TI  - New Empirical Models for Estimation of Diffuse Radiation using Satellite Data
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Diffuse radiation is used in photovoltaic systems and other energy applications. Since global radiation is measured by local meteorological stations, it is possible to reach this radiation data. However, diffuse radiation is not usually measured, so it is not possible to obtain regular data on diffuse radiation. For this reason, efforts are underway to develop various empirical models to estimate diffuse radiation. This work aims to develop new empirical models to estimate the diffuse radiation values for Konya, Turkiye. The empirical models are used to determine the relationship between the diffuse fraction and the clearness index. Data from NASA-surface meteorology and solar energy and the measured global solar is used. The three most suitable developed models are selected, and it is suggested to estimate the diffuse radiation. The developed models consist of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-order polynomial regression models. The proposed models are tested to evaluate their performances by using eight statistical methods. These are Mean Bias Error (MBE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Sum Squared Relative Error (SSRE), Relative Standard Error (RSE), Coefficient of determination (R2), and Correlation Coefficient (r). For the suggested models, the statistical parameter R2 values are calculated as 0.999705413, 1, and 1, and the RSE values are determined as 0.0084537, 0.000122, and 6.05E-06. The proposed models can contribute to the researchers working on the applications of photovoltaic systems. The approaches could be used to estimate diffuse radiation elsewhere under similar climatic conditions.

TI  - Urban land use and land cover mapping: proposal of a classification system with remote sensing
T2  - AGUA Y TERRITORIO
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian urbanization process produced a complex urban space, with a variety of urban land use and cover as a result. The study of these forms through a classification system is essential, but most current systems don't capture this complexity, condensing it. Urban forms are difficult to distinguish and classify, resulting in the need for a system with a high degree of detail, for a more accurate urban planning. The objective of this work is to propose a classification system for urban land use and cover, which can demonstrate the multiplicities through remote sensing, using data from CBERS 04A satellite. The methodology surveys the visual elements of remote sensing images, through visual interpretation, relating them to each proposed use and cover class. With this, a classification system was developed that covers the urban space in 17 classes, being an effective way to raise information about the different urban forms.

TI  - The Sub-Antarctic Beagle Channel marine ecosystem: A regional and comprehensive sentinel of global change
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This special issue merges results obtained during a scientific expedition along the eastern Beagle Channel (BC) with previously available relevant data from the area. The expedition was conducted from 9 to 19 November 2019 on board the BIPO "Victor Angelescu", a research vessel belonging to the National Institute for Fisheries Research and Development (INIDEP-Argentina). The cruise was the result of collaborative bi-national (Chile -Argentina) diplomatic (Argentinian and Chilean Ministries of Foreign Affairs) and scientific efforts, led by the Austral Center for Scientific Research (CADIC-Argentina) and the Research Center: Dynamics of High Latitude Marine Ecosystems (IDEAL-Chile). In addition, this special issue is enriched with historical data from several research initiatives developed by both countries in the BC area and from other international collaborations, thereby providing a wider and comprehensive vision of the biological, chemical, and physical characteristics of the BC. From a historical point of view, both countries, which share the third longest international border of5,300 km, almost engaged in war in 1979 due to a border conflict in the southeastern BC. This war was averted and subsequently there have been decades of tight and close collaborations and friendly diplomatic, scientific, and social relationships. This special issue reflects these efforts.

TI  - Assessing spatial variations in soil organic carbon and C:N ratio in Northeast China's black soil region: Insights from Landsat-9 satellite and crop growth information
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring soil properties, especially soil organic carbon (SOC) and Carbon-to-Nitrogen (C:N) ratios, is vital for understanding degradation and developing black soil conservation strategies. Most soil mapping research has leveraged satellite imagery from limited bare-soil periods. The predictive accuracy using time-series images capturing crop growth is underexplored. Moreover, while the new Landsat-9 satellite surpasses Landsat-8, its use in soil mapping is mostly uncharted. In this study, we compared the performance of single-date bare soil imagery (Landsat-8, Landsat-9, and Sentinel-2) and multi-temporal images (Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 combined, and Sentinel-2) using three machine learning techniques (Boosted Regression Tree, BRT; Random Forest, RF; Extreme Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) for mapping SOC and C:N ratio in a typical Northeast China black soil cropland region. The results revealed that single-date Landsat-9 exhibited great potential for soil mapping with the optimal XGBoost model, improving the prediction accuracy (in terms of R2) of SOC and C:N ratio by 15.01% and 30.07%, respectively, compared to Landsat-8, while also delivering performance slightly inferior to single-date Sentinel-2. Moreover, predictors derived from multi-temporal images significantly outperformed those derived from single-date images. The XGBoost models that utilized multi-temporal Sentinel-2 predictors achieved the highest prediction accuracy for both SOC (R2 = 0.676, RMSE = 1.928 g/kg, MAE = 1.580 g/kg, RPD = 1.535) and C:N ratio (R2 = 0.713, RMSE = 0.585, MAE = 0.484, RPD = 1.718). Interestingly, the combination of Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 demonstrated similar prediction accuracy but lower uncertainties in SOC and C:N ratio mapping compared to multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images. In addition, a comparison of the contemporary prediction soil maps with historical soil data revealed a continual decrease in SOC content and C:N ratio, suggesting a concerning trajectory that is detrimental to organic matter accumulation. Overall, this study highlights the efficacy of Landsat-9 and multi-temporal imagery incorporating crop growth information in accurately predicting soil properties and assessing their spatial variability.

TI  - Satellite data geoprocessing to estimate PM<sub>2.5</sub> over the Megalopolis of Central Mexico
T2  - ATMOSFERA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Megalopolis of Central Mexico experiences high levels above the Official Mexican Standard (NOM) of PM2.5, leading to various respiratory diseases ranging from acute symptoms to chronic illnesses such as asthma and lung cancer. It is crucial to measure PM2.5 levels accurately to warn the public about the risks of exposure to particulate matter. Unfortunately, the Megalopolis of Central Mexico has a shortage of monitoring sites, limiting data availability. This study addresses this issue using satellite data to develop a multiple linear regression model. Our model uses aerosol optical depth (AOD), relative humidity (RH), temperature (T), the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as independent variables to estimate PM2.5 concentrations in the region under study. The relationship between AOD and PM2.5 concentrations was found to be strongly influenced by RH and T. However, this effect is compensated for by a low PBLH (< 400 m), which enables AOD and PM2.5 measurements to be similar in magnitude. Our findings have important implications for estimating PM2.5 concentrations using satellite data. This study could help improve air quality monitoring in the Megalopolis of Central Mexico by providing more spatial and temporal data on particle concentrations in the atmosphere.

TI  - Application of spectral indexes in the evaluation of sediment input to the reservoirs of the Itumbiara and Batalha hydroelectric power plants (Brazil)
T2  - AGUA Y TERRITORIO
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, two spectral indexes were implemented using Landsat images, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) for the delimitation of the water mirror and the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) to evaluate the sediment contribution to the reservoirs of the hydroelectric power plants Itumbiara and Batalha, located on the borders of the states of Goias and Minas Gerais. The acquisition and processing were carried out in the Google Earth Engine platform and the post-processing in the QGIS software. The NDTI was applied to the reservoirs considering the variation in water level between the dry and rainy seasons in 2020. The highest concentration of turbidity in the Itumbiara reservoir occurred in September, and the lowest in June. August was the month with the highest turbidity concentration and July the lowest in the Batalha reservoir.

T2  - AGUA Y TERRITORIO
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of Remote Sensing data has proved to be fundamental in the assessment of the daily, monthly, seasonal and annual variability of phenomena that occur on the Earth's surface. In the present study, the objective is to investigate the landscape variation during the seasonality and the precipitation regime in the surroundings of the reservoir of the Itumbiara Hydroelectric Power Plant - GO. For that, Landsat 7 (ETM+) and Landsat 8 (OLI) satellite images were used to evaluate the variability of vegetation indices (Enhanced Vegetation Index - EVI - and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI), according to monthly, seasonal variation and annual rainfall in the period between 2010 and 2020. The data showed an unequivocal relationship between vegetation dynamics and the alternation and duration of rainy and dry periods in the study area, with greater sensitivity of the EVI response, in relation to the NDVI.

TI  - Reconsidering the Role of Frozen Section in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Mastectomy Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Axillary lymph node dissection was recommended for mastectomy patients with more than two nodal metastases from sentinel lymph node biopsy. Conventionally, intraoperative frozen section was sent routinely to reduce the need for second-stage axillary lymph node dissection; however, recent global trend has seen decreasing usage of the intraoperative analyses. This pilot study conducted in Thailand aimed to evaluate the role of intraoperative frozen section of sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy. Methods: A 5-y retrospective study of 1773 patients was conducted in Thailand. The inclusion criteria were early-stage breast cancer patients with either radiologically negative nodes, or radiographically borderline nodes found to be negative on fine needle aspiration who underwent mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Reoperations were indicated when three or more nodal metastases were detected on the pathological analysis. The reoperation rate prevented by frozen section and the reoperation rate needed for those with permanent section alone were reported. Results: Among 265 patients, 202 patients underwent concomitant intraoperative frozen section while the remaining 63 patients underwent permanent section alone. Six patients (3.0%) from the frozen section group and one patient (1.6%) from the permanent section group were found with more than two nodal metastases. Despite using intraoperative frozen sections, only one patient from each group required reoperation. There was no significant difference in the number of patients requiring reoperation between the frozen section group and the permanent section group. Conclusions: Our study provides strong evidence to all surgeons that in early breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy with permanent section analysis alone may not lower the standard of care compared to using additional intraoperative frozen section analysis. Adopting this practice may lead to decreased operation costs, operative time, and anesthetic side effects. 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A study on wildfire impacts on greenhouse gas emissions and regional air quality in South of Orleans, France.
T2  - Journal of environmental sciences (China)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Wildfire events are increasing globally which may be partly associated with climate change, resulting in significant adverse impacts on local, regional air quality and global climate. In September 2020, a small wildfire (burned area: 36.3ha) event occurred in Souesmes (Loir-et-Cher, Sologne, France), and its plume spread out over 200km on the following day as observed by the MODIS satellite. Based on measurements at a suburban site ( 50km northwest of the fire location) in Orleans and backward trajectory analysis, young wildfire plumes were characterized. Significant increases in gaseous pollutants (CO, CH4, N2O, VOCs, etc.) and particles (including black carbon) were found within the wildfire plumes, leading to a reduced air quality. Emission factors, defined as EF (X)=∆X/∆CO (where, X represents the target species), of various trace gases and black carbon within the young wildfire plumes were determined accordingly and compared with previous studies. Changes in the ambient ions (such as ammonium, sulfate, nitrate, chloride, and nitrite in the particle- and gas- phase) and aerosol properties (e.g., aerosol water content, aerosol pH) were also quantified and discussed. Moreover, we estimated the total carbon and climate-related species (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O, and BC) emissions and compared them with fire emission inventories. Current biomass burning emission inventories have uncertainties in estimating small fire burned areas and emissions. For instance, we found that the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) may underestimate emissions (e.g., CO) of this small wildfire while other inventories (GFED and FINN) showed significant overestimation. Considering that it is the first time to record wildfire plumes in this region, related atmospheric implications are presented and discussed.

TI  - Matrix-producing carcinoma of the breast showing retained rim enhancement to the late phase on magnetic resonance imaging.
T2  - Radiology case reports
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - A 54-year-old woman with a left breast mass was referred to our hospital. Mammography showed a mass, 2.1cm in size, with micro-lobulated boarders. Ultrasonography showed an oval mass with predominant low internal echoes and enhanced posterior echoes. Core needle biopsy of the tumor showed malignant cells and chondroid matrices. With MRI, the tumor was hypo-intense on T1-weighted images, mixed hyper- and hypo-intense on T2-weighted images, and completely rim enhanced until late phase on time-signal intensity curve. Despite the good indication for breast conserving therapy, patient's preference made her undergo total mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and immediate breast reconstruction using an extended latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap. Postoperative pathologic study showed large acellular areas, atypical cells growing in cord-like and linear fashions with cartilage-like matrices, and no spindle cells / osteoclasts between the cancer cells and chondroid matrices, leading to the pathologic diagnosis of matrix-producing carcinoma. The patient received dose-dense chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy and has been well without any recurrences for 14 months. Physicians should note that partial hypo-intensity on T2-weighted images and retained rim enhancement to the late phase should be important findings of breast matrix-producing carcinoma.

TI  - Multilayer perceptron and Markov Chain analysis based hybrid-approach for predicting land use land cover change dynamics with Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - As urbanization accelerates, the degree of human impact on land use is increasing. land use land cover change (LULC) is acknowledged as crucial factor in environmental change. The best way to understand historical land use patterns, changes, drivers, and developments is through a rigorous assessment of LULC changes. In this study, we aim to identify LULC changes from 2015 to 2022, and predict changes for 2030. Sentinel-2 images were employed to analyze LULC change patterns and predict future trends. The Random Forest algorithm was used to classify the various LULC classes with high accuracy and reliability. Multilayer Perceptron and Markov Chain Analysis (MLP-MCA) based Hybrid-Approach was employed to predict the future dynamics of LULC change for 2030. The study revealed that built-up area expanded 90.64 km2 from 2015 to 2022 due to natural resource substitution. Predictions indicate that 58.84% of the study area will be transform into built-up by 2030.

TI  - Crop water use dynamics over arid and semi-arid croplands in the lower Colorado River Basin
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have evaluated the application of Remote Sensing (RS) techniques for mapping actual evapotranspiration (ETa) using Vegetation-Index-based (VI-based) and surface energy balance methods (SEB). SEB models computationally require a large effort for application. VI-based methods are fast and easy to apply and could therefore potentially be applied at high resolution; however, the accuracy of VI-based methods in comparison to SEB-based models remains unclear. We tested the ETa computed with the modified 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (METEVI2) implemented in the Google Earth Engine - for mapping croplands' water use dynamics in the Lower Colorado River Basin. We compared METEVI2 with the well-established RS-based products of OpenET (Ensemble, eeMETRIC, SSEBop, SIMS, PT_JPL, DisALEXI and geeSEBAL). METEVI2 was then evaluated with measured ETa from four wheat fields (2017-2018). Results indicated that the monthly ETa variations for METEVI2 and OpenET models were comparable, though of varying magnitudes. On average, METEVI2 had the lowest difference rate from the average observed ETa with 17 mm underestimation, while SIMS had the highest difference rate (82 mm). Findings show that METEVI2 is a cost-effective ETa mapping tool in drylands to track crop water use. Future studies should test METEVI2's applicability to croplands in more humid regions.

TI  - Strategies in training deep learning models to extract building from multisource images with small training sample sizes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Building extraction from remote sensing data is an important topic in urban studies and the deep learning methods have an increasing role due to their minimal requirements in training data to reach outstanding performance. We aimed to investigate the original U-Net architecture's efficiency in building segmentation with different number of training images and the role of data augmentation based on multisource remote sensing data with varying spatial and spectral resolutions (WorldView-2 [WV2], WorldView-3 [WV3] images and an aerial orthophoto [ORTHO]). When the trainings and predictions were conducted on the same image, U-Net provided good results with very few training images (validation accuracies: 94-97%; 192 images). Combining the ORTHO's and WV2's training data for prediction on WV3 provided poor results with low F1-score (0.184). However, the inclusion of only 48 WV3 training images significantly improved the F1-score (0.693), thus, most buildings were correctly identified. Accordingly, using only independent reference data (other than the target image) is not enough to train an accurate model. In our case, the reference from WW2 and ORTHO images did not provide an acceptable basis to train a good model, but a minimal number of training images from the targeted WV3 improved the accuracy (F1-score: 69%).

TI  - Use of time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to monitor fall armyworm (<i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i>) damage on maize production systems in Africa
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Fall armyworm (FAW) Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), damage was monitored at a regional scale using time series data in Western and Southern African countries. The study employed the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed from Landsat 8 imagery using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using image composites for the years 2013 to 2020 for the study areas. The index was then reclassified based on the NDVI threshold values into low, sparse, moderate, and dense classes. FAW prevalence data were then utilized to validate the correlation between the FAW infestation and NDVI values. FAW was associated with a decrease in vegetation productivity between the years 2016, 2017, and 2018 when the pest infestation was reported in the study areas. The validation results showed that there is a correlation between FAW infestation and NDVI (R(2)0.83). Our study highlighted that NDVI can be used as a proxy to quantify pest damage to vegetation productivity.

TI  - Deep neural network for oil spill detection using Sentinel-1 data: application to Egyptian coastal regions
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Building an oil spill segmentation model is very challenging because of the limited available information on oil spill accidents. Therefore, this paper proposes a custom data generator based on Segmentation Network (Seg-Net) model implemented in Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN). The proposed model is trained for oil spill segmentation using 50 Sentinal-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The proposed model employs a modified Seg-Net as a generator to produce high-quality oil spills' images and a Patch-GAN as discriminator. This architecture results in a significant improvement of the final oil segmentation results, in comparison with Seg-Net model, while using relatively small training dataset. For performance assessment, the paper presents the oil spills segmentation results of four suggested models using Sentinel-1 SAR images. The presented models are U-Net, Seg-Net, CGAN, and a Seg-Net-based CGAN the performance assessment reveals that the proposed model produces oil spill segmentation images with an average accuracy of 99.04%, Intersection over Union (IoU) index of 96.59%, and a precision of 85.24%. In addition, the training time required for the proposed model is 3 h 20 min per 50 epochs, while it is nearly 10 h and 55 min for training a CGAN model.

TI  - Uni-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery for wildfire detection using deep learning semantic segmentation models
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are common disasters that have long-lasting climate effects and serious ecological, social, and economic effects due to climate change. Since Earth observation (EO) satellites were launched into space, remote sensing (RS) has become a more efficient technique that can be used in agriculture, environmental protection, geological exploration, and wildfires. The increasing number of EO satellites orbiting the earth provides huge amounts of data, such as Sentinel-2 with its Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) sensor. Using uni-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, we proposed a workflow based on deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation models to detect wildfires. In particular, we created a new big wildfire dataset suitable for semantic segmentation models. We tested our dataset using DL models such as U-Net, LinkNet, DeepLabV3+, U-Net++, and Attention ResU-Net. The results are analysed and compared in terms of the F1 score, the intersection over union (IoU) score, the precision and recall metrics, and the amount of training time each model possesses. The best results were achieved using U-Net with the ResNet50 encoder, with F1-score of 98.78% and IoU of 97.38%, and we developed it into a pre-trained DL Package (DLPK) model that is able to detect and monitor the wildfire from Sentinel-2 images automatically.

TI  - Glacier area changes in the Arctic and high latitudes using satellite remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers have been retreating over the last century as a result of climate change, particularly in the Arctic, causing sea levels to rise, affecting coastal communities and potentially changing global weather and climate patterns. In this study, we mapped 2203 glaciers in Novaya Zemlya (Russian Arctic), Penny Ice Cap (Baffin Island), Disko Island (Qeqertarsuaq, Greenland) and part of Kenai (Alaska), using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) applied to multispectral Landsat satellite imagery in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to quantify the glacier area changes over three decades. Between 1985-89 and 2019-21, the results show that the overall glacier area loss in Novaya Zemlya is 1319 & PLUSMN; 419 km(2) (5.7% of area), 452 & PLUSMN; 227 km(2) (6.6%) for Penny Ice Cap, 457 & PLUSMN; 168 km(2) (23.6%) in Disko Island and 196 & PLUSMN; 84 km(2) (25.7%) in Kenai. A total of seventy-three glaciers have disappeared completely, including sixty-nine on Disko Island, three in Novaya Zemlya and one in Kenai.

TI  - Comparison of a Sentinel-2 land cover map obtained through multi-temporal analysis with the official forest cartography. the case of Galicia (Spain)
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In numerous countries, official forest cartography is obtained through photointerpretation of aerial images which hinders having up-to-date information. This study explores the usefulness of a land cover map produced automatically using Sentinel-2 images as a complement of the official Spanish forest map in Galicia. It was obtained a map with an Overall Accuracy of 86%. Both maps were compared. Net area covered by each forest class differed among maps, the differences were higher in areas managed with shorter rotation cycles. Main differences were due to the capabilities of Sentinel-2 to identify harvestings or disturbances and to the minimum mapping units of each map. The Sentinel-2 map had a higher ability to map trees outside the forest, and the official cartography hides small parcels and incipient land change dynamics. Sentinel-2 based maps could be a powerful tool to reduce the information gap considering the official cartography updating frames.

TI  - Sunflower crop yield prediction by advanced statistical modeling using satellite-derived vegetation indices and crop phenology
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely crop yield information is needed for agricultural land management and food security. We investigated using remote sensing data from the Earth observation mission Sentinel-2 to monitor the crop phenology and predict the crop yield of sunflowers at the field scale. Ten sunflower fields in Mezohegyes, southeastern Hungary, were monitored in 2021, and the crop yield was measured by a combine harvester. Images from Sentinel-2 were collected throughout the monitoring period, and vegetation indices (VIs) were extracted to monitor the crop growth. Multiple linear regression and two different machine learning approaches were applied to predicting the crop yield, and the best-performing one was selected for further analysis. The results were as follows. The VIs showed the highest correlation with the crop yield (R > 0.6) during the inflorescence emergence stage. The most suitable time for predicting the crop yield was 86-116 days after sowing. Random forest regression (RFR) was the best machine learning approach for predicting field-scale variability of the crop yield (R-2 similar to 0.6 and RMSE 0.284-0.473 t/ha). Our results can be used to develop a timely and robust prediction method for sunflower crop yields at the field scale to support decision-making by policymakers regarding food security.

TI  - Estimation and mapping of pasture biomass in Mongolia using machine learning methods
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mongolian pasture plays an essential role in the national economy. Reliable pasture biomass estimation is indispensable to support the agricultural sector and also sustainable livelihood in the country. The aim of this study is to determine an appropriate method to estimate and map pasture biomass in a forest-steppe area of Mongolia. For this purpose, machine learning methods such as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and partial least squares regression (PLSR) were compared. As data sources, spectral indices derived from Sentinel-2B image of 2019 and field-measured biomass sample datasets were used. To determine the optimal spectral predictor variables, initially, 20 spectral indices were evaluated using the PLSR. Of these, five indices (i.e. ATSAVI2, EVI, GRVI, IPVI and MSR) with the highest correlation coefficients (r = 0.94) were considered for further analysis. These indices were also examined and validated by a variable importance analysis. Then, the RF, SVM, and PLSR models were applied to predict and map pasture biomass using the selected five indices. The PLSR method demonstrated the highest accuracy with coefficient of determination (R-2) =0.899 and root mean square error (RMSE)=10.560 g/m(2). The SVM technique showed the second highest accuracy with R-2=0.837 and RMSE = 12.881 g/m(2). The RF model gave the lowest accuracy with R-2=0.823 and RMSE = 13.430g/m(2). Our research showed that different machine learning models might be applied (because in all cases R(2>)0.82) for a pasture biomass estimation and mapping in the selected test site, but the best result could be achieved by the use of the PLSR.

TI  - Implications of changes in land use on soil and biomass carbon sequestration: a case study from the Owabi reservoir catchment in Ghana
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use changes affect soil and biomass carbon sequestration potential of the agroecosystems of most Sub-Sahara Africa facing rising temperatures due to global climate change. One such ecosystem is the Owabi reservoir catchment in Ghana, which has undergone extensive changes in land use through urbanization. Our study aimed to determine the impact of the spatial and temporal variability of the different land uses on soil and biomass carbon storage in the Owabi catchment. Land use/cover maps were elaborated using SPOT satellite images of 30 x 30-m resolution and Erdas Imagine and ArcGIS Pro softwares. Soil and vegetation were sampled along three transects in the Y plane in early 2014. Nested plot design and temporary sample plots of 50 x 50 m were demarcated within a 1 ha plot in each of the land uses. Trees, herbs and litter were sampled to assess aboveground carbon, and soil samples were taken at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depth. Belowground (root) biomass was calculated using the root:shoot ratio. Seven (7) land use types - dense forest, sparse forest, grassland, cropland, wetland, settlement, and excavated land - were identified and differences in carbon stocks were assessed. Soil carbon stock (0-30 cm) ranged from 51.80 Mg/ha in dense forest to 7.00 Mg/ha in excavated land. Our study showed that the conversion of forest lands to other land uses through excavation resulted in about 30-folds loss in carbon and also a major loss of carbon in the catchment from c. 1.4 x 10(6) Mg C in 1990 to 0.55 x 10(6) Mg C in 2014. Enhancing forests or growing trees to sequester carbon seems to be the optimum choice among the seven land uses if the introduction of payment for environmental services options is considered.

TI  - Ground infrastructure monitoring in coastal areas using time-series inSAR technology: the case study of Pudong International Airport, Shanghai
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PDIA), with its east side built along the coast with weak geological conditions, is prone to uneven foundation settlement due to the consolidation and compression of soil and erosion of coastal tides, affecting the safe operation of the airport. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct dynamic subsidence monitoring within the airport, especially in the runway area. 29 scenes of ascending track Sentinel-1A radar images from August 2016 to June 2018 are selected to perform surface deformation inversion based on PS-InSAR and improved SBAS-InSAR for PDIA and its around coastal area. Through cross-validation, the reliability of the time-series InSAR technique for dynamic monitoring of surface deformation of coastal zone infrastructures is confirmed. The results show severely uneven settlement. By combining the monitoring results with the local geological and hydrological dataset, the driving factors of differential deformation of the infrastructures are analyzed, including stratigraphic geological conditions, ground loadings, foundation treatment methods, water erosion, and groundwater level changes. Finally, the time-series deformation characteristics and the causes of PDIA's runway are emphasized based on the PS deformation results. This case provides a reference for the safety management of critical infrastructure in coastal areas using advanced InSAR technique.

AB  - The study's objective is to check whether the predictive power of Machine Learning Techniques is better than Logistic Regression in predicting the bankruptcy of firms and that the same predictive power of ascertaining bankruptcy improves when a proxy for uncertainty is added to the model as a default driver. We considered the covid pandemic a black swan event that had caused ambiguity. A significant factor that has increased the probability of bankruptcy in recent times has been the large-scale supply chain disruptions and crippling lockdowns. Firms are trying to get back to pre-Covid utilization of plant capacity or pivot their business models differently to seize newer opportunities amidst the crisis. We considered the change in operating expenditure (primarily decrease) as our proxy for uncertainty as firms were forced to cut down majorly on their operations and thus incurred lesser variable costs. In an economy showing inflationary trends, the operating expenses will generally increase. But we found that the operational costs had shown a dip in the case of many of the firms during FY 20-21, and we attributed it to Covid disruptions. Results show that Machine Learning Techniques are better than Logistic Regression in predicting the bankruptcy of firms and that the same predictive power of ascertaining bankruptcy improves when a proxy for uncertainty is added to the model.

TI  - Modelling of land use and land cover changes and prediction using CA-Markov and Random Forest
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We used the Cellular Automata Markov (CA-Markov) integrated technique to study land use and land cover (LULC) changes in the Cholistan and Thal deserts in Punjab, Pakistan. We plotted the distribution of the LULC throughout the desert terrain for the years 1990, 2006 and 2022. The Random Forest methodology was utilized to classify the data obtained from Landsat 5 (TM), Landsat 7 (ETM+) and Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS), as well as ancillary data. The LULC maps generated using this method have an overall accuracy of more than 87%. CA-Markov was utilized to forecast changes in land usage in 2022, and changes were projected for 2038 by extending the patterns seen in 2022. A CA-Markov-Chain was developed for simulating long-term landscape changes at 16-year time steps from 2022 to 2038. Analysis of urban sprawl was carried out by using the Random Forest (RF). Through the CA-Markov Chain analysis, we can expect that high density and low-density residential areas will grow from 8.12 to 12.26 km(2) and from 18.10 to 28.45 km(2) in 2022 and 2038, as inferred from the changes occurred from 1990 to 2022. The LULC projected for 2038 showed that there would be increased urbanization of the terrain, with probable development in the croplands westward and northward, as well as growth in residential centers. The findings can potentially assist management operations geared towards the conservation of wildlife and the eco-system in the region. This study can also be a reference for other studies that try to project changes in arid are as undergoing land-use changes comparable to those in this study.

TI  - NDVI assessment versus two impact factors analysis (separate analysis based on chlorophyll content and leaf cellular structure): which method is more effective to detect declining health of an individual tree?
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In detecting the internal health of an individual tree, "two impact factors analysis" refers to evaluation of NIR and RED separately, instead of merging them together in one formula as in NDVI assessment. We use high resolution WorldView-2/-3 satellite data for our study. From our global case studies of stressed trees, we have found the following results: (1) NDVI works when the spectral reflectance in both NIR and RED bands deteriorates together/concurrently. (2) NDVI does not work when the spectral reflectance in NIR and RED bands varies. This will happen, as shown by our case studies of Tree 1 and Tree 2 of the removed stressed trees, and Tree 4 and Tree 5 of the collapsed stressed trees.

TI  - Sensitivity of surface soil moisture retrieval to satellite-derived vegetation descriptors over wheat fields in the Kairouan plain
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture estimation is a key component in hydrological processes and irrigation amounts' estimation. The synergetic use of optical and radar data has been proven to retrieve the surface soil moisture at a field scale using the Water Cloud Model (WCM). In this work, we evaluate the impact of staellite-derived vegetation descriptors to estimate the surface soil moisture. Therefore, we used the Sentinel-1 data to test the polarization ratio ( sigma V H 0 / sigma V V 0 ) and the normalized polarization ratio (IN) and the frequently used optical Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) as vegetation descriptors. Synchronous with Sentinel-1 acquisitions, in situ soil moisture were collected over wheat fields in the Kairouan plain in the center of Tunisia. To avoid the bare soil roughness effect and the radar signal saturation in dense vegetation context, we considered the data where the NDVI values vary between 0.25 and 0.7. The soil moisture inversion using the WCM and NDVI as a vegetation descriptor was characterized by an RMSE value of 5.6 vol.%. A relatively close performance was obtained using IN and ( sigma V H 0 / sigma V V 0 ) with RMSE under 7. 5 vol.%. The results revealed the consistency of the radar-derived data in describing the vegetation for the retrieval of soil moisture.

TI  - Estimation of emissions from crop residue burning in Turkiye using remotely sensed data and the Google Earth Engine platform
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to find crop-based residue burning (CRB) amounts for the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkiye, where versatile and diverse of agricultural fields are available. We used the time series of Sentinel-2 images to identify spatial distribution of different crop types and to determine the burned agricultural fields in 2019 using Google Earth Engine platform. We implemented Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change standards to calculate the emissions from Greenhouse gases and Particulate Matter. We also analyzed Sentinel-5P images to generate Nitrogen Dioxide maps and compared them with crop-based emission calculations. Our analysis illustrated that 14,444.307 Gg of Greenhouse Gases and 117.809 Gg of Particulate Matters were released in 2019 due to CRB practices. Our results can potentially improve the national statistics by providing spatio-temporal field-based CRB emissions and supporting country-level agricultural decision-making processes. Researchers could implement our proposed data and methodology in other regions suffering from the CRB problem.

TI  - Evaluating the impacts of watershed rehabilitation and irrigation interventions on vegetation greenness and soil erosion using remote sensing and biophysical modelling in Feresmay watershed in Ethiopia
T2  - ALL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion and subsequent land degradation undermine efforts to ensure food security and environmental sustainability in Ethiopia. The government of Ethiopia has implemented extensive soil and water conservation (SWC) programs in severely degraded and food-insecure areas of the country, in some cases integrated with subsequent or parallel irrigation development. However, the effectiveness of these interventions has not been extensively evaluated. This study, therefore, evaluates the performance and impacts of SWC practices in terms of improving vegetation greenness and reducing soil erosion in Feresmay watershed in Ethiopia. Long-term Landsat-based Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) were used for change-detection analysis before and after the implementation of various SWC interventions. The results revealed the positive impacts of SWC interventions in improving the vegetation greenness and soil erosion reduction although the outcome varied by intervention. Increased vegetation greenness was observed largely in areas where area closure with catchment treatment (ACCT) and impacts of irrigation (IRR) interventions are dominant, while relatively little impact was observed at the watershed level analysis. Although these interventions helped to reduce soil loss, the results highlighted the need for more SWC interventions to minimise further soil loss.

TI  - Long-term change and geospatial patterns of river ice cover and navigability in Southcentral Alaska detected with remote sensing
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - People who travel on ice-covered rivers to access traditional lands and resources can be profoundly impacted by effects of climate change on river ice seasonality. We used remote sensing, bolstered by citizen science, to assess trends and geospatial patterns of the ice cover in the Copper River Basin of Southcentral Alaska. Our analysis of Landsat imagery from water years (WYs) 1973 to 2021 suggests a severely diminishing season of river ice travel (delayed or incomplete freezeup, early breakup) due to increasing air temperatures. The weekly probability of an adequate ice cover for river crossings declined by an average of 53 percentage points. Ice extent was closely related to accumulated freezing degree days (AFDD). AFDD(Oct-Apr) decreased by 15% since WY 1943, a significant warming trend. We mapped the spatiotemporal variation of ice and open water extent with multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery (Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1). We identified reaches with more reliable opportunities for winter access and others susceptible to extensive open water, differences related to flow energy and channel form. The results of this study can support local decision making and adaptation in response to rapidly changing river ice conditions, and our approach can be applied elsewhere to document change and improve travel safety.

TI  - Modelling some stand parameters using Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 satellite images by machine learning techniques: a case study in Turkiye
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technologies have been extensively used in forest management in predicting stand parameters. The goal of this study is to use Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images to estimate stand volume, basal area, number of trees, mean diameter, and top height. 180 temporary sample plots were taken in pure Crimean pine stands with varied structure. Reflectance, vegetation indices, and eight texture values were generated from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images. The stand parameters were modelled with the remotely sensed data using multiple linear regression, support vector machine, and deep learning techniques. The results showed that the support vector machine technique provided the highest level of model performance with 45 degrees orientation for number of trees (R-2 = 0.98, RMSE%=5.97) and 90 degrees orientation for basal area (R-2=0.91, RMSE%=15.22). The results indicated that the texture values presented better results than the reflectance and the vegetation indices in estimating the stand parameters.

TI  - An improved deep learning network for AOD retrieving from remote sensing imagery focusing on sub-pixel cloud
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the success of MODIS, several widely used algorithms have been developed for different satellite sensors to provide global aerosol optical depth (AOD) products. Despite the progress made in improving the accuracy of satellite-derived AOD products, the presence of sub-pixel clouds and the corresponding cloud shadows still significantly degrade AOD products. This is due to the difficulty in identifying sub-pixel clouds, as they are hardly identified, which inevitably leads to the overestimation of AOD. To overcome these conundrums, we proposed an improved deep learning network for retrieving AOD from remote sensing imagery focusing on sub-pixel clouds especially and we call it the Sub-Pixel AOD network (SPAODnet). Two specific improvements considering sub-pixel clouds have been made; a spatial adaptive bilateral filter is applied to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance images for removing the noise induced by sub-pixel clouds and the corresponding shadows at the first place and channel attention mechanism is added into the convolutional neural network to further emphasize the relationship between the uncontaminated pixels and the ground measured AOD from AERONET sites. In addition, a compositive loss function, Huber loss, is used to further improve the accuracy of retrieved AOD. The SPAODnet model is trained by using ten AERONET sites within Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region in China, along with their corresponding MODIS images from 2011 to 2020; Subsequently, the trained network is applied over the whole BTH region and the AOD images over the BTH region from 2011 similar to 2020 are retrieved. Based on a comprehensive validation with ground measurements, the MODIS products, and the AOD retrieved from the other neural network, the proposed network does significantly improve the overall accuracy, the spatial resolution, and the spatial coverage of the AOD, especially for cases with sub-pixel clouds and cloud shadows.

TI  - Nonhuman Self-cultivators in Early Medieval China: Re-reading a Story Type
T2  - EARLY MEDIEVAL CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Historians of literature are well acquainted with early medieval stories of shapeshifting animals and other beings seducing unsuspecting men and women. This paper re-reads such narratives from the shapeshifters' point of view. This requires escaping the customary disciplinary boundaries and viewing these creatures' depictions against the backdrop of concurrently circulating "arts of the bedchamber" (fangzhong zhi shu ?(sic)(sic)?), one of several classes of techniques for "nurturing life" (yangsheng ?(sic)). I argue that the shapeshifters' actions make sense when understood within the framework of this mode of self-cultivation. This in turn implies a view of nonhumans as selves striving to realize aims-among them health, longevity, the acquisition of enhanced capabilities, and, ultimately, metamorphosis into higher species on the ladder of beings. The tales emerged, then, in a culture to some extent shaped by a worldview of the sort often termed "animistic," one that saw nonhuman beings as co-participants with humans in self-transformational projects grounded in a common cosmology.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation net ecosystem productivity and its response to drought in Northwest China
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) quantifies magnitude of the terrestrial vegetation carbon sinks. Drought is one of the most important stressors affecting vegetation NEP. At present, the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation NEP in drought-prone of Northwest China (NWC) lack discussion under different climatic zones and land cover types, and the response of vegetation NEP to drought remains unclear. Hence, we estimated the vegetation NEP in NWC using ground and remote sensing data and quantified the spatiotemporal differentiation of NEP under different climatic zones and land cover types. The drought fluorescence monitoring index (DFMI) was developed to examine the relationship between vegetation NEP and drought response based on the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data. Our results suggested that vegetation carbon sinks increased significantly at 7.09 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in NWC during 2000-2019, mainly in northern Shaanxi, eastern and southern Gansu, and southern Ningxia. NEP showed increasing trends under different climatic zones and land cover types, but there were differences in carbon sink capacity. The strongest carbon sink capacity was in humid regions and forests, while the weakest was in arid regions and grasslands. The vegetation carbon sinks showed a non-linear relationship with the drought degree reflecting multiple trend differences, especially in forests and grasslands. The response to drought was faster and more significant in semi-arid and semi-humid transition zones and extreme humid regions when vegetation carbon sinks decreased. DFMI was a good indicator to monitor drought conditions in NWC. NEP and DFMI were an 8-20-month periodic positive correlation and showed a high correlation with high-high and low-low clustering spatially. Drought significantly weakened vegetation carbon sinks in NWC. This study emphasizes the demand to rapidly identify climatic conditions that lead to decrease significantly in vegetation carbon sinks and to formulate adaptation strategies aimed at reducing drought risk under global warming.

TI  - Automated urban tree survey using remote sensing data, Google street view images, and plant species recognition apps
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban tree inventories have mostly focused on the information of individual trees becausethese allows city authorities to efficiently plan urban forestation . However, single-tree urban tree inventories are expensive for municipalities, so the inventories lack detail and are often out of date. In this work, we aim to integrate the possibility of using online applications for automatic species identification with worldwide coverage Pl@ntNet and Plant.Id on Google Street View (GSV) images in order to perform cost-effective urban tree inventories at the single-tree level and evaluate the performance of the two applications through comparison with a locally trained neural network using an appropriate set of metrics. Our work showed that the Plant.Id application gave the best performance by correctly identifying plants in the city of Prato with a median accuracy of 0.73 and better performance for the most common plants: Pinus pinea 0.87, Tilia aeuropea 0.87, Platanus hybrida 0.89. The proposed method also has a limitation. Trees within parks, walking paths and private green areas cannot be photographed and identified because Google cars cannot access them. The solution to this limitation is to combine GSV images with spherical photos taken via light unmanned aircraft.

TI  - Spatio-temporal characteristics of human activities using location big data in Qilian Mountain National Park
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities significantly impact the environment. Understanding the patterns and distribution of these activities is crucial for ecological protection. With location-based technology advancement, big data such as location and trajectory data can be used to analyze human activities on finer temporal and spatial scales than traditional remote sensing data. In this study, Qilian Mountain National Park (QMNP) was chosen as the research area, and Tencent location data were used to construct time series data. Time series clustering and decomposition were performed, and the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of human activities in the study area were analyzed in conjunction with GPS trajectory data and land use data. The study found two distinct human activity patterns, Pattern A and Pattern B, in QMNP. Compared to Pattern B, Pattern A had a higher volume of location data and clear nighttime peaks. By incorporating land use and trajectory data, we conclude that Pattern A and Pattern B represent the activity patterns of the resident and tourist populations, respectively. Moreover, the study identified seasonal variations in human activities, with human activity in summer being approximately two hours longer than in winter. We also conducted an analysis of human activities in different counties within the study area.

TI  - Multiscale mapping of local climate zones in Tokyo using airborne LiDAR data, GIS vectors, and Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisource remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) data have contributed powerfully to the large-scale automated mapping of local climate zones (LCZs). However, the accessibility of high-resolution height data, the applicability of standard thresholds to local contexts, and the dependence of mapping scales have limited LCZ classification studies. In this study, we combined airborne LiDAR data, Sentinel-2 imagery, and GIS vector (buildings and roads) data to develop a multiscale automated LCZ classification scheme in the 23 special wards of Tokyo. Based on the optimized thresholds of seven LCZ properties, GIS-based LCZ mapping was implemented using fuzzy logic classifiers at the block scale and at different grid-cell scales (100 m-1000 m). In addition to assessing accuracy using reference samples, multidate thermal infrared data (Landsat-8 and ASTER data) were used to understand the LCZ-LST (land surface temperature) relationship at multiple scales. The results showed that the overall accuracies of LCZs could be significantly increased by threshold optimization at all scales. Significant differences in LCZs and LSTs among different mapping units were observed. The highest overall accuracy was greater than 80% at the 100-m grid-cell scale. As the size of grid cells increased, the overall accuracy of LCZ classification decreased. For each LCZ, the mean daytime/nighttime LST exhibited more variation by date than by scale. This study provides a promising picture of GIS-based LCZ mapping and LCZ-LST relationships at multiple scales.

TI  - A landslide extraction method of channel attention mechanism U-Net network based on Sentinel-2A remote sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate landslide extraction is significant for landslide disaster prevention and control. Remote sensing images have been widely used in landslide investigation, and landslide extraction methods based on deep learning combined with remote sensing images (such as U-Net) have received a lot of attention. However, because of the variable shape and texture features of landslides in remote sensing images, the rich spectral features, and the complexity of their surrounding features, landslide extraction using U-Net can lead to problems such as false detection and missed detection. Therefore, this study introduces the channel attention mechanism called the squeeze-and-excitation network (SENet) in the feature fusion part of U-Net; the study also constructs an attention U-Net landside extraction model combining SENet and U-Net, and uses Sentinel-2A remote sensing images for model training and validation. The extraction results are evaluated through different evaluation metrics and compared with those of two models: U-Net and U-Net Backbone (U-Net Without Skip Connection). The results show that proposed the model can effectively extract landslides based on Sentinel-2A remote sensing images with an F1 value of 87.94%, which is about 2% and 3% higher than U-Net and U-Net Backbone, respectively, with less false detection and more accurate extraction results.

T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES REGIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - China's population and development land have changed dramatically over the last decade. Yet, our understanding of the spatial distribution patterns of the population and built-up areas remains limited. To fill this gap, we employ China's Population Census and GlobeLand30 remote sensing data from 2010 to 2020 at the county level to geovisualize the evolution of the population and built-up area. We find an increasing correlation between built-up areas and population as a result of the urbanization of rural areas, but the rapid expansion of built-up areas has not fundamentally changed concentration of China's population over the period 2010-20.

TI  - Street network patterns for mitigating urban heat islands in arid climates
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the impact of street pattern measurements on urban heat islands (UHI) in the arid climate of Mashhad, Iran. The Landsat-8 top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) brightness images from 2013 to 2021, average values of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) were calculated. Street pattern measurements, including closeness-centrality, straightness, and street orientation, were employed to analyse the patterns in each district. The results indicated that districts with higher straightness and lower closeness-centrality exhibit cooler surface temperatures. Strong correlations were observed between LST and NDVI, straightness, and local closeness-centrality. The research highlighted the importance of considering street network measurements in long-term urban planning and design to mitigate the UHI effect in arid regions. A moderate grid street pattern with a reasonable distribution of green spaces throughout the region is suggested to reduce surface temperatures sustainably. Street pattern indexes, such as straightness and local closeness-centrality, are identified as significant factors in urban design to mitigate UHI. These findings have implications for urban planners, who can use this information to create street network patterns with lower UHI effects by reducing local closeness-centrality and increasing straightness.

TI  - Super-resolution GANs for upscaling unplanned urban settlements from remote sensing satellite imagery - the case of Chinese urban village detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The semantic segmentation of informal urban settlements represents an essential contribution towards renovation strategies and reconstruction plans. In this context, however, a big challenge remains unsolved when dealing with incomplete data acquisitions from multiple sensing devices, especially when study areas are depicted by images of different resolutions. In practice, traditional methodologies are directed to downgrade the higher-resolution data to the lowest-resolution measure, to define an overall homogeneous dataset, which is however ineffective in downstream segmentation activities of such crowded unplanned urban environments. To this purpose, we hereby tackle the problem in the opposite direction, namely upscaling the lower-resolution data to the highest-resolution measure, contributing to assess the use of cutting-edge super-resolution generative adversarial network (SR-GAN) architectures. The experimental novelty targets the particular case involving the automatic detection of 'urban villages', sign of the quick transformation of Chinese urban environments. By aligning image resolutions from two different data sources (Gaofen-2 and Sentinel-2 data), we evaluated the degree of improvement with regard to pixel-based landcover segmentation, achieving, on a 1 m resolution target, classification accuracies up to 83%, 67% and 56% for 4x, 8x, and 10x resolution upgrades respectively, disclosing the advantages of artificially-upscaled images for segmenting detailed characteristics of informal settlements.

TI  - Assessing the effectiveness of UAV data for accurate coastal dune habitat mapping
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal dunes are considered some of the most threatened and vulnerable habitats in the European Union. Mapping the spatial distribution of these habitats is an essential task for their conservation. Advances in Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) facilitate the flexible acquisition of high-resolution imagery for identifying detailed spatial distributions of habitats within dune systems. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of UAV remote sensing for mapping these habitat types. Specifically, we determined the impact of temporally acquired UAV-derived spectral and topographic information on classification accuracy. The work combined the multi-temporal UAV imagery with field observation data and used the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to classify dune habitats. Results showed that using multi-temporal UAV imagery increased classification accuracy compared to using uni-temporal UAV imagery (92.37% vs. 84.09%, respectively). Also, including topographic information consistently improved accuracy, regardless of the number of image sets used (the highest accuracy increased from 84.81% to 92.57% for a uni-temporal model). Temporal analyses showed that the data acquired in the middle period of the growing season were better than those acquired in the early or late periods. The methodology presented here demonstrates the potential of using UAV data for detailed mapping and monitoring of habitat types.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Transboundary forests in the Himalayas are one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, but exploring the patterns and influencing factors related to forest disturbance-recovery is still limited. In this study, we used a random forests model, a LandTrendr temporal segmentation algorithm and geographical detector to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of forest disturbance and recovery and their influencing factors in the central Himalayas from 1995 to 2018. The results showed that forest disturbance was dominant (& SIM;2.94 x 10(4) km(2)) and greater than recovery (& SIM;0.56 x 10(4) km(2)). Both disturbance and recovery showed a significant decreasing trend (p < 0.01); disturbance occurred mainly at low elevations and the Gandaki basin, while recovery was in eastern Nepal. Disturbance rates were highest in Nepal (1.14%) and recovery rates in China (0.29%). The main influencing factors on forest dynamics were elevation, temperature and population. The interaction of all factors was synergistically enhanced.

TI  - Land use land cover (LULC) degradation intensity analysis of Guinea savannah and mosaic Forest savannah zones in Ghana
T2  - ALL EARTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Ghana is increasingly affected by climate change, increased soil aridity, demographic problems, and unfavourable environmental factors. In the context of conservation, protection and sustainable management, this study assessed the loss, gain and stable areas of vegetation cover in Ghana by considering four districts namely West Gonja and West Mamprusi; Sene and Afram Plains in two major ecological zones respectively (Guinea-savannah and Forest-savannah mosaic) to make a comparative study of their level and intensity of degradation. For this purpose, remote sensing (IMPACT toolbox), GIS and quantitative analysis (PontiusMatrix42) approaches were used and applied on Landsat ETM+, OLI TIRS and Sentinel 2B images (2001, 2011, 2021). The result shows that land uses land covers (LULCs) are changing with a high level of dynamism in both ecological zones, with particular mention over the last decade (2011-2021) in terms of degradation in the Guinean savannah zone. Losses in both zones are more considerable than gains and stability. Each zone is marked more by changes in quantity than exchanges and shifts in LULCs, thus giving us information on the rate of loss of forest resources. It is therefore essential to put in place adequate measures to fight this irreversible loss if no action is taken.

TI  - Predicting spatio-temporal land use / land cover changes and their drivers forces based on a cellular automated Markov model in Ibb City, Yemen
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use / land cover (LULC) change profoundly impacts regional natural, economic, and ecological development; However, no study has been conducted to classify LULC changes in Ibb city using high-resolution satellite images. This study aims to evaluate and predict LULC changes and their driving forces in Ibb city, the tourist capital of Yemen. In this study, an integrated cellular automata and Markov chain (CA-Markov) model were implemented to analyze the spatio-temporal trends of Ibb city. Meanwhile, a socio-economic survey and key informant interviews were conducted to analyze the probable drivers of LULC change. Landsat (5, 7, and 8) data are used to analyze maps of LULC distributions for 1990, 2005, and 2020 at regular intervals. A CA-Markov model was employed to simulate long-term changes to the landscape at 15-year intervals from 2020 to 2050. Results indicate that the vegetation area decreased from 1760.4 km2 (33.2%) to 1371.7 km2 (27.8%). Meanwhile, barren land, grassland, and built-up areas increased from 3190.5 km2 (60.1%) to 3428.6 km2 (64.8%), from 336.0 km2 (6.3%) to 419.3 km2 (7.9%), and from 11.8 km2 (0.38%) to 76.2 km2 (1.42%), respectively. The CA-Markov model's accuracy was validated by comparing simulated and actual LULC maps for 2020 using the land change modeler (LCM) of IDRISI-TerrSet software. The predicted LULC maps for 2035 and 2050 indicate that the vegetation area, grassland, and barren land showed decreasing trends, while the built-up area and waterbody showed increasing trends. These results provide valuable insights for tracking future LULC changes and are pivotal in guiding sustainable land use practices, striking a balance between conserving natural resources and advancing urban development projects in the future. HIGHLIGHTS Driving factors on land-cover transitions tend to be spatiotemporal scale-dependent. The study analyzed changes in LULC trends and their Proximate and Underlying drivers. Significant changes were observed between 1990 and 2020, and changes are expected by 2035 and 2050. The integration of the CA-Markov Model and GIS techniques successfully simulated spatiotemporal LULC changes. Fine-tuned analysis of driving forces is essential for planning and managing sustainable land use.

TI  - Vegetation structural composition mapping of a complex landscape using forest cover density transformation and random decision forest classifier: a comparison
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover density (FCD) transformation and random decision forest (RDF) classification have been widely used for vegetation mapping. Nevertheless, a comparison of their capabilities in complex tropical landscapes is still rarely carried out. This study compared the two methods using Landsat-8 OLI imagery which includes the blue up to thermal bands for vegetation structural composition mapping in a complex landscape of Central Java, Indonesia. We used the FCD transformation with six indices to generate 11 classes, while the RDF classified the same 11 classes based on training areas and used a random process involving various number of splits and trees. The results showed that the FCD transformation achieved 69.32% accuracy, while the RDF was able to classify the 11 classes with various accuracies depending on the parameter setting, i.e. from 70.76% to 75.19%. Regarding the obtained accuracies, problems associated with the terrain and vegetation characteristics have been discussed for further recommendation.

TI  - Genome-wide methylation profile of mitochondrial DNA across bovine preimplantation development
T2  - EPIGENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study characterized variations in the methylation profile of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) during initial bovine embryo development and correlated the presence of methylation with mtDNA transcription. Bovine oocytes were obtained from abattoir ovaries and submitted to in vitro culture procedures. Oocytes and embryos were collected at various stages (immature oocyte, IM; mature oocyte, MII; zygote, ZY; 4-cells, 4C; 16-cells, 16C and blastocysts, BL). Total DNA (including mtDNA) was used for Whole Genome Enzymatic Methyl Sequencing and for quantification of mtDNA copy number. Extracted RNA was used for quantification of mitochondrial transcripts using Droplet Digital PCR. We selected ND6, CYTB, tRNA-Phe and tRNA-Gln based on their location in the mitochondrial genome, functionality and/or previous literature associating these regions with cytosine methylation. The number of mtDNA copies per oocyte/embryo was found to be similar, while methylation levels in mtDNA varied among stages. Higher total methylation levels were found mainly at 4C and 16C. In specific gene regions, higher methylation levels were also observed at 4C and 16C (ND6, CYTB and tRNA-Phe), as well as an inverse correlation with the quantity of transcripts for these regions. This is a first description of epigenetic changes occurring in mtDNA during early embryonic development. Our results indicate that methylation might regulate the mtDNA transcription at a local level, particularly around the time of embryonic genome activation.

TI  - Assessing tree crown fire damage integrating linear spectral mixture analysis and supervised machine learning on Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Crown fire damage is a mixture of three principal fire-related components: charred material, scorched foliage, and unaltered green canopy. This study estimated the abundance of these physical alterations in two immediate post-fire Mediterranean forest contexts (Portugal and Italy) by applying linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) on Sentinel-2 imagery. The tree crowns fire damage was subsequently mapped, integrating fractional abundance information in a random forest (RF) algorithm, comparing the accuracy resulting from the adoption of generic or image spectral libraries as the primary investigative goal. Although image-derived endmembers resulted in more effectiveness in terms of fire-related components abundance quantification (LMSA-derived RMSE < 0.1), the F-scores always were & GE; 90% whether generic endmembers or image endmembers derived information was employed. The environmental heterogeneity of the two study areas affected the fire severity gradients, with a prevalence of the charred (PT) (45-46%) and green class (IT) (44-53%). Post-fire temporal monitoring was initialized by applying the proposed strategies, and the preliminary results showed a positive recovery trend in forest vegetation from the first year following the fire event, with a reduced charcoal predominance and an increasing proportion of green components.

TI  - Geochemical analysis of SAR backscattering (Sentinel-1) on global ocean oil spill cases
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The oil spill is one of the most impactful sources of marine pollution on the ocean surface, detected by the SAR sensors as dark areas, regions with low backscatter values. Due to the complex mixture of hydrophobic hydrocarbons, mineral oil spills change the water surface tension dampening the capillary gravity waves and provoking a specular reflection. In this work, we associated the geochemical oil characteristics, such as density, viscosity, API, and molecular composition with the backscatter values for each oil spill case. We identified the relationship between the oil weathering processes, with the changes in the backscattering values of ocean oil spills. The method designed zonal sections over the oil spills detected in the SAR images, to extract the backscatter values for each pixel along the section. The lowest backscatter average was observed by the heavy oil spill in the Corsica Island study (-29,99 dB). The highest level of weathering had the highest backscatter averages. Damping rates ranged between 4,12 and 7,07 dB and the backscatter values may be related to low oil layer thickness. Furthermore, low wind speeds may have reduced the contrast between water and oil spills, resulting in low damping ratios in all events.

TI  - Using Sentinel-1 and Google Earth Engine cloud computing for detecting historical flood hazards in tropical urban regions: a case of Dar es Salaam
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the potential of freely available Sentinel-1 imagery coupled with Google Earth Engine (GEE) for mapping and monitoring flooding in Dar es Salaam. Sentinel-1 images (n = 55) available during the rainy season (March-May) since 2016 were used and processed in GEE. For separating water and land surfaces, we used a histogram-based automatic thresholding method. The binarization accuracy was assessed using confusion matrix based on 1064 randomly generated points in GEE. Overall accuracy of 95% (Kappa = 0.90) were achieved. Dar es Salaam has experienced flood inundation per flood event on average over an area of 50 km(2) in March 2019 and 2021. Territories located along the Ocean and inland water shores, built and bare ground were subject to flooding compared to other land cover types. Flooding inundations have been difficult to detect in the city center. With the current temporal and spatial resolution of Sentinel-1, flood detection in city centers remains a challenge yet. However, Sentinel-1 images, coupled with GEE cloud computing simplified flood mapping and monitoring in a large urban region and this approach can be applied in other large cities and their surroundings for countries where data gap and lack of processing tools are critical challenges.

TI  - Automated and refined wetland mapping of Dongting Lake using migrated training samples based on temporally dense Sentinel 1/2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands provide vital ecological services for both humans and environment, necessitating continuous, refined and up-to-date mapping of wetlands for conservation and management. In this study, we developed an automated and refined wetland mapping framework integrating training sample migration method, supervised machine learning and knowledge-driven rules using Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and open-source geospatial tools. We applied the framework to temporally dense Sentinel-1/2 imagery to produce annual refined wetland maps of the Dongting Lake Wetland (DLW) during 2015-2021. First, the continuous change detection (CCD) algorithm was utilized to migrate stable training samples. Then, annual 10 m preliminary land cover maps with 9 classes were produced using random forest algorithm and migrated samples. Ultimately, annual 10 m refined wetland maps were generated based on preliminary land cover maps via knowledge-driven rules from geometric features and available water-related inventories, with Overall Accuracy (OA) ranging from 81.82% (2015) to 93.84% (2020) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) between 0.73 (2015) and 0.91 (2020), demonstrating satisfactory performance and substantial potential for accurate, timely and type-refined wetland mapping. Our methodological framework allows rapid and accurate monitoring of wetland dynamics and could provide valuable information and methodological support for monitoring, conservation and sustainable development of wetland ecosystem.

TI  - Impacts of terrain on land surface phenology derived from Harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 in the Tianshan Mountains, China
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of terrain impacts on land surface phenology (LSP) is crucial for understanding the responses of mountainous ecosystems to environmental changes. While the effects of terrain factors on LSP spatial patterns have been observed to vary across regions due to their different climate and terrain conditions, the specific effects across different elevations are still largely unclear, especially in regions with diverse hydrothermal conditions, such as the Tianshan Mountains located in arid and semiarid region. Here, we investigated the spatial relationships between LSP metrics and terrain factors (i.e. elevation and aspect) in the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, China. Our analysis utilized surface reflectance at a 30 m spatial resolution from the Harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 dataset for 2021 and 2022. We focused on two LSP metrics, vegetation greenup (GU20) and maturity (GU90), which were estimated using 20% and 90% thresholds of seasonal amplitude of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series, respectively. We modeled the spatial relationships using ordinary least square (OLS) linear regression for the entire study region and then applied geographically weighted regression (GWR) with a 2.5 km bandwidth to explore local variations. Our results suggest that, at a large scale, elevation played a primary role in controlling the spatial variations in both LSP metrics, overshadowing the role of aspect. However, when examined at a local scale using GWR, aspect emerged as an important factor, with south-facing aspects associated with earlier dates of GU20 and GU90 for most regions. Furthermore, we found that the influences of terrain on the LSP metrics varied across elevations. The explanatory power of terrain was stronger at middle elevations (approximately 2000-3000 m) than at lower (<2000 m) and higher (>3000 m) elevations. In addition, the sensitivities of the LSP metrics to elevation and aspect demonstrated varying patterns at elevations above 2000 m. Our findings highlight the diverse environmental controls on LSP across elevations, with a particular emphasis on the phenological sensitivities to aspect-induced local climatic differences.

TI  - Sentinel-2 satellite images for monitoring cattle slurry and digestate spreading on emerging wheat crop: a field spectroscopy experiment
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is aimed to evaluate the utility of Sentinel-2 imagery for monitoring exogenous organic matter (EOM) applied on winter wheat crop, using two spatial scales: proximal and satellite. From proximal sensing, multi-temporal spectral field measurements were taken on experimental fields consisting of three treatments (cattle slurry, liquid and raw digestates) and a control throughout 46 days. From Sentinel-2 satellites, images were analysed before and after EOM application. For both sensing scales, EOM and vegetation indices were used. On any scale of observation, the digestates spread on emerging wheat were easily detectable in late winter, in contrast to spring spreading events which were hindered by the developed vegetation. The agglomerative hierarchical clustering from the EOM indices divided by EVI achieved to discriminate digestates at early and medium stages of vegetation growth. Our findings did not apply for cattle slurry, presumably because of both lower organic and dry matter contents.

T2  - CYTA-JOURNAL OF FOOD
M3  - Article
AB  - Immunosenescence is the degeneration of immunological organs and cells due to aging. Some plants and fungi may have anti-aging benefits through regulating immunosenescence. In this study, mice were fed with two dietary supplement products: Zeng Jian Health Tonic (ZJ) contains extracts from Lentinula edodes, Poria cocos, Tremella fuciformis, cassia seed, Flammulina velutipes, Fructus lycii, chrysanthemum, and mulberry. Zhen Yuan Capsule (ZY) contains extracts from Ganoderma lucidum, Semen cuscutae, Poria cocos, Schisandra chinensis, Codonopsis pilosula, and Atractylodes macrocephala. In addition, the immune organ index, immune cell functions, inflammatory cytokines, and antioxidant enzyme activities were evaluated. The combination of ZJ and ZY could restore the function of lymphocytes and NK cells; decrease the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and GM-CSF; increase the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-5; and enhance superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities. Therefore, combining ZJ with ZY has anti-aging effects on elderly mice.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional mapping and monitoring of land use/land cover (LULC) still remain a challenge that depend on classifier and remote sensing data selected. This study aims to create precise LULC maps and explore the efficiency of an ensemble machine learning approach that integrates random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). Two sets of remote sensing data were multi-temporal Landsat and a single scene from QuickBird covering the coastal area of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were used. By training the classifier using samples collected from QuickBird and knowledge-based and optimal parameterization, the overall accuracy was enhanced from 70% to more than 90%. For the proposed approach, the result showed that the F1-score was 0.99. The results exhibited a rapid increase in all classes, accompanied by a significant change in the shoreline. The proposed approach has the potential to be applied to other regions and to produce accurate LULC maps.

TI  - Regionalized classification of stand tree species in mountainous forests by fusing advanced classifiers and ecological niche model
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Though many new remote sensing technologies have been introduced to analyze forests, regional-scale species-level mapping products are still rare, especially in large mountainous areas. Tree species abundance, low spectral separability among species and huge computing demand are hindrances for obtaining an accurate stand tree species map. This study addressed these problems by synergizing regionalization, multiple feature fusion, and model fusion and proposed a new machine learning workflow. The whole area, i.e. Yunnan province in China (approximately 390,000 km(2)), was firstly divided into 8 distinct floristic regions according to the distributions and phylogenetic relationships of native tree species. Thereafter, with Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, multiple data sets, including Sentinel-2 imagery, SRTM DEM, and WorldClim bioclimatic, were collected to construct a high-dimensional feature pool for each region. Thirdly, the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt?, generally used for predicting ecological niche, and three classifiers, i.e. Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were used to pre-classify environmental and remote sensing data, respectively. After that, two types of decision fusion strategies, parallel and serial ensembles, were applied to fuse pre-classification probability maps for each sub-region. Finally, the spatial distribution of 19 forest stand species over the whole Yunnan Province was obtained by mosaicking the best classification results from 8 sub-regions. Our method achieves an overall accuracy of 72.18% on the entire validation dataset. The decision fusion models significantly improve the classification accuracy, with the eight partitioned best fusion models improving the accuracy by 7.33%-25.39% on average compared to base classifiers. This study demonstrates that the spatial partitioning strategy and the decision fusion integrating a proper machine learning algorithm and ecological niche model can significantly improve the classification accuracy of forest stand species in montane forests.

TI  - Combining PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 images with environmental data for improved wheat yield estimation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images are widely used for crop yield estimation, but their coarse spatial resolution means that they often fail to provide detailed information at the field scale. Recently, a new generation of high-resolution satellites and CubeSat platforms has been launched. In this study, satellite data sources including PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 were combined with topographic and climatic variables, and the improvement in wheat yield estimation was evaluated. Wheat yield data from a combine harvester were used to train and validate a yield estimation model based on random forest regression. Nine vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, MSAVI2, MTVI2, MTCI, reNDVI, SAVI, EVI and WDVI) and spectral bands were tested. During the model training, the Sentinel-2 data realized a slightly higher estimation accuracy than the PlanetScope data. However, combining environmental data with the PlanetScope data realized the highest estimation accuracy. For the validated models, adding the topographic and climatic datasets to the satellite data sources improved the estimation accuracy, and the results were slightly better with the Sentinel-2 data than with the PlanetScope data. Observation data of the milk and dough stages provided the highest estimation accuracy of the wheat yield at 210-225 days after sowing.

TI  - National-scale mapping of building footprints using feature super-resolution semantic segmentation of Sentinel-2 images
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since buildings are closely related to human activities, large-scale mapping of individual buildings has become a hot research topic. High-resolution images with sub-meter or meter resolution are common choices to produce maps of building footprints. However, high-resolution images are both infrequently collected and expensive to obtain and process, making it very difficult to produce large-scale maps of individual buildings timely. This paper presents a simple but effective way to produce a national-scale map of building footprints using feature super-resolution semantic segmentation of sentinel-2 images. Specifically, we proposed a super-resolution semantic segmentation network named EDSR_NASUnet, which is an end-to-end network to generate semantic maps with a spatial resolution of 2.5 m from real remote sensing images with a spatial resolution of 10 m. Based on the dataset consisting of images from 35 cities in China, we quantitatively compared the proposed method with three methods under the same framework and qualitatively evaluated the identification results of individual buildings. In addition, we mapped building footprints within the entire China at 2.5 m-resolution using Sentinel-2 images of 10 m resolution. The density of building footprints varies considerably across China, with a gradual increase in building footprints from west to east, i.e. from the first step of China's terrain to the third one. We detected over 86.3 million individual buildings with a total rooftop area of approximately 58,719.43 km(2). The number of buildings increased from 5.73 million in the first step of China's terrain, through 23.41 million in the second step of China's terrain, to 57.16 million in the third step of China's terrain. The area of buildings also increased from 3318.02 km(2) through 13,844.29 to 41,557.12 km(2). The Aihui-Tengchong line, a dividing line representing the regional distribution of China's population, also divides the regional distribution of Chinese buildings. Our approach has a more open and practical application because of the medium-resolution images and platform with open access. Results are available to the community (https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=users/flower/2019_China)).

TI  - Tracking the historical urban development by classifying Landsat MSS data with training samples migrated across time and space
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - To reveal the historical urban development in large areas using satellite data such as Landsat MSS still need to overcome many challenges. One of them is the need for high-quality training samples. This study tested the feasibility of migrating training samples collected from Landsat MSS data across time and space. We migrated training samples collected for Washington, D. C. in 1979 to classify the city's land covers in 1982 and 1984. The classifier trained with Washington, D. C.'s samples were used in classifying Boston's and Tokyo's land covers. The results showed that the overall accuracies achieved using migrated samples in 1982 (66.67%) and 1984 (65.67%) for Washington, D. C. were comparable to that of 1979 (68.67%) using a random forest classifier. Migration of training samples between cities in the same urban ecoregion, i.e. Washington, D. C., and Boston, achieved higher overall accuracy (59.33%) than cities in the different ecoregions (Tokyo, 50.33%). We concluded that migrating training samples across time and space in the same urban ecoregion are feasible. Our findings can contribute to using Landsat MSS data to reveal the historical urbanization pattern on a global scale.

TI  - Mapping groundwater dependent ecosystem potential in a semi-arid environment using a remote sensing-based multiple-lines-of-evidence approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) are vulnerable to groundwater regime changes. However, their protection is often hampered by challenges in their identification. Within is presented a remote sensing-based GDE potential mapping approach based on the persistency of relevant vegetation parameters during prolonged dry periods as an indicator of potential 'consistency' of water supply (e.g. groundwater). The study uses a novel approach to characterising persistency for selected vegetation parameters based on a normalised difference measure and an adaptation of the coefficient of variation statistic. Aggregation of parameters was facilitated through the analytic hierarchy process providing a structured weighting approach to minimise parameter bias. The approach is demonstrated in the semi-arid Flinders Ranges of South Australia where new groundwater resources are being sought to support local domestic and industry needs. Variations in GDE potential were mapped to better target areas where exploration of groundwater should be avoided. Mapping results indicated a high-level of agreement of 77% with an independent springs dataset, along with an 87% agreement with areas coinciding with known phreatophyte species and depths to groundwater. The index-based mapping approach has potential applicability across landscapes, as it normalises for variations in vegetation cover, minimises technical overheads, and employs continental-wide remote sensing data-products.

TI  - A comparative estimate of air temperature from modis land surface temperatures in Ghana
T2  - COGENT ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is aimed at establishing a comparative estimate of air temperature (Tair) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) between 1 km and 6 km spatial resolutions and to investigate and quantify spatial variability of LST-Tair relationships. The test area is Republic of Ghana located in the sub-region of West Africa. The purpose of the research is to establish an optimal performance of Tair between two spatial resolutions. Arithmetic Mean method was employed for computation of the datasets. Seventy (70) pairs of composite LSTs consisting of Terra and Aqua MODIS observations which correspond to 70 meteorological stations were used. Due to problem of missing data and outliers, 277 pairs of LST data points per resolution were used. Application of Regression Analyses revealed a good direct correlation existing between values of Tair and LSTs in 1 km with coefficient of determination, R-2 = 0.8124 while, 6 Km resolution recorded R-2 = 0.8031. Hence, MODIS LST in 1 km is a better estimator of air temperature in Linear Regression study. Statistical indices of 1 km procedure were found to be lower than the 6 km procedure. The 1 km resolution registered a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.97 degrees C, Standard Error of regression, 1.14 degrees C and Coefficient of Variation, CV of 10.19%. Meanwhile, 6 km resolution yielded a RMSE of 2.13 degrees C, Standard Error of regression, 1.22 degrees C and CV of 10.68% respectively. Therefore, 1 km resolution datasets show better accuracy and performance of air temperature estimation than 6 km data products. Hence, a good result would be achieved when 1 km datasets are processed.

TI  - Collaborative multiple change detection methods for monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of mangroves in Beibu Gulf, China
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are one of the most diverse and productive marine ecosystems around the world, although losses of global mangrove area have been occurring over the past decades. Therefore, tracking spatio-temporal changes and assessing the current state are essential for mangroves conservation. To solve the issues of inaccurate detection results of single algorithms and those limited to historical change detection, this study proposes the detect-monitor-predict (DMP) framework of mangroves for detecting time-series historical changes, monitoring abrupt near-real-time events, and predicting future trends in Beibu Gulf, China, through the synergetic use of multiple detection change algorithms. This study further developed a method for extracting mangroves using multi-source inter-annual time-series spectral indices images, and evaluated the performance of twenty-one spectral indices for capturing expansion events of mangroves. Finally, this study reveals the spatio-temporal dynamics of mangroves in Beibu Gulf from 1986 to 2021. In this study, we found that our method could extract mangrove growth regions from 1986 to 2021, and achieved 0.887 overall accuracy, which proved that this method is able to rapidly extract large-scale mangroves without field-based samples. We confirmed that the normalized difference vegetation index and tasseled cap angle outperform other spectral indexes in capturing mangrove expansion changes, while enhanced vegetation index and soil-adjusted vegetation index capture the change events with a time delay. This study revealed that mangrove changes displayed historical changes in the hierarchical gradient from land to sea with an average annual expansion of 239.822 ha in the Beibu Gulf during 1986-2021, detected slight improvements and deteriorations of some contemporary mangroves, and predicted 72.778% of mangroves with good growth conditions in the future.

TI  - Towards quantifying the relative tectonic activity in the Trans-Yamuna segment of NW Himalaya
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the increased availability of high-resolution satellite data and the rapid development of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, the mapping of active faults and quantification of tectonic activity in inaccessible regions has exceedingly improved. We examined the tectonic activity in the Trans-Yamuna region of the NW Himalaya using geomorphic indices derived from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In addition, this study evaluates the sensitivity of four space-borne Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) with respect to TAN DEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements). The Cartosat DEM, generated with a spatial resolution of 5 meters using state-of-the-art methods, demonstrated a reliable representation of topography. Geomorphic indices such as Asymmetry Factor (AF), Transverse Topography (TT), Hypsometric Integral (HI), Valley Floor width (Vf), Stream-length gradient index (SL), and Normalised steepness index (ksn) were computed for 41 sub-watersheds to determine the degree of tectonic activity. We infer that majority of the region is tectonically active, with upliftment continuing to occur in the north of the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT). Furthermore, the existence of mapped active faults north of the MBT further substantiates the fact that strain release is not only concentrated in the frontal Himalaya, but is distributed over a broader area above the decollement.

TI  - Retrieving the grounding lines of the Riiser-Larsen Ice Shelf using Sentinel-1 SAR images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately locating and studying grounding lines is essential for predicting the response of glaciers to climate change. However, it is challenging to find grounding lines since they are subglacial features. In this study, Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data were utilized to derive the grounding lines of the Riiser-Larsen Ice Shelf. A new method with inspiration drawn from multi-temporal baseline InSAR techniques is proposed. It takes advantage of the temporal consistency of the vertical displacement gradients and identifies grounding zones pixel-by-pixel on a stack of double differential interferograms, thereby providing grounding line proxies. As it fully exploits coherent signals in both spatial and temporal domains, the maximum possible number of grounding zone pixels can be obtained. Moreover, due to the introduction of the concept of the temporal consistency, the method can cope with short term grounding line fluctuations to some extent and may mitigate the influences of atmospheric disturbances and residual ice displacements. The resulting grounding lines are compared with the MEaSUREs Antarctic grounding line product. The comparison confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method and corroborates that the Riiser-Larsen Ice Shelf should have not undergone significant changes over the past few decades.

TI  - Impacts of irrigation tank restoration on water bodies and croplands in Telangana State of India using Landsat time series data and machine learning algorithms
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2014, the State of Telangana in southern India began repairing and restoring more than 46,000 irrigation water tanks (artificial reservoirs) under the Mission Kakatiya project with an investment in excess of USD 2 billion. In this study, we attempted to map the temporal changes that have occurred in cropland areas and water bodies as a result of the project, using remote sensing imagery and applying land use/land cover (LULC) mapping algorithms. We used 16-day time series data from Landsat 8 to study the spatial distribution of changes in water bodies and cropland areas over the 2013-18 period. Ground survey information was used to assess the pixel-based accuracy of the Landsat-derived data. The areas served by these tanks were identified on the basis of training data and Random Forest algorithms using Google Earth Engine. Our spatial analysis revealed a substantial increase in cropped area under irrigation and expansion of water bodies over the study period. We observed a 20% increase in total tank area in 2017-18 and total cropland and irrigated area expansion of the order of 0.6 M ha and 0.2 M ha, respectively. A comparison of ground survey data and four LULC classes derived from Landsat temporal imagery showed an overall accuracy of 87%, significantly correlated with national agriculture statistics. Periodic monitoring based on remote sensing has proved to be an effective method of capturing LULC changes resulting from the Mission Kakatiya interventions. Higher-resolution satellite data can further improve the accuracy of estimates.

TI  - A novel remote sensing monitoring index of salinization based on three-dimensional feature space model and its application in the Yellow River Delta of China
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies were mostly conducted based on two-dimensional feature space to monitor salinization, while studies on dense long-term salinization monitoring based on three-dimensional feature space have not been reported. Based on Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images and three-dimensional feature space method, this study introduced six typical salinization surface parameters, including NDVI, salinity index, MSAVI, surface albedo, iron oxide index, wetness index to construct eight different feature space monitoring index. The optimal soil salinization monitoring index model was proposed base on field observed data and then the evolution process of salinization in Yellow River Delta (YRD) were analyzed and revealed during 1984-2022. The salinization monitoring index model of MSAVI-Albedo-I-Fe2O3 feature space had the highest accuracy with R-2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 0.678g/kg. The spatial distribution of salinization in YRD showed an increasing trend from inland southwest to coastal northeast and the salinization intensity showed an increasing trend during 1984-2022 due to the implements of agricultural measures such as planting salt-tolerant crops, microbial remediation and fertility improvement. The rate of salinization deterioration in the northeast part was greater than others. Zones of salinization improvement were mainly located in cultivated land of the southwest parts.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of population density in China using nighttime light and geographic weighted regression method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution and dynamic changes of regional or national population data with long time series are very important for regional planning, resource allocation, government decision-making, disaster assessment, ecological protection, and other sustainability research. However, the existing population datasets such as LandScan and WorldPop all provide data from 2000 with limited time series, while GHS-POP only utilizes land use data with limited accuracy. In view of the limited remote sensing images of long time series, it is necessary to combine existing multi-source remote sensing data for population spatialization research. In this research, we developed a nighttime light desaturation index (NTLDI). Through the cross-sensor calibration model based on an autoencoder convolutional neural network, the NTLDI was calibrated with the same period Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band (VIIRS-DNB) data. Then, the geographically weighted regression method is used to determine the population density of China from 1990 to 2020 based on the long time series NTL. Furthermore, the change characteristics and the driving factors of China's population spatial distribution are analyzed. The large-scale, long-term population spatialization results obtained in this study are of great significance in government planning and decision-making, disaster assessment, resource allocation, and other aspects.

TI  - The hot zones are cities: Methodological outcomes and synthesis of surface urban heat island effect in Africa
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Global warming and rapid population growth are two of the most pressing issues in today's world. There is growing evidence of rising temperatures. The urban heat island effect is a significant environmental issue facing cities today. Although this issue has gained much attention from developed countries, countries in Africa are yet to grapple with it on a significant scale. This paper examined the rising research dimensions and major methodological techniques in studying urban heat effects. The paper adopted a systematic review method where peer-reviewed articles formed the trajectory of debate on Urban Heat Island (UHI) in African cities. The paper finds remote sensing the most common method in analysing UHI effect than ground use technology (weather station), which is limited in spatial spread in most African countries. Urbanization and other human-induced factors majorly contribute to UHI and this has an impact on many elements of life, including morbidity, mortality, birth weight decrease, and social strife. The paper recommends research priority on UHI effect in African cities due to the rising population.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of carbon stock in seagrass meadows is in challenges of paucity of assessment and low accuracy of the estimates. In this study, we used a fusion of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 (S-1), the multi-spectral Sentinel-2 (S-2), and coupled this with advanced machine learning (ML) models and meta-heuristic optimization to improve the estimation of total organic carbon (TOC) stock in the Zostera muelleri meadows in Tauranga Harbour, New Zealand. Five scenarios containing combinations of data, ML models (Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boost, Rotation Forest, CatBoost) and optimization were developed and evaluated for TOC retrieval. Results indicate a fusion of S1, S2 images, a novel ML model CatBoost and the grey wolf optimization algorithm (the CB-GWO model) yielded the best prediction of seagrass TOC (R (2), RMSE were 0.738 and 10.64 Mg C ha(-1)). Our results provide novel ideas of deriving a low-cost, scalable and reliable estimates of seagrass TOC globally.

TI  - A type of polarimetric parameter for evaluating the reliability of model-based decomposition result and its application
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The reliability of the model-based decomposition result, which is seldom investigated, is a key factor in determining whether decomposition parameters can be effectively applied to polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) applications. In this paper, a type of polarimetric parameter for evaluating the reliability of model-based decomposition result is proposed. It originates from the degree of correlation between the scattering models. The main idea is whether the measured power can be assigned to the corresponding scattering model. The more the measured power that can be allocated to the corresponding scattering model, the more reliable the decomposition result. The C-band Radarsat-2, L-band UAVSAR, X-band TerraSAR-X, and L-band E-SAR PolSAR data are selected for experiments. The results show that the type of polarimetric parameter can effectively represent the reliability of the decomposition result. The reliabilities of surface and double-bounce scattering are high in the ocean and orthogonal buildings, respectively. For oriented buildings, the reliability of the decomposition result is lower owing to the overestimation of volume scattering. For forested areas, reliability is generally higher if volume scattering is not overestimated. Furthermore, the results show that the reliability of soil moisture retrieval is positively correlated with surface scattering reliability.

TI  - Estimation of the occurrence, severity, and volume of heartwood rot using airborne laser scanning and optical satellite data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rot in commercial timber reduces the value of the wood substantially and estimating the occurrence, severity, and volume of heartwood rot would be a useful tool in decision-making to minimize economic losses. Remotely sensed data has recently been used for mapping rot on a single-tree level, and although the results have been relatively poor, some potential has been shown. This study applied area-based approaches to predict rot occurrence, rot severity, and rot volume , at an area level. Ground reference data were collected from harvester operations in 2019-2021. Predictor variables were calculated from multi-temporal remotely sensed data together with environmental variables. Response variables from the harvester data and predictor variables from remotely sensed data were aggregated to grid cells and to forest stands. Random Forest models were built for the different combinations of response variables and predictor subsets, and validated with both random- and spatial cross-validation. The results showed that it was not possible to estimate rot occurrence and rot severity with the applied modeling procedure (pR(2): 0.00-0.16), without spatially close training data. The better performance of rot volume models (pR(2): 0.12-0.37) was mainly due to the correlation between timber volume and rot volume.

TI  - Heterogeneous mass balance of selected Glaciers in the Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Himalaya between 2000 and 2018
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalayas (HKH) are a major source of freshwater in the agriculture-dependent economy of Pakistan. In recent decades, mountain glaciers have been threatened by global warming. In this study, we estimated the Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) and geodetic mass balance of fifteen representative glaciers from Hunza (Karakoram), Chitral (Hindu Kush), and Astore (Himalaya) using Landsat satellite images and Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) DEMs between 2000 and 2018. The climatic trends (temperature and precipitation) in the 19 years (1995-2013) time series of the three regions were assessed using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Sen's Slope. The ELA of the observed glaciers except for two Atrak (Chitral) and Gulkin (Hunza) is shifted upward, while the mass balance indicates a heterogeneous pattern ranging from -0.23 +/- 0.05 to -0.01 +/- 0.015 m w.e a(-1), -0.13 +/- 0.05 to+0.17 +/- 0.11 m w.e a(-1) and -0.03 +/- 0.02 to+0.23 +/- 0.09 m w.e a(-1) in Chitral, Hunza, and Astore basin, respectively. A significant or slight increasing or decreasing trend was found in the mean annual temperature, mean total precipitation, and mean discharge of the studied basins. This study will be a good contribution to understanding snow and glacier dynamics in HKH, the factors that influence them, and their interaction with the environment.

TI  - Coral reef applications of Landsat-8: geomorphic zonation and benthic habitat mapping of Xisha Islands, China
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Being one of the most significant and valuable coral reef systems in the South China Sea, the Xisha Islands has undergone rapid transformation due to increasing stressors from human impacts and climate change in recent years. However, as indispensable information for coral reef monitoring and management, the detailed reef extent, geomorphic zonation, or benthic composition of the Xisha Islands is not well documented. Considering limited access to the Xisha Islands, the rapid development of optical remote sensing technology provides us with a feasible mean for coral reef observation. This study adopted a water depth substitution index - probabilistic inundation (PI) - combined with depth-invariant index (DII) to achieve reef extent exploration, geomorphologic and benthic habitat types classification with unsupervised classification algorithms based on Landsat-8 time-series satellite data. Compared with two open-access datasets, the extent of each independent reef extracted from PI exhibited higher similarity with the actual boundary conditions displayed in RGB (Red-Green-Blue) composite images from Landsat-8. Based on PI and derived slope, we obtained geomorphic zonation classification results, and similarly benthic compositions were retrieved based on PI, DII, and reflectance. The overall accuracy of geomorphic zonation and benthic habitat classification results were 72% and 86%, respectively. We also interestingly discovered that corals of the Xisha Islands may be capable of an ability to resist chronic heat stress as a growth trend of reef area after two successive stress events in 2014-2015 were observed at most reefs. The proposed mapping framework of this study provides a repeatable and flexible scheme in depicting the comprehensive situation of coral reefs at Xisha Islands based only on publicly available remote sensing data without complicated pre-set parameters, which could be easily extended to coral reef research around the world. Simultaneously, the findings also provide requisite information supporting the sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems in the Xisha Islands.

TI  - Potential improvement of XCO<sub>2</sub> retrieval of the OCO-2 by having aerosol information from the A-train satellites
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-real time observations of aerosol properties could have a potential to improve the accuracy of XCO2 retrieval algorithm in operational satellite missions. In this study, we developed a retrieval algorithm of XCO2 (Yonsei Retrieval Algorithm; YCAR) based on the Optimal Estimation (OE) method that used aerosol information at the location of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) measurement from co-located measurement of the Afternoon constellation (A-train) such as the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) onboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Observation (CALIPSO) and the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua. Specifically, we used optical depth, vertical profile, and optical properties of aerosol from MODIS and CALIOP data. We validated retrieval results to the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) ground-based measurements and found general consistency. The impact of observed aerosol information and its constraint was examined by retrieval tests using different settings. The effect of using additional aerosol information was analyzed in connection with the bias correction process of the operational retrieval algorithm. YCAR using a priori aerosol loading parameters from co-located satellite measurements and less constraint of aerosol optical properties made comparable results with operational data with the bias correction process in three of the four cases subject to this study. Our work provides evidence supporting the bias correction process of operational algorithms and quantitatively presents the effectiveness of synergic use of multiple satellites (e.g. A-train) and better treatment of aerosol information.

TI  - Synthetic aperture radar polarised backscattering behaviour in partially inundated agricultural fields
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A methodology for classifying rainfed paddy fields based on their hydrological conditions is lacking. This study analysed the behaviour of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter coefficients at each polarisation and cross-polarisation ratio index in a rainfed rice paddy field with a partially waterlogged surface. The SAR polarisations used were the VH and VV of the C-band SAR Sentinel-1 and the HV and HH of the L-band SAR Palsar-2. The relationship between backscatter coefficient and terrains including topographic categories and local relative elevation, which affect waterlogging conditions in rainfed paddy fields, were evaluated. The VV of C-band, and HH and HV of L-band showed different patterns in the time series variation according to the topographic categories. We observed that the combination of L-band HH and HV could be used to assess waterlogging conditions because they differ depending on variations in local elevation. The study results suggest that future studies can evaluate the microtopography and associated local hydrological environment using the combination of L-band HH and HV backscatter coefficient.

TI  - A new multivariate agricultural drought composite index based on random forest algorithm and remote sensing data developed for Sahelian agrosystems
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - This manuscript aims to develop a new multivariate composite index for monitoring agricultural drought. To achieve this, the AVHRR, VIIRS, CHIRPS data series over a period of 40 years, rainfall and crop yield data as references were used. Variables include parameters for vegetative stress (SVCI, PV, SMN), water stress (PCI, RDI, NRDI), and heat stress (SMT, TCI, STCI), and a new variable related to environmental conditions was calculated through a normalized rainfall efficiency index. Then, random forest algorithm was used to determine the weights of each component of the model by considering interannual fluctuations in cereal yields as an impact variable. The multivariate composite model was compared to the VHI, NVSWI and SPI-12 indices for validation. The results show a large spatiotemporal concordance between the MDCI and the validation indices with a maximum correlation of 0.95 with the VHI and a highly significant p value (< 2.2e-16). Validation of the MDCI model by SPI-12 shows a significantly higher statistically significant relationship than that observed between SPI and VHI and NVSWI. P value range from 3.531e-05 to 6.137e-06 with correlations that vary between 0.6 and 0.64 depending on the station. It is also highly correlated with the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and climatic water deficit index (CWDI), with R = 0.85 and p value < 5.8e-10 and R = 0.72 and p value < 1.9e-6, respectively. Finally, the study provides a new direction for multivariate modeling of agricultural drought that should be further explored under various agroclimatic conditions.

TI  - Land-use and land cover change dynamics in urban Ghana: implications for peri-urban livelihoods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examined the dynamics of urban land use and land cover change, and their implications for livelihoods in peri-urban Tamale, Ghana. The study employed household data and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) for 1986, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) for 2004 and Landsat 8 Operationalised Landsat Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLIS/TIRS) for 2019. The findings show that the urban expansion process witnessed a transition from agricultural livelihood to a more complex and monetised urban economy, which presented mixed impacts on the livelihoods of the peri-urban households. We argued that the horizontal expansion of urban areas into prime agricultural lands could be halted by promoting vertical development in the form of multi-storey buildings rather than the horizontal multiplication of individual housing units. Supporting the peri-urban households to diversify their livelihood portfolios by venturing into beekeeping, poultry farming, and livestock keeping, which do not require large tracts of land is recommended.

TI  - Comparative analysis of GIS and RS based models for delineation of groundwater potential zone mapping
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a crucial natural resource that varies in quality and quantity across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pakistan. Increased population and urbanization place enormous demands on groundwater supplies, reducing both their quality and quantity. This research aimed to delineate the groundwater potential zone in the Kohat region, Pakistan by integrating twelve thematic layers. In the current research, Groundwater Potential Zone (GWPZ) were created by implementing Weight of Evidence (WOE), Frequency Ratio (FR), and Information Value (IV) models of the Kohat region. In this study, we used Sentinel-2 satellite data were utilized to generate an inventory map of groundwater using machine learning algorithms in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Furthermore, the validation was done with a field survey and ground data. The inventory data was divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets. The WOE, FR, and IV models are applied to assess the relationship between inventory data and groundwater factors to generate the GWPZ of the Kohat region. Finally, the current research results of Area Under Curve (AUC) technique for WOE, FR, and IV models were 88%, 91%, and 89%. The final GWPZ can aid in better future planning for groundwater exploration, management, and supply of water in the Kohat region.

TI  - Deforestation and agricultural fires in South-West Para, Brazil, under political changes from 2014 to 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing deforestation and fires since 2019 raises concerns about the irreversible destruction of the Brazilian Amazon. Our goal was to better understand these changes in south-west Para across different land-tenure and farm systems and between the terms of President Rousseff, Temer, and Bolsonaro. We reconstructed deforestation and fire history using all Landsat and Sentinel-2 observations from 2014 to 2020 and assessed, using quasi-experimental methods, the average treatment effects of each presidency on deforestation and fires across land-tenure and farm types. Deforestation nearly quadrupled to 1,201 km(2), particularly during Bolsonaro in undesignated areas and conservation units and on medium-sized farms (p < 0.001). Burning increased to 4,805 km(2) and in all tenure types (p < 0.001). The increase was strongest in agrarian settlements and conservation units and on medium and large farms. Our observations show the importance of clarifying land-tenure and re-strengthening disincentives of environmental infractions, which have been weakened specifically under President Bolsonaro.

TI  - A machine learning method for Arctic lakes detection in the permafrost areas of Siberia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermokarst lakes are the main components of the vast Arctic and subarctic landscapes. These lakes can serve as geoindicators of permafrost degradation; therefore, proper lake distribution assessment methods are necessary. In this study, we compared four machine learning methods to improve existing lake detection systems. The northern part of Yakutia was selected as the study area owing to its complex environment. We used data from Landsat 8 and spectral indices to take into account the spectral characteristics of the lakes, and MERIT DEM data to take into account the topography. The lowest accuracy was found for the classification and regression trees (CART) method (overall accuracy = 81%). On the other hand, the random forests (RF) classification provided the best results (overall accuracy = 92%), and only this classification coped well in all problematic areas, such as shaded and humid areas, near steep slopes, burn scars, and rivers. The altitude and bands SWIR1 (Short wave infrared 1), SWIR2 (Short wave infrared 2), and Green were the most important. Spectral indices did not have significant impact on the classification results in the specific conditions of the thermokarst lakes environment. 17,700 lakes were identified with the total area of 271.43 km(2).

TI  - Developing a new red band-SEVI-blue band (RSB) enhancement method for recognition the extra-high-voltage transmission line corridor in green mountains
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the extra-high-voltage transmission line corridor (EHVTLC) in mountains is critical for safe smart-grid operation. However, the transmission lines are so narrow that they are difficult to recognize using multispectral satellite images with a spatial resolution of 10 m. In this study, we developed a new method using the red band-shadow-eliminated vegetation index (SEVI)-blue band (RSB) composite image to enhance the EHVTLC in green mountains (named RSB-enhancement method). Using this method, the EHVTLC becomes evident in the false-color synthesis of the RSB composite of the Sentinel-2 image. Then, we recognized and extracted approximately 342.45 km of the EHVTLC in a mountainous region of Fuzhou City, China, including a 46.73 km three-parallel-lane segment of 1000 kV and a 295.72 km two-parallel-lane segment of 500 kV. Spatial analysis shows that the SEVI mean difference between the EHVTLC and the buffer zone reaches approximately 10%, and three landslides and 2.66 km(2) soil erosion reside in the buffer zone which area is approximately 73.67 km(2). Finally, the RSB-enhancement method can be used in other satellite images with spatial resolutions of greater than 10 m for enhancement and recognition the transmission line corridors in green mountains.

TI  - Monitoring the subsidence at different periods in high underground water level coal mine areas using differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR)
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the subsidence at different periods in high underground water level coal mine areas can provide a data basis for land reclamation. For the purpose of monitoring subsidence in I working face located in Guotun Coal Mine, 22 Sentinel-1 images were processed by using differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR). After dividing subsidence periods, the characteristics and monitoring accuracy at different subsidence periods were explored. The results showed that: (1) The formation of single-gradient subsidence funnel is an important sign to identify active period. (2) The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) in central area of subsidence are reduced by 50% and 49%, respectively, compared with those in edge area. (3) The monitoring accuracy is high at different subsidence periods. The coefficient of determination (R-2) can reach more than 0.89. Therefore, D-InSAR technique can accurately monitor the subsidence at different periods based on Sentinel-1 data.

TI  - Estimating PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in a central region of China using a three-stage model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to uneven environmental monitoring site distribution, there are significant spatial data gaps for concentrations of ambient fine particles with diameters <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) obtained using traditional monitoring methods. Satellite products are an alternative data source for locations where monitoring sites are unavailable. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) product has been widely used in PM2.5 assessment for years; however, it has obvious data gaps in winter. Here, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) AOD was applied to supplement MODIS AOD data to obtain a fused AOD dataset. A three-stage model consisting of a corrected AOD model, mixed effects model, and geographically weighted regression model was developed and used with meteorological and vegetation factors to estimate PM2.5. Results showed overall model fitting by cross-validation (CV) with an R-2 of 0.92, mean absolute error of 5.72 mu g/m(3), and root mean square error of 7.15 mu g/m(3). The combination of MODIS AOD and VIIRS AOD was a suitable method for enhancing AOD coverage. The CV R-2 value of the three-stage model (0.92) was higher than that of the two-stage model (0.9). Hence, the three-stage model could achieve a better fit in estimating PM2.5 on a regional scale.

TI  - Evaluating the contribution of Sentinel-2 view and illumination geometry to the accuracy of retrieving essential crop parameters
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wide field-of-view (FOV) sensors such as Sentinel-2 exhibit per-pixel view and illumination geometry variation that may influence the retrieval accuracy of essential crop biophysical and biochemical variables (BVs) for precision agriculture. However, this aspect is rarely studied in the existing literature. Hence, the current study aimed to evaluate the contribution of view and illumination geometries to the accuracy of retrieving Leaf Chlorophyll a and b (LC ab ), Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) using the Random Forest (RF). The experiments were performed on various input variable scenarios where per-pixel geometric covariates, i.e. View and Sun Zenith Angles (VZA and SZA, respectively), and Relative Azimuth Angle (RAA), are excluded and included in spectral bands (SB) and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), respectively, in two semi-arid areas. The results showed that spectral bands or vegetation indices combined with geometric covariates improved the R (2) by 10-15% for LAI and 3-5% for CCC. In contrast, negligible improvements of 1-2% were achieved for LC ab  with cross-validation test data and independent held-out dataset, respectively. In agreement with previous studies, VZA and SZA were among the topmost influential variables in the RF models for estimating LAI, LC ab , and CCC. Collectively, per-pixel geometric variables explained more than 30% of the variability in surface reflectance for all Sentinel-2 spectral bands (p < 2.2e-16). Overall, the results showed that incorporating geometric covariates improved the accuracy of retrieving BVs; thus, it provided additional information that improves the predictive power of SB and SVIs. The significant benefits of the geometric variables were mainly realized for canopy-level BVs (i.e. LAI and CCC) than for LC ab . Therefore, it is recommended to incorporate per-pixel view and illumination geometry in estimating LAI and CCC, especially when using wide-view sensors such as Sentinel-2. However, further testing in different phenology, site and acquisition conditions is needed to confirm the contribution of the geometric covariates to facilitate reliable retrieval of BVs from remotely sensed data and aid better agronomic decisions.

TI  - County-level corn yield prediction using supervised machine learning
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objectives of this study are (1) to compare several machine learning models to predict county-level corn yield in the study area and (2) to compare the feasibility of machine learning models for in-season yield prediction. We acquired remotely sensed vegetation indices data from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Vegetation indices for a span of 15 years (2006-2020) were processed and downloaded using GEE for the months corresponding to crop growth (April-October). We compared nine machine learning models to predict county-level corn yield. Furthermore, we analyzed the in-season yield prediction performance using the top three machine learning models. The results show that partial least square regression (PLSR) outperformed other machine learning models for corn yield prediction by achieving the highest training and testing performance. The study area's top three models for county-level corn yield prediction were PLSR, support vector regression (SVR) and ridge regression. For in-season yield prediction, the SVR model performed comparatively well by achieving testing R2 = 0.875. For in-season corn yield prediction, SVR outperformed other models. The results show that machine learning models can predict both in-season yield (best model R2 = 0.875) and end-of-season yield (best model R2 = 0.861) with satisfactory performance. The results indicate that remote sensing data and machine learning models can be used to predict crop yield before the harvest with decent performance. This can provide useful insights in terms of food security and early decision making related to climate change impacts on food security.

TI  - Coseismic displacement fields and the slip mechanism of the 2021 Mw 6.7 Hovsgol earthquake in Mongolia constrained by Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 InSAR
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 11 January 2021, an Mw 6.7 earthquake, which involved a complex rupture mechanism, occurred in Lake Hovsgol, Mongolia. This study measured the earthquake's 3-D coseismic surface displacement fields using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) pairs of three radar look directions: Sentinel-1B from the descending path and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 from the ascending and descending paths. The three DInSARs showed that the maximum coseismic surface displacement appeared east of the Northern Hovsgol Fault (NHF), where the displacement components were 18 cm, 5 cm, and 33 cm in the east-west, north-south, and up-down directions, respectively (precision: 1.7 cm, 20.4 cm, and 5.2 cm). However, the 3-D displacements indicated that although the earthquake induced a combination of normal faulting with strike slip motions, the displacements in the north-south direction had very large uncertainty owing to the similar geometry of the InSARs in the descending path. Later, we performed inversions of the DInSAR-measured coseismic surface displacement fields in the line-of-sight direction, which assumes a fault plane's uniform and distributed slips in analyzing the slip mechanism. We conducted slip distribution estimations on the ruptured fault plane in accordance with the optimal fault geometry and source parameters determined by the uniform slip model. Investigations revealed that, with a correlation of 95.3%, the simulated displacements from the best-fitted distributed slip model were consistent with the observed displacements from DInSARs. Besides, our slip distribution model showed two distinctive slip patches, which include differences in their magnitudes and directions on the fault plane. We also observed ruptured faults experiencing a predominant right-lateral strike slip with a significant dip slip, according to the slip distribution, which caused two distinct slips due to the dramatic bending of the fault strike. Then, by analyzing the Coulomb stress change, our findings proposed that the seismic risk potential of active faults in the Hovsgol Basin increased after the earthquake. Overall, the great potential of multi-track DInSAR observations in the identification of complex slip mechanisms was demonstrated.

TI  - Remote sensing of sea surface salinity: challenges and research directions
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinity is a key parameter that affects the surface, deep circulations, and heat transport of oceans. Sea surface salinity (SSS) represents the salinity at the ocean surface and impacts atmosphere - ocean interactions and vertical ocean circulation. To monitor SSS, three passive microwave radiometers with an L-band (1.4 GHz) have been launched since 2009. The scientific need for SSS retrieval and estimation has grown in recent years; however, the operational retrieval of SSS via satellite remote sensing still faces significant challenges. This study provides a review of satellite-based SSS retrieval methods and guidelines to encourage future research. This paper introduces satellite-derived SSS research trends and summarizes the representative SSS satellite sensors and their retrieval methods. The limitations and challenges of satellite-derived SSS are then discussed. The errors from the retrieval algorithms, discrepancies in the spatio-temporal scales of in situ and remote sensing, and limitations of the satellite-derived SSS are then detailed. Finally, our paper provides suggestions for the future directions of SSS remote sensing in five ways: mitigation of measurement errors, improvement of currently available SSS products, enhancement of the usage of in situ data, reconstruction of three-dimensional salinity information, and synergetic uses of multi-satellite missions.

TI  - Assessing Combinations of Landsat, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 Time series for Detecting Bark Beetle Infestations
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bark beetle infestations are among the most substantial forest disturbance agents worldwide. Moreover, as a consequence of global climate change, they have increased in frequency and in the size and number of affected areas. Controlling bark beetle outbreaks requires consistent operational monitoring, as is possible using satellite data. However, while many satellite-based approaches have been developed, the full potential of dense, multi-sensor time series has yet to be fully explored. Here, for the first time, we used all available multispectral data from Landsat and Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 SAR data, and combinations thereof to detect bark beetle infestations in the Bavarian Forest National Park. Based on a multi-year reference dataset of annual infested areas, we assessed the separability between healthy and infested forests for various vegetation indices calculated from the satellite data. We used two approaches to compute infestation probability time series from the different datasets: Bayesian conditional probabilities, based on the best-separating index from each satellite type, and random forest regression, based on all indices from each satellite type. Five different sensor configurations were tested for their detection capabilities: Landsat alone, Sentinel-1 alone, Sentinel-2 alone, Landsat and Sentinel-2 combined, and data from all satellite types combined. The best overall results in terms of spatial accuracy were achieved with Sentinel-2 (max. overall accuracy: 0.93). The detections of Sentinel-2 also were the closest to the onset of infestation estimated for each year. Sentinel-2 detected infested areas in larger contiguous patches with higher reliability compared to smaller patches. The results achieved with Landsat were somewhat inferior to those of Sentinel-2 (max. accuracy: 0.89). While yielding similar results, the combination of Landsat and Sentinel-2 did not provide any advantages over using Landsat or Sentinel-2 alone (max. accuracy: 0.87), while Sentinel-1 was unable to detect infested areas (max. accuracy: 0.62). The combined data of all three satellite types did not achieve satisfactory results either (max. accuracy: 0.67). Spatial accuracies were typically higher for Bayesian conditional probabilities than for random forest-derived probabilities, but the latter resulted in earlier detections. The approach presented herein provides a flexible disturbance detection pipeline well-suited for the monitoring of bark beetle outbreaks. Furthermore, it can also be applied to other disturbance types.

TI  - The essence of acquisition time of airborne hyperspectral and on-ground reference data for classification of highly invasive annual vine <i>Echinocystis lobata</i> (Michx.) Torr. & A. Gray
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive alien species are one of the biggest threats to biodiversity today. Identifying their locations are mandatory parts of the strategies being developed to control them. Remote sensing along with machine learning are already proven and effective tools for monitoring invasive species, especially trees, shrubs, and tall perennials. However, annual vine species are particularly difficult to map using remote sensing because of their dynamic plant growth and the movement of shoots during the growing season. Therefore, the phenological phase in which the data is acquired, and the synchronization of airborne data acquisition with on-ground reference data, may be key factors for correct plant classification. This research aimed to answer the following questions: (i) What is the impact of acquiring synchronized on-ground data and hyperspectral data in different phases of plants' phenological development on the annual vine IAPS (Invasive Alien Plant Species) classification results? (ii) How does the lack of synchronization while obtaining hyperspectral and on-ground data collection impact annual vine IAPS mapping results? (iii) Does multitemporal image fusion improve the results of annual vine IAPS classification? For this purpose, research was carried out on Echinocystis lobata, an annual vine species considered highly invasive in Europe. The obtained results indicate that the phenological phase in which the data is acquired has a very strong influence on the quality of the classification result. The period of flowering (summer) with the greatest coverage of the area with shoots was optimal for the classification of Echinocystis lobata with F1 classification accuracy of 0.87 +/- 0.04. The accuracy of classifications was significantly less for spring (F1 = 0.64 +/- 0.04) and autumn (F1 = 0.75 +/- 0.05). Obtaining on-ground reference data that is mismatched temporally with hyperspectral data causes a decrease in the accuracy of the result up to 0.08 (from F1 = 0.64 to 0.56) in relation to data obtained synchronously. In the multitemporal image fusion method, using hyperspectral data linked from different phases of plants' development to classify an image had a minimal improvement in classification accuracy compared to classifications trained on images from one phenological stage. The main conclusion is that mapping an annual vine using remote sensing and machine learning is possible and highly effective, provided the remote sensing and on-ground data are obtained in strict synchronization and the appropriate phenological phase. For the most efficient classification results, a single data acquisition per year is enough, even in the case of annual vine IAPS. Further research is needed to explore the possibility of mapping Echinocystis lobata using, i.e. multispectral or hyperspectral satellite data (e.g. EnMAP).

TI  - Assessing the impacts of land use/land cover changes on hydrological processes in Southern Ethiopia: The SWAT model approach
T2  - COGENT ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The change in land use and land cover (LULC) due to human activities is a major cause of hydrological process changes in watersheds. This study assesses the effects of LULC changes on the hydrological processes in the Bilate catchment, located in southern Ethiopia. Landsat images of 1986, 2002, and 2018 were used to classify LULC through supervised classification. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) evaluated the hydrological responses to LULC changes. Results indicate an increase in built-up areas (0.70%), water bodies (0.19%), cultivated land (10.54%), and barren land (1.265%) from 1986 to 2018. Conversely, the forest (8.52%) and grazing (3.18%) areas declined. An increase in water leaving the root zone (962.02 mm/year), potential evapotranspiration (593.85 mm/year), actual evapotranspiration (201.71 mm/year), and surface runoff (514.86 mm/year) was observed, while soil water content (1423.25 mm/year) decreased at the catchment level. The declining soil water content and increasing actual and potential evapotranspiration could result in a water shortage for crop production. The impact of LULC changes on hydrology provides vital knowledge for integrated LULC and water resource management. Water resource development planning must consider LULC changes to achieve sustainable development in the catchment.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT) and the surrounding piedmont alluvial region represent a zone of active deformation in the Indo-Gangetic plains. We investigated the Piedmont zone between the Ghaggar and Yamuna River basins in Haryana, India, for geomorphic signatures of active tectonics using remotely sensed data and validated by Geophysical Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys. The possible locations and the types of active tectonic features such as sub-surface fault, ridges, lineaments and warps were identified based on the presence of geomorphic signatures such as drainage gradient anomalies, abrupt change in flow direction, river offset, compressed meanders, paleochannels and topographic breaks. We used various optical satellite imageries to detect and map the temporal changes in the flow pattern of rivers in the study area. GPR investigations were done at selected test sites to locate and verify the continuity of subsurface fault. The GPR profiles were taken in the North-South direction using the common midpoint technique with 40 and 100 MHz antennae. Low frequency bi-static GPR scanning confirmed a number of dipping reflectors due to fault planes and warp surfaces in the study area. It is concluded that the piedmont zone of Haryana is actively deforming and could become a future seismic hazard zone.

TI  - A critical survey of GEOBIA methods for forest image detection and classification
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern earth observation sensors have revolutionized the remote sensing community by improving remote sensing image quality. However, Pixel-based image analysis methods have challenges in handling very high-resolution (VHR) imagery. Geographic Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) yielded promising results, but it is not inflexible in capturing domain experts' expressions, therefore geographic information system professionals shifted to ontologies for remote sensing science. This paper advocates for the adoption of knowledge representation using ontologies in remote sensing. To this end, a survey of GEOBIA studies for image analysis and classification is presented, and the limitations of existing methods in reaching the remote sensing expert-level expectation are clarified. New GEOBIA development techniques as well as opportunities for improving GEOBIA models have been looked into. Recent studies that adopted ontologies in forest image classification are analyzed and recommendations for the remote sensing science community are provided, to highlight the advantages of ontologies in interpreting satellite images.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy based on anatomical landmarks and locoregional mapping of inguinofemoral sentinel lymph nodes in women with vulval cancer: an operative technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on this subject? Inguinal sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in women with vulval cancer is often construed as a challenging skill to master and the success rate of SLN detection is dependent on the experience and skill of the surgeon. A review of the literature has revealed that whilst studies have largely concentrated on the efficacy of different intraoperative detection modalities or histopathological protocols, the literature describing a standardised surgical technique remains deficient. What do the results of this study add? Our technique offers multiple advantages: our incision, albeit small, allows the operator to gain access to 96.7% of inguinal SLNs and facilitates access to both deep and superficial SLNs regardless of patients' body mass index, minimises the need for extensive dissection and hence reduces the incidence of complications associated with overharvesting of lymph nodes such as lymphoedema or lymphocysts, particularly in obese women. Our local figures also support the safety of this operative technique (negative nodal recurrence rate 1.7%) and compare favourably with those from the GROINSS-V study. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? We describe a reproducible technique based on anatomical landmarks and an appreciation of the territorial mapping of inguinal SLN to optimise the chances of identifying the inguinal SLN in women with vulval cancer while circumventing the sequelae often attributed to this procedure.Inguinal lymph node involvement is the most robust predictor of mortality in vulval cancer and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a safe diagnostic modality. We describe a technique based on anatomical landmarks. Our aims are (1) to describe the territorial mapping of SLNs, (2) to evaluate the associated complication rate vis-a-vis those reported in the literature, and (3) to assess its accuracy in detecting SLNs. Data from women who underwent groin SLN biopsies for vulval cancer at a single cancer centre were prospectively collected. All subjects met the GROINSS-V eligibility criteria. The location of the SLN relative to the saphenous vein was recorded. All women were followed up and early and late complications were recorded. The recurrence rate at the time of the census was calculated. A total of 71 groins in 44 women were included. The SLN was primarily located over Cloquet's node (85.2%). The incidence of early wound cellulitis and dehiscence were 2.8% and 11.3% while lymphocysts were present in 11.3% of groins. The negative nodal recurrence rate was 1.7%. Results showed that this reproducible technique allows access to 96.7% of SLNs, including both deep and superficial SLNs whilst minimising the need for extensive dissection and complications associated with overharvesting of lymph nodes.

TI  - Contemporary and historical detection of small lakes using super resolution Landsat imagery: promise and peril
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat is the longest-running environmental satellite program and has been used for surface water mapping since its launch in 1972. However, its sustained 30 m resolution since 1982 prohibits the detection of small water bodies, which are globally far more prevalent than large. Remote sensing image resolution is increasingly being enhanced through single image super resolution (SR), a machine learning task typically performed by neural networks. Here, we show that a 10x SR model (Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network, or ESRGAN) trained entirely with Planet SmallSat imagery (3 m resolution) improves the detection of small and sub-pixel lakes in Landsat imagery (30 m) and produces images (3 m resolution) with preserved radiometric properties. We test the utility of these Landsat SR images for small lake detection by applying a simple water classification to SR and original Landsat imagery and comparing their lake counts, sizes, and locations with independent, high-resolution water maps made from coincident airborne camera imagery. SR images appear realistic and have fewer missed detections (type II error) compared to low resolution (LR), but exhibit errors in lake location and shape, and yield increasing false detections (type I error) with decreasing lake size. Even so, lakes between similar to 500 and similar to 10,000 m(2) in area are better detected with SR than with native-resolution Landsat 8 imagery. SR transformation achieves an F-1 score for water detection of 0.75 compared to 0.73 from native resolution Landsat. We conclude that SR enhancement improves the detection of small lakes sized several Landsat pixels or less, with a minimum mapping unit (MMU) of similar to 2/3 of a Landsat pixel - a significant improvement from previous studies. We also apply the SR model to a historical Landsat 5 image and find similar performance gains, using an independent 1985 air photo map of 242 small Alaskan lakes. This demonstration of retroactively generated 3 m imagery dating to 1985 has exciting applications beyond water detection and paves the way for further SR land cover classification and small object detection from the historical Landsat archive. However, we caution that the approach presented is suitable for landscape-scale inventories of lake counts and lake size distributions, but not for specific geolocational positions of individual lakes. Much work remains to be done surrounding technical and ethical guidelines for the creation, use, and dissemination of SR satellite imagery.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Inventory and kinematics of active and transitional rock glaciers in the Southern Alps of New Zealand from Sentinel-1 InSAR
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we inventoried and mapped the active and transitional rock glaciers in the central part of the Southern Alps, New Zealand, using Sentinel-1 InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) data. We used forty-three interferograms acquired between 2015 and 2019 with time intervals between six days and two years along with orthoimage analyses. A total of 123 rock glaciers were identified, of which 40 are active; that is, displaying velocities higher than 10 cm/yr. The remaining landforms are considered transitional. Among the complete sample of rock glaciers inventoried, 9 may also be interpreted as debris-covered glacierets. The number of inventoried landforms is low compared to what is observed in other similar mountain ranges, such as the European Alps. We explain this by the reduced vertical extent of the periglacial belt and the generally steep topography often not favorable for rock glacier development. Additionally, the motion rates appear relatively low. We hypothesize that a mean annual air temperature at the rock glacier locations well above 0 degrees C is the main reason for this. These conditions may have resulted in significant ground ice melt. Rock glaciers in the Southern Alps are thus in an inactivation phase, which is expressed by typical morphologies such as stable fronts.

TI  - Mapping lava flow from the Kilauea eruption of 2018 in the east rift zone using space-based synthetic aperture radar
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lava flows from volcanoes can significantly destroy infrastructure, although they rarely threaten human life. Mapping lava flows is essential to managing the volcanic hazard during eruptions and understanding significant changes in geomorphology after eruptions. In 2018, the eruption of Kilauea, Hawaii's youngest and most active volcano, destroyed more than 700 homes, farmlands, and roads. Active lava flow tracking is crucial for providing timely warnings to evacuate residents and protect infrastructure. We constructed a map of the lava flow in the East Rift Zone (ERZ) during the Kilauea volcanic eruption in 2018 using remotely sensed satellite synthetic aperture radar observations. We processed 23 C-band Sentinel-1 A/B interferometric wide mode acquisitions captured from May 1 to 17 September 2018 and applied a coherent change detection (CCD) technique to detect minute changes in the target structure. A time series of coherence maps provided detailed spatial information on the movement of the lava flow fields in the ERZ. The overall lava flow map had an area of approximately 33.3 km(2) and was verified with a lava thickness map provided by the United States Geological Survey that was generated by two digital elevation models using airborne light detection and ranging observations. Excellent agreement (>90%) among the lava flow observations suggests that the CCD technique is effective in monitoring lava flows during a volcanic eruption.

TI  - Evaluating the potential of burn severity mapping and transferability of Copernicus EMS data using Sentinel-2 imagery and machine learning approaches
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The abiotic and biotic conditions in forest ecosystems can be significantly influenced by forest fires. However, difficulties in policy decisions for restoration inevitably occur in the absence of information on the damaged forests, such as location, area, and burn severity. In this study, eight spectral indices calculated from Sentinel 2 MSI imagery and machine learning algorithms (Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) were used for mapping burned areas and severity. Two study sites with similar meteorological environment (dry season) and species (coniferous vegetation) were tested, and dataset (EMSR448) from Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) was used as the reference truth. RF showed better performance for classifying pixels from classes with similar properties than SVM. Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) showed high importance in assessing fire severity suggesting that it may be effective for identifying senescent plants. The results also confirmed that the CEMS dataset has transferability as a reference truth for fire damage classification in other regions. Implementation of this method enables fast and accurate mapping of the area and severity of destructive damage by forest fires, and also has applicability for other disasters.

TI  - Applicability study of four atmospheric correction methods in the remote sensing of lake water color
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the complexity of spectral characteristics for inland lake water, high-precision atmospheric correction methods play an essential role in remote sensing. This research conducted atmospheric correction on the Tiande lake zone in Zhengzhou, China based on Zhuhai-1, Sentinel-2, Planet, and GF-2 images using four methods (QUAC, Dark Subtract, Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) and 6S). In doing so, water reflectance can be extracted and compared with the data measured from a ground-based spectrometer. The analysis indicates that the FLAASH method has best applicability to Zhuhai-1 and Sentinel-2 images; while 6S method shows best applicability to Planet and GF-2 images. The comparison of single-band images indicates that the four atmospheric correction approaches used in different images are proven to be applicable to construction of sensitive wavebands of a water body inversion model in the Tiande lake zone. The correction results of four types of images prove that FLAASH and 6S are more applicable to lake water color remote sensing inversion.

TI  - Differentiating effects of salvage logging and recovery patterns on post-fire boreal forests in Northeast China using a modified forest disturbance index
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are resilient to a range of disturbances, but combinations of severe natural and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g. wildfire and logging) may inhibit forest recovery and lead to forest degradation. Recent studies have explored long-term forest-disturbance detection and forest-recovery dynamics by using free and open-access remote-sensing images. However, mapping consecutive multiple disturbance agents is challenging using existing automated change-detection algorithms because the reduced canopy reflectance and the smoothing of consecutive disturbance signals mean that the initial disturbance cannot be spectrally separated from the second disturbance. Furthermore, uncertainty remains about post-disturbance vegetation dynamics and the effects of forest recovery under the interaction of burn severity, biological-legacy management, and active forest restoration (i.e. artificial regeneration and assisted natural regeneration). This contributes to biases in long-term forest-recovery monitoring, which are not conducive to the guidance of post-fire vegetation recovery. Here, we propose a modified disturbance index to separate the spectral characteristics of fire and forest logging using normalized tasseled-cap components (brightness and wetness) and detect the spatiotemporal distribution of post-fire logging by means of an index threshold and image differencing. On this basis, the recovery patterns of the post-fire forest are differentiated by considering the cumulative effect of fire, post-fire logging, and recovery approaches. The method is tested in the burn areas of the 5.6 Fire in the Greater Hinggan Mountain area (the largest forest fire in recorded history in China), giving an overall accuracy of 85% in post-fire forest logging mapping. Our results confirm that biological legacies (i.e. trees, logs, and snags) were removed across many areas in the fire, with activities peaking in the second year after the fire and located chiefly in areas of moderate and high burn severity. By identifying post-fire logging, the fluctuation and high disturbance index of the conventional temporal trajectory in the early stage of forest recovery are explained. The large-scale salvage logging slowed the recovery of the post-fire forest ecosystem and influenced the recovery process through the interaction of burn severity and active forest restoration. In areas of high burn severity, assisted natural regeneration (i.e. natural regeneration with artificial aids such as clearing the snags, weeding, digging pits, and supplemental planting) preserved biological legacies and achieved a higher proportion of forest recovery, second only to non-logged areas where natural regeneration (i.e. forestry recovering naturally without any artificial intervention) occurred. By contrast, salvage logging followed by artificial regeneration (i.e. clear-cutting all dead or damaged trees followed by tree planting or artificial seeding) hindered vegetation recovery in the early stage, but it improved the recovery rate in years 10-20 and approached the recovery proportion of non-logged areas where natural regeneration occurred as the recovery progressed and habitat conditions improved. The proposed method is shown to offer important advantages in detecting post-fire salvage logging, and it provides improved guidance for forest managers in developing strategies for forest recovery.

TI  - Downscaling inversion of GRACE-derived groundwater storage changes based on ensemble learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data monitors changes in terrestrial water storage, including groundwater, at a regional scale. However, the coarse spatial resolution limits its applicability to small watershed areas. This study introduces a novel ensemble learning-based model using meteorological and topographical data to enhance spatial resolution. The effectiveness was evaluated using groundwater-level observation data from the Henan rainstorm-affected area in July 2021. The factors influencing Groundwater Storage Anomalies (GWSA) were explored using Permutation Importance (PI) and other methods. The results demonstrate that feature engineering and Blender ensemble learning improve downscaling accuracy; the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) can be reduced by up to 18.95%. Furthermore, Blender ensemble learning decreased the RMSE by 3.58%, achieving an R-Square (R-2) value of 0.7924. Restricting the downscaling inversion to June-August data greatly enhanced the accuracy, as evidenced by a holdout dataset test with an R-2 value of 0.8247. The overall GWSA variation from January to August exhibited 'slow rise, slow fall, sharp fall, and sharp rise.' Additionally, heavy rain exhibits a lag effect on the groundwater supply. Meteorological and topographical factors drive fluctuations in GWSA values and changes in spatial distribution. Human activities also have a significant impact.

TI  - Soil erosion assessment by RUSLE model using remote sensing and GIS in an arid zone
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, we used the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and Geographical Information System (GIS) to predict the annual rate of soil loss in the District Chakwal of Pakistan. The parameters of the RUSLE model were estimated using remote sensing data, and the erosion probability zones were determined using GIS. The estimated length slope (LS), crop management (C), rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), and support practice (P) range from 0-68,227, 0-66.61%, 0-0.58, 495.99-648.68 MJ/mm.t.ha(-1) .year(-1), 0.15-0.25 MJ/mm.t.ha(-1) .year(-1), and 1 respectively. The results indicate that the estimated total annual potential soil loss of approximately 4,67,064.25 t.ha(-1).year(-1) is comparable with the measured sediment loss of 11,631 t.ha(-1).year(-1) during the water year 2020. The predicted soil erosion rate due to an increase in agricultural area is approximately 164,249.31 t.ha(-1).year(-1). In this study, we also used Landsat imagery to rapidly achieve actual land use classification. Meanwhile, 38.13% of the region was threatened by very high soil erosion, where the quantity of soil erosion ranged from 365487.35 t.ha(-1).year(-1). Integrating GIS and remote sensing with the RUSLE model helped researchers achieve their final objectives. Land-use planners and decision-makers use the result's spatial distribution of soil erosion in District Chakwal for conservation and management planning.

TI  - Extracting subpixel vegetation NDVI time series for evaluating the mixed pixel effect on GPP estimation in urban areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is the most widely used vegetation index for monitoring vegetation vigor and cover. As NDVI time series are usually derived at coarse or medium spatial resolutions, pixel size often represents a mixture of vegetated and non-vegetated surfaces. In heterogeneous urban areas, mixed pixels impede the accurate estimation of gross primary productivity (GPP). To address the mixed pixel effect on NDVI time series and GPP estimation, we proposed a framework to extract subpixel vegetation NDVI (NDVIvege) from Landsat OLI images in urban areas, using endmember fractions, mixed NDVI (NDVImix), and NDVI of non-vegetation endmembers. Results demonstrated that the NDVIvege extracted by this framework agreed well with the true NDVIvege cross seasons and vegetation fractions, with R-2 ranging from 0.74 to 0.82 and RMSE ranging from 0.03 to 0.04. The NDVIvege time series was applied to evaluate vegetation GPP in Wuhan, China. The total annual GPP estimated with NDVIvege was 28-35% higher than the total annual GPP estimated with NDVImix, implying uncertainty in the GPP estimations caused by mixed pixels. This study showed the potential of the proposed framework to resolve NDVIvege for characterizing vegetation dynamics in heterogeneous areas.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of remotely sensed phenology and their response to climate change and topography in subtropical bamboo forests during 2001-2017: a case study in Zhejiang Province, China
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology has long been adapted to environmental change and is highly sensitive to climate change. Shifts in phenology also affect feedbacks of vegetation to environmental factors such as topography and climate by influencing spatiotemporal fluctuations in productivity, carbon fixation, and the carbon water cycle. However, there are limited studies which explores the combined effects of the climate and terrain on phenology. Bamboo forests exhibit the outstanding phenological phenomena and play an important role in maintaining global carbon balance in climate change. Therefore, the interaction mechanisms of climate and topography on bamboo forest phenology were analyzed in Zhejiang Province, China during 2001-2017. The partial least squares path model was applied to clarify the interplay between the climate and terrain impacts on phenology under land cover/use change. The results revealed that the average start date of the growing season (SOS) significantly advanced by 0.81 days annually, the end date of the growing season (EOS) was delayed by 0.27 days annually, and the length of the growing season (LOS) increased by 1.08 days annually. There were obvious spatial differences in the partial correlation coefficients between the climate factors and phenological metrics. Although the SOS, EOS and LOS were affected by different climatic factors, precipitation was the dominant factor. Due to the sensitivity of the SOS and EOS to precipitation, a 100 mm increase in regional annual precipitation would cause the average SOS to advance by 0.18 days and the EOS to be delayed by 0.12 days. Regarding the terrain factors affecting climate conditions, there were clear differences in the influences of different altitudes, slopes and aspect gradients on bamboo forest phenology. This study further showed that topographic factors mainly affected the interannual variations in phenological metrics under land cover/use change by affecting precipitation. This study clarified the spatial pattern of bamboo forest phenology and the interactive mechanisms between vegetative phenology and environmental conditions, as this information is crucial in assessing the impact of phenological change on the carbon sequestration potential of bamboo forests.

TI  - Effectiveness evaluation of DS-InSAR method fused PS points in surface deformation monitoring: a case study of Hongta District, Yuxi City, China
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - InSAR technology provides a powerful tool for detecting large-scale surface deformation. In particular, the newly developed DS-InSAR method fused PS points has obvious advantages in monitoring bare land and vegetation covered areas, but at present, there is a lack of effectiveness evaluation of this method. Therefore, this paper takes Hongta District of Yuxi City as an example. The 29 scenes sentinel-1A data from January 2019 to December 2019 were processed and analyzed using the DS-InSAR method fused PS points. The research results show that the position and deformation trend of the inversion results of the three methods are highly consistent, the correlation between DS-InSAR method fused PS points and PS- InSAR and SBAS-InSAR methods is 0.9473 and 0.8583, respectively. But the spatial density of the measurement points (MPs) obtained by the DS-InSAR method of PS points is 11 times and 4 times that of the PS-InSAR method and SBAS-InSAR method respectively. It clearly shows that DS-InSAR method fused PS points has greater advantages than PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR methods in deformation mapping displacement, because the MPs density is higher. It is conducive to the detailed analysis of the spatio-temporal characteristics and deformation mechanism of deformation.

TI  - Local climate zone mapping using remote sensing: a synergetic use of daytime multi-view Ziyuan-3 stereo imageries and Luojia-1 nighttime light data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The local climate zone (LCZ) scheme has been widely utilized in regional climate modeling, urban planning, and thermal comfort investigations. However, existing LCZ classification methods face challenges in characterizing complex urban structures and human activities involving local climatic environments. In this study, we proposed a novel LCZ mapping method that fully uses space-borne multi-view and diurnal observations, i.e. daytime Ziyuan-3 stereo imageries (2.1 m) and Luojia-1 nighttime light (NTL) data (130 m). Firstly, we performed land cover classification using multiple machine learning methods (i.e. random forest (RF) and XGBoost algorithms) and various features (i.e. spectral, textural, multi-view features, 3D urban structure parameters (USPs), and NTL). In addition, we developed a set of new cumulative elevation indexes to improve building roughness assessments. The indexes can estimate building roughness directly from fused point clouds generated by both along- and across-track modes. Finally, based on the land cover and building roughness results, we extracted 2D and 3D USPs for different land covers and used multi-classifiers to perform LCZ mapping. The results for Beijing, China, show that our method yielded satisfactory accuracy for LCZ mapping, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 90.46%. The overall accuracy of land cover classification using 3D USPs generated from both along- and across-track modes increased by 4.66%, compared to that of using the single along-track mode. Additionally, the OA value of LCZ mapping using 2D and 3D USPs (88.18%) achieved a better result than using only 2D USPs (83.83%). The use of NTL data increased the classification accuracy of LCZs E (bare rock or paved) and F (bare soil or sand) by 6.54% and 3.94%, respectively. The refined LCZ classification achieved through this study will not only contribute to more accurate regional climate modeling but also provide valuable guidance for urban planning initiatives aimed at enhancing thermal comfort and overall livability in urban areas. Ultimately, this study paves the way for more comprehensive and effective strategies in addressing the challenges posed by urban microclimates.

TI  - Reconstruction of a large-scale realistic three-dimensional (3-D) mountain forest scene for radiative transfer simulations
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The realistic three-dimensional (3D) forest scene is an important input to 3D radiative transfer simulations, which are essential for analyzing the reflective properties of forest canopies. Previous studies utilized the voxel as an essential element to reconstruct the 3D forest scene, while they mainly focused on the small flattened areas and ignored the wood components. This study introduces a novel approach for reconstructing a realistic 3D mountain forest scene by incorporating branches into the voxel crown. To determine the optimal voxel size for simulating Bidirectional Reflectance Functions (BRFs) in a temperate deciduous mountain forest, this study reconstructed the forest scene using eight different voxel sizes, ranging from 30 to 100 cm with a step of 10 cm. Two forest scenes were examined to evaluate the impact of branches on radiative transfer simulations: one with branch voxel-based scenes and one without branches. The radiative transfer simulation is conducted using an efficient Monte Carlo path-tracing algorithm and has been implemented in the LargE-Scale remote sensing data and image Simulation framework (LESS) model, facilitating high-quality, large-scale simulations of forested environments. The finding revealed that the optimal voxel size for simulating BRFs in 30 m resolution is approximately 90 cm, smaller than the 100 cm used in flat areas. This study emphasized the significant impact of branches on the BRF simulations and underscored their critical role in scene reconstruction. The impact of branches is two-fold: branches themselves increase the simulated BRFs, whereas their shadows decrease them. Moreover, the effects of branches and their shadows decrease as the voxel size increases. The simulated spectral albedo exhibits maximum deviations of 0.71% and 1.04% in the red and NIR wavebands, respectively, while remaining below 0.2% in the blue waveband. Furthermore, the study suggests that if the precise branch architecture is unknown, constructing branches of the first generation is recommended to achieve better results. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the proposed scene achieves greater accuracy and robustness when compared to both the ellipsoid-based and the boundary-based scenes. The finding of this study can help researchers to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving the reflective properties of forest canopies, which can inform future studies and improve the accuracy of forest monitoring and ecological modeling.

TI  - Future variation of land surface temperature in the Yangtze River Basin based on CMIP6 model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, past changes in global and regional land surface temperatures (LST) have been well studied, however, future LST changes have been largely ignored owing to data limitations. In this study, three climate variables of CMIP6, namely air temperature (AT), precipitation (Pre), and leaf area index (LAI), were spatially corrected using the Delta downscaling method. On this basis, by combining MODIS LST, elevation, slope and aspect, a random forest (RF) model was built to calculate the LST from 2022 to 2100. The absolute variability (AV) and Mann-Kendall (M-K) tests were used to quantitatively detect interannual and seasonal LST changes in different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios. The results showed that the AV value increased successively from SSP1-2.6 to SSP2-4.5 and then to SSP5-8.5. Compared with the base period (2003-2021), the increment in interannual, spring, summer and autumn LST during 2022-2100 was mainly between 1 and 2 & DEG;C under three scenarios. The interannual and seasonal LST were spatially characterized by significant warming over large areas, and the increasing was the fastest under SSP5-8.5. These results indicate that, in the future, LST will increase further over large areas, especially in winter.

M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST), especially day-night LST difference (LSTd - LSTn), is a key variable for the stability of terrestrial ecosystems, affected by vegetation and climate change. Quantifying the contribution and feedback of vegetation and climate to LST changes is critical to developing mitigation strategies. Based on LST, Normalized vegetation index (NDVI), land use (LU), air temperature (AT) and precipitation (Pre) from 2003 to 2021, partial correlation was used to analyze the response of LST to vegetation and climate. The feedback and contribution of both to LST were further quantified by using spatial linear relationships and partial derivatives analysis. The results showed that both interannual LST (LSTy) and LSTd - LSTn responded negatively to vegetation, and vegetation had a negative feedback effect in areas with significantly altered. Vegetation was also a major contributor to the decline of LSTd - LSTn. With the advantage of positive partial correlation area of 94.99%, AT became the main driving factor and contributor to LSTy change trend. Pre contributed negatively to both LSTy and LSTd - LSTn, with contributions of -0.004 degrees C/y and -0.022 degrees C/ y, respectively. AT played a decisive role in LST warming of YRB, which was partially mitigated by vegetation and Pre. The present research contributed to the detection of LST changes and improved understanding of the driving mechanism.

TI  - Ship detection and classification based on cascaded detection of hull and wake from optical satellite remote sensing imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote-sensing provides a cost- and time-effective tool for ship monitoring at sea. Most existing approaches focused on extraction of ship locations using either hull or wake. In this paper, a method of cascaded detection of ship hull and wake was proposed to locate and classify ships using high-resolution satellite imagery. Candidate hulls were fast located through phase spectrum of Fourier transform. A hull refining module was then executed to acquire accurate shapes of candidate hull. False alarms were removed through the shape features and textures of candidate hulls. The probability that a candidate hull is determined as a real one increased with the presence of wakes. After true ships were determined, ship classification was conducted using a fuzzy classifier combining both hull and wake information. The proposed method was implemented to Gaofen-1 panchromatic and multispectral (PMS) imagery and showed good performance for ship detection with recall, precision, overall accuracy, and specificity of 90.1%, 88.1%, 98.8%, and 99.3%, respectively, better than other state-of-the-art coarse-to-fine ship detection methods. Ship classification was successfully achieved for ships with detected wakes. The accuracy of correct classification was 83.8% while the proportion of false classification was 1.0%. Factors influencing the accuracy of the developed method, including texture features and classifiers combination and key parameters of the method, were also discussed.

TI  - Geomorphological transformations and future deformation estimations of a large potential landslide in the high-order position area of Diexi, China
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides in high-order position areas pose a serious threat to residents located below such areas. Therefore, research on the evolution process and underlying dynamic mechanisms is crucial. The majority of relevant studies are based on landslides that have already occurred; however, the investigation of potential landslides is of higher value. In this study, a progressive potential landslide identification method is proposed with the application of SBAS-InSAR (Small Baseline Subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) and subsequently combined with Google Earth, GF-1 (Gaofen-1), GF-2 (Gaofen-2), ZY-3 (Ziyuan-3) and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) imagery, and DEM (Digital Elevation Model) for further validation. The proposed method is employed to determine the potential landslide in Tuanjiecun by integrating the multi-period data to simultaneously analyze the evolution and mechanism of the potential landslide. The long short-term memory method is then adopted to predict the evolution trend based on accumulative deformation from SBAS-InSAR. The results suggest that the deformation of Tuanjiecun potential landslide will increase to -238.57 mm. This article provides a new approach for disaster prevention and mitigation by determining a potential landslide using composite remote sensing and predicting the development of the potential landslide on indirect contact monitoring.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring of surface water areas of nine plateau lakes in Yunnan Province using long time-series Landsat imagery based on the Google Earth Engine platform
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are sensitive to both climate change and human activities, especially in the Yungui Plateau zone. As the main supply of water sources, surface water has a significant impact on environment, ecological balance and socioeconomic development. However, it is unclear how the surface water areas (SWAs) of the nine Yunnan Plateau lakes (NYPLs) have changed over previous decades. In this study, the SWAs of the NYPLs were first extracted using the optimal water index (WI) based on Landsat remote sensing images and the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Then, a spatiotemporal variation analysis of the SWAs was carried out for the NYPLs from 1988 to 2021. Finally, the correlations between the SWA changes in each lake, climatic factors and human activities were analysed. We found that the total SWAs of the NYPL have remained stable over the past 30 years, reaching a maximum of 1,012.51 km(2) in 2000 and a minimum of 972.94 km(2) in 2015. From 1988 to 2015, the overall SWAs of the NYPLs fluctuated steadily within 1%. However, Lakes Qilu and Yilong shrunk significantly in 2015. Generally, the SWAs of the NYPLs during the rainy season were larger than during the dry season; however, there were some differences between each period. The seasonal change in the SWAs was approximately 10 km(2) in 1991, 1994, and 2003, but was relatively less in other years. Precipitation was a direct factor, whereas temperature and evaporation were indirect factors influencing the intra- and inter-annual SWAs of the NYPLs. The changes in the SWAs of the NYPLs were consistent with the precipitation trend and were negatively correlated with changes in temperature and evaporation. Evaporation had more of an influence on shallow lakes than on deep-water lakes. Human activities led to significant changes in individual lakes (such as lakes Dianchi, Yilong, and Qilu). The NYPLs had a spatially heterogeneous response to regional climate change caused by both global climate change and human activities. The results of this study can provide a data reference and decision support for the scientific management of the ecological environment of the Yunnan Plateau lakes.

TI  - Mapping bedrock with vegetation spectral features using time series Sentinel-2 images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation hinders the acquisition of bedrock spectra and makes it difficult to classify bedrock with remote sensing data. Previous studies indicated bedrock can control vegetation growth through soluble nutrients and water-holding capacity. However, the potential of using vegetation spectral features to map bedrock has been rarely explored. This study first derived reflectance and vegetation indices from time series Sentinel-2 products, then did a spatiotemporal analysis of vegetation spectral features on different bedrock, and finally combined vegetation features and random forest classifiers to map bedrock. The results demonstrated that (a) the close relationship between vegetation growth and bedrock can be captured by Sentinel-2 images; (b) both VIs' combination and reflectance derived from the growing season can achieve reasonably classified maps, with classification accuracies of 70.06% and 73.46%, respectively; (c) NDVI was more sensitive to the bedrock than other VIs. Overall, vegetation spectral features showed great potential to map bedrock underneath vegetation.

TI  - Mapping soil organic matter content using Sentinel-2 synthetic images at different time intervals in Northeast China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping soil organic matter (SOM) content has become an important application of digital soil mapping. In this study, we processed all Sentinel-2 images covering the bare-soil period (March to June) in Northeast China from 2019 to 2022 and integrated the observation results into synthetic materials with four defined time intervals (10, 15, 20, and 30 d). Then, we used synthetic images corresponding to different time periods to conduct SOM mapping and determine the optimal time interval and time period before finally assessing the impacts of adding environmental covariates. The results showed the following: (1) in SOM mapping, the highest accuracy was obtained using day-of-year (DOY) 120 to 140 synthetic images with 20 d time intervals, as well as with different time intervals, ranked as follows: 20 d > 30 d > 15 d > 10 d; (2) when using synthetic images at different time intervals to predict SOM, the best time period for predicting SOM was always within May; and (3) adding environmental covariates effectively improved the SOM mapping performance, and the multiyear average temperature was the most important factor. In general, our results demonstrated the valuable potential of SOM mapping using multiyear synthetic imagery, thereby allowing detailed mapping of large areas of cultivated soil.

TI  - Investigating the seasonal dynamics of surface water over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using Sentinel-1 imagery and a novel gated multiscale ConvNet
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface water in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) region has undergone dramatic changes in recent decades. To capture dynamic surface water information, many satellite imagery-based methods have been proposed. However, these methods are still limited in terms of automation and accuracy and thus prevent surface water dynamic studies in large-scale QTP regions. In this study, we developed a new fully automatic method for accurate surface water mapping by using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and convolutional networks (ConvNets). Specifically, we built a new multiscale ConvNet structure to improve the model capability in surface water body extraction. Moreover, a gating mechanism is introduced to promote the efficient use of multiscale information. According to the accuracy assessment, the proposed gated multiscale ConvNet (GMNet) achieved the highest overall accuracy of 98.07%. We applied our GMNet for monthly surface water mapping on the QTP; accordingly, we found that the QTP region experienced significant surface water fluctuations over one year. The surface water also showed distinct spatial heterogeneity on the QTP; that is, the surface water fraction of the Inner Tibetan Basin was significantly higher than that of the Mekong Basin in both the wet and dry seasons.

TI  - Reconstruction of spatially continuous time-series land subsidence based on PS-InSAR and improved MLS-SVR in Beijing Plain area
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Beijing has undergone severe settlement in recent years. Persistent Scatterers Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) technique has been widely used to derive time-series land deformation. However, existing studies have faced two challenges: (1) the nonlinear characteristics of time-series subsidence has not been fully investigated; (2) since PS points are normally distributed in urban areas with high building density, measurement gaps usually exist in nonurban areas. To address the challenges, we presented a new method to reconstruct spatially continuous time-series deformation. First, PS-InSAR was used to retrieve the deformation based on 135 scenes of Envisat ASAR and Radarsat-2 images from 2003 to 2020. Polynomial Curve Fitting (PCF) was then used to model nonlinear time-series deformation for the PS points. In the PS measurement gaps, Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) and Multi-output Least Squares Support Vector Regression (MLS-SVR) were used to estimate the PCF coefficients and then time-series deformation considering 40 features including thickness of the compressible layers, annual groundwater level, etc. The major results showed that (1) compared to linear, quadratic, and quartic models, cubic polynomial model generated better fit for the time-series deformation (R-2 & AP;0.99), suggesting obvious nonlinear temporal pattern of deformation; (2) the time-series deformation over measurement gaps reconstructed by ISODATA and MLS-SVR had satisfactory accuracy (R-2 = 0.92, MAPE < 15%) and yielded higher accuracy (R-2 = 0.947) than IDW (R-2 = 0.687) and Ordinary Kriging (R-2 = 0.688) interpolation methods. The reconstructed results maintain the nonlinear characteristics and ensure the high spatial resolution (120 m) of time-series deformation. Among the 40 predictor variables, ground water level datasets are the most influential predictors of time-series deformation.

TI  - Challenges for chlorophyll-a remote sensing in a highly variable turbidity estuary, an implementation with sentinel-2
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal waters have high ecological and economic relevance and are globally threatened by intense human activities leading to eutrophication. The decameter resolution of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (S2-MSI) provides an advantage to detect spatially heterogeneous phenomena that are limited in extent, such as harmful cyanobacterial blooms (cyanoHABs). Chlorophyll-a is typically used in remote sensing of blooms; however, it remains to be evaluated in several coastal regions of the world. The Rio de la Plata estuary (South America) provides a key case study due to its highly variable concentrations of suspended sediments, and the increasing frequency of cyanoHABs. Here, we evaluate the potential and limitations of S2-MSI indices to retrieve chlorophyll-a in these optically complex waters, obtaining regional algorithms and comparing them to previously available ones. We propose an approach to follow the evolution of chlorophyll-a thresholds (10 and 24 mu g/L) that can contribute to monitoring programs and early warning strategies of cyanoHABs.

TI  - Enhancing the predictive performance of remote sensing for ecological variables of tidal flats using encoded features from a deep learning model
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats are among the ecologically richest areas of the world where sediment composition (e.g. median grain size and silt content) and the macrozoobenthic presence play an important role in the health of the ecosystem. Regular monitoring of environmental and ecological variables is essential for sustainable management of the area. While monitoring based on field sampling is very time-consuming, the predictive performance of these variables using satellite images is low due to the spectral homogeneity over these regions. We tested a novel approach that uses features from a variational autoencoder (VAE) model to enhance the predictive performance of remote sensing images for environmental and ecological variables of tidal flats. The model was trained using the Sentinel-2 spectral bands to reproduce the input images, and during this process, the VAE model represents important information on the tidal flats within its layer structure. The information in the layers of the trained model was extracted to form features with identical spatial coverage to the spectral bands. The features and the spectral bands together form the input to random forest models to predict field observations of the sediment characteristics such as median grain size and silt content, as well as the macrozoobenthic biomass and species richness. The maximum prediction accuracy of feature-based maps was close to 62% for the sediment characteristics and 37% for benthic fauna indices. The encoded features improved the prediction accuracy of the random forest regressor model by 15% points on average in comparison to using just the spectral bands. Our method enhances the predictive performance of remote sensing, in particular the spatiotemporal dynamics in median grain size and silt content of the sediment thereby contributing to better-informed management of coastal ecosystems.

TI  - A new four-stage approach based on normalized vegetation indices for detecting and mapping sugarcane hail damage using multispectral remotely sensed data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Hailstorms have increased in frequency and intensity over the past decade causing substantial losses in agriculture. Since hailstorms often hit a wide area with no detectable pattern, relying on traditional field-based methods to assess crop damage is difficult. The aim of this study was to develop and test a new four-stage normalized vegetation index approach for detecting the severity of hailstorm damage on sugarcane plants in a large estate in south eastern Zimbabwe. The following six spectral indices were computed for the period before and after a hailstorm event to assess the extent of hailstorm damage on sugarcane: Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI); Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Normalized Difference Senescent Vegetation Index (NDSVI); Red Edge Chlorophyll Index (RECI); Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI); and Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI2). Then, the spectral differences were computed for each index separately and the difference maps are reported as delta (& UDelta;) indices. The results of this study show that within one week and even two weeks after a hailstorm, & UDelta;NDTI, & UDelta;NDVI and & UDelta;RECI were consistently able to detect and characterise the severity of sugarcane damage. When used in partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), & UDelta;NDTI performed best in mapping the severity of crop damage throughout the large estate. & UDelta;NDTI was able to discriminate three different levels of sugarcane damage with an overall accuracy of 90% and a Kappa value of 0.85. Combined these results imply that & UDelta;NDTI computed using multi-spectral datasets within a fortnight after a hailstorm is a promising tool for generating reliable information about the severity of sugarcane damage by hailstorms. Such spatially explicit information is useful for creating customised crop insurance packages sensitive to damage incurred by the farmer.

TI  - Monitoring of Carbon Monoxide (CO) changes in the atmosphere and urban environmental indices extracted from remote sensing images for 932 Iran cities from 2019 to 2021
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon Monoxide (CO) is an important urban pollutant with a relation to transition economies based on emission intensities. In this study, Sentinel-5, MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Landsat-8 images were used to investigate the variations of CO and urban environmental indices and the correlations between them. From the assessed correlations for 932 Iranian cities, it occurred that the assessed indices were all correlated. The highest CO levels were 0.031 in the spring of 2019 and 2020, whereas in 2021 it was equal to 0.030 in both the spring and winter, respectively. In 2019 and 2020 the maximum values of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) in the spring were 0.181 and 0.183. Exceptionally high Absorbing Aerosol Index (AAI) values of - 0.834 and - 1.0, along with Urban Index (UI) of 0.102 and 0.092, were correlated with recorded spikes in CO level, despite that these seasons' EVI values were not so abnormal. It was forecasted that in 2030 rises in the CO level by 13.2% in the winter and by 17.5% in the fall are expected, with the simultaneous increase of AAI by 204.5% and 980.2%, and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) by 27% and 5% in the winter and spring, respectively.

TI  - Stochastic modeling of urban growth using the CA-Markov chain and multi-scenario prospects in the tropical humid region of Ethiopia: Mettu
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion possesses significant negative impacts on the environment, particularly in forest areas worldwide. This study aimed to analyze urban expansion by using stochastic modeling with the CA-Markov chain and multi-scenario prospects in Mettu area, Ethiopia. The Landsat images of 1986, 2000, and 2021 were used. The results reveal built-up areas gained 27.2%, of which cropland and forest accounted for 11.4 and 6.4%, respectively, within the 1986-2021 period. Despite the potential decline in urban growth rates, the model revealed that the spatial extent will likely expand twofold before the 2040s. In the rapid development (RD) scenario, urban development due to population increase will occur, which is also prevalent in the proposed suitable urban expansion (PSUE) scenario, but the ecological and economic protection (EEP) scenario reveals very limited. The findings of this study will have far-reaching impacts on ecological and economic livelihoods unless green economy principles are effectively implemented.

TI  - A patch filling method for thematic map refinement: a case study on forest cover mapping in the Greater Mekong Subregion and Malaysia
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate forest cover mapping is essential for monitoring the status of forest extent in Southeast Asia. However, tropical areas frequently experience cloud cover, resulting in invalid or missing data in thematic maps. The initial 2005 and 2010 forest cover maps produced by the collaboration of the Greater Mekong Subregion and Malaysia (GMS+) economies contain unclassified pixels in the areas affected by cloud or cloud shadow. To enhance the usability and effectiveness of the 2005 and 2010 GMS+ forest cover maps for further analysis and applications, we present a novel method for accurately mapping forest cover in the presence of cloud cover. We employed a pixel-based algorithm to create clear view composites and automatically generated land cover training labels from the existing forest cover maps. We then reclassified the invalid areas and produced updated maps. The land cover types for all previously missing pixels have been successfully reclassified. The accuracy of this method was assessed at both the pixel and region level, with an overall accuracy of 94.2% at the forest/non-forest level and 86.6% at the finer classification level by pixel level assessment across all reclassified patches, and 93.2% at the forest/non-forest level and 89.9% at the finer level by region level for the selected site. There are 2.6% of forest and 0.7% of non-forest areas in the 2005 map, as well as 2.7% of forest and 0.6% of non-forest in the 2010 map have been reclassified from invalid pixels. This approach provides a framework for filling invalid areas in the existing thematic map toward improving its spatial continuity. The updated outputs provide more accurate and reliable information than the initial maps on the status of forest extent in the GMS+, which is critical for effective forest management and sustainable use in the region.

TI  - Evaluation of temporal compositing algorithms for annual land cover classification using Landsat time series data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, four widely used temporal compositing algorithms, i.e. median, maximum NDVI, medoid, and weighted scoring-based algorithms, were evaluated for annual land cover classification using monthly Landsat time series data. Four study areas located in California, Texas, Kansas, and Minnesota, USA were selected for image compositing and land cover classification. Results indicated that images composited using weighted scoring-based algorithms have the best spatial fidelity compared to other three algorithms. In addition, the weighted scoring-based algorithms have superior classification accuracy, followed by median, maximum NDVI, and medoid in descending order. However, the median algorithm has a significant advantage in computational efficiency which was & SIM;70 times that of weighted scoring-based algorithms, and with overall classification accuracy just slightly lower (& SIM;0.13% on average) than weighted scoring-based algorithms. Therefore, we recommended the weighted scoring-based compositing algorithms for small area land cover mapping, and median compositing algorithm for the land cover mapping of large area considering the balance between computational complexity and classification accuracy. The findings of this study provide insights into the performance difference between various compositing algorithms, and have potential uses for the selection of pixel-based image compositing technique adopted for land cover mapping based on Landsat time series data.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of planted forests on the Loess Plateau between 1986 and 2021 based on Landsat NDVI time-series analysis
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term and large scale spatiotemporal patterns of planted forests are essential for evaluating local plantation effectiveness and to promote sustainable afforestation. Satellite remote sensing data provide broad spatial coverage and increasingly long-term and large scale records for spatiotemporal analysis of planted forests. In this study, we developed a dynamic and conversion extraction (DCE) framework by combining the similarity of Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series with a change detection algorithm. This framework allows the analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics of planted forests. The proposed framework can be used to extract the planting year and conversion patterns of planted forests by performing the Mann-Kendall (MK) statistic test on the inter-annual Landsat NDVI time-series and measuring the similarity of the intra-annual time-series, respectively. Therefore, it can be applied to addressing the key questions on where, when, and how planted forests conversions have occurred. Took the Loess Plateau in China as an example, we applied the DCE framework to illustrate how planted forests have changed over time and space and have been converted from other land cover types from 1986 to 2021. The producer and user accuracies for the mapping of planted forests were 88.22% and 87.11% in 2021, respectively, and the accuracy of identifying planted forests conversions was 80.25%. The results showed that the newly planted forests experienced four phases: a slow rise from 1986 to 2000, a sharp increase during 2001-2004, a fluctuating pattern from 2005 to 2013, and a reduction until 2020, resulting in a total planted forest area of 7.13 Mha in 2021. In addition, 83.51% of the planted forest pixels underwent conversion from grasslands (58.19% or 4.15 Mha) or croplands (25.32% or 1.81 Mha) during 1986-2021. These results indicate the capability of the DCE framework to capture essential information (planting year and conversion patterns) to support the spatiotemporal analysis of planted forests at large scales.

TI  - The superiority of the Adjusted Normalized Difference Snow Index (ANDSI) for mapping glaciers using Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of glaciers' extents and their dynamics is essential for improving our understanding of the impacts of climate and environmental changes in cold regions. The satellite-based Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) has been widely used for mapping snow cover and glaciers around the globe. However, mapping glaciers in snow-covered areas using existing indices remains a challenging task due to their incapabilities in separating snow, glaciers, and water. This study aimed to evaluate a new satellite-based index and apply machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of mapping glaciers. A new index based on satellite data from Sentinel-2 was tested, which we call the Adjusted Normalized Difference Snow Index (ANDSI). ANDSI (besides NDSI) was used with five different machine learning algorithms, namely Artificial Neural Network, C5.0 Decision Tree Algorithm, Naive Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machine, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, to map glaciers, and their performance was evaluated against ground reference data. Four glacierized regions in different countries (Canada, China, Sweden, and Switzerland-Italy) were selected as study sites to evaluate the performance of the proposed ANDSI. Results showed that the proposed ANDSI outperformed the original NDSI, and the C5.0 classifier showed the best overall accuracy and Kappa among the selected five machine learning classifiers in the majority of cases. The original NDSI yielded results with an average overall accuracy of (around) 91% and the proposed ANDSI with (around) 95% for glacier mapping across all models and study regions. This study demonstrates that the proposed ANDSI serves as a superior and improved method for accurately mapping glaciers in cold regions.

TI  - Future prediction of existing glacial lake's size in the Himalaya by Markov model and glacial surface topography
T2  - ALL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes in the Himalayas are increasing in size and number at an alarming rate, with the majority of lakes concentrated in the eastern and central parts of the mountain range. This research focuses on the future prediction of regional-scale glacial lake size in the entire Himalayan mountain range to avoid future glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). Here, we used Landsat TM and OLI images, Google Earth imageries, Cartosat DEM, and SRTM DEM, and used some techniques: average lake size change rate, Markov model and glacial surface topography to extract glacial lake size change and future prediction of lake size. A total of 9675 individual glacial lakes were noticed during the study period (1990-2020), out of which the lakes present constantly throughout the study period (with size > 0.01 km(2)) were added in this study.1This study used two methods (i.e., Markov model and Glacier surface topography) to predict future lake size and identified 191 and 94 critical lakes that are most at risk of enlargement in Markov and glacial surface topography, respectively. Moreover, 443 critical lakes in Himalaya is distributed as 227 in the eastern Himalayas, 195 in the central Himalayas, and 21 in the western Himalayas. The findings suggest that the number and size of glacial lakes will continue to increase, posing an even greater risk of GLOFs in the future.

TI  - Analyzing the correlation of forest and wetland with land surface temperature by using geospatial technology: a case of Yayo district, Southwestern Ethiopia
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests and wetlands played a crucial role in minimizing the increasing trends of land surface temperature (LST). This study aimed to analyze the contribution of forests and wetlands on LST in Yayo district using multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite. Landsat images of 1986, 2003 and 2021 were downloaded from United State Geological Survey website with 30 m spatial resolution. Results show that the mean LST was increased from 22.8 & DEG;C in 1986 to 27 & DEG;C in 2003 over cultivated land. As the results of forest conservation and wetland protection, the LST in Yayo district is experencing a declining trend in the recent year. Result reveal that the normalized difference vegetation index and Normalized Difference Water Index show a strong negative relationship with LST. Over the last two decades, the LST was declined by 1.5 & DEG;C due to the protection of forest and wetland ecosystem. Thus, governmental and non-governmental organization should encourage the conservation and protection of forest and wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Causes and effects of Shisper glacial lake outburst flood event in Karakoram in 2022
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Karakoram Himalayas are vulnerable to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which cause catastrophic floods in the surrounding areas. The increasing natural and anthropogenic activities, especially in the Indo-Gangetic Plains at the southern flank of the towering Himalayas, could be the cause of climate change affecting the frequency of the natural hazards in the Himalayas. In the present study, a detailed analysis of the Shisper Lake breach of 7 May 2022 is carried out using satellite remote sensing. A decreasing trend in the glacial mass balance is observed between 2017 and 2021; in this period, frequent GLOF episodes occurred. A pronounced decline in the snow cover and glacial debris (before the cascade) and an abnormal increase in land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from satellite data could be responsible for the enhanced snow/glacial melting prior to the breach. Alteration in glacial mobility (cm/12 days) is observed at the locations where the glacier melts due to an increase in LST with increased debris cover. In the paper, we have studied changes in water quality and land cover along the stream after the GLOF. An increment in normalized difference turbidity index (NDTI) is observed before the flood showing turbulence and sediment load. Increased glacial melt contribution into the stream results in increased flow rate and decreased water quality as observed through normalized difference water index (NDWI) and normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI), near the Karakoram Highway Bridge. Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficient indicates increased discharge from the melting of glaciers. A significant reduction in co-flood coherence is observed, attributed to the bridge collapse and severe bank erosion.

TI  - Assimilation of NDVI data in a land surface - Vegetation model for leaf area index predictions in a tree-grass ecosystem
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Periodic observations of vegetation index, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), can be used for data assimilation in heterogenous ecosystems. Indeed, the new Sentinel 2 Multispectral instrument and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager sensor data are available at such high temporal and spatial resolutions that can be used to detect the patches of the main vegetation components (grass and trees) of heterogenous ecosystems, and capture their dynamics. We demonstrate the possibility to merge grass and tree NDVI observations and models, to optimally provide robust predictions of grass and tree leaf area index. The proposed assimilation approach assimilates NDVI data through the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and dynamically calibrates a key vegetation dynamic model parameter, the maintenance respiration coefficient (ma ). In the presence of large bias of the grass and tree ma base values, only the use of the proposed assimilation approach removes the large bias in the biomass balance, dynamically calibrating maintenance respiration coefficients, and corrects the model. The performance of a land surface - vegetation model was improved by assimilating observations of NDVI. The effective impact of the proposed assimilation approach on the evapotranspiration and CO2 uptake predictions in the heterogenous ecosystem is also demonstrated.

TI  - Development of an algorithm for identification of sown biodiverse pastures in Portugal
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sown biodiverse pastures (SBP) are a pasture system developed in Portugal. Until 2014, farmers were supported in installing and maintaining SBP, but tracking their locations has been lacking. To survey the country, remote sensing tools with machine learning were used. Here, we developed the first algorithm that combines remote sensing data with machine learning algorithms to identify SBP areas. The algorithm combines Landsat-7 and night-light spectral data with terrain and bioclimatic data. Remotely sensed data offer higher spatial resolution compared to bioclimatic data and also cover interannual variability. Gradient-boosted decision trees (XGB) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were the machine learning methods used. The overall classification accuracy, on an independent validation dataset, was 94%, with 82% producer accuracy and 85% user accuracy. The total estimated area of SBP in the Portuguese region of Alentejo region was 1300 km2 in 2013, which is similar to the total known installed area (approximately 1000 km(2)). The estimated spatial distribution is in accordance with the known distribution at the municipal level. These results are a critical first step towards the future development of remote systems for assessing the state of SBP and for compliance checks of farmer commitments.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive tumor, and lymph node metastasis significantly impacts the prognosis and treatment of this condition. Sentinel node biopsy, as a less invasive alternative to traditional dissection, offers convenience, safety, and improved efficiency in assessing local lymph node status. It provides valuable staging information and aids in determining appropriate follow-up treatment. The evolution and enhancement of technical and conceptual aspects associated with sentinel node biopsy have transformed the management of malignant melanoma. Notably, several large multicenter trials have challenged the necessity of complete lymph node dissection, leading to a paradigm shift. While some controversy remains, the standard of care for melanoma is progressing toward a consensus.

TI  - Mapping invasive alien plant species with very high spatial resolution and multi-date satellite imagery using object-based and machine learning techniques: A comparative study
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive alien plant species (IAPS) have negative impacts on ecosystems, including the loss of biodiversity and the alteration of ecosystem functions. The strategy for mitigating these impacts requires knowledge of these species' spatial distribution and level of infestation. In situ inventories or aerial photo interpretation can be used to collect these data but they are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and incomplete, especially when dealing with large or inaccessible areas. Remote sensing may be an effective method of mapping IAPS for a better management strategy. Several studies using remote sensing to map IAPS have focused on single species detection and were conducted in relatively homogeneous natural environments, while other common, more heterogeneous environments, such as urban areas, are often invaded by multiple IAPS, posing management challenges. The main objective of this study was to develop a mapping method for three major IAPS observed in the urban agglomeration of Quebec City (Canada), namely Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica); giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum); and phragmites (Phragmites australis). Mono-date and multi-date classification approaches were used with WorldView-3 and SPOT-7 satellite imagery, acquired in the summer of 2020 and in the autumn of 2019, respectively. To estimate presence probability, object-based image analysis (OBIA) and nonparametric classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were used. Overall, multi-date classification using WorldView-3 and SPOT-7 images produced the best results, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.85 and an overall accuracy of 91% using RF. For XGBoost, the Kappa coefficient was 0.81 with an overall accuracy of 89%, whereas the Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy were 0.80 and 88% for SVM classifier, respectively. Individual class performances based on F1-score revealed that Japanese knotweed had the highest maximum value (0.95), followed by giant hogweed (0.91), and phragmites (0.87). These results confirmed the potential of remote sensing to accurately map and simultaneously monitor the main IAPS in a heterogeneous urban environment using a multi-date approach. Although the approach is limited by image and reference data availability, it provides new tools to managers for IAPS invasion control.

TI  - Mapping common and glossy buckthorns (<i>Frangula alnus</i> and <i>Rhamnus cathartica</i>) using multi-date satellite imagery WorldView-3, GeoEye-1 and SPOT-7
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Letter
AB  - Buckthorns (Glossy buckthorn, Frangula alnus and common buckthorn, Rhamnus cathartica) represent a threat to biodiversity. Their high competitivity lead to the replacement of native species and the inhibition of forest regeneration. Early detection strategies are therefore necessary to limit invasive alien plant species' impacts, and remote sensing is one of the techniques for early invasion detection. Few studies have used phenological remote sensing approaches to map buckthorn distribution from medium spatial resolution images. Those studies highlighted the difficulty of detecting buckthorns in low densities and in understory using this category of images. The main objective of this study was to develop an approach using multi-date very high spatial resolution satellite imagery to map buckthorns in low densities and in the understory in the Quebec city area. Three machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting) were applied to WorldView-3, GeoEye-1 and SPOT-7 satellite imagery. The Random Forest classifier performed well (Kappa = 0.72). The SVM and XGBoost's coefficient Kappa were 0.69 and 0.66, respectively. However, buckthorn distribution in understory was identified as the main limit to this approach, and LiDAR data could be used to improve buckthorn mapping in similar environments.

TI  - Consecutive DInSAR and well based on the law of material conservation between land surface pressure and ground water to observe land subsidence
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The concern about the recurrence of land subsidence has arisen in Japan with urban development and new groundwater use. Land subsidence observation well has been utilized for monitoring the subsidence, but due to the recent aging of facilities and equipment, remote sensing technology is attracting attention. This paper seeks to assess the substitutability of Consecutive DInSAR with the land subsidence observation well. To investigate the subsidence in Kanagawa prefecture, Sentinel 1 images from August 2017 to March 2022 were analyzed by SARPROZ software based on Consecutive DInSAR, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and land subsidence observation well methods. Moreover, we assessed the new calculation model between land surface pressure and ground water called the law of material conservation to estimate land subsidence. The results revealed that the Consecutive DInSAR results agreed with the land subsidence observation well data, indicating the possibility of future substitution.

T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Pneumococcal diseases have a clinical and economic impact on the population. Until this year, a 10-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV10) used to be applied in Colombia, which does not contain serotypes 19A, 3, and 6A, the most prevalent in the country. Therefore, we aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the shift to the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13). Research design and methods A decision model was used for newborns in Colombia between 2022-2025 and adults over 65 years. The time horizon was life expectancy. Outcomes are Invasive Pneumococcal Diseases (IPD), Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), Acute Otitis Media (AOM), their sequelae, Life Gained Years (LYGs), and herd effect in older adults. Results PCV10 covers 4.27% of serotypes in the country, while PCV13 covers 64.4%. PCV13 would avoid in children 796 cases of IPD, 19,365 of CAP, 1,399 deaths, and generate 44,204 additional LYGs, as well as 9,101 cases of AOM, 13 cases of neuromotor disability and 428 cochlear implants versus PCV10. In older adults, PCV13 would avoid 993 cases of IPD and 17,245 of CAP, versus PCV10. PCV13 saves $51.4 million. The decision model shows robustness in the sensitivity analysis. Conclusion PCV13 is a cost-saving strategy versus PCV10 to avoid pneumococcal diseases.

TI  - Sami traditional medicine and complementary and alternative medicine - a descriptive study of use within the Sami population of Sweden
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional medicine has been practised for millennia in the Sami population, based on a Sami worldview and cosmology, which includes natural remedies, prayers, drums and yoik singing. During the Christianisation of the Sami during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, these practices were condemned. In recent years, however, a revival of Sami culture has occurred and so has the practice of Sami traditional medicine (STM) and the use of complementary alternative medicine (CAM). The aim of this study is to map the prevalence and use of STM and CAM among Sami in Sweden today. The study population consisted of 3641 Sami from the whole of Sweden, who had participated in the population-based cross-sectional survey Sami Health on Equal Terms (SamiHET) in 2021. Our results show that women are more prone to use both STM and CAM than men and that younger persons are more likely to use STM and CAM than elderly persons. STM is more often used in the northern parts of Sapmi compared to the southern parts as well as a lower use of CAM in the north. This might be due to the stronger Sami identity and easier access to traditional Sami healers/helpers in the north as well as limited access to CAM services

TI  - Urban land-use classification using machine learning classifiers: comparative evaluation and post-classification multi-feature fusion approach
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial-temporal mapping of urban land-use and land-cover (LULC) provides critical information for planning and management of urban environments. While several studies have investigated the significance of machine learning classifiers for urban land-use mapping, the determination of the optimal classifiers for the extraction of specific urban LULC classes in time and space is still a challenge especially for multitemporal and multisensor data sets. This study presents the results of urban LULC classification using decision tree-based classifiers comprising of gradient tree boosting (GTB), random forest (RF), in comparison with support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP-ANN). Using Landsat data from 1984 to 2020 at 5-year intervals for the Greater Gaborone Planning Area (GGPA) in Botswana, RF was the best classifier with overall average accuracy of 92.8%, MLP-ANN (91.2%), SVM (90.9%) and GTB (87.8%). To improve on the urban LULC mapping, the study presents a post-classification multiclass fusion of the best classifier results based on the principle of feature in-feature out (FEI-FEO) under mutual exclusivity boundary conditions. Through classifier ensemble, the FEI-FEO approach improved the overall LULC classification accuracy by more than 2% demonstrating the advantage of post-classification fusion in urban land-use mapping.

TI  - Understanding spatiotemporal evolution of the surface urban heat island in the Bangkok metropolitan region from 2000 to 2020 using enhanced land surface temperature
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The urbanization process has significantly intensified surface urban heat island (SUHI) effects in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR). However, understanding the evolution of the urban thermal environment is challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining consistent remote sensing data of the cloud-prone landscape in the BMR. In this study, the data fusion algorithm was utilized to fill cloud-induced data gap and create high spatiotemporal-resolution data by blending Landsat and MODIS remote sensing images. The fused data was used to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) for winter months from 2000 to 2020. The spatiotemporal variations in SUHI were then captured using spatial cluster analysis. Finally, gradient analysis and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were employed to analyse the effects of land cover composition on LST. The SUHI intensity in winter increased from 4.40 degrees C in 2000 to 5.76 degrees C in 2020. The areal percentage of SUHI hot spots increased from 24.86% to 29.13%. The gradient analysis results indicated that vegetation with a density higher than 0.3 had a significant effect on LST compared to low-density areas. The woody lands were more effective in lowering LST than cultivated lands. These results provide useful information for developing heat mitigation strategies in the metropolitan regions.

TI  - Application of remote sensing-based spectral variability hypothesis to improve tree diversity estimation of seasonal tropical forest considering phenological variations
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Global decline in biodiversity warrants its systematic monitoring in space and time. Remote sensing derived Rao's Q index has been proposed as a proxy for species diversity yet its scope for seasonal tropical forest is untested. The study assessed the influence of phenology on Rao's Q index derived using multi-date Sentinel-2 NDVI to estimate tree diversity. Plot level vegetation inventory data (n = 61) was used to estimate tree diversity (Shannon-Wiener index (H')) of Nandhaur landscape in North-West Himalayan foothills. Rao's Q index and H' showed lower correlation at the landscape level than individual forest types. Rao's Q index based on NDVI observed higher correlation with H', especially during the leaf flushing period. NDVI-based multi-dimensional Rao's Q index offered better performance for dry deciduous (R (2) =0.69) followed by moist deciduous forest. The present approach can be used for estimating tree diversity, especially in seasonal tropical forests.

TI  - Using geospatial data to identify land grabbing. Detecting spatial reconfigurations during the implementation of the Nacala Development Corridor in Mozambique with remote sensing and land conflicts databases
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The contemporary food system pushes agriculture to a globalized value-chain, affecting landscapes, resource access, and institutional arrangements. Institutions operating in Africa adopt development corridors to integrate multisector investments and induce export-driven primary sector, leading to massive land deals, also known as land-grabbing. Organizations struggle to monitor land deals accurately, lacking spatial precision and contextual information for affected communities. This research examines Mozambique's Nacala Corridor, using geospatial data as a tool to detect spatial (re)configurations due to exported-oriented policies and infrastructure. Data from land conflicts databases (Land Matrix and Environmental Justice) were analyzed with remote sensing Landsat and MODIS imagery using multiple indexes, an EVI time series, and the application of the LandTrendr algorithm. The results show that the temporal and spatial analysis of remote-sensing data is in line with the major political and economic dynamics of the region. Hotspots of land cover changes were detected in the same areas where land grabbing were reported; however, reported and detected land areas did not coincide. Temporal analysis showed that institutional changes played a greater role in triggering land use changes than infrastructure implementation. We conclude that land cover modifications, conflicts, and spatial development initiatives follows policies and institutional arrangements targeting international investments.

TI  - Monitoring nonlinear and fast deformation caused by underground mining exploitation using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 radar interferometry and corner reflectors: application, validation and processing obstacles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) of artificial Corner Reflectors (CRs) were validated in the area of fast and nonlinear deformation gradient caused by active coal longwall exploitation. Three Sentinel-1 datasets were processed using conventional DInSAR, Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI), and Small BAseline Subset methods implemented in ENVI SARscape (TM). For evaluation, leveling and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements were used. Considering the challenge of snow cover, the removal of all winter images was not a successful strategy due to the long temporal baseline and strong movement, which cause phase unwrapping problems and underestimate the real deformation. The results indicate that only conventional DInSAR and SBAS with low network redundancy allow us to capture maximal deformation gradient and the root mean square error calculated between the CRs and the ground truth is on the level of 2-3 cm for the vertical and easting deformation component, respectively. For the small deformation gradient represented by the permanent GNSS station (4 cm/year), all SBAS techniques appeared to be more accurate than DInSAR, which corresponds to higher redundancy and better removal of the atmospheric signal. In contrast, DInSAR results allowed to capture information about two subsidence basins, which was not possible with SBAS and PSI approaches.

TI  - Identification of densely populated-informal settlements and their role in Chinese urban sustainability assessment
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China's National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development identified the upgrading of urban shantytowns, urban villages, and dilapidated houses as an important initiative to implement the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11.1. However, informal housing being used as temporary housing by low-income families (especially in megacities) has resulted in informal settlements that are usually densely populated, dilapidated, and disorganized. Identifying targets based on deep learning and single very high-resolution images remains a challenging task. Here, we used multi-source geographic information data and machine-learning methods to identify and compare the distribution of densely populated?informal settlements (DPISs) and measured population ratios within the urban areas of three Chinese first-tier cities: Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Our results indicate that DPISs occupy 1.98%, 0.67%, and 3.95% of the total area in these study regions, with population densities of 42,800 people/km2, 7,100 people/km2, and 20,800 people/km2, respectively. Further, significant variability existed in the distribution of DPISs, population ratios, and composition of the study areas. DPISs reflected the rapid urbanization process in China and the planning of the city, which can be used as an indicator of sustainable urban development in China.KEY POLICY HIGHLIGHTS? Localizing SDGs indicators to study areas and incorporating regional variations and specific characteristics enhanced the understanding of their role in regional sustainable development.? DPISs were introduced in this study; the similarities and differences were made between DPIS and SDG indicators.? Contrasting distribution patterns of DPISs in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou revealed distinct regional disparities and urban development dynamics.? Integration of multi-source remote sensing data enabled comprehensive analysis of complex features and spatial patterns of DPISs.? Exploration of the intricate relationship between DPISs and urbanization unveiled challenges and potential opportunities for inclusive urban development.

TI  - Agricultural expansion into forest reserves in Zambia: a remote sensing approach
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest reserves play an important role in the provision of ecosystem goods and services; however, these reserves are facing increasing anthropogenic impacts primarily because of agricultural activities. In sub-Saharan Africa, studies on understanding the extent and impacts of agricultural expansion into forest reserves are generally lacking. Thus, this study aimed to assess the extent of agricultural expansion into forest reserves in Zambia on a national scale between 2000 and 2018 and explores the drivers. We used a remote sensing approach by employing Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Random Forests classifier to map land cover changes at five-time steps: 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018. Landsat images were used to map six land cover classes (forest, cropland, wetland, grassland, settlement, and water body) determined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). A social survey was also undertaken to understand the drivers of agricultural expansion into forest reserves at two study sited located in eastern and north-western part of Zambia. Based on the land cover maps which were produced with high accuracies ranging from 82% to 94%, the results indicated a general decline of 10% in forest area and an increase of 25% in cropland. Almost 50% of the forest reserves in Zambia are experiencing some form of encroachment, and 10% of these are heavily encroached (>90% loss). Local communities indicated that population growth, loss of soil fertility, high market demand for crops, land tenure system, and lack of law enforcement are the major drivers of agricultural expansion into forest reserves. This study highlights the need for policy marker to consider trade-offs in agricultural expansion and conservation of forest reserves relation to population growth. Enhancing sustainable agricultural practices and strengthening the implementation of different legislative frameworks is key in addressing the challenges of conservation, while enhancing food security.

TI  - Contribution of topographic features and categorization uncertainty for a tree species classification in the boreal biome of Northern Ontario
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations within local topography can effectively impact the location of tree species within naturally forested areas. Furthermore, the uncertainty of prediction for classification can vastly differ amongst topography and the overlying tree species groupings. This study investigated the supplementation of a suite of topographic features corresponding to morphometry and hydrological considerations, in addition to multispectral imagery and other LiDAR-derived features, at fine (2 m) spatial resolution for a pixel-based tree species classification of a forested region of the boreal biome in northern Ontario, Canada. The study area conforms to the Abitibi River Forest (ARF) and consists of the tree species of black spruce (Picea mariana), balsam fir (Abies balsamea), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), tamarack (Larix laricina), white spruce (Picea glauca), and eastern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis). Random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVMs) were implemented for the classification. Topographic features, specifically those conforming to channel base level, valley depth, and multi-resolution valley bottom flatness (MRVBF), were among the most important features for species predictors. The RF and SVM methods were trained on pixels of pure stands (composed of 70%+ of same tree species) for the tree species groupings, which were split by site level. Modelling accuracies for both the pixel and site level were reported, with the best model attaining an overall site level accuracy and corresponding Cohen's kappa score of 0.79 and 0.69 for classification, respectively. Entropy maps were generated to characterize the uncertainty of prediction, and substantiate that the regions of lowest uncertainty correspond to wetlands, which are dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana). A modified entropy map was calculated from the normalized top two probabilities of tree species groupings predicted per pixel, so as to better highlight regions of prediction uncertainty. A prediction map for the second most-likely tree species groupings was also computed, which supports the presence of balsam fir (Abies balsamea) as a secondary tree species throughout the ARF region.

TI  - A novel alpine land cover classification strategy based on a deep convolutional neural network and multi-source remote sensing data in Google Earth Engine
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine land cover (ALC) is facing many challenges with climatic change, biodiversity reduction and other cascading ecosystem damage triggered by natural and anthropogenic interference. Although several global land cover products and thematic maps are already available, their mapping accuracy of alpine and montane regions remains unsatisfactory due to the data acquisition, methodology, and workflow design constraints. Therefore, in this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) in Google Earth Engine (GEE) was developed to map the ALC types of the Yarlung Zangbo river basin (YZRB) in the Tibetan plateau using multi-source remote sensing data. The DCNN algorithm was offline trained using automatically generating samples and online deployed in the GEE for a large-scale ALC mapping. Moreover, a set of fine land cover classification system (containing 14 ALC types) was also established in accordance with the natural situation of the YZRB. The overall accuracy and kappa were 86.24% and 0.8156, which were higher than traditional classification algorithms. The spatial distribution of ALC types was analyzed in different gradient zones, and a clear altitudinal characteristic was noticed. The terrain of the YZRB from upper-stream to down-stream with an elevation dramatically decreases, and corresponding to vertical zonal changes from glacier and permanent snow/ice, barren gravel land, alpine desert steppe, alpine steppe, alpine meadow, shrubs, to tree cover. The product can provide valuable land cover information to support alpine ecosystem conservation.

TI  - Machine learning-based detection of irrigation in Vojvodina (Serbia) using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With rapid population growth and the high influence of climate change on agricultural productivity, providing enough food is the main challenge in the 21st century. Irrigation, as a hydrological artificial process, has an indispensable role in achieving that goal. However, high pressure and demand on water resources could lead to serious problems in water consumption. Knowing information about the spatial distribution of irrigation parcels is essential to many aspects of Earth system science and global change research. To extract this knowledge for the main agricultural region in Serbia located in the moderate continental area, we utilized optical satellite Sentinel-2 data and collected ground truth data needed to train the machine learning model. Both satellite imagery and ground truth data were collected for the three most irrigated crops, maize, soybean, and sugar beet during 3 years (2020-2022) characterized by different weather conditions. This data was then used for training the Random Forest-based models, separately for each crop type, differentiating irrigated and rainfed crops on the parcel level. Finally, the models were run for the whole territory of Vojvodina generating 10 m resolution maps of irrigated three crops of interest. With overall accuracy for crops per year (2020: 0.76; 2021: 0.78; 2022: 0.84) results showed that this method could be successfully used for detecting the irrigation of three crops of interest. This was confirmed by validation with the national dataset from Public Water Management Company "Vode Vojvodine" which revealed that classification maps had an accuracy of 76%. These maps further allow us to understand the spatial dynamics of the most important irrigated crops and can serve for the improvement of sustainable agricultural water management.

TI  - Health care resource utilization patterns among patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis: analysis of Medicare beneficiaries treated with pimavanserin or other-atypical antipsychotics
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Pimavanserin (PIM) is the only FDA-approved atypical antipsychotic (AAP) for hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP). Comparative real-world analyses demonstrating its benefits are needed. Objectives To evaluate health care resource utilization (HCRU) outcomes among PDP patients treated with PIM vs. other-AAPs. Methods Retrospective cohort analysis of Parts A, B, and D claims from 100% Medicare sample from 01 January 2013-31 December 2019 was conducted. PDP Patients initiating (i.e. index date) continuous monotherapy (PIM vs. other-AAPs) for >= 12-months during 01 January 2014-31 December 2018 without 12-months pre-index AAP use were selected after 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) on 31 variables (sex, race, region, age, and 27 Elixhauser comorbidities). HCRU outcomes included: annual all-cause and psychiatric hospitalization (short-term stay, long-term stay, and SNF-stay [skilled nursing facility]) rates, annual all-cause and psychiatric-ER visit rates, mean per-patient-per-year (PPPY) hospitalizations, and average length of stay (ALOS). PIM and other-AAPs were compared using generalized linear models (GLM) controlled for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, coexisting-dementia, and coexisting insomnia. Results Of 12,164 PDP patients, 48.41% (n = 5,889) were female, and mean age was 77 (+/- 8.14) years. Among 1:1 matched patients (n = 842 in each), 37.8% (n = 319) on PIM vs. 49.8% (n = 420) on other-AAPs (p < .05) reported >= 1 all-cause hospitalizations, respectively. Specifically, short-term and SNF-stay among PIM patients vs. other-AAPs were: 34% (n = 286) vs. 46.2% (n = 389) and 20.2% (n = 170) vs. 31.8% (n = 267) (p < .05), respectively. Similarly, 9.6% (n = 81) of PIM vs. 14.6% (n = 123) of other-AAPs patients had >= 1 psychiatric hospitalization (p < .05). Furthermore, >= 1 all-cause and psychiatric ER visit among PIM vs. other-AAPs were 61.6% (n = 519) vs. 69.4% (n = 584) and 5.2% (n = 43) vs. 10.2% (n = 86) (p < .05), respectively. PIM also had significantly lower ALOS, and mean PPPY short-term hospitalization and SNF-stays. Conclusions In this analysis of PDP patients, PIM monotherapy resulted in nearly 12% and 7% lower all-cause hospitalizations and ER visits vs. other-AAPs.

TI  - Remote sensing techniques for water management and climate change monitoring in drought areas: case studies in Egypt and Tunisia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused on monitoring the water status of vegetation and soil by exploiting the synergy of optical and microwave satellite data with the aim of improving the knowledge of water cycle in cultivated lands in Egyptian Delta and Tunisian areas. Environmental analysis approaches based on optical and synthetic aperture radar data were carried out to set up the basis for future implementation of practical and cost-effective methods for sustainable water use in agriculture. Long-term behaviors of vegetation indices were thus analyzed between 2000 and 2018. By using SAR data from Sentinel-1, an Artificial Neural Network-based algorithm was implemented for estimating soil moisture and monthly maps for 2018 have been generated to be compared with information derived from optical indices. Moreover, a novel drought severity index was developed and applied to available data. The index was obtained by combining vegetation soil difference index, derived from optical data, and soil moisture content derived from SAR data. The proposed index was found capable of complementing optical and microwave sensitivity to drought-related parameters, although ground data are missing for correctly validating the results, by capturing drought patterns and their temporal evolution better than indices based only on microwave or optical data..

TI  - Identification and delineation of groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) in the Khakea-Bray transboundary aquifer region using geospatial techniques
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying and delineating groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) is critical in understanding their location, distribution and groundwater allocation. However, this information is inadequately understood due to limited available data for most areas where they occur. Thus, this study aims to address this gap using remotely sensed, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and in situ data to identify and delineate GDEs in the Khakea-Bray transboundary aquifer region. The study tested various spatial-explicit GDE indices that integrates environmental factors that predict occurrence of GDEs. These include the normalized difference vegetation index as a proxy for vegetation productivity and modified normalized difference water index as proxy for moisture availability, land-use and landcover, topographical factors such as slope, topographic wetness index, flow accumulation and curvature. The GDEs were delineated using the weighted overlay tool in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. The thematic output layer was then spatially classified into two classes, namely, GDEs and non-GDEs. The results showed that only 1.34% of the area is characterised by GDEs covering 721,908 ha. Overall, identified GDEs were found mostly on a gentle slope on the large portion of shrubland and grassland. The derived GDEs map was then statistically compared with groundwater level (GWL) data from 22 boreholes that occur in the area. Our results indicated that: GDEs are concentrated at the northern, central and south-western part of the study area. The validation results showed significant overlapping of GDEs classes with both the groundwater level (GWL) and rainfall in the study area. The results show a possible delineation of GDEs in the study area using remote sensing and GIS techniques along with AHP and is transferable to other arid and semiarid environments. The results of this study contributes to identifying and delineating priority areas where appropriate water conservation programmes for sustainable groundwater development can be implemented.

TI  - A comparative analysis of multi-index overlay and fuzzy ordered weighted averaging methods for porphyry Cu prospectivity mapping using remote sensing data: the case study of Chahargonbad area, SE of Iran
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the specific features of porphyry copper (Cu) mineralization is the distinct occurrence of hydrothermal alteration zones, which can be mapped by processing various satellite images. Among free multispectral images, Landsat 8 OLI and ASTER data are known to be efficient in mapping different geological features, such as alteration zones and tectonic lineaments. This study aims to show the potential of these data types in mapping porphyry Cu mineralization by proposing a framework for employing and integrating different image processing methods. These methods include principal component analysis (PCA), spectral angle mapper (SAM), and matched filtering (MF) employed on these satellite images to map target al.teration zones. Moreover, PCA and directional filtering are applied to the ASTER dataset to enhance and map structural features. The results are evaluated and then combined to provide a potential map of Cu mineralization in the Chahargonbad area, located within the Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic belt (UDMB) in Kerman province, Iran. The prediction-area plot and normalized density, which are data-driven methods, are used to assign the relative weight of each layer and evaluate them. Finally, using the calculated weights, data-driven multi-index overlay (DMIO) and fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (FOWA) methods are applied to combine the evidential layers. The potential mineralization maps created by the DMIO and FOWA provide a prediction rate of 80% and 82%, respectively. Furthermore, the accuracy of the integrated maps is investigated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The AUC scores obtained from the ROC curves of DMIO and FOWA methods are 0.85 and 0.88, respectively, representing powerful positive spatial relationships with mineralization areas. Based on the results, the proposed framework can be applied to provide a potential map of porphyry Cu mineralization, particularly in arid regions, with reasonable accuracy.

TI  - Water depth estimation from Sentinel-2 imagery using advanced machine learning methods and explainable artificial intelligence
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of water depth in coastal areas and shallow waters is crucial for marine management and monitoring. However, direct measurements using fieldwork methods can be costly and time-consuming. Therefore, remote sensing imagery is a promising source of geospatial information for coastal planning and development. To this end, this study investigates advanced machine learning (ML) methods and redesigned morphological profiles for water depth estimation using high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The proposed framework involves three main steps: (1) morphological feature generation, (2) model training using several ML methods (Decision Tree, Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient BOOSTing, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Deep Neural Network, and CatBoost), and (3) model interpretation using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The performance of the proposed method was evaluated in two different coastal areas (port and jetty) with reference data from accurate hydrographic data (Echo-sounder and differential global positioning systems). The statistical analysis revealed that the proposed method had high efficiency for depth estimation of the coastal area, achieving a best R-2 value of 0.96 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.27 m in water depth estimation in the shallow water of Chabahar Bay in the Oman Sea. Additionally, the higher impact and interaction of the morphological features were verified using XAI for water depth mapping.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil phosphorous sorption parameters (PSPs) using environmental variables and machine learning algorithms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study some soil phosphorous sorption parameters (PSPs) by using different machine learning models (Cubist (Cu), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM) and Gaussian process regression (GPR)) were predicted. The results showed that using the topographic attributes as the sole auxiliary variables was not adequate for predicting the PSPs. However, remote sensing data and its combination with soil properties were reliably used to predict PSPs (R (2) =0.41 for MBC by RF model, R (2)=0.49 for PBC by Cu model, R (2)=0.37 for SPR by Cu model, and R (2)=0.38 for SBC by RF model). The lowest RMSE values were obtained for MBC by RF model, PBC by SVM model, SPR by Cubist model and SBC by RF model. The results also showed that remote sensing data as the easily available datasets could reliably predict PSPs in the given study area. The outcomes of variable importance analysis revealed that among the soil properties cation exchange capacity (CEC) and clay content, and among the remote sensing indices B5/B7, Midindex, Coloration index, Saturation index, and OSAVI were the most imperative factors for predicting PSPs. Further studies are recommended to use other proximally sensed data to improve PSPs prediction to precise decision-making throughout the landscape.

TI  - An adaptive spectral index for carbonate rocks using OLI Landsat-8 imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate characterization of carbonate rocks is crucial for determining the potential for exploring outcrops in the oil industry. Modern remote sensing instruments have played an important role in estimating mineral characteristics in the most varied scales. However, mathematical expressions suggested for converting radiance values to mineral information are often designed to work in only one particular territory. At the same time, the few general solutions existing tend to achieve overall poor results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive approach to estimate subpixel amounts of carbonate rocks using OLI-Landsat 8 image data. The main formulation is derived from exhaustive analysis of the spectral behavior of several carbonate materials. The formulation is subsequently adapted through the use of a genetic algorithm to work on diverse situations. Experiments have demonstrated the adaptability of the method for different environments, as well as its higher performance when compared with existing carbonate indices.

TI  - Prediction of land use and land cover change in two watersheds in the Senegal River basin (West Africa) using the Multilayer Perceptron and Markov chain model
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and Land cover change (LULCC) is a major global problem, and projecting change is critical for policy decision-making. Understanding LULCCs at the watershed level is essential for transboundary river basin management. The present study aims to analyse the past and future LULCCs in two significant watersheds of the Senegal River basin (SRB) in West Africa: Bafing and Faleme. This study used Landsat images from 1986, 2006 and 2020 and the Random Forest classification method to analyze past LULCCs in these two watersheds. The results revealed: In Bafing, vegetation, settlement, agricultural areas and water increased, while the bareground decreased significantly between 1986-2020. In Faleme, two periods have different trends. Between 1986-2006, vegetation, settlement, agricultural areas and water increased, while bareground decreased. Between 2006-2020, settlement increased, while vegetation, agricultural areas, water and bareground decreased. To predict LULCCs in 2050 under business-as-usual assumptions, the Multilayer Perceptron and Marcov Chain model (MLP-MC) was used. The MLP-MC shows better results on Bafing than on Faleme but without questioning its application on the two watersheds. Bafing has seen a trend towards "more people, more trees", while Faleme has seen a trend towards "more people, more deforestation". These results contribute to develop appropriate land management policies and strategies to achieve or to maintain sustainable development in the SRB.

TI  - Surveillance of severe maternal morbidity and maternal mortality in maternity hospitals of the Latin American and Caribbean network - Red CLAP: study protocol
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustained reduction in maternal mortality in America underlines the need to analyse women who survived a complication that could have been fatal if appropriate and timely care had not been taken. Analysis of maternal near-miss (MNM) cases, as well as potentially life-threatening conditions (PLTC), are considered indicators for monitoring the quality of maternal care. The specific objective of this study protocol is to develop a surveillance system for PLTC, MNM and maternal mortality, as primary outcomes, in Latin American and Caribbean maternal healthcare institutions. Secondarily, the study was designed to identify factors associated with these conditions and estimate how often key evidence-based interventions were used for managing severe maternal morbidity. This is a multicenter cross-sectional study with prospective data collection. The target population consists of all women admitted to health centres participating in the network during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period. Variables describing the sequence of events that may result in a PLTC, MNM or maternal death are recorded. Relevant quality control is carried out to ensure the quality of the database and confidentiality. Centres with approximately 2,500 annual deliveries will be included to achieve a sufficient number of cases for calculation of indicators. The frequency of outcome measures for PLTC, MNM and maternal mortality and their confidence intervals and differences between groups will be calculated using the most appropriate statistical tests. Similar procedures will be performed with variables describing the use of evidence-based practices. Networking creates additional possibilities for global information management and interaction between different research groups. Lessons can be learned and shared, generating scientific knowledge to address relevant health problems throughout the region with provision of efficient data management.

TI  - Detecting semi-arid forest decline using time series of Landsat data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting forest decline is crucial for effective forest management in arid and semi-arid regions. Remote sensing using satellite image time series is useful for identifying reduced photosynthetic activity caused by defoliation. However, current studies face limitations in detecting forest decline in sparse semi-arid forests. In this study, three Landsat time-series-based approaches were used to distinguish non-declining and declining forest patches in the Zagros forests. The random forest was the most accurate approach, followed by anomaly detection and the Sen's slope approach, with an overall accuracy of 0.75 (kappa = 0.50), 0.65 (kappa = 0.30), and 0.64 (kappa = 0.30), respectively. The classification results were unaffected by the Landsat acquisition times, indicating that rather, environmental variables may have contributed to the separation of declining and non-declining areas and not the remotely sensed spectral signal of the trees. We conclude that identifying declining forest patches in semi-arid regions using Landsat data is challenging. This difficulty arises from weak vegetation signals caused by limited canopy cover before a bright soil background, which makes it challenging to detect modest degradation signals. Additional environmental variables may be necessary to compensate for these limitations.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of operational land imager sensor on board landsat 8 and landsat 9 for land use land cover mapping over a heterogeneous landscape
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its advent in 1972, the Landsat satellites have witnessed consistent improvements in sensor characteristics, which have significantly improved accuracy. In this study, a comparison of the accuracy of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and OLI-2 satellites in land use land cover (LULC) mapping has been made. For this, image fusion techniques have been applied to enhance the spatial resolution of both OLI and OLI-2 multispectral images, and then a support vector machine (SVM) classifier has been used for LULC mapping. The results show that LULC classification from OLI-2 has better accuracy than OLI. The validation of classified LULC maps shows that the OLI-2 data is more accurate in distinguishing dense and sparse vegetation as well as darker and lighter objects. The relationship between LULC maps and surface biophysical parameters using Local Moran's I also shows better performance of the OLI-2 sensor in LULC mapping than the OLI sensor.

TI  - Multi-temporal InSAR and Sentinel-1 for assessing land surface movement of Joshimath town, India
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - This study deals with the spatio-temporal measurement of land movement in Joshimath town using multi-temporal SBAS-InSAR technique. A network of 424 small-baseline interferograms was generated using 111 Sentinel-1 images acquired during May 2019-April 2023. Spatial distribution of line of sight displacement (LOSD) shows south-eastern Pekamarwadi, southern Gandhinagar and central Sunil wards are majorly affected; Manoharbagh, Singhdhar, and Lowerbazar moderately affected; northern Ravigram minor affected; and Parsari ward has no sign of land movement during investigation period. The observed negative values of mean LOS velocity and acceleration in southern Gandhinagar and central Sunil indicate these patchy areas are still susceptible and riskier for land stability. The SBAS-InSAR results were validated with CORS data during January 2022-March 2023. Trends show the gradual increase in LOSD from January to November 2022, rapid increase started from November 2022 and nearly ended mid January 2023, which indicates the initiation of movement stabilization. Accuracy assessment was performed in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), R 2 , RMSE, and MAE, and the estimated values are 0.9896, 0.9495, 1.7534 cm, and 1.4028 cm, respectively. The analysis supports that CORS and SBAS-InSAR observed LOSD are in good agreement and reveals the true story of the land movement of Joshimath.

TI  - Unlocking the hidden potential: groundwater zone mapping using AHP, remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater resource problems are increasing development and planning challenges due to climate change and overexploitation, necessitating assessments of their potential and productivity. The study area has been facing a groundwater level decline problem for many years, and these results can help increase the groundwater level in the basaltic rock area. In this research, we have worked on the demarcation and suitability of groundwater potential zones using GIS and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) methods for the Urmodi River Basin. This research prepared eight thematic maps, that is, geomorphology, geology, drainage density, land use/land cover, elevation, lineament density and slope from satellite data and GIS methods, which play a primary factor in determining the proper groundwater potential zones. In this study, every thematic map was allocated weights depending on its specific characteristics and contribution to the groundwater potential capacity. The weights were determined using the AHP method, which considers the comparative significance of every layer about others. This weighting procedure allowed for a comprehensive assessment of the factors influencing groundwater potential in the Urmodi River basin. The resulting groundwater potential map was divided into four classes, that is, good, excellent, moderate, and poor. The study revealed that approximately 22.69% of the basin had excellent groundwater potential, 28.96% had good potential, 25.32% had moderate potential, and 22.92% had poor potential. These study findings suggest that a significant portion of the Urmodi River Basin exhibits good to moderate groundwater potential, indicating promising opportunities for sustainable groundwater utilization in the region. The groundwater potential zone map accuracy is 84% based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) method. These results can have implications for sustainable groundwater resources and provide a framework for conducting similar assessments in other regions. The results can be more important for sustainable development goals and helpful in increasing groundwater levels in the area.

TI  - HiLPD-GEE: high spatial resolution land productivity dynamics calculation tool using Landsat and MODIS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land productivity is one of the sub-indicators for measuring SDG 15.3.1. Land Productivity Dynamics (LPD) is the most popular approach for reporting this indicator at the global scale. A major limitation of existing products of LPD is the coarse spatial resolution caused by remote sensing data input, which cannot meet the requirement of fine-scale land degradation assessment. To resolve this problem, this study developed a tool (HiLPD-GEE) to calculate 30 m LPD by fusing Landsat and MODIS data based on Google Earth Engine (GEE). The tool generates high-quality fused Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset for LPD calculation through gap filling and Savitzky-Golay filtering (GF-SG) and then uses the method recommended by the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) to calculate LPD. The tool can calculate 30 m LPD in any spatial range within any time window after 2013, supporting global land degradation monitoring. To demonstrate the applicability of this tool, the LPD product was produced for African Great Green Wall (GGW) countries. The analysis proves that the 30 m LPD product generated by HiLPD-GEE could reflect the land productivity change effectively and reflect more spatial details. The results also provide an important insight for the GGW initiative.

AB  - High resolution satellite images are becoming increasingly available for urban multi-temporal semantic understanding. However, few datasets can be used for land-use/land-cover (LULC) classification, binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) simultaneously because classification datasets always have one time phase and BCD datasets focus only on the changed location, ignoring the changed classes. Public SCD datasets are rare but much needed. To solve the above problems, a tri-temporal SCD dataset made up of Gaofen-2 (GF-2) remote sensing imagery (with 11 LULC classes and 60 change directions) was built in this study, namely, the Wuhan Urban Semantic Understanding (WUSU) dataset. Popular deep learning based methods for LULC classification, BCD and SCD are tested to verify the reliability of WUSU. A Siamese-based multi-task joint framework with a multi-task joint loss (MJ loss) named ChangeMJ is proposed to restore the object boundaries and obtains the best results in LULC classification, BCD and SCD, compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Finally, a large spatial-scale mapping for Wuhan central urban area is carried out to verify that the WUSU dataset and the ChangeMJ framework have good application values.

TI  - Total land suitability analysis for rice and potato crops through FuzzyAHP technique in West Bengal, India
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - A total land suitability analysis was carried out through FuzzyAHP technique for rice and potato crops in West Bengal, India. Around 21 most relevant crop suitability parameters were selected and classified under five primary criteria, such as terrain distribution parameter, static soil parameter, available soil nutrient, agriculture practice parameter, and local variation parameter for the study. The factors such as NDVI and SAVI values were estimated from Sentinel 2B images in "SNAP" toolbox software environment, whereas soil nutrients were estimated through standard laboratory methods. Individual parameter weights were assigned through the FuzzyAHP technique for sub-criteria as well as for primary criteria. The final crop suitability map was developed showing nearly 20% of the total area as highly suitable for rice crop, whereas nearly 39% of the area was found suitable for the potato crop. Comparing the prediction map with yield distribution, it was found that the southwest region of the study area is very suitable for both rice and potato crop with higher crop yields in the range of 5 t/ha and 20 t/ha, respectively. Six different machine learning models, namely random forest, support vector machine, AdaBoost, extreme gradient boosting, logistic regression, and naive Bayes, were utilized for validation of the suitability maps. The support vector machine (SVM) learning model with the highest AUC (similar to 80%) was found efficient for testing both rice and potato crop suitability. The economic status of farmers can be rejuvenated by selecting the best crop rotation through land suitability analysis.

TI  - Agricultural drought dynamics in China during 1982-2020: a depiction with satellite remotely sensed soil moisture
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought (AD) is a serious threat to food security for many regions worldwide. Understanding the dynamics of AD contributes to preventing or mitigating its adverse impacts. Soil moisture (SM) anomaly is a relatively straightforward indicator of AD. However, most of the previous studies on AD dynamics of China were conducted with non-remotely sensed SM indicators due to the lack of long-term and spatial-continuous SM datasets. Here, such an SM dataset was created by enhancing a satellite remote sensing SM dataset with a machine learning method XGBoost, various remote sensing datasets, and some surface or meteorological parameters from reanalysis data. The new SM dataset has a period of 1982-2020, a spatial resolution of 0.25 & DEG;, and a temporal resolution of 1 month. Furthermore, Standardized SM Index at one-month scale (SSMI1) was calculated, and AD events were identified using the SSMI1 and a 3-dimensional clustering method. Results demonstrated that 1) the new SM presented comparable or even better performances with the original SM as evaluated with spatial distributions, in-situ SM observations, and manufactured data gaps. 2) The AD was most frequent in North China, followed by the western parts of East China, Northeast, and Southwest China. The centroids of identified AD events were found chiefly in the Northeast, North, Southwest, and western parts of East China. 3) The severity of AD events presented a decreasing trend from 1982 to 2020, while significant drying trends were found mostly in the southern parts of North China, western parts of East China, and Southwest China. 4) The AD dynamics revealed in this study are basically consistent with other studies but also have unique features such as more space details and less drought frequency and count than that of meteorological drought. Further studies are expected to create a long-term satellite SM with faster timeliness, higher resolution, and greater depth.

TI  - Multimodal multiscale characterization of cascading hazard on mountain terrain
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme precipitation (rain or/and snow) in upstream areas of the Himalayan region often triggers water and sediment hazards, including flash floods, landslides, debris flow, and river damming. These hazards often interact with the environmental and human systems, resulting in acute and chronic disasters that deleteriously impact the economy, infrastructure, and livelihoods. As cascading and compound hazards become more common in the Himalayan region, a more holistic approach is needed to understand the complex interaction among human, natural, and engineered systems and tackle problems connected to several system constraints. Recent catastrophes like the 2021 Melamchi disaster cannot be attributed to a single cause; rather, they result from several geomorphologic and hydroclimatic factors and physical processes. Individual and interacting dynamics and their cascading and compounding effects occurred in various settings, from high elevations to river valleys along the Melamchi River. This study diagnoses the likely causal effects of hydroclimatic processes of the 2021 Melamchi disaster by integrating space-borne remotely sensed data, hydrologic and hydrodynamic modeling, and machine learning techniques. We have evaluated several scenarios of landslide damming and breaching and analyzed flooding impacts on major settlements across the Melamchi River. Model outputs evaluated using satellite flood imagery, field-based surveys, and published reports were used to understand the characteristics of the 2021 Melamchi disaster. We find that earlier rain episodes had saturated the soil and increased the river's water level. Therefore, after the outburst of the landslide dam coupled with heavy downpours, a sudden release of huge water had enormous energy to inundate vast areas of flood plains and damaged settlements near riverbanks far downstream up to the Melamchi Bazar. It was not just one extreme event that led to the devastation but a series of non-extreme events. This further reinforces the idea that not just extreme events, but several not-extreme series of events may lead to disaster. Thus, the chances of such a sequence of cascading events must be investigated for risk computation along with extreme events.

TI  - A multi-scale classification method for rocky desertification mapping in the red-bed area of northwestern, Jiangxi, China
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the monitoring of rocky desertification(RD) is concentrated in the karst area, whereas the study in red-bed areas is rare. In this paper, we present a multi-scale classification framework for RD monitoring based on spectral-spatial features. At the pixel scale, we explored several spectral indices based on spectral statistics and separability analysis of land cover samples. The homogeneous land covers were classified by the decision rules from the selected spectral indices (such as NDIOI, NRRI and NDGI); At the patch scale, RD classes were further distinguished by spatial decision rules based on multiple neighborhood features including proximity, linear density, and buffer distance. The method was applied on an OLI image over the red-bed area of northwestern Jiangxi, south central China, and validated using ground-based observations. The experimental results of verification and comparison are satisfactory. This work demonstrates a methodological supplement to the monitoring of red bed RD.

TI  - Integrated use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and open-source machine learning algorithms for burnt and unburnt scars
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - This research compares the use of the SAR (Sentinel-1) and Optical (Sentinel-2) sensors in identifying and mapping burnt and unburnt scars are rising during a bushfire in southeastern Australia and Margalla Hills, Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2019 and 2020. In order to evaluate the backscatter strength along with the Polarimetric decomposition portion, the C-band dual-polarized Sentinel-1 data was investigated to determine the magnitude of the burnt areas of forest cover in the study area. We could derive texture measurements from locally-based statistics using the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and the backscatter coefficient. This was because of how well it picked up on differences in texture between burned and unburned scars. In contrast, Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing was employed to evaluate the extent of the burnt intensity levels for both regions utilizing the differential Normalized Burnt Ratio (dNBR). A Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Markov Random Field (MRF) classifier were utilized to investigate the study's context. The ideal smoothing parameter is the result of incorporating the image's spectral characteristics and spatial meaning. Sentinel-2 images were used as a foundation for both the test and training datasets, which were built from images of both unburned and burned areas broken down pixel by pixel. In both types, including spectral sensitivity and sensitivity of Polarimetric for the two groups identified after classification, the experimental findings showed a clear association between them. The algorithm's efficiency was evaluated using the kappa coefficient and F-score calculation. Except for Sentinel-1 data in Pakistan, all fire areas have more than 0.80 accuracies. The highest precision of both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 was also provided by the performance of users' and producers' accuracy. The entropy alpha decomposition helped define the target given by the H-a plane based on its physical properties. After the burn, the entropy and alpha values diminished and formed a pattern. However, the findings in this field validate the effectiveness of SAR sensors data and optical satellite in forest applications. The related sensitivity is highly dependent on the composition of the landscape, the geographical nature of the study area, and the severity of the burn.

TI  - Improving the accuracy of the Water Detect algorithm using Sentinel-2, Planetscope and sharpened imagery: a case study in an intermittent river
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping surface water using remotely sensed optical imagery is a particular challenge in intermittent rivers because water contracts down to narrow linear features and isolated pools, which require accurate water detection methods and reliable image datasets. Of the many methods that use optical sensors to identify water, the Water Detect algorithm stands out as one of the best options due to its classification accuracy, open-source code, and because it does not require ancillary data. However, in the original study, the Water Detect algorithm was only tested with Sentinel-2 imagery. High-resolution and high-frequency imagery, such as Planetscope, combined with sharpening and band synthesizing techniques have the potential to improve the accuracy of surface water mapping, but their benefit to the Water Detect algorithm remains unknown. Uncertainty also exists about the extent to which different input parameters (i.e. maximum clustering and regularization) influence the accuracy of Water Detect. Practitioners seeking to map surface water in intermittent rivers need guidance on a best-practice approach to improve the accuracy of Water Detect. To meet this need, we automated an existing method for sharpening and synthesizing bands and applied it to a series of multispectral Sentinel-2 and Planetscope images. We then developed a sensitivity analysis algorithm that compared the accuracy for all possible combinations of input parameters in a given range for the water detection process - enabling optimal parameters to be identified. We applied this workflow to an 81 km stretch of the lower Fitzroy River (Western Australia) to periods when spatial water extent varied markedly, i.e. mid-wet (February), early-dry (June), and late-dry season (October), across three years with variable wet season flow. We found that the ability to accurately detect surface water using multispectral imagery was increased by using input parameters identified by the sensitivity analysis and using Visible + Near-infrared (VNIR) bands, with relatively little gained by image sharpening unless the area of interest was burnt or experienced considerable shading. Also, the regularization parameter exerted less influence on results than maximum clustering. Importantly, the accuracy of the Water Detect algorithm can vary drastically if input parameters are not calibrated to local conditions. Results also revealed that our approach was adept at detecting linear features in intermittent rivers. We recommend that practitioners using Water Detect to identify surface water undertake a workflow similar to that described here to improve the accuracy of the Water Detect algorithm. The automated routines provided by this study will significantly assist practitioners in doing so. Increasing the accuracy with which we detect and map water in intermittent rivers will improve our understanding and management of these important systems which are under increasing threat.

TI  - Forecasting monthly soil moisture at broad spatial scales in sub-Saharan Africa using three time-series models: evidence from four decades of remotely sensed data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a critical environmental variable that determines primary productivity and contributes to climatic processes. It is, therefore, important to forecast soil moisture to inform expectations of derivative outputs reliably. While forecasting soil moisture continues to advance, there is a need to extend it to different geoclimatic regions, including in sub-Saharan Africa, where livelihoods predominantly rely on subsistence agriculture. We used remotely sensed soil moisture data produced by the European Space Agency - Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI). The data, which covered the period 1978 to 2019, were used to forecast monthly soil moisture in different agroecological zones and land cover types. The Seasonal Random Walk, Exponential Smoothing and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) forecasting models were trained on 70% of the data (November 1978 - August 2007) and subsequently applied to a test dataset (September 2007 - December 2019). All models showed solid prediction accuracies for all agroecological zones (unbiased root mean square error, ubRMSE = 0.05 m(3) m(-3)) and land cover types (ubRMSE = 0.04 m(3) m(-3)). This was corroborated by similarities in season-adjusted anomalies between observed and forecasted soil moisture for nearly all agroecological zones and land cover types, with a correlation coefficient of r> 0.5 for most locations). The broad-scale interpretation of soil moisture forecasting can inform moisture availability and variability by regions; however, more research is encouraged to improve forecasting at spatially and temporally detailed levels to assist small-scale farming practices in the continent.

TI  - A shape-attention Pivot-Net for identifying central pivot irrigation systems from satellite images using a cloud computing platform: an application in the contiguous US
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forty percent of global food production relies upon irrigation, which accounts for 70% of total global freshwater use. Thus, the mapping of cropland irrigation plays a significant role in agricultural water management and estimating food production. However, current spaceborne irrigated cropland mapping is highly reliant upon its spectral behavior, which often has high uncertainty and lacks information about the method of irrigation. Deep learning (DL) allows for the classification of irrigated cropland according to unique spatial patterns, such as the central pivot irrigation system (CPIS). But convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are usually biased toward color and texture features, a spatial transferable and accurate CPIS identification model is lacking owing to previous model seldom involves the round shapes of CPIS, which is usually key to distinguishing CPIS. To address this lack, we proposed a shape attention neural network by integrating spatial-attention gate, residual block, and multi-task learning, Pivot-Net, to incorporate shape information identify CPIS in satellite imagery. Specifically, we employed CPIS in Kansas to train our model using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical images. We found that Pivot-Net is superior to seven state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models on second-stage validation. We also evaluated the performance of Pivot-Net at three validation sites, which had an average F-1-score and mean IOU of 90.68% and 90.45%, respectively, which further demonstrated the high accuracy of the proposed model. Moreover, to show that the proposed Pivot-Net can map CPIS at the country scale, we generated the first CPIS map at 30 m for the contiguous US using a cloud computing platform and our Pivot-Net model. The total CPIS area for the contiguous US was 61,094 km(2) in 2018, which comprised 26.22% of all irrigated lands. Our results can be accessed at . Therefore, the proposed shape-attention Pivot-Net demonstrates the ability to classify CPIS at large spatial scales and are feasible to map CPIS at national scales.

TI  - Optimizing satellite ground station facilities scheduling for RSGS: a novel model and algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As the rapid increasing of the number of the satellites, the number of facilities of the satellite ground stations is becoming insufficient and the conflicts of serving satellite data missions exist. To make full use of the facilities of the China Remote Sensing Satellite Ground Station (RSGS), scheduling optimization of these facilities was studied in this paper, which was not well-solved by the original method in the operation system of RSGS. The problem is formulated as a continuous time-based mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. A decomposition optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the large-scale problem, which is difficult to solve using traditional methods. In the first step, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the multi-ground station relay tasks, and the multi-ground station optimization problem is transformed into several single ground station optimization problems. Next, in two additional steps, optimization of the facilities at a single ground station is performed to further reduce the size of the model. The proposed method has been applied to operations systems of RSGS, and the approach presented in this article has demonstrated stable performance and sufficient efficiency online, resulting in the automation of facility scheduling.

TI  - MSCANet: multiscale context information aggregation network for Tibetan Plateau lake extraction from remote sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Qinghai-Tibet Plateau lakes are important carriers of water resources in the 'Asian's Water Tower', and it is of great significance to grasp the spatial distribution of plateau lakes for the climate, ecological environment, and regional water cycle. However, the differences in spatial-spectral characteristics of various types of plateau lakes, and the complex background information of plateau both influence the extraction effect of lakes. Therefore, it is a great challenge to completely and effectively extract plateau lakes. In this study, we proposed a multiscale contextual information aggregation network, termed MSCANet, to automatically extract Plateau lake regions. It consists of three main components: a multiscale lake feature encoder, a feature decoder, and a Multicore Pyramid Pooling Module (MPPM). The multiscale lake feature encoder suppressed noise interference to capture multiscale spatial-spectral information from heterogeneous scenes. The MPPM module aggregated the contextual information of various lakes globally. We applied the MSCANet to the lake extraction of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau based on Google data; additionally, comparative experiments showed that the MSCANet proposed had obvious improvement in lake detection accuracy and morphological integrity. Finally, we transferred the pre-trained optimal model to the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A dataset to verify the generalization of the MSCANet.

TI  - Evaluation of common reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) bed changes in the context of management using earth observation and automatic threshold
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is no easy in situ way to monitor large waterbodies for their aquatic vegetation change, especially during mowing works. The objective of this study is to choose the best automatic workflow that would estimate a change in the reed bed area and density over time. This workflow will assess the mowing effect on reeds over 3 years in the Plateliai Lake (Lithuania). Sentinel-2/MSI images were used to derive reed beds using water adjusted vegetation index (WAVI) and normalised difference water index (NDWI). The indices were classified using seven different binary thresholding algorithms. Results were validated with orthophotos gathered from unmanned aerial vehicle surveys in mowed regions and one reference area. Analysis demonstrated that using the NDWI together with the Yen thresholding algorithm generated the best accuracy results, with the highest accuracy resulting with high vegetation areas where the area under the curve values were 0.85 +/- 0.17. The changes in estimated density did not show a significant correlation between mowed and reference areas and years. The results indicate that Sentinel-2/MSI is a feasible tool for the evaluation of reed bed change. On this basis, it is recommended to implement it as an additional monitoring tool that covers larger areas than in situ monitoring.

TI  - Using remote sensing for exposure and seismic vulnerability evaluation: is it reliable?
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conducting field surveys for exposure and seismic vulnerability evaluation is the most costly, resource-intensive task when assessing earthquake risk. During the past decade, risk analysts have been trying to alleviate this using remote sensing for building characterization. However, the use of vulnerability databases created with remote sensing had not been sufficiently validated thus far. In this paper, we have created an exposure and seismic vulnerability database in Port Prince (Haiti) using freely accessible aerial ortho-imagery and LiDAR points. We have validated this database against two reference datasets from different, independent studies. Then, we have computed an earthquake damage scenario to test whether remotely sensed data are actually valid for seismic risk evaluation. We have seen how our vulnerability database yields an accurate damage distribution with a low Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 3.78% when compared to the damage obtained with the reference vulnerability dataset. Further, we have conducted a thorough comparison of the cost that entails creating a vulnerability database using remote sensing with a traditional field survey. Twelve international experts have collaborated in the cost estimation of a typical in-field building inspection. As a result, we have found that using remote sensing techniques allows for saving up to 75% of the cost and 85% of the time. These outcomes seem to prove both, the technical and economic feasibility of remote sensing for seismic vulnerability assessment. Thus, we have proposed a 5-step approach for evaluating building vulnerability that combines both, the analysis of remotely sensed data and a reduced, targeted field survey to optimize time and cost. The final goal is to help cities reach the Sustainable Development Goal nr. 11.B to increase their resilience against disasters.

TI  - Decadal assessment of agricultural drought in the context of land use land cover change using MODIS multivariate spectral index time-series data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a multivariate drought index that incorporates important environmental variables and is suitable for a specific geographical region is essential to fully understanding the pattern and impacts of drought severity. This study applied feature scaling algorithms to MODIS time-series imagery to develop an integrated Multivariate Drought Index (iMDI). The iMDI incorporates the vegetation condition index (VCI), the temperature condition index (TCI), and the evaporative stress index (ESI). The 54,474 km(2) Vietnamese Central Highlands region, which has been significantly affected by drought severity for several decades, was selected as a test site to assess the feasibility of the iMDI. Spearman correlation between the iMDI and other commonly used spectral drought indices (i.e. the Drought Severity Index (DSI-12) and the annual Vegetation Health Index (VHI-12)) and ground-based drought indices (i.e. the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-12) and the Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI-12)) was employed to evaluate performance of the proposed drought index. Pixel-based linear regression together with clustering models of the iMDI time-series was applied to characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of drought from 2001 to 2020. In addition, a persistent area of LULC types (i.e. forests, croplands, and shrubland) during the 2001-2020 period was used to understand drought variation in relation to LULC. Results suggested that the iMDI outperformed the other spectral drought indices (r > 0.6; p < 0.005). The analysis revealed an increase in drought risk in some provinces of the Central Highlands including Gia Lai, Kon Tum, and Dak Lak. It was also found that changes in LULC patterns could minimize (reforestation) or exacerbate (deforestation) the impacts of drought. Our study suggests that applying a multivariate drought index enables a better understanding of drought patterns at the local scale. This provides valuable information for the development of appropriate land and environmental management practices that can affect and mitigate climate change effects.

TI  - Sentinel-2 mapping of a turbid intertidal seagrass meadow in Southern Vietnam
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems are crucial to the carbon cycle, biodiversity, fisheries, and erosion prevention. However, there are gaps in mapping seagrass in tropical coastal waters due to turbidity and constantly changing tidal dynamics. To tackle such issues, tidal heights and reflectance of 33 Sentinel-2 images were used to calculate a multitemporal composite of Sentinel-2 images, which was classified using the Random Forest classifier. UAV images classified with Object-based image analysis provided ground truth for training and validation. The effectiveness of water column correction and using the multitemporal composite was evaluated by comparing overall classification accuracy. As a result, applying water column correction improved classification accuracy from 80.4% to 80.6%, while using the multi-temporal composite improved accuracy to 88.6%, among the highest accuracy achieved for seagrass classification in turbid waters. The combined protocol could lead to advances in quantifying seagrass distribution in the tropical coastal waters and their carbon sequestration capacity, resolving significant uncertainties in blue carbon estimation.

TI  - How a basement fault has controlled Pb- Zn ore deposition within the Zagros Fold-Thrust Belt? a focus on remote sensing approaches
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zagros fold and thrust belt as one of the structurally complex areas have been considered chiefly only for hydrocarbon reserves, despite having other mineral deposits like the Surmeh lead and Zinc mine. This study was conducted in the Fars region, one of the structural zones in the Zagros, to detect hydrothermal alteration minerals associated with Pb-Zn mineralization and fracture distribution using ASTER, Landsat 8, and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery. Using different algorithms and approaches, we demonstrate the interesting distribution of Pb-Zn-related mineral deposits controlled by structures on different scales. These methods included the spectral band ratios and spectral angle mapping for alteration detection and manual extraction of structural lineaments (i.e. fault and fractures) from ETM+. Also, an augmented circular scanline method, along with areal sampling, was used to prepare a fracture intensity map of the area. According to the results, the intersection of NW-SE and N-S trending fracture sets are promising areas for Pb-Zn-related mineral exploration. These fracture sets are likely associated with the main Karebas tear fault and its horsetail splay terminal. The findings of this study were validated by field observation of the Pb-Zn deposit and its related mineral associations in the area.

TI  - Enhanced-resolution reconstruction for the China-France Oceanography Satellite scatterometer
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The China-France Oceanography Satellite SCATterometer (CSCAT) can observe radar backscatter values on the same sea surface at multiple incidence angles, and is often used to estimate the ocean near-surface wind. However, CSCAT utilizes a novel scanning mechanism and the wind vector cell has a spatial resolution is 25 km or 12.5 km, which limit the study of high-resolution land and sea ice monitoring. To address this issue, this paper constructs a geometric model of the main lobe-to-ground projection relationship and generates the enhanced-resolution radar images. CSCAT data are applied to three main image reconstruction algorithms (SIR, AART, and MART), and experiments are performed in the Iceland and Hudson Bay, and verified by Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data. The experiments show the geometric model for CSCAT improves the spatial resolution from traditional 25 km to 5 km, and the SIR-reconstructed images are characterized by higher accuracy and better suppression of noise than are those obtained with the AART and MART methods. Therefore, this study extends the application of domestic remote sensors and provides data support for high-resolution applications, such as land and sea ice monitoring.

TI  - Winter remote sensing images are more suitable for forest mapping in Jiangxi Province
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Jiangxi Province boasts the second-highest forest coverage in China. Its forests play a crucial role in providing essential ecosystem services and maintaining the ecological health of the region. High-resolution and high-precision forest mapping are significant in the timely and accurate monitoring of dynamic forest changes to support sustainable forest management. This study used Sentinel-2 images from four seasons in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to map forest distribution. Moreover, the classification results were compared and analyzed using different classification algorithms and feature-variable combinations. Based on the overall accuracy, the optimal image seasonality, feature combinations and classification algorithms were selected, and the forest maps of Jiangxi Province were mapped from 2019 to 2021. The accuracy evaluation showed that the winter image classification results had the highest accuracy (above 0.88). The red edge bands carried by Sentinel-2 could effectively improve the classification accuracy. The Random Forest classifier is the optimal classification algorithm for forest mapping in Jiangxi Province. The forest mapping obtained can be used for ecological health assessment and ecosystem function. The study provides a scientific basis for accurate and timely extraction of forest cover and can serve as a valuable resource for forest management planning and future research.

TI  - Evaluating expressway stability using interferometric synthetic aperture radar and measuring its impact on the occurrence of geohazards: a case study of Shanxi Province, China
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study designs a coherence-based multi-master-image stacking InSAR workflow as an efficient large-scale expressway stability monitoring method, which can improve the overall coherence and number of interferometric pairs via multi-master-image stacking and an average coherence threshold. The average annual ground deformation rate of Shanxi Province, China, was determined using Sentinel-1A data from 2017 to 2021 with a parallel processing strategy to improve efficiency. Compared to global navigation satellite system data, the InSAR results have a root mean square error of 2.90 mm/year. To evaluate the relationship between different factors and the occurrence of geohazards along the expressway network, we conducted a binary logistic regression analysis. The result shows that the deformation rate, annual precipitation, bedrock hardness, distance to stream, and traffic load are significantly related to the occurrence of geohazards along the expressway network in Shanxi Province, among which the deformation rate has the highest significant value, while the traffic load has the lowest, indicating that using InSAR alone to determine geohazards along expressway network is biased and it takes more than InSAR to conduct a comprehensive yet accurate expressway geohazard vulnerability evaluation. This study provides guidance for the road maintenance to ensure the safe operation of expressway systems.

TI  - Ocean surface currents estimated from satellite remote sensing data based on a global hexagonal grid
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global ocean surface currents estimated from satellite derived data based on a regular global grid are affected by the grid's shape and placement. Due to different neighbourhood relationships, the rectangular lat/lon grids lose accuracy when interpolating and fitting elevation data. Hexagonal grids have shown to be advantageous due to their isotropic, uniform neighbourhood. Considering these merits, this paper aims to estimate global ocean surface current using a global isotropic hexagonal grid from satellite remote sensing data. First, gridded satellite altimeter data and wind data with different resolutions are interpolated into the centre of the global isotropic hexagonal grid. Then, geostrophic and Ekman currents components are estimated according to the Lagerlof Ocean currents theory. Finally, the inversion results are verified. By analyzing the results, we conclude that the ocean surface currents estimated based on the global isotropic hexagonal grid have considerable accuracy, with improvement over rectangular lat/lon grids.

TI  - Regression-based surface water fraction mapping using a synthetic spectral library for monitoring small water bodies
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Small water bodies (SWBs), such as ponds and on-farm reservoirs, are a key part of the hydrological system and play important roles in diverse domains from agriculture to conservation. The monitoring of SWBs has been greatly facilitated by medium-spatial-resolution satellite images, but the monitoring accuracy is considerably affected by the mixed-pixel problem. Although various spectral unmixing methods have been applied to map sub-pixel surface water fractions for large water bodies, such as lakes and reservoirs, it is challenging to map SWBs that are small in size relative to the image pixel and have dissimilar spectral properties. In this study, a novel regression-based surface water fraction mapping method (RSWFM) using a random forest and a synthetic spectral library is proposed for mapping 10 m spatial resolution surface water fractions from Sentinel-2 imagery. The RSWFM inputs a few endmembers of water, vegetation, impervious surfaces, and soil to simulate a spectral library, and considers spectral variations in endmembers for different SWBs. Additionally, RSWFM applies noise-based data augmentation on pure endmembers to overcome the limitation often arising from the use of a small set of pure spectra in training the regression model. RSWFM was assessed in ten study sites and compared with the fully constrained least squares (FCLS) linear spectral mixture analysis, multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), and the nonlinear random forest (RF) regression without data-augmentation. The results showed that RSWFM decreases the water fraction mapping errors by similar to 30%, similar to 15%, and similar to 11% in root mean square error compared with the linear FCLS, MESMA unmixings, and the nonlinear RF regression without data-augmentation respectively. RSWFM has an accuracy of approximately 0.85 in R-2 in estimating the area of SWBs smaller than 1 ha.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and unified information from the increasingly remote sensing (RS) scenes is important for RS applications in multi-sectoral association services of natural resource management. However, these applications in mountain areas are limited by the challenging issues of random geometric distortions and erroneous spatial associations. The paper introduces digital elevation model (DEM) maps as a unified geographic reference to search and match homonymy ground points (HGPs). The proposed computer-based procedure was tested with Landsat TM, ETM and HJ-1B satellite images using ASTER global DEM in the Longitudinal Rang-gorge Valley Region of Southwest China. 1322, 3551 and 694 pairs of HGPs were identified and acquired the geometric accuracies with 43 m (TM), 14 m (ETM) and 123 m (HJ), respectively. The deviations are significantly reduced and the disjoint ground objects are matched. The study satisfies the application requirement of multispectral satellite imagery with less labour and time costs.

TI  - Virtual image-based cloud removal for Landsat images
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The inevitable thick cloud contamination in Landsat images has severely limited the usability and applications of these images. Developing cloud removal algorithms has been a hot research topic in recent years. Many previous algorithms used one or multiple cloud-free image(s) in the same area acquired on other date(s) as reference image(s) to reconstruct missing pixel values. However, it remains challenging to determine the optimal reference image(s). In addition, abrupt land cover change can substantially degrade the reconstruction accuracies. To address these issues, we present a new cloud removal algorithm called Virtual Image-based Cloud Removal (VICR). For each cloud region, VICR reconstructs the missing surface reflectance by three steps: virtual image within cloud region construction based on time-series reference images, similar pixel selection using the newly proposed temporally weighted spectral distance (TWSD), and residual image estimation. By establishing two buffer zones around the cloud region, VICR allows automatic selection of the optimal set of time-series reference images. The effectiveness of VICR was validated at four testing sites with different landscapes (i.e. urban, croplands, and wetlands) and land change patterns (i.e. phenological change, abrupt change caused by flooding and tidal inundation), and the performances were compared with mNSPI (modified neighborhood similar pixel interpolator), WLR (weighted linear regression) and ARRC (AutoRegression to Remove Clouds). Experimental results showed that VICR outperformed the other algorithms and achieved higher Correlation Coefficients and lower Root Mean Square Errors in surface reflectance estimation at the four sites. The improvement is particularly noticeable at the sites with abrupt land change. By considering the difference in the contributions from the reference images, TWSD can select more reliable similar pixels to improve the prediction of abrupt change in surface reflectance. Moreover, VICR is more robust to different cloud sizes and to changing reference images. VICR is also computationally much faster than ARRC. The framework for time-series image cloud removal by VICR has great potential to be applied for large datasets processing.

TI  - An advanced coverage estimation method to quantify biological soil crust coverage using Sentinel-2 imagery in desert and sandy land of China
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the distribution and area change of biological soil crusts (BSCs) can enhance our understanding of the interactions between nonvascular plants and the environment in drylands. However, using only pixel-based binary classification methods results in large-area estimation errors at large scales. The lack of available calculation methods for directly measuring BSC coverage using multispectral satellite images makes it challenging to obtain BSC area data for further studies at large scales. To address these issues, this study developed feature space conceptual models for desert and sandy land based on the characteristics of BSC in drylands. The desert feature space comprised the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) combined with the brightness index (BI), encompassing moss, lichen, and non-BSC. The sandy land feature space relied on the biological soil crust index (BSCI) and the NDVI, including vegetation, mixed BSCs and sandy soil. Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and a spectral unmixing model, the abundance of BSCs was quantified in four BSC growth areas located in the Gurbantunggut Desert and Mu Us Sandy Land of China. Validation of the method indicated that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the BSC coverage estimation results was 10% and 8% in desert and sandy land, respectively (estimation accuracies of 79% and 81%, respectively). This demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively estimate BSC coverage at a subpixel scale. The resulting BSC coverage data can provide the possibility to evaluate the functions of regional ecosystems.

TI  - Monitoring forest dynamics in Africa during 2000-2020 using a remotely sensed fractional tree cover dataset
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Africa is covered with extensive woodlands, savannas and rainforests. The tree cover of these biomes has been undergoing substantial changes in recent decades. However, the dynamics of forests in Africa are currently unclear, particularly in the woodlands and savanna areas covered by sparse trees. Here, we assessed the spatio-temporal trend of African forests from 2000 to 2020, using a 250-m resolution fractional tree cover product that can capture the variation of forest density in the widespread mixed vegetation landscapes of the continent. The tree cover trends, interannual change and hotspots of forest gain and loss were evaluated. Results showed that the African forest area increased at a rate of 3.59 million ha/year over the study period, reaching 589 million ha in 2020. Considerable forest gain and loss both occurred in Africa. The net change rate in woodlands' forest area was the fastest (2.28 million ha/year), followed by rainforests (0.80 million ha/year) and savannas (0.34 million ha/year). Hotspots of forest gain were concentrated in the north belt of woodlands and savannas, while forest loss primarily clustered in East and South Africa. This work would help African countries to monitor forest change and promote forest management to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - A novel fine-resolution snow depth retrieval model to reveal detailed spatiotemporal patterns of snow cover in Northeast China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal snow cover is a key component of the global climate and hydrological system, it has drawn considerable attention under global warming conditions. Although several passive microwave (PMW) snow depth (SD) products have been developed since the 1970s, they inherit noticeable errors and uncertainties when representing spatial distributions and temporal changes of SD, especially in complex mountainous regions. In this paper, we developed a fine-resolution SD retrieval model (FSDM) using machine learning to improve SD estimation quality for Northeast China and produced a long-term, fine-resolution, daily SD dataset. The accuracies of the FSDM dataset were evaluated against in-situ SD data along with existing SD products. The results showed the FSDM dataset provided satisfactory inversion accuracy in spatiotemporal evaluation, with the root-mean-square error (RMSE), bias, and correlation coefficient (R) of 7.10 cm, -0.13 cm, and 0.60. Additionally, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of SD in Northeast China and found that snow cover was mainly distributed in the Greater Khingan Range, Lesser Khingan Mountains, and Changbai Mountain regions. The SD exhibited high-low distribution patterns with the increased latitude. The annual mean SD slightly increased at the rate of 0.029 cm/year during 1987-2018.

TI  - Revealing the time lag between slope stability and reservoir water fluctuation from InSAR observations and wavelet tools- a case study in Maoergai Reservoir (China)
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoir water fluctuation in supply and storage cycle have strong triggering effects on landslides on both sides of reservoir banks. Early identification of reservoir landslides and revealing the relationship between slope stability and the triggering factors including reservoir level and rainfall, are of great significance in further protecting nearby residents' lives and properties. In this paper, based on the small baseline subset time series method (SBAS-InSAR), the potential landslides with active displacements in the river bank of Maoergai hydropower station in Heishui County from 2018 to 2020 were monitored with Sentinel-1 data. As a result, a total of 20 unstable slopes were detected. Subsequently, it was found through a gray correlation analysis that the fluctuation of the reservoir water level is the main triggering factor for the displacement on unstable slopes. This paper applied wavelet tools to quantify the time lag between slope stability and reservoir water fluctuation, revealing that the displacement exhibits a seasonal trend, whose high-frequency signal displacement has an interannual period (1 year). Based on the Cross Wavelet Transform (XWT) analysis, under the interannual scale of one year, the reservoir water fluctuation and nonlinear displacement show a clear common power in wavelet. Additionally, a time lag of 65-120 days between slope stability and reservoir water fluctuations has been found, indicating that the non-linear displacements were behind the water level changes. Among the factors affecting the time lag, the elevation of the points and their distance to the bank shore show Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.69 and 0.70, respectively. The observed time lag and correlations could be related to the gradual saturation/drainage processes of the slope and the drainage path. This paper demonstrates the technical support to quantitatively reveal the time lag between slope stability and reservoir water fluctuation by InSAR and wavelet tools, providing strong support for the analysis of the mechanisms of landslides in Maoergai reservoir area.

TI  - Analysing the context and characteristics of legal abortion and comprehensive post-abortion care among adolescents aged 10-14 in a network of sentinel centres in Latin America: a retrospective cross-sectional study, 2016-2020
T2  - SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pregnancy-related complications are a substantial source of morbidity and mortality among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries. While the youngest adolescents (those aged 10-14) are considered to be at particularly high risk of adverse outcomes, there is little empirical data available on their sexual and reproductive health. Using a unique dataset of clinical records drawn from a regional network of sentinel centres providing legal abortion and comprehensive post-abortion care in 12 Latin American and Caribbean countries, we described the population of adolescents aged 10-14 seeking legal abortion and post-abortion care and calculated institutional rates of complications, using older adolescents (aged 15-19) and young adults (aged 20-24) as comparator groups. We also assessed the quality of care provided as compared to WHO recommendations. Nearly 17% (89 out of 533) of young adolescents sought care when they were already at 15 or more weeks' gestation. Young adolescents were at higher risk of pre-procedure and intra-operative complications than older adolescents and young adults, though the trend is less clear for the most severe complications. In general, the quality of care provided by centres in the network was aligned with WHO recommendations for safe abortion and comprehensive post-abortion care. Taken together, these findings provide insight into the challenges facing the global health community in assuring the sexual and reproductive health and rights of the youngest adolescents, and outline avenues for future research, advocacy, and evidence-based policymaking.

TI  - Investigating two-dimensional deformations of the head of the Central Route of the South-North Water Diversion Project in China with TerraSAR-X datasets
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - As a landmark in China's hydraulic engineering history, the Central Route of the South-North Water Diversion Project (SNWD-CR) plays a major role in alleviating severe water shortages in Northern China. Existing InSAR monitoring of the SNWD-CR based on one-dimensional viewing geometry and Sentinel-1 imaging is insufficient for a comprehensive assessment of deformation causes. Moreover, the poor geocoding accuracy hampers the previous interpretation of the estimated deformations. Here we carry out comprehensive two-dimensional deformation analyses over the head of the SNWD-CR by integrating the multitemporal PS/DS InSAR and the stress-strain model, where the well-designed topography and geocoded error correction can help to identify the causes of deformation. We apply our strategy to ascending and descending TerraSAR-X meter-resolution datasets acquired from June 2020 to February 2021. Geocoding errors in both ascending and descending orbits are corrected, and the relationship between topography error and horizontal positioning error is discussed. The multi-data fusion results reveal insignificant deformations in the east-west direction except for a makeshift rigid-frame bridge, whereas the vertical deformation field shows two uplifts and a subsidence area in the narrow canal with a maximum rate of 23 mm/y, which are likely to be related to rainfall and water diversion pressure. Furthermore, the combination of the external DEM and topographic residual offers the chance to reconstruct the high-accuracy DEM.

TI  - Multiresolution generative adversarial networks with bidirectional adaptive-stage progressive guided fusion for remote sensing image
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image (RSI) with concurrently high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions cannot be produced by a single sensor. Multisource RSI fusion is a convenient technique to realize high spatial resolution multispectral (MS) images (spatial spectral fusion, i.e. SSF) and high temporal and spatial resolution MS images (spatiotemporal fusion, i.e. STF). Currently, deep learning-based fusion models can only implement SSF or STF, lacking models that perform both SSF and STF. Multiresolution generative adversarial networks with bidirectional adaptive-stage progressive guided fusion (BAPGF) for RSI are proposed to implement both SSF and STF, namely BPF-MGAN. A bidirectional adaptive-stage feature extraction architecture in fine-scale-to-coarse-scale and coarse-scale-to-fine-scale modes is introduced. The designed BAPGF introduces a previous fusion result-oriented cross-stage-level dual-residual attention fusion strategy to enhance critical information and suppress superfluous information. Adaptive resolution U-shaped discriminators are implemented to feed multiresolution context into the generator. A generalized multitask loss function unlimited by no-reference images is developed to strengthen the model via constraints on the multiscale feature, structural, and content similarities. The BPF-MGAN model is validated on SSF datasets and STF datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art SSF and STF models, results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed BPF-MGAN model in both subjective and objective evaluations.

TI  - Topographic effects amplify forest disturbances detected by yearly wide-time-window Landsat time series
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread topographic effects in remote sensing images of mountainous regions with rugged terrain severely hinder satellite-based global land surface monitoring and change detection. However, topographic effects in Landsat time series (LTSs) disturbance detection remain highly debated and unquantified. In this study, we proposed a novel postprocessing approach to quantify the impact of topographic effects on long time-series (1989 - 2020) forest disturbance detection, taking the Hengduan Mountains Region (HDMR) of southwest China as an example. This approach applied a pixel-by-pixel simulation based on a semiempirical sun-canopy-sensor with a C-correction (SCS+C) model to identify and remove topography-induced disturbances from the LandTrendr-detected forest disturbances. Filtering of the detected forest disturbances with different patch sizes was conducted, and its effectiveness in removing topography-induced disturbances was quantitatively evaluated. The results showed that 10.43% of the total area of LandTrendr-detected forest disturbances was topography-induced. Removing topography-induced disturbances increased the traditional and area-adjusted overall accuracies (OAs) of the forest disturbance map by 3.50% and 0.62%. Topography-induced disturbances occurred mainly on northwest-facing (300 degrees-360 degrees) slopes with a gradient of 30 degrees-55 degrees and higher latitude and between the day of year (DOY) pairs (such as DOYs 90, 330, and 360) with a considerable disparity in solar azimuth and zenith angle. The pixel-by-pixel simulation approach outperformed spatial noise filtering with a minimum mapping unit (MMU), which considerably decreased the area percentage of topography-induced disturbances at the expense of decreasing the producer's accuracy (PA) in detecting disturbed forests. This study highlighted the importance of removing topographic effects from the detected forest disturbances and shed new light on the promising potential of the postprocessing topographic correction method to replace the preprocessing topographic correction of the LTSs to map forest disturbances in mountainous regions globally.

TI  - Mapping of bamboo forest bright and shadow areas using optical and SAR satellite data in Google Earth Engine
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboo groves predominantly thrive in tropical or subtropical regions. Assessing the efficacy of remote sensing data of various types in extracting bamboo forest information from bright and shadow areas is a critical issue for achieving precise identification of bamboo forests in complex terrain. In this study, 34 features were obtained from Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images using the Google Earth Engine platform. The normalized shaded vegetation index (NSVI) was then employed to segment the bright and shadow woodlands. Different features from diverse data sources were evaluated to extract bamboo forest information in the bright and shadow areas, then use the random forest (RF) classification algorithm to extract bamboo forest. The results showed that (1) the red-edge and short-wave infrared bands of Sentinel-2 optical images and their corresponding vegetation indices are significant in bamboo forest information extraction. (2) The dissimilarity and homogeneity of Sentinel-2 texture features in the bright area and dissimilarity in the shadow area, the Sentinel-1 backscatter features in the bright area and the VV and VH in the bright area and VV-VH in the shadow area have some variability between bamboo and nonbamboo forests, which can be used as effective features for bamboo forest extraction. (3) The combination of spectral, texture and backscatter features yields the highest overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient, at 87.96% and 0.7435, respectively. This study has the potential for remote sensing refinement of bamboo forest identification in complex terrain areas by utilizing subregion classification methods combined with optical and radar image features.

TI  - On-orbit geometric calibration of satellite laser altimeters using infrared detectors and corner-cube retroreflectors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - After being launched into orbit, the geometric calibration of a satellite laser altimeter will reduce errors in laser pointing and ranging caused by satellite vibrations during launch, environmental changes, and thermal effects during long-term operation, which guarantees the accuracy of measurement data. In this study, a satellite laser geometric calibration method combining infrared detectors and corner-cube retroreflectors (CCRs) is proposed. First, a CCR-based laser ranging error calibration method was established, and then a laser pointing error calibration model was derived based on a single infrared detector array. Taking GaoFen-7 (GF-7) satellite laser beam 2 as the experimental object, laser geometric calibration was realized using an infrared detector and CCR-measured data. Then, the accuracy of the proposed method was compared with that of other calibration methods, the CMLID and the CMSPR. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed calibration method is equivalent to that of the CMLID and higher than that of the CMSPR. Among them, the accuracy of the laser pointing after calibration using the proposed method is better than 0.8 arcsec, and the elevation accuracy of the laser on flat, sloping, and mountainous terrains is better than 0.11 m, 0.30 m, and 1.80 m, respectively.

TI  - A multitemporal index for the automatic identification of winter wheat based on Sentinel-2 imagery time series
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate monitoring of the spatial distribution of wheat is crucial for wheat field management, growth monitoring, yield estimation and prediction. In this study, a multitemporal index, termed the winter wheat mapping index (WWMI), was constructed for automatic winter wheat mapping on the basis of Sentinel-2 enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series and wheat phenological features. Henan, an important winter wheat production province in China, was selected as the study area. Zhumadian, the primary wheat-growing city in Henan, was the test area. Both empirical and automatic threshold (Otsu) methods were adopted to calculate the optimal threshold of the WWMI. The performance of WWMI in winter wheat mapping was compared at object-oriented and pixel-based levels. The proposed WWMI separated winter wheat and nonwinter wheat areas well, thus achieving highly accurate winter wheat mapping. In Zhumadian, the empirical threshold method performed better than the Otsu method, but the former relied on official statistics to iteratively adjust the WWMI threshold. In Henan, the mapping accuracy achieved by the Otsu method was higher than that achieved by the empirical threshold method, with mean relative errors (MREs) of 6.78% and 19.87% at the municipal and county levels, respectively. This was because, compared with the empirical threshold method, the Otsu method did not rely on official statistics and adaptively determined the optimal threshold of the WWMI for each city in Henan, thus fully considering wheat growth state differences in different cities. In addition, the object-oriented WWMI performed better than the pixel-based WWMI in wheat mapping. The results further demonstrated the feasibility of combining the WWMI with the Otsu method for automatic winter wheat mapping at large extents, which will provide a theoretical basis for identifying other food crops.

TI  - Digital mapping of pesticides bioconcentration by integrating remote sensing techniques and plant uptake model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although pesticides have been widely used worldwide to enhance crop yield and product quality, most pesticides are harmful to the environment and human health. Plants absorb pesticides mainly from air and soil. Therefore, the soil-plant pathway is essential for pesticide absorption. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) has extensively been applied to evaluate potential plant contamination by pesticides from soil. Hence, this study developed a simplified plant transpiration-based plant uptake model (PT-model) to estimate plant pesticides' BCF from soil based on plant transpiration. Remote sensing techniques were employed to generate spatiotemporal continuous plant transpiration via evapotranspiration. Pesticide BCF mapping was achieved by integrating PT-model with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed data. The results were compared with a verified model driven by relative humidity and air temperature (RA-model), which has been confirmed by findings from previous studies. The estimated BCF was within the boundaries of the RA-model, indicating the simulation's overall acceptability. In this study, the BCF temporal trend estimated by the proposed method agreed with the RA-model assimilating meteorology datasets, while the spatial distribution was partially inconsistent. Overall, the proposed method generates the spatiotemporal patterns of pesticide BCF with relatively consistent results supported by previous records and findings.

TI  - Variability and trends in land surface longwave radiation fluxes from six satellite and reanalysis products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth surface longwave radiation (SLR), including downward (DLR), upward (ULR), and net longwave radiation (NLR), significantly impacts the surface radiation budget and global climate evolution. However, the spatiotemporal variation in SLR remains poorly understood. In this study, three satellite products (GLASS-MODIS V40, GLASS-AVHRR, and CERES-SYN) and three reanalysis datasets (ERA5, MERRA-2, and GLDAS) were validated using ground measurements from 288 sites at seven observation networks. The mean biases and root mean square errors of the monthly DLR (ULR, NLR) estimates from the six products were -6.36 (-3.56, -2.86) Wm(-2) and 16.63 (14.33, 13.38) Wm(-2), respectively. Large differences in the spatial distribution of the SLR were mainly observed at high-latitude, high-altitude and desert/barren-covered regions. Large interannual variability was detected at high latitudes. GLASS-AVHRR and ERA5 better captured the long-term variability in DLR and ULR, whereas GLASS-AVHRR and MERRA-2 better detected trends in NLR. An increasing trend in DLR and ULR was observed between 1982 and 2015, followed by a decreasing trend from 2016 to 2021; the NLR flux did not exhibit a significant trend. Overall, the GLASS-AVHRR and ERA5 SLR estimates were more accurate and stable than those of the other products in accuracy, spatiotemporal distribution, and trend analysis.

TI  - Extraction of cropland field parcels with high resolution remote sensing using multi-task learning
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Parcel-level farmland information contains rich spatial distribution and boundary details, which is crucial for digital agriculture and agricultural resource surveys. However, the spatial complexity and heterogeneity of features resulting from high resolution makes it difficult to obtain parcel-level information quickly and accurately. In addition, existing methods do not sufficiently take into account the spatial topological information, particularly for blurred boundaries. Here, we develop a multi-task network model to extract plot-level cropland information. Specifically, the model consists of a cascaded multi-task network with integrated semantic and edge detection, a refinement network with fixed edge local connectivity, and an integrated fusion model. To validate the performance of the model, two typical tests were conducted in Denmark (Europe) and Chongqing (Asia) with high-resolution remote sensing images provided by Sentinel-2 (10 m) and Google Earth (0.53 m) as data sources. The results show that our proposed model outperforms other baseline models and exhibits higher performance. This study is expected to provide important support for the design of new global agricultural information management systems in the future.

TI  - High-resolution global mature and young oil palm plantation subclass maps for 2020
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate high-resolution maps of oil palm plantations underpin effective management of environmental and socio-economic impacts at global, regional, and national levels. However, young industrial and highly irregular small-holder plantations are mostly unmapped and not included in official FAO statistics. This issue is addressed here by discriminating global oil palm plantation in 2020 into four subclasses: Industrial Mature Oil Palm (IMOP); Industrial Young Oil Palm (IYOP); Smallholder Mature Oil Palm (SMOP); and Smallholder Young Oil Palm (SYOP). Data, resolved to 4.77 m, from Planet & NICFI, Sentinel-1/2, were combined with other layers using the image-oriented classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm which performed best in classification tests. Results show that SMOP dominates distributional extent, but it was also the most accurately mapped subclass typically found at 500-1000 m altitude. IMOP had the most extensive altitude range of 500-1300 m, while IYOP and SYOP were found at similar altitudes of 500-800 m and 500-900 m respectively. Recent developments in South East Asia show oil palm plantations expanding into new areas with a slope of 24 degrees. Results provide data to support Sustainable Development Goal by assisting future oil palm-related development planning and monitoring in the world's major oil palm-growing countries.

TI  - A comparative study on the applicability and effectiveness of NSVI and NDVI for estimating fractional vegetation cover based on multi-source remote sensing image
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) is an important ecological parameter reflecting the growth of regional plants. Existing FVC estimation is often based on vegetation indices, especially the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). However, NDVI can be oversaturated and easily affected by problems such as 'shadow' in images, which leads to a decrease in the precision of FVC estimation. In this study, the Normalized Shaded Vegetation Index (NSVI) was used to comprehensively compare the estimation ability of FVC with NDVI, and the differences in FVC estimation ability between NSVI and NDVI were explored. Based on two dimensions of 'bright' and 'shadow' hierarchies and FVC ranks, four evaluation systems of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), index range, statistical model and dimidiate pixel model were selected from Sentinel-2A MSI, Landsat-8 OLI and Resource-1-02D (ZY1-02D) images and covered a variety of topographic landscapes. The results showed that: (1) the ability of NSVI to resist soil background is slightly smaller than NDVI; (2) the range of NSVI and NDVI in hyperspectral images is slightly larger than multispectral images, and the ability of NSVI to detect vegetation information in medium-high-rank and high-rank FVC areas has obvious advantages; (3) in the same kind of regression model, the goodness of fit of NSVI, NDVI and FVC was slightly higher in bright areas than in shaded areas, and the goodness of fit of the five regression models obtained from NSVI showed a significant advantage in bright areas compared with NDVI, with the best fit of the cubic curve model; (4) the estimation accuracy of the dimidiate pixel model based on NSVI and NDVI is slightly higher in bright areas than in shaded areas, and the estimation ability of NSVI is slightly better than that of NDVI in bright areas with medium-high-rank and high-rank FVC. NSVI and NDVI have their own advantages in SNR, index range, statistical model and dimidiate pixel model, so it is suggested that when remote sensing estimation of FVC is carried out, NSVI should be preferred in medium-high-rank and high-rank FVC areas, and NDVI should be preferred in low-rank FVC areas in shaded areas.

TI  - Assessing Landsat-8 atmospheric correction schemes in low to moderate turbidity waters from a global perspective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction is one of the major challenges in ocean color remote sensing, thus threatening comprehensive evaluation of water quality within aquatic environments. In this study, five state-of-the-art atmospheric correction (AC) processors (i.e. Acolite, C2RCC, iCOR, L2gen, and Polymer) were applied to Operational Land Imager (OLI) Landsat-8 scenes and evaluated against in situ measurements across various types of waters worldwide. A total of 262 matchups between in situ measured and satellite-derived remote sensing reflectance (R (rs)) at 20 sites were obtained between August 2013 and August 2021. Classification of optical water types (OWTs) was carried out using in situ measurements with matched satellite observations. OWT-specific analysis demonstrated that L2gen produced the most accurate R (rs) with R (2) >= 0.74 and root mean squared error (RMSE) <= 0.0018 sr(-1) for the four visible bands of OLI, followed by Polymer, C2RCC, iCOR, and Acolite. In terms of R (rs) spectral similarity, C2RCC yielded the lowest spectral angle (SA) of 8.55 degrees, followed by L2gen (SA = 9.20 degrees). The advantage and disadvantage of each AC scheme were discussed. Recommendations to improve the accuracy for atmospheric correction were made, such as polarization observations and concurrent aerosol and ocean color measurements.

TI  - Mapping high-resolution forest aboveground biomass of China using multisource remote sensing data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is crucial for carbon cycle studies and climate change mitigation actions. However, because of limitations in timely and reliable forestry surveys and high-resolution remote sensing data, producing a fine resolution and spatial continuous forest AGB map of China is challenging. Here, we combined 4789 ground-truth AGB measurements and multisource remote sensing data such as a recently released forest canopy-height product, optical spectral indexes, topographic data, climatological data, and soil properties to train a random forest regression model for forest AGB estimation of China at 30-m resolution. The accuracy of the estimated AGB can yield R-2 = 0.67 and RMSE = 70.71 Mg/ha. The nationwide estimates show that the average forest AGB and total forest carbon storage were 97.57 +/- 23.85 Mg/ha and 11.06 Pg C for the year 2019, respectively. The value of AGB uncertainty ranges from 0.68 Mg/ha to 37.80 Mg/ha, and the average AGB uncertainty was 4.32 +/- 1.75 Mg/ha. The forest AGB estimates of China in this study correspond reasonably well with the AGB estimates derived from the forestry and grassland statistical yearbook at the provincial level (R-2 = 0.61, RMSE = 30.15 Mg/ha). In addition, we found that previous AGB products generally underestimate the forest AGB compared with our estimated AGB at the pixel-level and ground-truth AGB measurements. The high-resolution forest AGB map provides an important alternative data source for forest carbon cycle studies and can be used as a baseline map for forest management and conservation practices.

TI  - A review and comparison of surface incident shortwave radiation from multiple data sources: satellite retrievals, reanalysis data and GCM simulations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Surface incident shortwave radiation (R-s) can promote the circulation of substance and energy, and the accuracy of its estimation is of great significance for climate studies. The R-s can be acquired from satellite retrievals, reanalysis predictions and general circulation model (GCM) simulations. Although R-s estimates have been evaluated and compared in previous studies, most of them focus on evaluating the R-s estimates over specific regions using ground measurements from limited stations. Therefore, it is essential to comprehensively validate R-s estimates from multiple data sources. In this study, ground measurements of 690 stations from BSRN, GEBA, CMA, GC-NET and buoys were employed to validate the R-s estimates from seven representative products (GLASS, GEWEX-SRB, CERES-EBAF, ERA5, MERRA2, CFSR and CMIP6). The validation results indicated that the selected products overestimated R-s globally, with biases ranged from 0.48 to 21.27 W/m(2). The satellite retrievals showed relatively better accuracy among seven datasets compared to ground measurements at the selected stations. Moreover, the selected seven products were all in poor accuracy at high-latitude regions with RMSEs greater than 50 W/m(2). The long-term variation trends were also analyzed in this study.

TI  - GEE-Based monitoring method of key management nodes in cotton production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-temporal-resolution monitoring of key management nodes in cotton management via agricultural remote sensing is vital for field cotton macro-statistics, particularly for predicting cotton production and obtaining comprehensive data. This study examines Shihezi, Xinjiang as a case study, utilizing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data from 2019 to 2021. Three machine learning models(RF, SVM, and CART) were employed to extract annual crop classification area rasters, monitor weekly cultivation progress, and monitor abandoned cropland during the cultivation period. The results demonstrate that the random forest model has produced satisfactory results in gridded extraction for cotton classification areas, achieving the producer's accuracy of the cotton category reached 98.5%, and the kappa coefficient is 0.947. Cotton cultivated in 2021 began is a week later than in 2020, yet exhibited a faster cultivate speed. The proportion of abandoned cotton fields in the study area rose in 2020 compared to 2019. The methodology presented in this study has a certain reference value for exploring the monitoring of continuous changes in crops over the years and macro-monitoring of important activities in the entire growth cycle.

TI  - A comparative assessment of the statistical methods based on urban population density estimation
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Population density is important spatial information for addressing the use and access to land resources in cities under the Sustainable Development Goals. This is because the spatial data support appropriate spatial policies at the spatial scale and predicts how much land will be consumed in the future. The study aims to compare and evaluate the regression tools in the context of estimating the population density difference. The three analysis tools used are Random Forest-Based Classification, Multiple Linear Regression, and Geographically Weighted Regression. The sampling area covers cities around Turkiye. Comparative results showed that the two most important descriptive variables in the Random Forest-Based Classification model are the density difference of the new developed area and the connectivity. The three main explanatory variables of the Multiple Linear Regression model are centrality, vehicle ownership, and accessibility. The results of the Multiple Linear Regression model (a non-spatial model) and the Geographically Weighted Regression model (a spatial model), were found to be quite similar. The importance of accessibility and connectivity is more evident in the Multiple Linear Regression model when the Random Forest-Based Classification model highlights the density values in the new development areas.

TI  - Significant discrepancies of land surface daily net radiation among ten remotely sensed and reanalysis products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface all-wave net radiation (Rn) is crucial in determining Earth's climate by contributing to the surface radiation budget. This study evaluated seven satellite and three reanalysis long-term land surface Rn products under different spatial scales, spatial and temporal variations, and different conditions. The results showed that during 2000-2018, Global Land Surface Satellite Product (GLASS)-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) performed the best (RMSE=25.54 Wm-2, bias=-1.26 Wm-2), followed by ERA5 (the fifth-generation of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast Reanalysis) (RMSE=32.17 Wm-2, bias=-4.88 Wm-2) and GLASS-AVHRR (Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer) (RMSE=33.10 Wm-2, bias=4.03 Wm-2). During 1983-2018, GLASS-AVHRR and ERA5 ranked top and performed similarly, with RMSE values of 31.70 and 33.08 Wm-2 and biases of -4.56 and 3.48 Wm-2, respectively. The averaged multi-annual mean Rn over the global land surface of satellite products was higher than that of reanalysis products by about 10 & SIM;30 Wm-2. These products differed remarkably in long-term trends variations, particularly pre-2000, but no significant trends were observed. Discrepancies were more frequent in satellite data, while reanalysis products showed smoother variations. Large discrepancies were found in regions with high latitudes, reflectance, and elevation which could be attributed to input radiative components, meteorological variables (e.g., cloud properties, aerosol optical thickness), and applicability of the algorithms used. While further research is needed for detailed insights.

TI  - Integrating MODIS LST and Sentinel-1 InSAR to monitor frozen soil deformation in the Qumalai-Zhiduo area, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to continuous global warming, frozen soil degradation has become a universal phenomenon, leading to large-scale ground deformation that affects engineering construction and the fragile ecological balance. Geodetic observations, especially temporal InSAR, can quantify ground deformation. However, the accuracy of InSAR modelling in capturing the spatial-temporal variability of the freeze-thaw process depends on the spatial resolution of temperature measurements. This paper proposes a freeze-thaw amplitude model incorporating MODIS LST based on a single-master InSAR time-series deformation to calculate frozen soil deformation. We applied this model to the Qumalai-Zhiduo area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and compared its results with those of the model using weather station temperature in terms of frozen soil deformation parameters, RSME, and characteristic targets. Our study found that the model incorporating MODIS LST performed better in areas far from weather stations, while both models produced similar results in areas of close proximity. Finally, we evaluated another commonly used method for calculating frozen soil deformation parameters and found that the method incorporating MODIS LST based on a single-master time-series deformation is more accurate and precise than the method based on a multi-master SBAS network.

TI  - A fully automatic and high-accuracy surface water mapping framework on Google Earth Engine using Landsat time-series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient and continuous monitoring of surface water is essential for water resource management. Much effort has been devoted to the task of water mapping based on remote sensing images. However, few studies have fully considered the diverse spectral properties of water for the collection of reference samples in an automatic manner. Moreover, water area statistics are sensitive to the satellite image observation quality. This study aims to develop a fully automatic surface water mapping framework based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) with a supervised random forest classifier. A robust scheme was built to automatically construct training samples by merging the information from multi-source water occurrence products. The samples for permanent and seasonal water were mapped and collected separately, so that the supplement of seasonal samples can increase the spectral diversity of the sample space. To reduce the uncertainty of the derived water occurrences, temporal correction was applied to repair the classification maps with invalid observations. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed method can generate reliable samples and produce good-quality water mapping results. Comparative tests indicated that the proposed method produced water maps with a higher quality than the index-based detection methods, as well as the GSWD and GLAD datasets.

TI  - Mapping rapeseed in China during 2017-2021 using Sentinel data: an automated approach integrating rule-based sample generation and a one-class classifier (RSG-OC)
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapeseed mapping is important for national food security and government regulation of land use. Various methods, including empirical index-based and machine learning-based methods, have been developed to identify rapeseed using remote sensing. Empirical index-based methods commonly employed empirically designed indices to enhance rapeseed's bright yellow spectral feature during the flowering period, which is straightforward to implement. Unfortunately, the heavy cloud cover in the flowering period of China would lead to serious omission errors; and the required flowering period varies spatially and yearly, which often cannot be acquired accurately. Machine learning-based methods mitigate the reliance on clear observations during the flowering period by inputting all-season imagery to adaptively learn features. However, it is difficult to collect sufficient samples across all of China considering the large intraclass variation in both land cover types of rapeseed and non-rapeseed. This study proposed an automated rapeseed mapping approach integrating rule-based sample generation and a one-class classifier (RSG-OC) to overcome the shortcomings of the two types of methods. First, a set of sample selection rules based on empirical indices of rapeseed were developed to automatically generate samples in cloud-free pixels during the predicted flowering period throughout China. Second, all available features composited based on the rapeseed phenological calendar were used for classification to eliminate the phenology differences in different regions. Third, a specific sample augmentation that removes the observation in the flowering period was employed to improve the generalization to the pixels without cloud-free observation in the flowering period. Finally, to avoid the need for diverse samples of nonrapeseed classes, a typical one-class classifier, positive unlabeled learning implemented by random forest (PUL-RF) trained by the generated samples, was applied to map rapeseed. With the proposed method, China rapeseed was mapped at 20 m resolution during 2017-2021 based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Validation on six typical rapeseed planting areas demonstrates that RSG-OC achieves an average accuracy of 94.90%. In comparison, the average accuracy of the other methods ranged from 83.33% to 88.25%, all of which were poorer than the proposed method. Additional experiments show that the performance of RSG-OC was not sensitive to cloud contamination, inaccurate predicted flowering time and the threshold of sample selection rule. These results indicate that the rapeseed maps produced in China are overall reliable and that the proposed method is an effective and robust method for annual rapeseed mapping across China.

TI  - Generation of global 1-km daily top-of-atmosphere outgoing longwave radiation product from 2000 to 2021 using machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), a key component of the Earth's energy budget, serves as a diagnostic of the Earth's climate system response to incoming solar radiation. However, existing products are typically estimated using broadband sensors with coarse spatial resolutions. This paper presents a machine learning method to estimate TOA OLR by directly linking Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) TOA radiances with TOA OLR determined by Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and other information, such as the viewing geometry, land surface temperature and cloud top temperature determined by Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2). Models are built separately under clear- and cloudy-sky conditions using a gradient boosting regression tree. Independent test results show that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the clear-sky and cloudy-sky models for estimating instantaneous values are 4.1 and 7.8 W/m(2), respectively. Real-time conversion ratios derived from CERES daily and hourly OLR data are used to convert the instantaneous MODIS OLR to daily results. Inter-comparisons of the daily results show that the RMSE of the estimated MODIS OLR is 8.9 W/m(2) in East Asia. The developed high resolution dataset will be beneficial in analyzing the regional energy budget.

TI  - A new method for the extraction of tailing ponds from very high-resolution remotely sensed images: PSVED
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic extraction of tailing ponds from Very High-Resolution (VHR) remotely sensed images is vital for mineral resource management. This study proposes a Pseudo-Siamese Visual Geometry Group Encoder-Decoder network (PSVED) to achieve high accuracy tailing ponds extraction from VHR images. First, handcrafted feature (HCF) images are calculated from VHR images based on the index calculation algorithm, highlighting the tailing ponds' signals. Second, considering the information gap between VHR images and HCF images, the Pseudo-Siamese Visual Geometry Group (Pseudo-Siamese VGG) is utilized to extract independent and representative deep semantic features from VHR images and HCF images, respectively. Third, the deep supervision mechanism is attached to handle the optimization problem of gradients vanishing or exploding. A self-made tailing ponds extraction dataset (TPSet) produced with the Gaofen-6 images of part of Hebei province, China, was employed to conduct experiments. The results show that the proposed method achieves the best visual performance and accuracy for tailing ponds extraction in all the tested methods, whereas the running time of the proposed method maintains at the same level as other methods. This study has practical significance in automatically extracting tailing ponds from VHR images which is beneficial to tailing ponds management and monitoring.

TI  - Thin cloud correction method for visible remote sensing images using a spectral transformation scheme
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thin cloud contamination adversely influences the interpretation of ground surface information in optical remote sensing images, especially for visible spectral bands with short wavelengths. To eliminate the thin cloud effect in visible remote sensing images, this study proposes a thin cloud correction method based on a spectral transformation scheme. Given the strong linear correlation among the three visible bands, a spectral transformation scheme is presented to derive intermediate images and further estimate spectrally varied transmission maps for the three visible bands. An improved strategy that locally estimates atmospheric light was also developed to produce spatially varied atmospheric light maps. Spectrally varied transmission maps and spatially varied atmospheric light maps contribute to the complete removal of thin clouds. Several remotely sensed images featuring various land covers were collected from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and GaoFen-2 to perform simulated and real tests and verify the effectiveness and universality of the presented approach. Four existing thin cloud correction algorithms were used as baseline for comprehensive evaluation, including three single-image-based approaches and a deep-learning-based approach. Results demonstrate that the proposed method outperformed the other four baseline methods, yielding more natural and clearer cloud-free images. The ground surface information in the cloud-contaminated images can be appropriately recovered by the proposed method, with high determination coefficients (>0.8906) and low root-mean-square errors (<2.4711) and spectral angle maps (<0.8870). In summary, the proposed method can completely remove thin clouds, faithfully recover ground surface information, and effectively work for visible remote sensing images from diverse sensors. Furthermore, the factors potentially affecting correction performance and the applicability to open-source datasets were investigated.

TI  - Integrating Sentinel-1 and 2 with LiDAR data to estimate aboveground biomass of subtropical forests in northeast Guangdong, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is vital for sustainable forest management. Generally, the AGB is estimated by combining satellite images and field measurements. Nevertheless, field plots are inaccessible in complex forest areas. Due to the limitations related to either optical or SAR data alone, combining the two data types is indispensable. Here, we explored the LiDAR-derived biomass as training/testing samples for the combination of yearly time-series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to estimate AGB in north-eastern Conghua, Guangdong province, China. The AGB reference map derived from airborne LiDAR data and field plots could provide more samples for satellite-based AGB estimation with a limited amount of sampling plots. We designed four groups of experiments based on diverse Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 variables, including backscatter, backscatter indices, texture features, spectral bands, vegetation indices, and biophysical features. Four different prediction methods (support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron neural network, K-nearest neighbour, and random forest (RF)) were separately used to estimate AGB. Results showed that the RF model achieved the best accuracy for AGB mapping. All Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 experiment (R-2: 0.72, RMSEr: 17.65%) performed better than the monthly complementary experiment (R-2: 0.66, RMSEr: 19.01%). Additionally, the arid period images were observed to be sensitive for estimating AGB. The most contributing Sentinels predictors were determined via a sequential forward selection. Consequently, the proposed methodology has great potential for low-cost, large-scale, and high-precision AGB estimation.

TI  - A labor-free index-guided semantic segmentation approach for urban vegetation mapping from high-resolution true color imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely information on urban vegetation (UV) can be used as an important indicator to estimate the health of cities. Due to the low cost of RGB cameras, true color imagery (TCI) has been widely used for high spatial resolution UV mapping. However, the current index-based and classifier-based UV mapping approaches face problems of the poor ability to accurately distinguish UV and the high reliance on massive annotated samples, respectively. To address this issue, an index-guided semantic segmentation (IGSS) framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a novel cross-scale vegetation index (CSVI) is calculated by the combination of TCI and Sentinel-2 images, and the index value can be used to provide an initial UV map. Secondly, reliable UV and non-UV samples are automatically generated for training the semantic segmentation model, and then the refined UV map can be produced. The experimental results show that the proposed CSVI outperformed the existing five RGB vegetation indices in highlighting UV cover and suppressing complex backgrounds, and the proposed IGSS workflow achieved satisfactory results with an OA of 87.72% similar to 88.16% and an F1 score of 87.73% similar to 88.37%, which is comparable with the fully-supervised method.

TI  - Can Gross Primary Productivity Products be effectively evaluated in regions with few observation data?
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is key to understand the global carbon cycle. Multiple GPP products are currently available based on remote sensing, Light Use Efficiency model (LUE) or diagnostic biophysical model. However, little knowledge is available on the spatial patterns of the uncertainty of different GPP products and their potential drivers over the Central Asia (CA), a fragile environment for accurate GPP estimation. This study investigates the sensitivity of the 8-day, monthly and yearly GPP uncertainties based on the three-cornered hat (TCH) method and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) model in terms of vegetation, energy, water, climate and terrain factors in the dryland ecosystem during the 2003-2015 period. Ten GPP products were examined, including one product (FLUXCOM) from machine learning (ML), six products (EC-LUE, FluxSat, LUEopt, MODIS, MuSyQ and VPM) based on the (LUE), two products (GOSIF and NIRv) from satellite-based direct proxies (Proxies) and one product (PML) from the diagnostic biophysical model. The results indicate that the spatial distribution of the ten GPP products in CA showed similar patterns at different time scales, but with values varied at different products and time scales. According to the eddy covariance (EC) observations and the TCH-based uncertainties, the FLUXCOM product showed smaller relative uncertainties than other products. The attribution analysis denotes that the sources of uncertainty of the GPP varied for each product, and thus the improvement strategies for different products should be implemented separately The FLUXCOM should adapt the vegetation- related module to the dryland environment of CA. The LUE model should optimize the LUE parameters for the dryland ecosystem and incorporate the water related variables in the model. The Proxies model should incorporate the water and energy variables (such as soil moisture and radiation) as input data to improve their performance in CA. The diagnostic model should consider the elevation variable as input data, which may improve the performance of the PML in CA. Our results do not only provide an important basis for the selection of GPP products in the study of the carbon cycle in CA, but also offer a new insight into the GPP model development and improvement for the dryland ecosystem.

TI  - High-resolution satellite video single object tracking based on thicksiam framework
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution satellite videos realize the short-dated gaze observation of the designated area on the ground, and its emergence has improved the temporal resolution of remote sensing data to the second level. Single object tracking (SOT) task in satellite video has attracted considerable attention. However, it faces challenges such as complex background, poor object feature representation, and lack of publicly available datasets. To cope with these challenges, a ThickSiam framework consisting of a Thickened Residual Block Siamese Network (TRBS-Net) for extracting robust semantic features to obtain the initial tracking results and a Remoulded Kalman Filter (RKF) module for simultaneously correcting the trajectory and size of the targets is designed in this work. The results of TRBS-Net and RKF modules are combined by an N-frame-convergence mechanism to achieve accurate tracking results. Ablation experiments are implemented on our annotated dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed ThickSiam framework and other 19 state-of-the-art trackers. The comparison results show that our ThickSiam tracker obtains a precision value of 0.991 and a success value of 0.755 while running at 56.849 FPS implemented on one NVIDIA GTX1070Ti GPU.

TI  - Forest status assessment in China with SDG indicators based on high-resolution satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the status and change trend of forest in China, an indicator framework was developed using SDG sub-indicators. In this paper, we propose an improved methodology and a set of workflows for calculating SDG indicators. The main modification include the use of moderate and high spatial resolution satellite data, as well as state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for forest cover classification and estimation of forest above-ground biomass (AGB). This research employs GF-1 and GF-2 data with enhanced texture information to map forest cover, while time series Landsat data is used to estimate forest AGB across the whole territory of China. The study calculate two SDG sub-indicators: SDG(15.1.1) for forest area and SDG(15.2.1) for sustainable forest management. The evaluation results showed that the total forest area in China was approximately 219 million hectares at the end of 2021, accounting for about 23.51% of the land area. The average annual forest AGB from 2015 to 2021 was estimated to be 105.01Mg/ha, and the overall trend of forest AGB change in China was positive, albeit with some spatial differences.

TI  - Kinematic inventory of rock glaciers in the Nyainqêntanglha Range using the MT-InSAR method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rock glaciers are typical periglacial landforms with tongue or lobate morphological shapes and characterized by the distinct front, lateral margins, and often by ridge-and-furrow surface topography textures as well as kinematic characteristics, widely distributed in alpine environments. Multitemporal Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (MT-InSAR), is a remote sensing technique with demonstrated effectiveness for detecting landform kinematics. However, its application to rock glaciers is challenged by temporal decorrelation and atmospheric phase noises due to complex topography and snow cover. We designed a quadtree segmentation and parallel computing-based MT-InSAR method to improve the quality and efficiency of deformation measurement of rock glaciers. We applied the method to a rock glacier inventory of the Nyainqentanglha Range, China, derived from high-resolution Gaofen-2 images, to quantify the activity rate of each rock glacier. Results showed that 32.1% (6,389) of the identified rock glaciers exhibited slope-parallel deformation rates exceeding 100 mm/y. The activities of the rock glaciers exhibited strong correlations with their distance to glaciers, precipitation, freeze-thaw magnitude, and permafrost occurrence probability. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed segmentation-parallel MT-InSAR method for monitoring rock glacier deformation over a large region.

TI  - Analysis of the future trends of typical mountain glacier movements along the Sichuan-Tibet Railway based on ConvGRU network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The anomalous movements of glaciers cause disasters, such as debris flows and landslides. It is very important to assess the glacier movements and their future trends. Glacier velocity refers to movement process. The current research aims to analyse past and current spatiotemporal changes in glacier velocity. No study has used neural network model to conduct a spatiotemporal prediction for glacier velocity. Therefore, this paper selected typical mountain glaciers G2 and G5 along the Sichuan-Tibet Railway as research objects and constructed the Convolutional Gate Recurrent Unit (ConvGRU) spatiotemporal prediction model based on 1988-2018 Landsat data to predict velocities in 2019-2028, and analysed the future trends of G2 and G5. The evaluation indexes met the model requirements to a large extent, quantitatively showing that the model has high accuracy and can successfully capture the fluctuation changes in time series data of glacier velocity. The mean deviations of G2 and G5 were 0.09 and -0.47 m/yr, respectively, reflecting the high reliability of the model applied to extraction of glacier velocity. The velocities of G2 and G5 showed a slow downtrend with fluctuations; that is, they will not cause damage to the construction and operation of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway in the short term.

TI  - Dynamic evolution of spring sand and dust storms and cross-border response in Mongolian plateau from 2000 to 2021
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 15.3), frequent sand and dust storms (SDSs) in the spring are a long-term challenge to the prevention and control of land degradation on the Mongolian plateau. In this study, MODIS remote sensing data are used to monitor and analyse SDS events on the Mongolian Plateau. The annual distribution of spring SDSs (March to May) from 2000 to 2021 are obtained based on the dust storm detection index. The overall classification accuracy is 85.24% and the kappa coefficient is 0.7636. Results show a decrease in the overall frequency of SDS events, where storm events in 2000-2010 are significantly higher than those in the second decade. The cross-border regions between China and Mongolia appear to be SDS intensity centers, particularly those in southern Mongolia. Precipitation exhibits a strong negative correlation with the area affected by SDS, and the correlation coefficient is - 0.72. The increase in barren and sand contributes primarily to the increase in SDS, whereas wind prevention and sand control projects undertaken by the Mongolian and Chinese governments promote regional restoration. Policies pertaining to cross-board sandstorm responses on the Mongolian Plateau are recommended.

TI  - A new multi-source remote sensing image sample dataset with high resolution for flood area extraction: GF-FloodNet
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning algorithms show good prospects for remote sensing flood monitoring. They mostly rely on huge amounts of labeled data. However, there is a lack of available labeled data in actual needs. In this paper, we propose a high-resolution multi-source remote sensing dataset for flood area extraction: GF-FloodNet. GF-FloodNet contains 13388 samples from Gaofen-3 (GF-3) and Gaofen-2 (GF-2) images. We use a multi-level sample selection and interactive annotation strategy based on active learning to construct it. Compare with other flood-related datasets, GF-FloodNet not only has a spatial resolution of up to 1.5 m and provides pixel-level labels, but also consists of multi-source remote sensing data. We thoroughly validate and evaluate the dataset using several deep learning models, including quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis, and validation on large-scale remote sensing data in real scenes. Experimental results reveal that GF-FloodNet has significant advantages by multi-source data. It can support different deep learning models for training to extract flood areas. There should be a potential optimal boundary for model training in any deep learning dataset. The boundary seems close to 4824 samples in GF-FloodNet. We provide GF-FloodNet at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pengliuair/gf-floodnet and https://pan.baidu.com/s/11yx5ERsGkkfUQXPYn34KkQ?pwd=yh47.

TI  - The global change and response special project: using remote sensing data to monitor and invert key components in the cryosphere
T2  - ALL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is critical to understand the mechanisms and impacts of global climate change in cryosphere and polar environment. Here we describe the design and progress of the remote sensing products we have developed to monitor these changes. We obtain datasets by combining multi-sensor remote sensing systems with field validation systems, and then develop a methodological system that combines multiple sources and calibration technologies to address the challenges of data heterogeneity in dynamically monitoring key parameters. This global change and response special project supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, named 'observation and inversion of critical parameters of changes in the cryosphere and polar environment', providing comprehensive records of essential elements of the cryosphere through long-term satellite records. The multi-team is completing the project and collecting data from multi-sensor to create remote sensing data products that include records of changes in the cryosphere, such as permafrost, glaciers, ice sheet mass balance, seasonal snow accumulation, sea ice, and albedo changes. Finally, the existing ground- and space-based observing system can be improved to provide dynamic monitoring of key parameters in the cryosphere and changes in the polar environment.

TI  - A novel spectral index for mapping blue colour-coated steel roofs (BCCSRs) in urban areas using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue colour-coated steel roofs (BCCSRs) offer a lightweight and economical option to concrete and other cladding in buildings, but they are also controversial for altering the surface energy budget and water cycle. Obtaining spatial information about BCCSRs is crucial for exploring the environmental impacts of man-made landscapes. However, existing methods are not always effective due to the variety of BCCSR types and background conditions. To overcome these limitations, we proposed a new index (called BCCSI) based on Sentinel-2 multispectral images to map the commonly used BCCSRs. Five typical study areas were chosen worldwide to develop and validate the BCCSI. Based on spectral analysis, we constructed the BCCSI using the blue, red, green, and shortwave infrared 2 (SWIR2) bands to highlight the BCCSR while suppressing the background condition. Compared with five existing indices, the BCCSI was effective in the visual evaluation, separability analysis and BCCSR mapping. Moreover, the BCCSI achieved similar accuracy to the supervised classifier while avoiding the time-consuming and laborious effort of sample collection. Furthermore, the BCCSI showed its applicability in medium-resolution satellite data, such as Landsat-8 imagery. Thus, the proposed BCCSI provides a viable scheme for global BCCSR mapping and analysis.

TI  - Urban subsidence in rapid economic development: the case of Luoyang city, Henan Province
T2  - ALL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urban development has led to severe land subsidence in Luoyang, Henan Province in the past few years. The current research on subsidence in urban areas of Luoyang is relatively few and early, and cannot reflect the current status of land subsidence in Luoyang. To grasp the current status of land subsidence in Luoyang and prevent the harm caused by subsidence. We used 57 Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images covering Luoyang to obtain the land subsidence from April 2017 to December 2021 by using the small baseline subset interferometric SAR technique. The results show that there are several areas of land subsidence in Luoyang City, and the most serious area of subsidence is located near the highway in Jianxi District, with a cumulative subsidence of 130 mm. Land subsidence exists to varying degrees near transportation facilities (Expressway roads, railway, metro), key urban facilities (airports, high-speed railway stations) and ancient sites in Luoyang. A number of small-scale local subsidence in Luoyang is mainly related to high-intensity urban construction, and urban highway and building construction are the main causes of local land subsidence. Industrial activities are also an important factor in land subsidence in Luoyang. Groundwater and rainfall can impact land subsidence, and large amounts of rainfall during the flood season can replenish groundwater resources and slow down the rate of land subsidence. Loess foundations and large amounts of artificial fill in the city may also induce land subsidence.

TI  - Fanet: A deep learning framework for black and odorous water extraction
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Black and odorous water (BOW) is a common issue in rapidly urbanizaing developing countries. Existing methods for extracting BOW from remote sensing images focus mainly on spectral information and ignores important spatial characteristics like texture, context and orientation. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach for BOW extraction, but its effectiveness is hindered by limited amount of labeled data and a small proportion of objects. In this paper, we proposed a fully convolutional adversarial network (FANet) for end-to-end pixel-level semantic segmentation of BOW.. FANet combines a fully convolutional network (FCN) with a larger receptive field and perceptual loss, and employs adversarial learning to enhance stability in the absence of sufficient data labels. The Normalized Difference BOW Index, which can reflect the higher spectral reflectance of BOW in the near-infrared band, is used as the input of FANet together with RGB. In addition, we create a standard BOW dataset containing 5100 Gaofen-2 of 224 x 224 pixels. Evaluation of FANet on BOW dataset using intersection over union and F1-score demonstrates its superiority over popular models like FCN, U-net, and Segnet. FANet successfully preserves the integrity, continuity, and boundaries of BOW, achieving superior performance in both quantity and quality of BOW extraction.

TI  - A scalable software package for time series reconstruction of remote sensing datasets on the Google Earth Engine platform
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal residual noise in terrestrial earth observation products, often caused by unfavorable atmospheric conditions, impedes their broad applications. Most users prefer to use gap-filled remote sensing products with time series reconstruction (TSR) algorithms. Applying currently available implementations of TSR to large-volume datasets is time-consuming and challenging for non-professional users with limited computation or storage resources. This study introduces a new open-source software package entitled 'HANTS-GEE' that implements a well-known and robust TSR algorithm, i.e. Harmonic ANalysis of Time Series (HANTS), on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for scalable reconstruction of terrestrial earth observation data. Reconstruction tasks can be conducted on user-defined spatiotemporal extents when raw datasets are available on GEE. According to site-based and regional-based case evaluation, the new tool can effectively eliminate cloud contamination in the time series of earth observation data. Compared with traditional PC-based HANTS implementation, the HANTS-GEE provides quite consistent reconstruction results for most terrestrial vegetated sites. The HANTS-GEE can provide scalable reconstruction services with accelerated processing speed and reduced internet data transmission volume, promoting algorithm usage by much broader user communities. To our knowledge, the software package is the first tool to support full-stack TSR processing for popular open-access satellite sensors on cloud platforms.

TI  - High-resolution spatio-temporal analysis of snowmelt over Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves from 2015 to 2021 using SAR images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice shelves play an essential role in the dynamics of the Antarctic ice sheet. The surface meltwater is important, as it can irreversibly weaken ice shelves by exerting additional hydrostatic pressure. Therefore, high-resolution snowmelt products are urgently needed to accurately analyze melting patterns of ice shelves and further estimate mass loss. In this study, a new high-resolution (40 m) snowmelt dataset over all of the Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves larger than 100 km 2 was developed based on the modified snowmelt detection framework by using a co-orbit normalization method. The dataset provides detailed snowmelt information on each ice shelf, including the image coverage, melting area and melting ratio every 5 days. The melting patterns of three typical ice shelves (George VI, Wilkins and Larsen C Ice Shelves) and the spatio-temporal melting distribution of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) were further analyzed. The snowmelt information indicates that both the extent and duration of snowmelt have been increasing in the Antarctic Peninsula from 2015 to 2021, and we found that the snowmelt on the Antarctic Peninsula showed a spatial pattern of significantly intense snowmelt on the western side. We believe this study will provide essential data for ice shelf investigation to support other fields of polar research.

TI  - Modification and validation of a new method to improve the accuracy of MODIS-derived dew point temperature over mainland China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS atmospheric profile products (MOD07_L2 and MYD07_L2) have been widely used for near-surface dew point temperature ( T d ) estimation. However, their accuracy over large scale has seldom been evaluated. In this study, we validated these two products comprehensively against 2153 stations over mainland China. MOD07_L2 was suggested by our study because it achieved higher accuracy in either of two frequently-used methods. To be specific, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) achieved by MOD07_L2 and MYD07_L2 was 5.82 and 7.42 & DEG;C, respectively. On this basis, a recent ground-based correction method was modified to further improve their accuracy. Our focus is to investigate whether this ground-based approach is applicable to large-scale remote sensing applications. The results show that this new method showed great potential for T d estimation independently from ground observations. Through the introduction of MODIS land surface products, the RMSE it achieved for MOD07_L2 and MYD07_L2 was 5.23 and 5.59 & DEG;C, respectively. Further analysis shows that it was particularly useful in capturing the annual average T d patterns. The R2 , RMSE, and bias of annual average daily mean T d estimates were 0.95, 1.84 & DEG;C, and 0.53 & DEG;C, and those achieved for annual average instantaneous T d estimates were 0.94, 2.09 & DEG;C, and 0.75 & DEG;C, respectively.

TI  - Landsat-derived impervious surface area expansion in the Arctic from 1985 to 2021
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely impervious surface mapping is essential for assessing land cover change, urban heat island, and monitoring human activity intensity and ecological change. While various global impervious surface datasets become available, these datasets exhibit significant omissions in Arctic regions. Hence, in this study, we present a 30-m impervious surface area (ISA) dataset of Arctic from 1985 to 2021 (GISA_Arcitc). To this aim, we proposed to combine visually interpreted ISA samples and automatically generated NonISA samples for Arctic ISA mapping. Then, adaptive random forest (RF) classifiers were used for long time-series ISA mapping and the result was post-processed to improve the spatial-temporal consistency. Finally, the accuracy of GISA_Arcitc was assessed using the 37,800 independent test samples. GISA_Arctic possessed an overall accuracy of 93.59 % and a F-score of 0.934. It is found that the Arctic ISA increased from 857.83 km2 to 2115.49 km2 during the past 37 years. More than 84 % of the Arctic ISA increment is embraced by three countries: Russia, Finland, and Norway. Courtesy of the long time-series GISA_Arctic, the sources of Arctic ISA expansion were further analyzed. It was found that the top three land covers transformed to ISA are tundra, forest and grassland. The GISA_Arctic could contribute to further understanding of human activities and Arctic ecological changes, which can be accessed from http://irsi p.whu.edu.cn/resources/resources_v2.php.

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamics of land use transitions associated with human activities over Eurasian Steppe: Evidence from improved residual analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We presented a framework to evaluate the land use transformations over the Eurasian Steppe (EUS) driven by human activities from 2000 to 2020. Framework involves three main components: (1) evaluate the spatial -temporal dynamics of land use transitions by utilizing the land change modeler (LCM) and remote sensing data; (2) quantifying the individual contributions of climate change and human activities using improved re-sidual trend analysis (IRTA) and pixel-based partial correlation coefficient (PCC); and (3) quantifying the con-tributions of land use transitions to Leaf Area Index Intensity (LAII) by using the linear regression. Research findings indicate an increase in cropland (+1.17 % = 104,217 km2) over EUS, while a -0.80 % reduction over Uzbekistan and -0.16 % over Tajikistan. From 2000 to 2020 a slight increase in grassland was observed over the EUS region by 0.05 %. The detailed findings confirm an increase (0.24 % = 21,248.62 km2) of grassland over the 1st half (2000-2010) and a decrease (-0.19 % =-16,490.50 km2) in the 2nd period (2011-2020), with a notable decline over Kazakhstan (-0.54 % = 13,690 km2), Tajikistan (-0.18 % = 1483 km2), and Volgograd (-0.79 % = 4346 km2). Area of surface water bodies has declined with an alarming rate over Kazakhstan (-0.40 % = 10,261 km2) and Uzbekistan (-2.22 % = 8943 km2). Additionally, dominant contributions of human ac-tivities to induced LULC transitions were observed over the Chinese region, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, and Volgograd regions, with approximately 87 %, 83 %, 92 %, and 47 %, respectively, causing effective transitions to 12,997 km2 of cropland, 24,645 km2 of grassland, 16,763 km2 of sparse vegetation in China, and 12,731.2 km2 to grassland and 15,356.1 km2 to sparse vegetation in Mongolia. Kazakhstan had mixed climate-human impact with human-driven transitions of 48,568 km2 of bare land to sparse vegetation, 27,741 km2 to grassland, and 49,789 km2 to cropland on the eastern sides. Southern regions near Uzbekistan had climatic dominancy, and 8472 km2 of water bodies turned into bare soil. LAII shows an increasing trend rate of 0.63 year -1, particularly over human-dominant regions. This study can guide knowledge of oscillations and reduce adverse impacts on eco-systems and their supply services.

TI  - Monitoring long-term vegetation condition dynamics in persistent semi-arid wetland communities using time series of Landsat data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands in arid and semi-arid regions are characterized by dry- and wet-phase vegetation expression which responds to variable water resources. Monitoring condition trends in these wetlands is challenging because transitions may be rapid and short-lived, and identification of meaningful condition change requires longitudinal study. Remotely-sensed data provide cost effective, multi-decadal information with sufficient temporal and spatial scale to explore wetland condition. In this study, we used a time series of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from 34 years (1988-2021) of Landsat imagery, to investigate the long-term condition dynamics of six broad vegetation groups (communities) in a large floodplain wetland system, the Macquarie Marshes in Australia. These communities were persistently mapped as River Red Gum wetland, Black Box/Coolibah woodland, Lignum shrubland, Semi-permanent wetland, Terrestrial grassland and Terrestrial woodland. We used generalized additive models (GAM) to explore the response of vegetation to seasonality, river flow and climatic conditions. We found that EVI was a useful metric to monitor both wetland condition and response to climatic and hydrological drivers. Wetland communities were particularly responsive to river flow and seasonality, while terrestrial communities were responsive to climate and seasonality. Our results indicate asymptotic condition responses, and therefore evidence of hydrological thresholds, by some wetland communities to river flows. We did not observe a long-term trend of declining condition although an apparent increase in condition variability towards the end of the time series requires continued monitoring. Our remotely-sensed, landscape-scale moni- toring approach merits further ground validation. We discuss how it can be used to provide a management tool which continuously assesses short and long-term wetland condition and informs conservation decisions about water management for environmental flows.

TI  - Shoreline change rate detection applying the DSAS technique on low and medium resolution data: Case study along Ash Shu'aybah-Al Mujayrimah coastal Area of the Eastern Red Sea, Saudi Arabia
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ash Shu'aybah and Al Mujayrimah coast area in Saudi Arabia is threatened by constantly changing shoreline dynamics. This work explains how to appropriately quantify shoreline change rates using the Landsat and Sentinel-2 datasets, predict the coastline after twenty years (2022-2042) and compare the results from both satellite data. The technique used depends on the integration of remote sensing data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with a Digital Shoreline Analysis System tool (DSAS). For calculating shoreline change rates and predicting future shoreline positions in 2042, eight Landsat satellite images over 36 years from 1986 to 2022 were analysed along with four Sentinel-2 satellite images from 2015 to 2022. Based on the LRR models' data, the shoreline is exposed to erosion with average values of -3.25 and -2.12 m/yr for the Sentinel-2 and the Landsat datasets, respectively. Segment 2 in the central part of the coastline is the area most affected by the dynamics of the shoreline. To assess the accuracy of the obtained results, the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean annual error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were used. The results indicated that both the Sentinel-2 and the Landsat datasets can reliably calculate the shoreline change rate of the study area based on the similar patterns of their data, although the Sentinel-2 had a somewhat better ability in calculating the change of the shoreline. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Active peptides with hypoglycemic effect obtained from hemp (Cannabis sativa L) protein through identification, molecular docking, and virtual screening
T2  - FOOD CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hemp (Cannabis sativa L) seeds are rich in proteins of high nutritional value, which makes the study of beneficial properties of hemp seed proteins and peptides, such as hypotensive and hypoglycemic effects, increasingly attractive. The present results confirm the good processability and stability of the hemp protein hydrolysate obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of non-dehulled hemp seed meal (NDHM). Six peptides with potential hypoglycemic activity were obtained by ethanol-graded precipitation, Nano LC-Q-Orbitrap-MS/MS mass spectrometry, and computerized virtual screening. Further, validation experiments for in vitro synthesis showed that TGLGR, SPVI, FY, and FR exhibited good & alpha;-glucosidase inhibitory activity, respectively. Animal experiments showed that the hemp protein peptides modulated blood glucose and blood lipids in hyperglycemic rats. These results indicate that hemp protein peptides can reduce blood glucose levels in hyperglycemic rats, suggesting that hemp proteins may be a promising natural source for the prevention and treatment of hyperglycemia.

TI  - Spatial-temporal distribution of mangrove species in the estuary of the Mamanguape river in the state of Paraíba, Brazil
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are under pressure from various anthropic sources, such as changes in land use in watersheds and effects related to climate change. Thus, detailed monitoring of the distribution of mangrove species can provide important information concerning how such ecosystems are responding to these alterations. This study investigates the spatial-temporal distribution of mangrove species and quantifies the area of the mangrove in the Mamanguape River estuary in the state of Paraiba, Brazil. Land use and land cover changes in mangrove morest during the past 35 years (1985 to 2020) were determined using multi-temporal satellite imageries by Landsat TM and the Random Forest algorithm. The results indicated 17 classes, 9 of which belong to mangrove and 8 to associated classes. The classification of images presented overall accuracy varying between 81.9% and 92.3% and a Kappa coefficient of from 77.7% to 91.1%. We verified a trend of species distribution, in which A. schaueriana and R. mangle exhibited the greater coverage in areas under greater marine influence, while A. germinans and L. racemosa showed higher coverage in areas under greater influence of fresh water. The dominant class was composed of Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia schaueriana, and Laguncularia racemosa. Analyses into alterations of the composition of mangrove species in the estuary of the Mamanguape River indicate that the class of R. mangle, A. schaueriana, and L. racemosa and the class of A. schaueriana diminished, while the class of R. mangle and L. racemosa and the apicum class increased. There was a loss of 2.1% of the mangrove during the study period. During the year 2020 the area registered was 4,620 ha. The main causes of loss of the mangrove area were the installation of shrimp farming ponds, severe defoliation, and the conversion of mangroves into pasture. The mapping carried out in this study provides new insights into the conservation status of the mangrove forests in the Mamanguape River estuary and represents a valuable approach for informing replanting strategies and future management practices.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Monitoring of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, and turbidity in Tunisian waters from 2005 to 2020 using MODIS imagery and the Google Earth Engine
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series ocean color data product facilitates the study of spatio-temporal variability of various physical parameters of water, which allows the monitoring of water quality, interannual variability in phytoplankton biomass, and seasonal representation at different latitudes. Its role in marine biogeochemistry, water quality distribution, and climate fluctuation is very crucial., However, the lack of in situ measurement induces poor management and knowledge of the dynamics of Tunisian coastal waters. Therefore, this study aims to develop a workflow to monitor Tunisian waters based on long-term spatial observations of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, and turbidity observations. Long-term sea surface observations were automatically obtained by processing the daily Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua data via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform from 2005 to 2020. The recorded average monthly and yearly trends are validated by point-based measurements from the Gulf of Gabes and a qualitative analysis based on the bibliographic synthesis of offshore measurement campaigns in Tunisian waters. The hottest years were 2006, 2007, and 2017 while the coldest ones (12-28 degrees C) were 2011, 2012, and 2016. The highest chlorophyll content (10 and 5 & mu;g L-1) was observed in 2006, 2007, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016, and 2019. In addition, Turbidity peaks ranging between 11 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) and 5 NTU were identified during December and January of 2005 2008, and 2011. Moreover, seasonal cyclicity and high correlations between estimated parameters were observed. Overall, combining the Google Earth Engine tool with daily MODIS data was effective for the routine monitoring of water quality parameters that is fast, accurate, and important for Tunisian coast management. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Quantifying biomass and canopy cover of submerged aquatic vegetation on an offshore island
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The coverage and biomass of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) are vital characteristics of marine resource management and development. However, using in situ measurements to assess the distribution and biomass of SAV is challenging because SAV distribution varies with biomass, substrate type, and depth, making it difficult to monitor. Satellite remote sensing is an advanced tool that can tackle this problem. In this study, several techniques, such as atmospheric correction, water column correction, and supervised classification, were integrated with Landsat-8 images to map SAV distribution on an offshore island in Viet Nam, Ly Son island. The substrate-classifying result had high accuracy (OA = 92.6%, K = 0.9 ). The coastal, blue, and green bands of Landsat-8 were used to estimate the SAV biomass using a polynomial regression (RMSE = & PLUSMN;1440.6 g fresh m-2, R2 = 0.71). The results showed that the total fresh biomass of SAV in Ly Son island is 14551.04 tonnes, with a corresponding area of 332.1 hectares, equivalent to an average biomass of 4381.5 & PLUSMN; 1440.6 g fresh m-2. The distribution and biomass maps of SAV produced in this study could be used as input to measure the attributes of SAV biodiversity, contributing more effectively to monitoring marine ecosystems in Viet Nam.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - DBCT-Net:A dual branch hybrid CNN-transformer network for remote sensing image fusion
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image fusion aims at fusing high spatial resolution single-band panchromatic (PAN) image with spectrally informative multispectral (MS) image to generate panchromatic sharpened image with high resolution and color information, it is also called pansharpening. Most of the proposed single convolutional neural network (CNN) or transformer-based pansharpening methods own several problems, such as inability to acquire long-range features or difficult to train, resulting the loss of spatial details and colors. In addition, the computational complexity of transformer cannot be ignored. In this work, we propose a dual-branch hybrid CNN-Transformer network (DBCT-Net) that utilizes the local specificity of CNN and models the global dependencies by transformer. First, a multi-branch dense connected block (MDCB-4) network is designed to obtain spectral and textural information in MS and PAN images, respectively. Next, an encoder-decoder transformer based on the self-attention and co-attention modules is able to inject the missing local and global information, which can further enhance the results. It is worth noting that an inverted multi-head transposed attention (IMTA) is applied here to build attention maps from feature dimensions, which greatly reduces the computation time. Finally, an image reconstruction module is employed to effectively fuse the acquired texture and spectral features. Furthermore, to generate visually better pansharpened images, we propose a combined loss function that includes a focal frequency loss. Extensive experiments on WorldView II (WV2), GF-2,and QuickBird (QB) datasets show that DBCT-Net can perform better in spatial preservation and spectral feature recovery.

TI  - Integrated vegetation cover of typical steppe in China based on mixed decomposing derived from high resolution remote sensing data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands represent the largest ecosystem in China, accurate and efficient extraction of its integrated vegetation cover (IVC) plays a crucial role in supporting policy decisions. This study presented a method for grassland monitoring via IVC derived from high-resolution satellite data. Taking the multispectral data of Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Gaofen-6 (GF-6) with 16 m resolution as the main data source, vegetation cover of six representative regions was assessed based on mixed-pixel decomposition model. Using grassland vegetation cover and ratio of grassland area, the IVC in each site was calculated and verified against ground-measured sample data. The results showed that the IVC of grassland was closely related to vegetation habitat driven by regional hydrothermal regime. Yichang grassland, dominated with warm-temperate shrub tussock type, had the highest IVC (80.06 %) due to its favorable hydrothermal conditions. For the main grassland types in Hulunbuir and Gansu Province (temperate meadow steppe and temperate typical steppe), the IVC was 79.38 % and 58.46 %, respectively. In both Xilin-Gol and Nagqu, vegetation cover decreased gradually from east to west, and the IVC was merely 42.83 % and 42.61 %, respectively. Both regions are endowed with less hydrothermal resources to different degrees. Alxa, with a predominately temperate desert landscape, had the lowest IVC of 15.58 % where precipitation is extremely scarce. Based on the grass species of measured samples, the dominant species and biodiversity of different grassland types in Gansu Province and Hulunbuir Municipality of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were analyzed. The results showed that the meadow grassland has the richest biodiversity. The temperate mountain meadows in Gansu Province have a high species diversity, with a total of 90 grass species, and the lowland meadows in Hulunbuir have a total of 49 grass species. This study utilizes high-resolution data to conduct largescale vegetation monitoring, which is a viable alternative for efficient assessment of steppe ecology.

TI  - The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the variation of sea surface chlorophyll-a in Bohai Sea, China
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To prevent the pandemic of COVID-19, Chinese government implemented restrict city lockdown policy, which directly changed human daily habitats and customs, and further influence environment. Using the GOCI-derived sea surface chlorophyll-a Level-2 products, the impacts of city lockdown policy on sea surface chlorophyll-a in the coastal regions of Bohai Sea were evaluated by difference-in-differences (DiD) model. To improve the spatiotemporal coverage of the remote sensing data, data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions were employed to reconstruct the sea surface chlorophyll-a data. The results of DiD model showed that the city lockdown policy will contribute to a significant increment (with the range 1.12-1.14 mg/m3) of sea surface chlorophyll-a within 15 km from the coastline; meanwhile, the impact strength weakens with the distance to coastline increases. Applying the DiD model for the cities with human development index larger than 0.77, the inference is more prominent and significant with the increment (1.15-1.29 mg/m3) of sea surface chlorophyll-a; while non-significant increment of sea surface chlorophyll-a was detected for the cities with a human development index smaller than 0.77. The detected 15 km delimiter can be regarded as a guidance for environmental manager to make sampling strategies. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - From urbanization to bioaccumulation: A comparative study of metal pollution and biomarker responses in Donax trunculus along a touristic coastal area in Morocco
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the use of the edible bivalve, Donax trunculus, as a bioindicator of metal pollution (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, and Cr) resulting from beach urbanization related to touristic development in Morocco. The study aim is to conduct a two-year investigation to compare a period of moderate urbanization (2018) with a period of high urbanization (2019). Particularly, the study investigated the occurrence and bioaccumulation levels of metals in D. trunculus as well as the response of four biomarkers in this sentinel species. The results revealed that metal bioaccumulation in the studied bivalve increased due to the intensification of anthropogenic activities associated with urbanization, particularly for cadmium. Similar findings were observed for the metal pollution index, which reached higher values in the second year. Overall, the hazard associated with human consumption was not significant, however, the risk was more probable for children and during 2019. In the second year, the examined biological endpoints demonstrated varied responses, including induction for glutathione-S-transferase and malondialdehyde, inhibition for catalase, and stability in acetylcholinesterase activity. Consequently, statistical analyses revealed a relationship between the bioaccumulated metals and the response of biomarkers. Further management considerations are required in the study area to minimize the occurrence and the risks of metals. Likewise, additional in situ and ex situ scientific investigations must be implemented to provide deeper findings about the sources, occurrences, magnitudes, and toxicity of metals in the touristic coasts of Morocco. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Investigating an extreme meteo-oceanographic event in the southern Brazil from in situ observations and modeling results
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In March 2016, the passage of a cold front on the southern coast of Brazil generated extreme meteooceanographic conditions along the southern Brazilian coast. This work investigates the wave field evolution during this period from in situ observations and numerical modeling. The observations were obtained from high-frequency measurements performed in four sites along the coastline (Santos, Tramandai, Rio Grande, and Cassino). The wavefield simulations were performed by coupling the Global Forecast System (GFS) reanalysis and the WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) ocean wave model. In a synoptic analysis was observed that not only the cold front caused the high wave in the area, but the interaction between the front post-high-pressure center and a low-pressure center generated a substantial pressure gradient area along the Brazilian coast with winds between 17.1 and 20.7 m s-1 reaching up to 24.4 m s-1. Model estimates confirm the presence of high waves between 6.0 and 6.5 m on the Southern coast of Brazil. Also, in the adjacent deep waters of the South Atlantic Ocean, highly simulated waves reached significant wave heights of 9 m. An analysis of the model input wind indicates that the GFS winds represented very well the trends and evolution of the wind registered by ocean buoys, with a small phase error. The t-test shows no significant differences in any buoys, with p-value = 0.73 and p-value = 0.78, with a significance level of 0.05. The best WW3 domain identified to simulate the wavefield off the coast of Southern do Brazil was 70 degrees W -4 degrees W longitude and 55 degrees S -13 degrees S latitude. Two buoys and two ondographic records in the area were used to evaluate the simulations in shallow water. In contrast, a reanalysis with satellite data assimilation was used to compare the simulations. In shallow water, the results for significant height of Wind and Swell Waves (SWH) show how the WW3 model slightly advances the maximum SWH time in relation to the buoys and ondographs records. This maximum SWH simulated by WW3 is in correspondence with the maximum GFS and records wind. The WW3 model underestimated the maximum SWH compared to the maximum buoys recorded and overestimated the maximum SWH compared to the maximum ondographs recorded. The Peak Period (Tp) simulations also showed an underestimate by the model in the two buoys and two ondograph locations. The BIAS distribution showed low values of the SWH in deep water between-1.2 m and 1.2 m. In general, in each analysis carried out, the t-test showed that there are no significant differences between the SWH and Tp simulated and the SWH and Tp records. In the analysis of the directions, it was observed that the strongest winds were recorded from the E direction for both Rio Grande (above 18 m s-1) and Santos (12-15 m s-1) buoys with frequency values of 27.8% and 12% respectively. As a reflection of the wind, predominant directions of E-SE waves were observed with high-frequency values in the Rio Grande (43.1%), Santos (54.2%), Cassino (67.4%), and Tramandai (100%) records. The presence of waves with Tp (less than 12s) was observed in the records of buoys and wave gauges related to wind-wave. Only in the Santos buoy were observed waves with Tp higher than 12s (swell). The model showed a difference of 22.5 & DEG; between the recorded wind and wave roses, and 45 & DEG; between the recorded wind roses and the wave rose.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ecohydrologic model with satellite-based data for predicting streamflow in ungauged basins
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on water availability in basins can be crucial for making decisions for effective water resource management in basins. As the operation of hydrometric stations in Korea is mainly focused on flood season and large rivers, most basins have lack or no observed data. Consequently, this complicates water resource planning and management. Remote sensing data is emerging as a powerful alternative to hydrological information in ungauged basins. This study investigated the applicability of Satellite-Remote Sensed Data (SRSD) as a source for model calibration in Prediction in Ungauged Basins (PUB) through modeling. Remote sensed leaf area index (LAI), actual evapotranspiration, and soil moisture data were used. Each SRSD was used alone to calibrate a hydrologic model to predict the daily streamflow for 28 basins in Korea. A vegetation module was added to the existing hydrologic model to use LAI. Among the SRSDs tested, the model calibrated with LAI had the most robust performance, predicting streamflow with acceptable accuracy compared to the traditional calibration based on streamflow. In particular, since the model account for vegetation actively interacting with evapotranspiration and soil moisture in the season of low flow, the LAI-calibrated model showed an advantage in improving the flow prediction performance. Although further research is required to utilize evapotranspiration and soil moisture data, the overall results of the LAI-based calibration were promising for predicting streamflow in ungauged basins where observations are scarce or absent, given that the satellite-derived LAI data were used alone without any preprocessing such as a bias correction. However, the prediction performance of the LAI-calibrated model was found to have a statistically significant relationship with local conditions. Therefore, by evaluating and improving the potential of SRSD in different region and climatic conditions, it is expected that the application of the SRSD-only calibration method can be extended to various ungauged basins.

TI  - Development of complex patterns of anthropogenic uplift and subsidence in the Delaware Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico, USA
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Delaware Basin in west Texas and southeast New Mexico is now the largest global oil producing basin, averaging-400,000 m3 (-2,500,000 barrels) per day in 2022. The shale-dominated strata targeted for pro-duction can co-produce 4-5 times more water than oil, necessitating disposal by injection of-1,400,000 m3 (-8,700,000 barrels) of water per day in 2022. Through a comprehensive assimilation of regional Sentinel-1 satellite radar data and analysis of production and injection, we show how petroleum operations have caused the development of complex and accelerating patterns of surface deformation from 2015 through 2021. We observe uplift from reservoir swelling, subsidence from reservoir contraction, and the development of linear features that are indicative of faulting. Subsidence is predominantly caused by production, and an important finding of this study is that the magnitude of subsidence is linearly proportional to total production. Uplift is caused by pressurization from wastewater injection of shallow permeable strata. The patterns of uplift are complex and extend laterally well-beyond areas where injection was performed. Linear surface deformation features are observed throughout the Delaware Basin, and they are lengthening and densifying as uplift and subsidence accelerate. Many of the lineations can be linked to known strata-bounded faults and shallow seismicity in the southern Delaware Basin where they serve as permeable and anisotropic conduits for pore pressure migration. In the Northern Delaware Basin, co-seismic rupture is hosted along basement-rooted faults that may link to the linear surface features. Understanding these dynamic changes in Delaware Basin is a pressing concern for management of subsurface reservoirs and safeguarding the surface environment. Concerns include ongoing induced seismicity, hazard of drilling through over-pressured strata, maintenance of integrity for newer well bores, mitigation of flows of brine and petroleum fluids at the surface of old wellbores, and management of the pore space resource for wastewater injection.

TI  - High vulnerability of coastal wetlands in Chile at multiple scales derived from climate change, urbanization, and exotic forest plantations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are considered one of the most vulnerable ecosystems worldwide; the ecosystem services they provide and the conservation of their biodiversity are threatened. Despite the high ecological and socioenvironmental value of coastal wetlands, regional and national vulnerability assessments are scarce. In this study we aimed to assess the vulnerability of coastal wetlands in Chile from 18 degrees S to 42 degrees S (n = 757) under a multiscale approach that included drivers associated with climate change and land cover change. We assessed multiple drivers of vulnerability at three spatial scales (10 m, 100 m, and 500 m) by analyzing multiple remote sensing data (16 variables) on land cover change, wildfires, climatic variables, vegetation functional properties, water surface and importance for biodiversity. We constructed a multifactorial vulnerability index based on the variables analyzed, which provided a map of coastal wetland vulnerability. Then we explored the main drivers associated with the vulnerability of each coastal wetland by performing a Principal Components Analysis with Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, which allowed us to group coastal wetlands according to the drivers analyzed. We found that 42.6 & PLUSMN; 9.2 % of the coastal wetlands evaluated have high or very high vulnerability, with higher vulnerability at the 500 m scale (51.4 %). We identified four groups of coastal wetlands: two located in central Chile, mainly affected by climate change-associated drivers (41.9 & PLUSMN; 2.1 %), and one in central Chile which is affected by land cover change (52.8 & PLUSMN; 6.2 %); the latter has a lower vulnerability level. The most vulnerable coastal wetlands were located in central Chile. Our results present novel findings about the current vulnerability of coastal wetlands, which could be validated by governmental institutions in field campaigns. Finally, we believe that our methodological approach could be useful to generate similar assessments in other world zones. which is affected by land cover change (52.8 & PLUSMN; 6.2 %); the latter has a lower vulnerability level.

TI  - The role of wastewater-based epidemiology for SARS-CoV-2 in developing countries: Cumulative evidence from South Africa supports sentinel site surveillance to guide public health decision-making.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The uptake of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for SARS-CoV-2 as a complementary tool for monitoring population-level epidemiological features of the COVID-19 pandemic in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) is low. We report on the findings from the South African SARS-CoV-2 WBE surveillance network and make recommendations regarding the implementation of WBE in LMICs. Eight laboratories quantified influent wastewater collected from 87 wastewater treatment plants in all nine South African provinces from 01 June 2021 to 31 May 2022 inclusive, during the 3rd and 4th waves of COVID-19. Correlation and regression analyses between wastewater levels of SARS-CoV-2 and district laboratory-confirmed caseloads were conducted. The sensitivity and specificity of novel 'rules' based on WBE data to predict an epidemic wave were determined. Amongst 2158 wastewater samples, 543/648 (85%) samples taken during a wave tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with 842 positive tests from 1512 (55%) samples taken during the interwave period. Overall, the regression-co-efficient was 0,66 (95% confidence interval=0,6-0,72, R2=0.59), ranging from 0.14 to 0.87 by testing laboratory. Early warning of the 4th wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Gauteng Province in November-December 2021 was demonstrated. A 50% increase in log copies of SARS-CoV-2 compared with a rolling mean over the previous five weeks was the most sensitive predictive rule (58%) to predict a new wave. Our findings support investment in WBE for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in LMICs as an early warning tool. Standardising test methodology is necessary due to varying correlation strengths across laboratories and redundancy across testing plants. A sentinel site model can be used for surveillance networks without affecting WBE finding for decision-making. Further research is needed to identify optimal test frequency and the need for normalisation to population size to identify predictive and interpretive rules to support early warning and public health action.

TI  - Water turbidity dynamics using random forest in the Yangtze River Delta Region, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity is a water quality indicator that is essential for the sustainable development of aquatic ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity. The turbidity of different water surfaces and its response mechanisms to regional climatic factors and human activities in the Yangtze River Delta Region (YRDR), an important rapid economic development region in China, remain poorly understood. To enhance the knowledge of turbidity variations and dominant drivers of YRDR water surfaces, a complete long-term turbidity series was obtained using Landsat images from 1990 to 2020. The results show that the turbidity trend differed from-1.3 NTU/yr to 0.7 NTU/yr in different water surfaces. Turbidity decreased significantly in the mainstream of the Yangtze River (MYR), aquaculture ponds (AP) and other water bodies, whilst increasing significantly in the medium lakes (ML) and mainstream of the Qiantang River (MQR). Meanwhile, no significant changes in turbidity were observed in the great lakes (GL) and small lakes (SL). Rather than climatic factors, urbanisation and decreasing wastewater discharge were the dominant drivers of turbidity trends during the study period. In addition, ecological engineering in AP increased water transparency. The Three Gorges Dam also decreased turbidity in MYR. Increasing turbidity in the downstream of MQR was driven by increasing seasonal water surfaces and reclamation projects near Hangzhou Bay. GL faced no significant increase in turbidity due to the offset of afforestation to urbanisation induced turbidity increase. These findings provide important information for government decision-making for subsequent aquatic environmental protection and restoration in the YRDR.

TI  - A novel framework for improving soil organic matter prediction accuracy in cropland by integrating soil, vegetation and human activity information
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an important tool for monitoring soil information. However, accurate spatial modeling of soil organic matter (SOM) in areas with high vegetation coverage, typically represented by agroecosystems, remains a challenge for field-scale estimation using remote sensing. To date, studies have focused on using single-period or multi-temporal vegetation information to characterize SOM. Thus, the relationship between SOM content and time-series vegetation biomass has not yet been fully explored. In addition, most studies have ignored the effects of critical soil properties and human activities (e.g., soil salinization, soil particle size fractions, history of land use changes) on SOM. By integrating information on vegetation, soil, and human activities, we propose a novel framework for assessing SOM in cotton fields of artificial oases in northwest China, where returned straw is one of the primary sources of SOM coming from vegetation. We developed an Annual Maximum Biomass Accumulation Index (AMBAI) using time-series Landsat images from 1990 to 2019. Subsequently, we quantified the information of the planting years (PY) of cropland using spectral index threshold and incorporated proximal sensing data (soil hyperspectral and apparent conductivity data) and soil particle size fractions to establish a predictive model of SOM using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and convolutional neural network (CNN). The results revealed that AMBAI had the highest correlation coefficient (r) with SOM (0.76, P < 0.01). AMBAI, soil hyperspectral data, and PY were the most relevant predictors for estimating SOM. The CNN model integrating vegetation, soil, and human activity information performed best, with coefficient of determination (R-2), relative analysis error (RPD), and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.83, 2.38 and 1.38 g kg(- 1), respectively. This study confirmed that AMBAI and PY had great potential for characterizing SOM in arid and semi-arid regions, providing a reference for other relevant studies.

TI  - Regional climate change and possible causes over the Three Gorges Reservoir Area
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three Gorges Project, the largest hydroelectric project in the world, has attracted widespread attention regarding its impact on regional climate. However, existing studies on the climate effects of the Three Gorges Project construction are not sufficient due to limited data accumulation. In this study, we analyzed the annual and seasonal trend changes in temperature, precipitation, and humidity over the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) based on long-term meteorological stations data, remote sensing data, and reanalysis products. Obser-vation minus reanalysis method (OMR) was used to reveal possible impacts of land cover changes on climate changes. Major results indicated that the TGRA experienced an overall warming trend for both annual and seasonal variations, with greater rising trends in the upstream. Except for autumn, the relative humidity of most regions mainly showed significant downward trends, indicating an overall drying trend in the TGRA. There was insignificant change in total precipitation and precipitable water vapor, with the largest variation observed during the summer. Although there were small differences among these datasets, their results of climate changes showed good consistency overall. In addition, the results of OMR indicated that land cover changes mainly had a warming and drying effect on the middle and upper reaches, and a cooling and moistening effect on the lower reaches of the TGRA. This may be due to the impact of land cover changes on the surface energy balance, thus affected temperature and humidity. The study has important reference value for understanding the climate changes in the TGRA and the climate effects brought about by large-scale engineering construction.

TI  - Contrasting effects of clean air actions on surface ozone concentrations in different regions over Beijing from May to September 2013-2020
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the nonlinear impacts of meteorology and precursors, the response of ozone (O3) trends to emission changes is very complex over different regions in megacity Beijing. Based on long-term in-situ observations at 35 air quality sites (four categories, i.e., urban, traffic, northern suburban and southern suburban sites) and satellite data, spatiotemporal variability of O3, gaseous precursors, and O3-VOCs-NOx sensitivity were explored through multiple metrics during the warm season from 2013 to 2020. Additionally, the contribution of meteorology and emissions to O3 was separated by a machine-learning-based de-weathered method. The annual averaged MDA8 O3 and O3 increased by 3.7 and 2.9 & mu;g/m3/yr, respectively, with the highest at traffic sites and the lowest in northern suburb, and the rate of Ox (O3 + NO2) was 0.2 & mu;g/m3/yr with the highest in southern suburb, although NO2 declined strongly and HCHO decreased slightly. However, the increment of O3 and Ox in the daytime exhibited decreasing trends to some extent. Additionally, NOx abatements weakened O3 loss through less NO titration, which drove narrowing differences in urban-suburban O3 and Ox. Due to larger decrease of NO2 in urban region and HCHO in northern suburb, the extent of VOCs-limited regime fluctuated over Beijing and northern suburb gradually shifted to transition or NOx-limited regime. Compared with the directly observed trends, the increasing rate of de-weathered O3 was lower, which was attributed to favorable meteorological conditions for O3 generation after 2017, especially in June (the most polluted month); whereas the de-weathered Ox declined except in southern suburb. Overall, clean air actions were effective in reducing the atmospheric oxidation capacity in urban and northern suburban regions, weakening local photochemical production over Beijing and suppressing O3 deterioration in northern suburb. Strengthening VOCs control and keeping NOx abatement, especially in June, will be vital to reverse O3 increase trend in Beijing.

TI  - Conservation and restoration efforts have promoted increases in shorebird populations and the area and quality of their habitat in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation policies have been formulated for coastal wetlands in China, and exploration of conservation effectiveness based on waterbirds and their habitat is important for guiding conservation actions. We characterized the effects of conservation efforts on shorebird diversity, habitat area and quality using long-term remote sensing data, and shorebird survey data in the Yellow River Delta. From 1997 to 2021, habitat area, quality and population number significantly declined by 49.8% (r = -0.72, p < 0.05), 13.6% (r = -0.72, p < 0.05) and 60.67% (R2 = 0.77, p < 0.05). Before 2012, habitat area (decreased by 38.2%, r = -0.62, p > 0.05, slope = -0.25), quality (decreased by 10.53%, r = -0.68, p > 0.05, slope = -0.008), and population size (significantly decreased by 94.5%, r = -0.95, p < 0.05, slope = -7874.3) declined, and the decline in habitat area significantly contributed to population reductions (r = 0.79, p < 0.05). Since 2012, habitat area (increased by 14.3%, r = 0.71, p > 0.05, slope = 0.12), quality (increased by 17.12%, r = 0.83, p > 0.05, slope = 0.01), and population size (increased by 8.34%, R2 = 0.29, p > 0.05) slightly increased. The coefficients of variation for habitat area and quality, and population size were smaller after 2012 than before 2012. These results suggest that conservation actions maintained the stability of waterbird populations and their habitat; additional actions are needed to mediate the conservation of other degraded habitats along coastal wetlands.

TI  - Denoising and classification of urban ICESat-2 photon data fused with Sentinel-2 spectral images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2) can collect earth surface elevation data with high precision on a global scale. However, the collected photon data contains a large amount of background noise due to the influence of sunlight, cloud reflection, and other factors. For photon data of different scenes, how to effectively denoise and achieve accurate classification of photon point clouds is crucial for subsequent applications. This study proposes a random forest based method for denoising and classifying ICESat-2 photon data in urban areas by fusing spectral features from Sentinel-2 images and spatial distribution features from photon data. The experimental results show that the method can effectively identify various types of photons. Compared with the reference data, the overall accuracy of photon denoising and classification is 95.97% on average, and the average kappa coefficient is 94.18%. Further analysis demonstrates that the addition of sentinel-2 spectral information can effectively improve the classification accuracy of photon point clouds in urban areas, and the photon classification method of combining photon lidar data and optical images can be a promising solution to improve classification accuracy.

TI  - Leaf area index estimation from the time-series SAR data using the AIEM-MWCM model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) inversion accuracy of the water cloud model (WCM) based on the SAR images is low. The main reason is that the WCM model assumes two independent contributions from plant and soil surfaces, without taking into account their interactions. Based on this, this study proposes an efficient LAI estimation method that combines the advanced integral equation model (AIEM) and modified water cloud model (MWCM). Images collected by GaoFen-3 synthetic aperture radar (GF-3 SAR) in the Xiangfu area in the east of Kaifeng City, Henan Province, are processed with a modified SAR-BM3D method and used as test data of the proposed method. The proposed AIEM-MWCM method that combines the AIEM and MWCM models is employed to perform the remote sensing inversion of winter wheat LAI throughout the growth cycle. The results show that the fitting accuracy of winter wheat LAI in the five growth stages achieved by the proposed AIEM-MWCM method inversion is better than that of the Dubois-MWCM model. The R2 value of the proposed method is higher than 0.8, and its root mean squared error (RMSE) is lower than 0.3.

TI  - Mapping thermokarst lakes in different physical states on the central Tibetan plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring the spatial-temporal evolution of thermokarst lakes on the Tibetan Plateau can significantly contribute to the estimation of climate change impacts on permafrost degradation. Remote sensing-based methods have been developed to monitor the interannual changes of thermokarst lakes. However, the seasonal changes, which are vital for understanding thermokarst lake dynamics, are commonly overlooked. This paper developed automatic methods which integrated the normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA) with Markov random field (MRF) for rapid mapping of thermokarst lakes in different physical states characterized by season changes. To validate the effectiveness, the proposed methods were applied to map thermokarst lakes on the central Tibetan Plateau, using four Sentinel-2 images representing different evolutionary states. Specifically, the area-to-point regression kriging (ATPRK) method was employed to downscale the 20-m short-wave infrared (SWIR) band to 10 m. Using manually digitized lakes as a reference, the proposed methods achieved an average Kappa coefficient of 0.79, significantly outperforming the water index thresholding method that merely attained 0.44. The results corroborate that the proposed methods can be robustly applied in mapping thermokarst lake dynamics with both interannual and seasonal trends on the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - An improvement in accuracy and spatial resolution of the pattern-matching sea ice drift from SAR imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice drift is a crucial parameter for sea ice flux, atmospheric and ocean circulation, and ship navigation. Pattern matching is widely used to retrieve sea ice drift from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, but it often yields mismatched vectors and coarse spatial resolution. This study presents a framework to enhance the spatial resolution and accuracy of pattern-matching sea ice drift derived from SAR images. The framework employs the Accelerated-KAZE feature extraction method and Brute-Force feature matcher to extract feature-tracking sea ice drift vectors from SAR data, with mismatched vectors subsequently removed. The pattern-matching vectors are then refined by fusing with these feature-tracking vectors, using a Co-Kriging algorithm. Using the sea ice drift product from the Technical University of Denmark space as the pattern-matching vector field for refinement, the framework's effectiveness is evaluated by comparing the refined vectors with buoy displacements and pattern-matching vectors across five selected regions. Results show a reduction in velocity and direction root mean square error (RMSE) by 0.47 km/d (22%) and 4.97 degrees (28%), respectively, and an enhanced spatial resolution from 10 km to 1 km. The findings demonstrate the framework's success in improving the accuracy and resolution of pattern-matching sea ice drift from SAR imagery.

TI  - Estimating carbon storage of desert ecosystems in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although desert ecosystems are commonly considered to have low carbon storage owing to their sparse vegetation and limited carbon sequestration capacity, they comprise 13.5% of China's terrestrial ecosystems and cover approximately 35% of the Earth's land surface, so they still possess significant carbon storage. The carbon storage of desert ecosystems in China was estimated using MODIS-NDVI data in combination with ground survey, soil census, and literature statistical data. The results indicated that the carbon storage of desert ecosystems in China was 7.063 Pg in 2020. One-meter soil carbon storage accounted for the largest proportion (89.514%), approximately 6.322 Pg, followed by vegetation carbon at 0.741 Pg, and biological soil crust carbon at 0.002 Pg. The carbon density of desert ecosystems was 33.895 Mg.ha(-1), with soil carbon density, vegetation carbon density, and biological soil crust carbon density at 30.330, 3.554, and 0.011 Mg.ha(-1), respectively. This research provides important evidence for the correct understanding of the carbon storage of desert ecosystems in China.

TI  - Soil temperature estimation at different depths over the central Tibetan Plateau integrating multiple Digital Earth observations and geo-computing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil temperature (ST) plays a critical role in ecosystems. Monitoring high-resolution ST profiles remains challenging due to the inherent heterogeneity of ST in space, time, and depth. To address this challenge, in this study, we integrate remote sensing techniques and deep learning methods to retrieve spatiotemporal continuous ST from 2011 to 2020 at four depths (5, 10, 20, and 40 cm) over the central Tibetan Plateau (TP). Landsat and MODIS observations were fused to obtain land surface properties at different resolutions. The fused variables were integrated with in-situ ST and soil moisture (SM) measurements to estimate spatiotemporally continuous (0.0005 degrees, 0.0025 degrees, and 0.0125 degrees) ST profile through deep learning-based training models. The deep belief network (DBN) was applied to estimate ST: (a) from layer to layer (LW-DBN), and (b) from land surface properties directly (Direct-DBN). The ten-fold cross-validation indicates that both approaches achieve promising results (R-2 > 0.836, MAE < 2.152 degrees C), and the Direct-DBN outperformed the LW-DBN at all spatial scales and depths. ST retrieval at deeper depths and coarser resolutions tend to have better monitoring accuracy. Further analysis indicates an increment of ST at all four depths over the study period, which provides valuable insights into global warming.

TI  - Generation of a 16 m/10-day fractional vegetation cover product over China based on Chinese GaoFen-1 observations: method and validation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As China has recently launched the GaoFen-1 satellite (GF-1) carrying on the wide-field view (WFV) sensor, it is a challenging task to make full use of its observations to produce the fractional vegetation cover (FVC). In light of this, our study presents a comprehensive algorithm to generate a 16 m/10-day FVC product by considering the vegetation types characteristics. For forests, considering the foliage clumping effect, FVC was estimated from the gap probability theory using GF-1 leaf area index (LAI) and clumping index (CI) as a priori knowledge; for non-forests, FVC was estimated from the dimidiate pixel model using GF-1 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The performance of GF-1 FVC from 2018 to 2020 was evaluated using FVC ground measurements obtained from 7 sites for crops, grasslands, and forests in China. The direct validation indicated that the performance of the FVC product was satisfactory, as evidenced by R2 = 0.55, RMSE = 0.15 and BIAS = 0.01 for all vegetation types. Furthermore, the GF-1 FVC exhibited better performance compared to the GEOV3 FVC at a spatial resolution of 300 meters. Moreover, the 10-day temporal interval of GF-1 FVC product successfully facilitated the extraction of regional phenological information at a spatial resolution of 16 meters.

TI  - Assessment of potential groundwater Zones in the drought-prone Harawa catchment, Somali region, eastern Ethiopia using geospatial and AHP techniques
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is essential for the sustainable growth of society, economy, and agriculture. Identifying potential zones for groundwater is required to fulfill the needs of various sectors. This study aims to identify prospective groundwater zones in the drought-prone Harawa catchment area of the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia using geospatial and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approaches. Eight significant groundwater regulating vari-ables were developed by combining primary and remote sensing data, and AHP analysis was performed to identify groundwater prospect zones. The findings of the prospective groundwater zone model were categorized into four groups: very low, low, moderate, and high. Approximately 14.2% of the research area was recognized as having high potential, 24.0% as having moderate potential, and 38.7% and 23.2% as having very low and low potentials, respectively. Groundwater prospect maps were examined and confirmed using the discharge data from numerous production wells in the study region. The results demonstrated a strong correlation or agreement with the yield data. The curve approach was cross-validated with the area, revealing an 81.7% correlation be-tween the model findings and the water well points. The sensitivity analysis showed that lithology, land use/land cover, and rainfall significantly impacted groundwater occurrence. In contrast, the slope of the study region had little effect.

TI  - A comparative analysis of surface and canopy layer urban heat island at the micro level using a data-driven approach
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon, which is defined as the temperature differential between inner cities and surrounding areas, has been extensively studied over the past few years to unravel its mechanism and develop mitigation strategies. Nonetheless, two distinct types of temperature can be used to measure UHI, namely, (1) air temperatures, which refer to air temperatures at the canopy layer (CUHI), and (2) surface temperature, which refers to the temperatures at the surface layer (SUHI). The two types of UHI can have different deriving mechanisms and any effective mitigation strategies should be able to mitigate both concurrently. While efforts have been made to compare these two types of UHI, the studies so far seldom used consistent data. This is because SUHI is mostly based on remote sensing data, whereas CUHI commonly requires field measurements. These data are often not consistent with respect to spatial resolution, frequency, and accuracy. To address this gap, the present research aims to perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of CUHI and SUHI using data collected by a tailor-made mobile data collection unit at a high frequency and resolution at the microlevel (i.e., street-level). Data was collected from a fixed 8 km-long route in the city of Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, for the period of one year. Two different machine learning techniques, i.e., random forest and neural network, were used to study SUHI and CUHI. The results indicated a considerable variability between air and surface temperatures during the data collection campaign. Air temperatures ranged from -0,3 to 35,3 degrees C, while surface temperatures fluctuated over a wider range, from -12,0 to 48,4 degrees C at a micro-level. This variability of temperatures translated into an average of 0,10 degrees C for CUHI, and -0,48 degrees C SUHI. More importantly, however, the results highlighted the importance of investigating simultaneously the two types of UHI. This is because while urban features do not change dramatically in short periods of time, the impact of these same features on the CUHI and SUHI is different, therefore urban-heat resilience strategies planned for one type of UHI alone could have a different impact on the other type.

TI  - Land Cover Change Detection and Prediction in the Fafan Catchment of Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change is a pressing environmental issue that the Fafan catchment in Ethiopia is currently grappling with. In spite of several studies on the historical period, predictions on future land cover in Ethiopia in general and the Fafan catchment in particular are limited. In line with this, studies that integrate the local knowledge with remote sensing data are scarce. Thus, the purpose of the study is to examine the land cover dynamics and its drivers for 1990 to 2050, using a combination of satellite imagery and a socio-economic survey. To investigate the dynamics of land cover change, the study employed support vector machine, post-classification, multi-layer perception-artificial neural network, and cellular automata-Markov approaches. Thematic information extraction from satellite imagery was triangulated using local knowledge derived from key informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). The results of the study revealed that the catchment includes six land cover categories, including cropland, settlement, barren land, forest, grassland, and shrubland. For the years 1990 to 2021, forest, grassland, and shrubland decreased by 13.2%, 4.6%, and 18%, respectively, while cropland, settlement, and barren land rose by 19.2%, 11.7%, and 4.9%, respectively. During this period, the net gain for cropland, settlement, and barren land was 30,705 ha; 18,541 ha; and 7,776 ha, respectively, while the net loss of shrubland, grassland, and forest was 28,675 ha; 7,294 ha; and 21,052 ha, respectively. Similarly, for the years 2022 to 2050, cropland, settlement, and barren land are predicted to increase by 9.1%, 3.5%, and 2.2%, respectively, while shrubland, forest, and grassland are expected to decrease by -1.3, -3.65%, and -10.1%, respectively. Furthermore, the findings of the study indicated that several factors have contributed to changes in land cover, including overgrazing, population growth, resettlement, wood collection, and cropland expansion. To this end, by combining socio-economic surveys and remote sensing data, this study has developed a reasonably accurate map of land cover changes. However, the use of very high-resolution satellite imagery, combined with local knowledge, could yield even better results than those obtained from Landsat imagery.

TI  - K-sharp: A segmented regression approach for image sharpening and normalization
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, Earth Observation (EO) satellite missions have improved in spatial resolution and revisit times. These missions, traditionally government-funded, utilize state-of-the-art technology and rigorous instrument calibration, with each mission costing millions of dollars. Recently, nano-satellites known as CubeSats are presenting a cost-effective option for EO; their capacity of working as a constellation has brought an unprecedented opportunity for EO in terms of achievable spatial and temporal resolutions, albeit at the cost of decreased accuracy and cross-sensor consistency. As such, CubeSat datasets often require post-calibration approaches before using them for scientific applications. K-sharp is a relatively simple, data-agnostic machine learning approach that combines K-means and partial least squares regression to derive relationships between two sets of images for normalization. This study used Planet's four-band CubeSat imagery to sharpen day-coincident Landsat 8 normalized difference vegetation index, albedo, and the first short-wave infrared (SWIR) band from 30 m to 3 m spatial resolution (it should be noted that the four-band CubeSat product does not include the first SWIR band, and that the calculation of albedo is not directly possible from this product). K-sharp was tested over agricultural, savanna, rainforest, and tundra sites with and without atmospheric correction. Our model reproduced surface conditions with an average r2 of 0.88 (rMAE =11.39%) across all study sites and target variables when compared against the original Landsat 8 data. These results showcase the promising potential of K-sharp in generating precise, CubeSat-derived datasets with high radiometric quality, which can be incorporated into agricultural or ecological applications to enhance their decision-making process at fine spatial scales.

TI  - Magnitude and direction of green-up date in response to drought depend on background climate over Mongolian grassland
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing drought is one major consequence of ongoing global climate change and is expected to cause significant changes in vegetation phenology, especially for naturally vulnerable ecosystems such as grassland. However, the linkage between the response characteristic of green-up date (GUD) to drought and background climate remains largely unknown. Here, we focused on how the GUD of Mongolian grassland responds to extreme drought events (EDE). We first extracted the GUD from the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index data during 2001-2020 and identified the preseason EDE using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index data. Subsequently, we quantified the response of GUD to preseason EDE (DGUD) in each pixel as the difference in GUD between drought and normal years. The effect of 12 factors on DGUD was analyzed using the random forest algorithm. The results showed that the GUD under EDE may delay or advance by > 20 days compared to normal years. For the regions with mean annual temperature >-2 ?C, the GUD was delayed under EDE due to the dominant role of water restriction on GUD, while the GUD was advanced under EDE in colder areas due to the warmer temperature during drought. However, the magnitude of delay in GUD under drought was greater in regions with less precipitation and more severe droughts. Our results could help to develop appropriate management strategies to mitigate the impacts of drought on grasslands.

TI  - Evaluating Performance of Community-based Irrigation Schemes Using Remote-sensing Technologies to Enhance Sustainable Irrigation Water Management
T2  - WATER CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate estimate of the amount of water used in an irrigation scheme is vital to conserve water resources, although a reliable scheme-level estimate is difficult. The study used remote-sensing technologies to assess the Koga irrigation scheme's performance in the Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia. Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Landsat 8 images were used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Additionally, the FAO-Penman-Monteith method was applied to estimate the crop's evapotranspiration (ETc) and used as a crop water need in assessing performance parameters. The result shows that seasonal relative irrigation supply (RIS) was 6 to 77% higher than the demand. Depletion fraction (DF) varied from 0.4 to 0.5, while relative evapotranspiration deficit values ranged from 0.3 to 0.6, and the crop water use estimate was only about 50% of its need. The lower crop water use is attributed to the excessive application of water for plowing, pre-plant irrigation, and during the early stage of the crop. While the amount of water applied at the mid and late-season stages is less than the crop water need due to water mismanagement because of a lack of coordination among the water users. The study concludes that the use of remote sensing created a good potential to evaluate community-managed scheme irrigation performance. Performing under potential is an implication of low irrigation water productivity that affects environmental sustainability. Therefore, re-thinking better water management ways in community-managed schemes can help to improve water productivity and food security in the changing environment.

TI  - Space Time Cube analytics in QGIS and Python for hot spot detection
T2  - SOFTWAREX
M3  - Article
AB  - The widespread use of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers for monitoring people, vehicles, and animals has generated large amounts of space-time point data. One of the important analyses of such data is hot spot detection. This could be realised by first aggregating the data into a Space Time Cube (STC), and then applying statistics like Getis-Ord G*i or local Moran's I on the cells of the STC. Existing open-source software to realise this either focuses on the spatial aspect of the phenomenon or does not provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This paper proposes, i) a QGIS plugin, and ii) a Python package to determine the localised clusters in space and time by aggregating data into an STC. While the former provides a GUI that is easy to use, the latter is suitable for sensitivity analysis. The experiments on the openly available New York City taxi data demonstrate that the detected hot spots change depending on whether the number of passengers is used as the weight for each data point, and the statistic (i.e. Getis-Ord G*i or local Moran's I). The main advantages of the developed software are two-fold. First, they contribute to free and open-source software for geospatial (FOSS4G). Second, users of varying expertise can utilise them on a potpourri of use cases ranging from transportation to criminology.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Determining the response of riparian vegetation and river morphology to drought using Google Earth Engine and machine learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian vegetation composition and channel morphology are susceptible to long-term alterations caused by external stressors, including climate-change-induced droughts and engineered infrastructures. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify trends in riparian vegetation and channel/floodplain morphology over large spatial (-290 km) and temporal scales (-30 years) and (2) investigate the relationships between hydroclimatic drivers and changes in riparian vegetation and channel morphology. We implemented a random forest classifier via a machine learning technique in Google Earth Engine. The study area was a 290 km reach of the Rio Grande located in New Mexico, USA. We used the combination of remotely sensed data and products (e.g., Landsat imagery, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and land cover) to characterize vegetation, vegetation cover changes, and river morphology shifts from 1984 to 2020. The trend analysis revealed increased vegetated areas and NDVI (0.0004/yr) during long-term drought. The channel experienced a reduction in width associated with vegetation encroachment and the formation of stable vegetated islands. The streamflow hydrograph characteristics were positively correlated with vegetation cover and channel morphology. Our study contributes novel insights into the long-term riparian ecosystem dynamics under drought stress, informing drought impact mitigation and ecosystem management in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Leveraging Chinese GaoFen-7 imagery for high-resolution building height estimation in multiple cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate building heights are essential to understand the mechanisms of urban systems and provide new insights into research on infrastructure equality, urban environment, population modeling, etc. However, relatively few studies have been conducted to estimate high-resolution building heights using Chinese GaoFen-7 imagery across multiple cities. In this study, we developed an effective Building Height Estimation method by synergizing Photogrammetry and Deep learning methods (BHEPD) to leverage Chinese multi-view GaoFen-7 (GF-7) images for high-resolution building height estimation. In particular, BHEPD incorporates the StereoNet model and is capable of generating an edge-preserving digital surface model (DSM) from GF-7 images. This improvement enhances the accuracy of heights estimation, particularly for high-rise, high-density, and multi-scale buildings. BHEPD extracted over 700,000 building heights in local areas of Tianjin, Lanzhou, Chongqing, Ningbo, Guangzhou, Foshan, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. The estimated building heights in the different cities are highly consistent with the reference building height data obtained from field-measured building height data, building floor data, and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. The R-2 varies from 0.75 to 0.90, while the root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 4.06 m to 8.06 m. The validation of the estimated building heights over 106,366 buildings using airborne LiDAR height data yielded R-2 and RMSE of 0.90 and 6.72 m for Shenzhen and 0.89 and 4.06 m for Hong Kong, respectively. Furthermore, a comparison with the building height estimation based on the traditional DSM generation method (i.e., semi-global matching (SGM) algorithm) confirmed the superiority of BHEPD in alleviating the underestimation of high-rise buildings (>60 m). Overall, BHEPD shows great potential for high-resolution building height estimation and can be expected to reduce the manual workload involved in collecting building height information on large scale.

TI  - Optimization of desert lake information extraction from remote sensing images using cellular automata
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Desert lakes are important wetland resources in the blown-sand area of western China and play a significant role in maintaining the regional ecological environment. However, large-scale coal mining in recent years has considerably impacted the deposition condition of several lakes. Rapid and accurate extraction of lake information based on satellite images is crucial for developing protective measures against desertification. However, the spatial resolution of these images often leads to mixed pixels near water boundaries, affecting extraction precision. Traditional pixel unmixing methods mainly obtain water coverage information in a mixed pixel, making it difficult to accurately describe the spatial distribution. In this paper, the cellular automata (CA) model was adopted in order to realize lake information extraction at a sub-pixel level. A mining area in Shenmu City, Shaanxi Province, China is selected as the research region, using the image of Sentinel-2 as the data source and the high spatial resolution UAV image as the reference. First, water coverage of mixed pixels in the Sentinel-2 image was calculated with the dimidiate pixel model and the fully constrained least squares (FCLS) method. Second, the mixed pixels were subdivided to form the cellular space at a sub-pixel level and the transition rules are constructed based on the water coverage information and spatial correlation. Lastly, the process was implemented using Python and IDL, with the ArcGIS and ENVI software being used for validation. The experiments show that the CA model can improve the sub-pixel positioning accuracy for lake bodies in mixed pixel image and improve classification accuracy. The FCLS-CA model has a higher accuracy and is able to identify most water bodies in the study area, and is therefore suitable for desert lake monitoring in mining areas.

TI  - Combining machine learning and environmental covariates for mapping of organic carbon in soils of Russia
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust and detailed quantitative prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC) is of great significance to studying the carbon budget, soil management and decision-making. Spatial variations of SOC content were modelled using 863 soil profiles and a set of 22 environmental covariates representing relief, bioclimate variables and remote sensing data. The article provided the results of 3D modeling of SOC content in several soil layers (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60 and 60-100 cm) for the territory of the Russian Federation with 500 m spatial resolution. Machine learning framework was used, with random forest and spatial cross-validation techniques (150 km blocks) to handle the spatial autocorrelation of the training points. Compared with randomized cross-validation (R-2 0.66, Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) 0.79, RMSE 0.99 g/kg), using spatial cross-validation to predict the SOC content yielded less accurate results - R-2 0.45, CCC 0.63, RMSE 1.41 g/kg. Regarding the importance of the variables, soil depth and temperature seasonality were major contributors to the SOC content prediction, followed by the EVI, 7 (MIR) MODIS band, and the topographic wetness index. The model was next evaluated with procedure so-called "area of applicability" (AOA) of prediction model - the areas for which we cannot estimate prediction quality. AOA spatial distribution showed that the feature space not represented by training data is located in the mountain provinces. The proposed framework can be used for SOC modeling with a limited soil profile number, and it is provides a reproducible approach for long-term SOC monitoring.

AB  - In this study, we examine how the effectiveness of satellite imagery affects stock price efficiency in the international capital market. With advancements in remote-sensing technology, sophisticated international investors have better access to detailed and real-time indicators of firm fundamentals through satellite imagery since the last decade. Our findings indicate that the availability of satellite imagery effectively mitigates the inefficient B-share discount in China by potentially addressing information asymmetry. Furthermore, we highlight the role of satellite data as a valuable complement to traditional information sources as well as its ability to monitor companies with unreliable disclosures. This study contributes to the literature on big data and capital market efficiency, while also offering policy implications for the technological advancement of the financial industry and the high-quality opening of the Chinese capital market.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As primary sites of tumor metastasis, sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) require a highly biocompatible theranostic platform for precise localization and treatment to inhibit tumor metastasis. Herein, indocyanine green-human serum albumin (ICG-HSA) nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated by ICG-induced self-assembly and radiolabeled with technetuim-99 m (99mTc). The fabricated NPs were composed of hospital-available drugs and isotopes, making them highly biocompatible for in vivo applications. In a mouse model of SLN metastasis, the prepared NPs exhibited excellent capacity for preoperative planning by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging-enabled SLN localization, near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging-enabled intraoperative real-time monitoring, and SLN photothermal treatment. Photothermal treatment with SLN enhanced the inhibition of lung metastasis and significantly increased the survival time of mice. The prepared NPs were highly biocompatible and exhibited efficient theranostic properties for inhibiting cancer metastasis, making them promising candidates for clinical translation.

TI  - An effective atmospheric correction method for the wide swath of Chinese GF-1 and GF-6 WFV images on lands
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate land surface reflectance plays an important role in the accurate inversion of surface parameters, and atmospheric correction plays a decisive role in obtaining accurate reflectance. For GF-1 WFV and GF-6 WFV images, there are two major issues to be addressed, including the spectral differences between nadir with far offnadir pixels and the spatial variability of atmospheric components for wide imaging. Therefore, this study focuses on these two issues using the Sensor Invariant Atmospheric Correction (SIAC) method. Our results reveal that the SIAC approach improves the correlation accuracy from 0.8868 to 0.9173 for GF-1 WFV image compared with Sentinel-2 reflectance, from 0.9530 to 0.9620 for GF-6 WFV image compared with the results using FLAASH model. For alleviating wide-swathed anisotropy, the directional imaging angle is calculated with the result ranging from 5.6450 degrees to 33.7497 degrees. Furthermore, the atmospheric components have been inversed pixel by pixel with obvious spatial variation. And the correlation of inversed aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and total column water vapor (TCWV) with a spatial resolution of 500 m TCWV with measured results of AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) observation stations are 0.9175 and 0.4442, respectively. These results reveal that the atmospheric correction method works well, which is effective for the wide swath of Chinese GF-1 WFV and GF-6 WFV images on land.

TI  - Satellite-based assessment of water use and leaf area efficiencies of dryland conifer forests along an aridity gradient
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dryland forests worldwide are increasingly threatened by drought stress due to climate change. Understanding the relationships between forest structure and function is essential for managing dryland forests to adapt to these changes. We investigated the structure-function relationships in four dryland conifer forests distributed along a semiarid to subhumid climatic aridity gradient. Forest structure was represented by leaf area index (LAI) and function by gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and the derived efficiencies of water use (WUE = GPP/ET) and leaf area (LAE = GPP/LAI). Estimates of GPP and ET were based on the observed relationships between high-resolution vegetation indices from VEN mu S and Sentinel-2A satellites and flux data from three eddy covariance towers in the study regions between November 2015 to October 2018. The red-edge-based MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) from VEN mu S and Sentinel-2A showed strong correlations to flux tower GPP and ET measurements for the three sites (R-cal (2)> 0.91, R-val(2) > 0.84). Using our approach, we showed that as LAI decreased with decreasing aridity index (AI) (i.e., dryer conditions), estimated GPP and ET decreased (R-2 > 0.8 to LAI), while WUE (R-2 = 0.68 to LAI) and LAE increased. The observed global-scale patterns are associated with a variety of forest vegetation characteristics, at the local scale, such as tree species composition and density. However, our results point towards a canopy-level mechanism, where the ecosystem-LAI and resultant proportion of sun-exposed vs. shaded leaves are primary determinants of WUE and LAE along the studied climatic aridity gradient. This work demonstrates the importance of high-resolution (spatially and spectrally) remote sensing data conjugated with flux tower data for monitoring dryland forests and understanding the intricate structure-function interactions in their response to drying conditions.

TI  - Environmental quality assessment of Assuit governorate using data observation and geospatial techniques
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper aims to assess the quality characteristics of the available water bodies, air, and agricultural lands of Assuit governorate using spatial and laboratory analyses integrated with remote sensing techniques. To fulfill this aim, a field survey was conducted for identifying the dominant anthropogenic activities, collecting water and soil for further lab analyses of physical and chemical characteristics. Contamination indices and ecological risk of heavy metals in soil were calculated and assessed. Further, calibrated space-borne multispectral Landsat images dated 1999, 2009, 2019 and 2023 were processed to retrieve the Particulate Matter (PM10) to assess air quality over the governorate. A similar spatial distribution of PM10 over Assuit governorate was recorded during the four investigated years; 1999, 2009, 2019 and 2023. PM10 exceeded the allowable Egyptian threshold limits over the desert lands (150 & mu;g/m3). Results reported the discharge of domestic wastewater into some irrigation canals as the main reason for elevating turbidity and Organic matter levels. Reasonable Electric Conductivity (EC) levels were recorded (277 to 1094.00 & mu;s/cm) which showed good to permissible levels for irrigation. The investigated water parameters of the River Nile are coinciding with the Egyptian threshold limits. Remarkable fluctuations were observed in the levels of most of the soil characteristics in Assuit and the spatial analyses showed that levels of soil pollution are increasing southward which is confirmed by the positive correlation between the indicators of pollution. However, soil contamination and ecological indices were low in the whole governorate.

TI  - A flash flood detected area using classification-based image processing for sentinel-2 satellites data: A case study of Zafaraana Road at Red Sea
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural crises manifested in floods and droughts are counted as the most severe impacts of climate change on the world. In this regard, flash floods are the most common cause of economic and human losses worldwide. However, the present study focuses on the flash flood-affected area between Zafaarana and Ras Ghareb coastal roads. Sentinel-2 satellite images of recent years before and after the flash flood have been utilized to detect flooded areas and investigate their environmental conditions.Initially, the captured images were pre-processed to compare the environmental conditions before and after flooding. Consequently, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was utilized to classify water bodies in different bands. Finally, an image difference feature (IDF) model with computation of per-pixel features, merging image disparities, and calculation of the characteristic value phases was constructed to extract various image differences after photo processing, that's to identify flooded pixels in the images and assess their performance in the proposed model. The proposed IDF model was compared by rating each model on the same test set, while changing the training set. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm shows an accuracy of 98.9%, which is a better flood image processing technique than other methods. The insights from this research will help decision makers in structuring their rescue strategies and evacuation maps during and before the environmental crisis.

TI  - Predicting land use/land cover changes in the Santchou Wildlife Reserve (Santchou, West-Cameroon) using a CA-Markov model
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last three decades, the Santchou Wildlife Reserve (SWR) located in the West region of Cameroon has experienced rapid degradation. Land reclamation and population growth have significantly contributed to meeting the increasing demands for foods and urban development. In this study, Landsat 4-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images of 1988 and 2005, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI-TIRS) image of 2022 are firstly used for calculating and analysing area changes and then spatial distribution of land use/land cover changes (LULCC) in the SWR for a time span 1988-2005-2022. Secondly, the spatial distribution of LULCC from 2022 to 2027 and from 2027 to 2032 was simulated using a Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov model that allows to predict future changes and identify the possible patterns of evolution. Results exhibit six major LULC classes including Mountain Forest, Degraded Lowland Forest, Lowland Forest, Degraded Mountain Forest, Built-up Area and Cultivated Land. The overall accuracies of LULC classification reached 89.71-92.24 %, with Kappa coefficients of 0.87-0.92. However, the prediction model was validated with an overall good agreement of 90.51 %. In general, two significant patterns of change were evidenced and characterized by the rapid expansion of Cultivated Land from 158.6 to 736.4 ha between 1988 and 2022, and could reach 809.0 ha in 2032, while Built-up Area displays a surface change from 12.4 to 29.3 ha, which is expected to attend 67.3 ha in 2032. Change patterns from the past to the future are also marked by a decline of Mountain Forest (2107.4 to 1594.4 ha), Degraded Lowland Forest (1450.1 to 1024.5 ha) and Degraded Mountain Forest (954.6 to 860.6 ha) at the expense of Lowland Forest (2332.5 to 2659.8 ha). Human activities influenced by socio-economic issues remain the main factor of changes in the SWR. Despite the limitations of the CA-Markov model due to the nonconsideration of socio-economic factors, this study appears as a new opportunity to develop effective strategies for managing LULCC and protecting ecological biodiversity in the SWR.

TI  - Estimation of water-infiltration rate in Mediterranean sandy soils using airborne hyperspectral sensors
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficiency of spectral-based assessments of soil attributes using soil spectral libraries (SSLs) covering the visible-near-infrared-shortwave-infrared (VNIR-SWIR: 400-2500 nm) region has been proven in many studies. Nevertheless, as traditional SSLs are commonly developed under laboratory conditions, their application is limited for the assessment of soil surface-dependent properties such as water-infiltration rate (WIR) into the soil profile due to the sampling procedure. Currently, few studies are based on field SSLs for the prediction of physical soil properties. This study used a field-based protocol to measure soil reflectance data and WIR simultaneously in the field, and generate spectral-based decision tree models to predict WIR solely from field spectral measurements using the SoilPRO & REG; assembly. The obtained models were applied to both airborne hyperspectral (HySpex) and satellite multispectral (Sentinel 2) data on a pixel-by-pixel basis to generate raster maps of WIR. The study areas were located in Macedonia (Greece), and were optimal for mapping WIR because the soil crust was well developed, and sites were characterized by bare soils (no vegetation coverage) with a sandy structure. Whereas the WIR map generated with the satellite data was poor due to the low spatial and spectral resolution of Sentinel 2 (20 m, 9 bands), the results obtained with the airborne hyperspectral HySpex sensor (5 m, 408 bands) were satisfactorily validated in the ground-truth stage with good prediction accuracy due to high spatial and spectral resolution. Validation accuracy of the HySpex observations using all field samples gave R2 = 0.68, whereas the predictions of the ground-truth samples that were not part of the calibration stage (field validation group) of the model gave R2 = 0.59. We concluded that these results are favourable for rapid estimation of soil surface conditions and pave the way for a wider spatial view from orbital hyperspectral remote-sensing sensors.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Crop phenology data offer crucial information for crop yield estimation, agricultural management, and assessment of agroecosystems. Such information becomes more important in the context of increasing year-to-year climatic variability. The dataset provides in-situ crop phenology data (first leaves emergence and harvest date) of major European crops (wheat, corn, sunflower, rapeseed) from seventeen field study sites in Bulgaria and two in France. Additional information such as the sowing date, area of each site, coordinates, method and equipment used for phenophase data estimation, and photos of the France sites are also provided. The georeferenced ground-truth dataset provides a solid base for a better understanding of crop growth and can be used to validate the retrieval of phenological stages from remote sensing data.

TI  - A national-scale assessment of land use change in peatlands between 1989 and 2020 using Landsat data and Google Earth Engine-a case study of Ireland
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the centuries, anthropogenic pressure has severely impacted peatlands on the European continent. Peatlands cover similar to 21% (1.46 Mha) of Ireland's land surface, but 85% have been degraded due to management activities (land use). Ireland needs to meet its 2030 climate energy framework targets related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, including wetlands. Despite Ireland's voluntary decision to include peatlands in this system in 2020, information on land use activities and associated GHG emissions from peatlands is lacking. This study strives to fill this information gap by using Landsat (5, 8) data with Google Earth Engine and machine learning to examine and quantify land use on Irish peatlands across three time periods: 1990, 2005 and 2019. Four peatland land use classes were mapped and assessed: industrial peat extraction, forestry, grassland and residual peatland. The overall accuracy of the classification was 86% and 85% for the 2005 and 2019 maps, respectively. The accuracy of the 1990 dataset could not be assessed due to the unavailability of high-resolution reference data. The results indicate that extensive management activities have taken place in peatlands over the past three decades, which may have negative impacts on its ecological integrity and the many ecosystem services provided. By utilising cloud computing, temporal mosaicking and Landsat data, this study developed a robust methodology that overcomes cloud contamination and produces the first peatland land use maps of Ireland with wall-to-wall coverage. This has the potential for regional and global applications, providing maps that could help understand unsustainable management practices on peatlands and the impact on GHG emissions.

TI  - Mapping gully affected areas by using Sentinel 2 imagery and digital elevation model based on the Google Earth Engine
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Gullies pose a great threat to the sustainable development of agricultural production and the ecological environment. Accurate mapping of gully affected areas plays an important role in regional environmental monitoring and management. In this paper, an object-based image analysis method based on the Google Earth Engine (OBIAGEE) is proposed for mapping gully affected areas by using Sentinel 2 imagery and AW3D30 DEM data. The method utilizes the simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC) algorithm to segment the top-five principal component images derived from Sentinel-2 surface reflectance images. Then, the random forest (RF) algorithm is used for feature importance analysis and gully affected area mapping. Finally, the gully affected area mapping results are further optimized by establishing terrain skeleton lines. The proposed method is applied to five study areas with different landform types on the Chinese Loess Plateau, and the results show that the method achieves good performance in mapping gully affected areas, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 86.44%, an F score (F1) of 0.84, a user's accuracy (UA) of 84.97%, and a producer's accuracy (PA) of 83.90%. Compared with the OA of the results of a previous study (OA was 78.8%), the accuracy of the gully affected area mapping results herein improved by 7.64%. The RF feature importance results and findings of different feature combination cases demonstrate that textural information, time series spectral information, and topographic factors are important for mapping gully affected areas. Object-based and pixel-based classification results are compared, and the performance of the OBIA-GEE method is better than that of the pixel-based RF method. In addition, the OBIA-GEE method is highly efficient, which provides the possibility of applying the proposed method in large-scale studies. This research is beneficial to studies related to monitoring gullies and managing soil erosion.

TI  - Improving Crop Classification Accuracy with Integrated Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data: a Case Study of Barley and Wheat
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop classification plays a crucial role in ensuring food security, agricultural policy development, and effective land management. Remote sensing data, particularly Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, has been widely used for crop mapping and classification in cloudy regions due to their high temporal and spatial resolution. This study aimed to enhance the classification accuracy of grain crops, specifically barley and wheat, by integrating Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) data. The study utilized two classification models, random forest (RF) and classification and regression trees (CART), to classify the grain crops based on the integrated data. The results showed an overall accuracy (OA) of 93%, and a Kappa coefficient (K) of 0.896 for RF, and an OA of 89.15% and K of 0.84 for the CART classifier. The integration of both radar and optical data has the potential to improve the accuracy of crop classification compared to using a single-sensor classification technique. The significance of this study is that it demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating radar and optical data to improve crop classification accuracy. These findings can be used to support crop management, environmental monitoring, and policy development, particularly in areas with cloud cover or limited optical data. The study's implications are particularly relevant in the context of global food security, where accurate crop classification is essential for monitoring crop health and yield estimation. Concisely, this study provides a useful approach for crop classification using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data integration, which can be employed to support sustainable agriculture and food security initiatives.

TI  - Causes of tea land dynamics in Sri Lanka between 1995 and 2030
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is vital to investigate changes in tea land use patterns in key tea-growing regions, which are among the most vulnerable to climate change. The objective of this research was to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of tea land in the main tea-growing areas in Sri Lanka such as Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, and Ratnapura over a 25-year period from 1995 to 2020 using Landsat satellite images. We estimated tea land changes in five time windows using change detection maps, assessed major driving forces' impact (temperature, rainfall, elevation, slope, population) on tea occurrences using a random forest (RF) algorithm coupled with a model-agnostic approach, and predicted tea land cover for 2030 using cellular automata and artificial neural networks (CA-ANNs) algorithms and independent variables. The results revealed an overall accuracy of over 83% from 1995 to 2020. Tea-growing areas increased by 13.1% in Nuwara Eliya and 19.3% in Ratnapura, while decreasing by 16.6% in Badulla between 1995 and 2020. The Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, and Ratnapura districts exhibited the greatest gains between 2010 and 2015, with gains of 36.7%, 36%, and 19.4%, respectively. As per the RF analyses, elevation (0.4) was the most important variable, followed by rainfall (0.32), and population (0.24). The model suggests that the selected variables impact tea land use and land cover differently. Tea lands are projected to shrink further by 2030, covering approximately 105 km2 in the study area. The findings provide valuable insights to stakeholders and policymakers, ensuring a sustainable tea sector in Sri Lanka in the future.

TI  - Fluorescein mapping for identification of residual satellite vulvar Paget's lesion.
T2  - Gynecologic oncology reports
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Background: Vulvar Paget disease (VPD) is a rare neoplastic condition exhibiting extensive multifocal involvement. It is clinically difficult to distinguish the margins of VPD from normal skin resulting in involved surgical margins leading to frequent lesion persistence and repeated excisions. Recently, fluorescein mapping has shown promise in providing accurate surgical margins in VPD. However, utilization of this technique after previous resection has not been explored.Case: A 63-year-old female underwent wide local excision of a large microinvasive VPD with involved resection margins. Two months later, the patient underwent additional surgery to excise the involved margins and for sentinel inguinal lymph nodes evaluation. With gross visualization, the vulvar skin appeared normal. However, after intravenous fluorescein sodium injection and Wood's lamp illumination, residual satellite pathological area was observed and resected, revealing more microinvasive tumor.Conclusion: Fluorescein mapping directly highlights sites of involvement in VPD and provides an improved estimation of disease extent which is otherwise not clinically visible.

TI  - Toward an adaptable deep-learning model for satellite-based wildfire monitoring with consideration of environmental conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the majority of active fire detection algorithms have been developed for worldwide applications using only satellite data without considering observing conditions and environmental factors, their performance varies regionally. This study investigates the viability of an adaptable active fire detection model that is applicable to diverse environmental and observing conditions by fusing numerical model data and satellite images. The model was developed for various land cover and climate types using commonly utilized brightness temperature-related variables (key variables) and supporting variables (sub-variables), including solar zenith angle, satellite zenith angle (SAZ), relative humidity (RH), and skin temperature. A dual-module (DM) convolutional neural network (CNN) structure was adopted to consider the different properties of key variables and sub-variables, and a control without sub-variables was used to assess the impact of observing and environmental variables. The proposed model was further evaluated using existing polar-orbiting and geostationary satellite-based active fire products. The recall and precision of the control model were 0.80 and 0.98, respectively, and the standard deviation of recall for the five focus sites was 0.140. However, the DM CNN model was notable for its higher recall and robustness compared to the control model (recall of 0.84, precision of 0.97, and standard deviation of recall of 0.126). High RH and SAZ, and the day-night transition period contributed to the poor performance of the control model which was mitigated by the DM CNN model. In particular, the use of RH improved the recall of the model, and SAZ contributed to the reduction of performance variation. Our model also outperformed the two geostationary satellite-based active fire products in terms of detection capacity, resulting in a spatial distribution of active fires similar to that of polar-orbiting satellite-based active fire products.

TI  - Using Landsat and Sentinel-2 spectral time series to detect East African small woodlots
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate maps of gains in tree cover are necessary to quantify carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and land use changes. Satellite-based mapping of emerging smallholder woodlots in heterogeneous landscapes of sub-Saharan Africa is challenging. Our goal was to evaluate the use of time series to detect and map small woodlots (<1 ha) in Tanzania. We distinguished woodlots from other land cover types by woodlots' distinct multi-year spectral time series. Woodlots exhibit greening from planting to maturity followed by browning at harvest. We compared two time series approaches: 1) a linear model of Tasseled Cap Wetness (TCW) and other indices, and 2) LandTrendr temporal segmentation metrics. The approaches had equivalent woodlot detection accuracy, but LandTrendr segments had lower accuracy for characterizing woodlot age. We tested the effect of the following factors on woodlot detection and mapping accuracy: the length of the time series (2009-2019), frequency of observations (all Landsat vs. only Landsat-8), spatial resolution (30-m Landsat vs. 10-m Sentinel-2), and woodlot age and size. Woodlot mapping accuracies were higher with longer time series (54% at 3-yrs vs 77% at 7-yrs). The accuracies also improved with more observations, especially when the time series was short (3-yrs Landsat-8 only: 54% vs. all-Landsat: 64%, p-value <0.001). Sentinel-2's higher spatial resolution minimized commission errors even for short time series. Finally, less than half of young and small (<0.4 ha) woodlots were detected, suggesting considerable omission errors in our and other woodlot maps. Our results suggest that the accurate detection of woodlots is possible by analyzing multi-year time series of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data. Given the region's woodlot boom, accurate maps are needed to better quantify woodlots' contribution to carbon sequestration, livelihoods enhancement, and landscape management.

TI  - Investigating the applicability of a simple iterative approach for aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval over diverse land surface types from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 using visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral bands
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous attempts at aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval from top-of-atmosphere satellite signals using a simplified approach have been limited in their assessment over selective surface types, calibration sites and given the low surface reflectance components at lower wavelengths, have mostly relied, fully or partially, on near-UV or blue spectral bands for AOD retrieval. The present study attempts to investigate the applicability of a simple iterative approach for retrieval of AOD over diverse land surface types using any of the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral bands. The results have been validated for 18 AERONET sites from 7 countries in South Asia and we found a strong correspondence between retrieved AOD and the AERONET AOD with good correlation (r > 0.80), both at 550 nm as well as at individual spectral bands. For image-based comparison, the results have been compared with those from MODIS products. While the retrievals show strong spatial similarity with MODIS, in absolute terms, they are mostly underestimated. Nevertheless, the coincident retrievals from both sensors do appear to be very similar, with intercomparison also showing good correlation. Overall, the iterative approach for AOD retrieval performs reasonably well for different surface types and can be easily adopted for most sensors, especially those which do not have deep blue or blue spectral bands.

TI  - Drivers and implications of land use/cover dynamics in land leased areas, western Ethiopia
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysing the drivers and implications of land use and cover (LULC) dynamics in land leased areas is essential for sustainable land use planning and environmental management interventions. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between large-scale agricultural investment and the socioecological implications of land use change in western Ethiopia. We used black and white aerial photographs of 1967 and Landsat satellite images from 1977 to 2019, taken at 10-year study intervals, SPOT-6 imagery and qualitative data to understand better the complex interactions between large-scale agricultural investments and the socioecological effects of land use change. The dynamics of LULC changes for each period were classified using a hybrid approach combining the outputs of supervised classification, intensive on-screen digitising techniques and qualitative data from interviews and focus group discussions. The results indicated that small-scale cultivated and settlement land, commercial farmland, grassland and shrubland increased by 120%, 137%, 89% and 65%, respectively, between 1967 and 2019. In contrast, over those six decades, forest, woodland, wetland and water bodies declined by 49%, 76%, 10% and 16%, respectively. The results of the qualitative data also showed that land leasing for agricultural investments and subsistence agriculture leads to socio-environmental changes such as reduced forest cover, biodiversity loss and wetland degradation, which lead to loss of livelihood and marginalisation of local communities. As a result, a wide range of policy packages for socio-environmental issues are required to avoid the adverse effects of land leasing in the study area and other parts of Ethiopia.

TI  - A joint InSAR-GNSS workflow for correction and selection of interferograms to estimate high-resolution interseismic deformations
T2  - SATELLITE NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the spatial distribution of interseismic deformations is essential to better understand earthquake cycles. The existing methods for improving the reliability of the obtained deformations often rely on visual inspection and prior model corrections that are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and do not consider the spatial distribution of interseismic deformations. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data provides wide-scale coverage for interseismic deformation monitoring over a wide area. However, the interseismic signal featured as millimeter-scale and long-wave deformations is often contaminated with noise. In the present study, a new workflow to correct the interferometric phase and quantitatively select interferograms is proposed to improve the accuracy of interseismic deformation measurements. Initially, the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service (GACOS), Intermittent Code for Atmospheric Noise Depression through Iterative Stacking (I-CANDIS), and plate model are combined to correct the atmospheric screen and long-wave ramp phase. Subsequently, the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC) between the interferometric phase and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) constrained interseismic model as well as the STandard Deviation (STD) of the interferometric phase are introduced as criteria to optimize the selection of interferograms. Finally, the intermittent stacking method is used to generate an average velocity map. A comprehensive test using Sentinel-1 images covering the Haiyuan Fault Zone validate the effectiveness of our workflow in measuring interseismic deformations. This demonstrates that the proposed joint InSAR-GNSS workflow can be extended to study the subtle interseismic deformations of major fault systems in Tibet and worldwide.

TI  - Automatic segment-wise restoration for wide irregular stripe noise in SDGSAT-1 multispectral data using side-slither data
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The raw orbital images captured by the new launched SDGSAT-1 Multispectral Image for Inshore (MII) are plagued by wide-irregular stripe noise, due to inconsistent unit response. This paper proposed a new method for destriping wide-irregular stripe noise in MII using the characteristics of side-slither data. Firstly, the raw sideslither data was standardized using line detection to guarantee that each row observed the same ground object. Then, the whole orbital side-slither image was segmented into blocks of equal length, and it was found that the response of wide-irregular stripe noise is consistent within a certain length. The Inverse Distance Weight was used to interpolate the DN values of striped pixels as referenced values, and the segmented length was determined by calculating Pearson correlation coefficient between the original and referenced DN values. Thirdly, the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm was used to find the inliers and calculate the correction parameters, after it was discovered that the original and referenced DN values had a linear correlation. The proposed method, SIR (consists of image segmentation, pixel interpolation and RANSAC fitting), can directly destripe the raw orbital image. One orbital side-slither data and six ordinary orbital data were selected for verification. Twelve state-of-the-art methods were chosen for comparison with SIR. The accuracy scores of SIR on three assessment indexes were higher than those of twelve other methods. The destriping outcomes for the images of city, cloud, forest, and river demonstrated the effectiveness of SIR in correcting wide-irregular stripe noise in MII images.

TI  - A delay-tolerant network approach to satellite pickup and delivery scheduling
T2  - AD HOC NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - An approach to job scheduling and task allocation in delay-and disruption-tolerant satellite networks, called Contact Graph Scheduling (CGS) is introduced. This method aims to minimize latency between the arrival of requests for satellite data products, and the delivery of those products, identifying efficient pickup and delivery paths through a resource-constrained time-varying network. Requests for goods are processed as soon as they arrive, resulting in the discovery of task distribution and product delivery routes, while being aware of both resource and operational constraints. CGS sits at the interface between Contact Graph Routing (CGR), the dynamic pickup and delivery problem (dPDP) and satellite scheduling. CGS provides a combined scheduling-routing solution, such that the route to be taken by data toward their destination informs the allocation of pickup tasks to network nodes. Results show that CGS can increase the number of fulfilled customer requests, while maintaining acceptable levels of delivery latency, compared to other, less burdensome methods. This study highlights the impact of contact reliability on CGS performance, suggesting that as uncertainty increases, so does the benefit of employing locally, rather than centrally, defined data routing strategies.

TI  - High spatiotemporal resolution analysis on suspended sediment and microplastic transport of a lowland river.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The suspended sediment (SS) and microplastic (MP) transport in rivers is quite a complex process, influenced by several spatially and temporally changing factors (e.g., hydrology, sediment availability, human impact). Researchers usually investigate these factors individually and based on limited repetition in space and time. Therefore, this study aims to compare the driving factors of SS and MP transport by applying dense temporal (72 measurements) and spatial monitoring (at 26 sites). This study was performed on the medium-sized Tisza River, Central Europe. The suspended sediment concentration (SSC) was measured by water sampling and estimated based on Sentinel-2 images, while MP concentration was measured by pumping of water (1m3). The SSC of the Tisza varied between 12.6 and 322.5g/m3, whereas the MP concentration ranged 0-129 item/m3. Most of the transported particles were fibers (81-98%), thus, it was assumed that MPs originated from wastewater. The results reflect that the hydrological conditions basically influence the SS and MP concentrations, as a strong positive correlation was found (rhoSSC-MP=0.6) between them during a year; however, the correlation during floods (minor floods: rho=0.63; medium floods: rho=0.41) was higher than at low stages (rho=0.1). It was assumed that run-off and mobilization of channel materials both contribute to increased SS and MP transport during floods. In contrary, the importance of mobilization of channel materials and wastewater input increase during low stages. The repeated measurements revealed that slope and velocity conditions, proximity of sources, tributaries, and dams influence the longitudinal changes in SS and MP concentrations. However, the effects of tributaries and dams are ambiguous (especially for MP) and require further research. The longitudinal measurements were conducted at low stages; hence, moderate negative correlations (rho2021=-0.35; rho2022=-0.41) were found between the SS and MP concentrations. Therefore, additional monitoring during (overbank) floods and denser spatial sampling are required to precisely reveal the spatiotemporal changes of SS and MP concentrations in rivers.

TI  - Assessing<i> Lantana</i><i> camara</i> spatial distribution in response to rainfall and temperature variations in Inkomati catchment in Mpumalanga
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lantana camara is an invasive plant affecting global natural ecosystems, including South African ecosystems. Preceding studies have focused on accurately identifying and mapping its spread, without understanding its adaptability to different environments. The aim of this study was to map and distinguish L. camara from different Land Use Land Cover (LULC) types, using Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, Sentinel 2 satellite data and Random Forest algorithm in Inkomati Catchment, Mpumalanga. The study also modelled the influence of rainfall and temperature on the L. camara, and predicted its future distribution, using the Maximum Entropy (Maxent) Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) approach. Overall, the accuracy of the identification of L. camara was 90.27%, with a user's and producer's accuracy of 80% and 89%, respectively. L. camara was detected mostly within the eastern, south-eastern and south-western areas of the Komati sub-catchment and in the north-eastern parts, of the Nwanedzi River sub-catchment in the Kruger National Park. In comparison to other LULC classes, the prevalence of L. camara was found to be sparse and heterogeneous across the catchment. L. camara spatial distribution was significantly influenced by the mean temperature of the coldest and driest quarters and the rainfall of the wettest quarter. The current and future climatic scenario models built using the selected bioclimatic variables, yielded high species predictive accuracies of 0.937 and 0.932, respectively. These findings are useful in assessing landscapes vulnerable to L. camara invasions, the potential of remote sensing, and species distribution modelling towards the management of species invasion.

TI  - Assessment of the desertification sensitivity of Northwestern El Minya Governorate, Egypt using MEDALUS model
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification leads to a decline in land production, resulting from biophysical interaction and human factors with temporal and spatial changes. This paper aims to evaluate the desertification sensitivity using Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use (MEDALUS) approach in the Northwestern El Minya Governorate in Egypt. The study area is one of the promising and important areas for land reclamation and developmental projects. Four indicators; climate, vegetation, management, and soil, were used in this study. Landsat 8 (OLI) satellite image 2021 was processed to calculate NDVI index to assess vegetation quality index. Then, it was classified into land cover classes to calculate the management quality index. ASTERDEM satellite data and the climate data were used in the climate quality index. Seventy soil samples were collected and analyzed for chemical and physical properties to be used for the retrieval of soil quality index. These indicators were integrated and used as input criteria in the model of desertification sensitivity. The physiographic unit extraction indicated that significant landforms were included in the study area namely; Old wadi Sediments, Peniplain, old river terraces, Shoulders, Sand sheets, Rock outcrops, and Sand dunes, Erosional Plains, Hill and Plain out wash. The obtained results showed that the severely sensitive area to desertification was represented by 86.7 % of the study area. The main factors affecting the sensitivity were climate conditions (arid, semi-arid), low soil quality and management in addition to the low vegetation cover. Furthermore, about 3% of the study area was located in the moderate sensitive class while the low sensitive area exhibits 1.06 %. Present study supports decision makers to reduce the constraining environmental conditions.

TI  - Omission of Axillary Dissection in Node Positive Breast Cancer After Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Guidelines recommend axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for ypN + positive patients as patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) were excluded from trials omitting ALND in pN + patients. We sought to characterize trends in omission of ALND in patients with ypN + disease.Methods: Adult women with invasive breast carcinoma in the National Cancer Database between 2012 and 2019 who received NST (chemotherapy or endocrine) and had ypN + disease were included. Patients were excluded if they did not have definitive surgery within eight months of diagnosis. The primary study outcome was completion of ALND versus omission. Differences in demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment were identified using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models.Results: In total, 103,121 women were included. Most had cT1 (26%) or cT2 (45%) tumors, cN + disease (71%), and ductal histology (83%). 69% of patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 31% neoadjuvant endocrine without chemotherapy (30% both). ALND was performed in 77% of patients. Omission of ALND became more prevalent each year from 2012 (14%) to 2019 (34%). On multivariate modeling, year of diagnosis, black race, cN status, higher grade, estrogen receptor+/HER2-receptor subtype, and mastectomy were associated with increased prevalence of ALND. Age, Charlson/Deyo comorbidity index score, endocrine versus chemotherapy, and adjuvant radiation were not associated with receipt of ALND.Conclusions: Despite guidelines recommending ALND, omission is common in patients with ypN + breast cancer after NST. Omission of ALND increased significantly over time and is associated with clinical and demographic factors. Future study is needed to determine the oncologic safety of this approach.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping forest fire severity using bi-temporal unmixing of Sentinel-2 data - Towards a quantitative understanding of fire impacts
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise quantification of forest fire impacts is critical for management strategies in support of post-fire mitigation. In this regard, optical remote sensing imagery in combination with spectral unmixing has been widely used to measure fire severity by means of fractional cover of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), charcoal (CH) and further ground components such as ash, bare soil and rocks. However, most unmixing analyses have made use of a single post-fire image without accounting for the pre-fire state. We aim to assess fire severity from Sentinel-2 data using a bi-temporal spectral unmixing analysis that provides a quantitative fire impact description and is oriented towards the process of change by including pre-fire and postfire information. Unmixing was based on Random Forest Regression (RFR) modeling using synthetic training data from a bi-temporal spectral library. We describe fire severity as changes associated with the combustion of photosynthetic vegetation (PV-CH fraction) and dieback of photosynthetic vegetation (PV-NPV fraction). Unburned forest was mapped as stable photosynthetic vegetation (PV-PV fraction). We evaluated our approach on a forest fire that burned in a temperate forest region in eastern Germany in 2018. Independent validation was carried out based on reference fractions obtained from very high-resolution (VHR) imagery such as Plante Scope, SPOT6, orthophotos, aerial photos, and Google Earth. The results underline the effectiveness of our unmixing approach, with Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE) of 0.072 for PV-CH, 0.09 for PV-NPV, and 0.08 for PV-PV fractions. Most of the errors were caused by spectral similarity between charcoal and shadow effects caused by trees, and the coloring of foliage and NPV in the late phenological season of the post-fire Sentinel-2 image. Based on the two-dimensional feature space of PV-CH and PV-NPV fractions, we calculated two metrics to characterize fire impacts: distance, an indicator of disturbance severity (sum of combustion and dieback), and angle, a measure of disturbance composition (gradient between combustion and dieback). Furthermore, we compared the fraction-based metrics with the difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). Since the dNBR is most sensitive to combustion and presence of charcoal, it does not fully characterize fire-related vegetation loss associated with dieback. The bi-temporal fraction-based indices provide more ecologically meaningful information on fire severity, particularly for regions that are less prone to severe wildfires such as Central Europe.

TI  - Absence of post-treatment changes in sentinel lymph nodes does not translate into increased regional recurrence rate in initially node-positive breast cancer patients.
T2  - Breast cancer research and treatment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the absence of post-treatment changes in the negative sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in the neoadjuvant setting for biopsy-proven cN+disease results in an increased regional recurrence (RR) rate in patients after SLN biopsy (SLNB) only.METHODS: Breast cancer patients with biopsy-proven cN+disease who converted to node-negative disease after neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NAST) and underwent SLNB only were included. Retrospective analysis was performed for patients diagnosed between 2008 and 2021. Pathohistological specimens were reviewed for the presence of post-treatment changes in the SLNs. Patients with negative SLNs (ypN0) were divided into two groups: (i) with post-treatment changes, (ii) without post-treatment changes. Patients' characteristics were compared between groups. Crude RR rates were compared using the log-rank test. Recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort were calculated using Kaplan-Meier.RESULTS: Of 437 patients with cN+disease, 95 underwent SLNB only. 82 were ypN0, 57 with post-treatment changes (group 1), 25 without post-treatment changes (group 2). During the median follow-up of 37months (range 6-148), 1 isolated regional recurrence occurred in group 2 (RR rate 0% for group 1 vs. 4% for group 2, p=0.149). There were no differences in 3-year RFS and OS between groups.CONCLUSION: Absent post-treatment changes in negative SLNs for biopsy-proven cN+disease that covert to node-negative after NAST did not result in increased regional recurrence rates in our cohort. Multidisciplinary input is essential to determine whether additional treatment is needed in these patients.

T2  - LETTERS IN SPATIAL AND RESOURCE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl is associated with many urban centres across the world; many times, the impacts are found to be negative on living organisms and the natural environment. Quantification of urban has been a valuable field of study to understand its various factors like dispersion, density, diversity, dimension, and many others. To be resilient and sustainable, many of these cities need to be physically restructured, which is quite an impossible task, especially in developing countries like India; Although, instead of restructuring established urban centres, plans can be developed to focus on the growth of the surrounding tier urban centres. The objectives of the present study are to, (1) assess the changes in the urban growth and built-up density; (2) assess the urban diversity of the Tiruchirappalli Municipal Corporation and the tier urban centres on a temporal scale for the years 1996, 2008 and 2020. The study has been carried out with the use of Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images. The hierarchical unsupervised image classifier technique is used to classify the image and the study area has been split into eight zones in which, Batty's spatial entropy method was used to assess the diversity index. The study results are comparable to understanding the relative spatial growth and patterns among the select urban centres across the zones. Like many Class-II cities, Tiruchirappalli Municipality Corporation has mostly recorded inward developments during the periods from 1996 to 2008; while from 2008 to 2020 they have recorded outward fringe developments leading to expansion of the city.

TI  - Healthcare delivery to elderly and unfit patients with breast disease and comorbidities under an outpatient regime: A report of a personal surgical technique named "Cut&Sew".
T2  - Surgery open science
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction: A growing need for proper geriatric assessment and short-stay surgical programs supported by the availability of less invasive approaches, even in ambulatory settings, is being recognized as a feasible option for breast cancer patients with comorbidities who are usually distressed after standard surgery with ordinary hospitalization. Few studies have been conducted in Italian breast centers with dedicated techniques and approach for frail patients with breast diseases due to a jeopardized approach to ambulatory surgery among institutions.Methods: This study included 58 women diagnosed with breast disease and comorbidities between March 2019 and December 2022 at the Ambulatory of Senology of San Giacomo Hospital in Novi Ligure (AL, Italy) and Civil Hospital in Ovada (AL, Italy). The patients were evaluated by a multidisciplinary consensus according to the guidelines provided to limit sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in older women. This kind of ambulatory surgery technique has been designed for i) patients with advanced age and/or comorbidities, ii) frail patients who psychologically do not accept other kinds of surgery, iii) patients who do not require SLNB, and iv) patients who need a surgical biopsy for lesions classified as B3 or small lesions with dubious radiological imaging. With this technique, the quadrant and whole breast may be removed in an outpatient setting with local anesthesia to limit blood loss by immediately cutting and suturing small portions of the gland. Local anesthetic infiltration is sequential and occurs stepwise before providing short passages of approximately 2cm during resection and immediately suturing the surgical wound. This overclock technique, named "Cut&Sew," requires no more than 20-25min and allows for a 1-2h patient discharge with no drainage. The follow-up period was set at 60months during routine yearly visits.Results: The patients were older or super-older with most primary pT1/pT2 tumors and ductal type cancers, which were distributed in molecular subtypes Luminal A (37.1%) and Luminal B (41.5% Luminal B, with 11.2% being HER2 positive). The tumour grade was mostly G2-G3. Mastectomy was performed in 10 patients, whereas quadrantectomy was performed in 48 patients, with the majority of tumors localized in Q1.While accompanied by a relative or a caregiver, all 58 patients acceded the "Cut&Sew" surgical technique in an ambulatory setting reporting negligible pain during the surgery and no pain within 10days post-surgery. No post-operative complications or readmissions were recorded, and no discomfort or recurrence was detected during scheduled visits. Finally, the extent of satisfaction with the overall surgery was recorded immediately and corroborated by most patients during the follow-up period.Conclusions: Although the small volume of cases collected does not allow for a controlled study necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this technique for approaching frail and older women with comorbidities, through the "Cut&Sew" surgical technique, frail, older, and super older patients may benefit from a minimal psychological impact of surgery, while improving the patients' disease-free life so to corroborate the advised surgical de-escalation but avoiding undertreatment for this kind of patient category. Moreover, a stricter assessment of patient pain and overall satisfaction with the collection of a larger amount of reliable data could allow this technique to be extended to frail and/or older patients as a valuable and safe alternative to the more common hospitalization with general anesthesia. Other advantages include reduced hospitalization costs for sanitary structures.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Global commitments to mitigating climate change and halting biodiversity loss require reliable information about Earth's ecosystems. Increasingly, such information is obtained from multiple sources of remotely sensed data combined with data acquired in the field. This new wealth of data poses challenges regarding the combination of different data sources to derive the required information and assess uncertainties. In this article, we show how predictors and their variances can be derived when hierarchically nested models are applied. Previous studies have developed methods for cases involving two modeling steps, such as biomass prediction relying on tree-level allometric models and models linking plot-level field data with remotely sensed data. This study extends the analysis to cases involving three modeling steps to cover new important applications. The additional step might involve an intermediate model, linking field and remotely sensed data available from a small sample, for making predictions that are subsequently used for training a final prediction model based on remotely sensed data:In cases where the data in the final step are available wall-to-wall, we denote the approach three-phase hierarchical model-based inference (3pHMB),In cases where the data in the final step are available as a probability sample, we denote the approach three-phase hierarchical hybrid inference (3pHHY).

TI  - Managing abandoned Mediterranean mountain landscapes: The effects of donkey grazing on biomass control and floral diversity in pastures
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional Mediterranean Mountain landscapes in Spain have suffered dramatic environmental and social changes over the last seven decades. The loss of these landscapes has had consequences for biodiversity, soil erosion, landscape quality and ecosystem services as croplands and pastures were mainly converted into forests and scrublands. Many animal breeds present in traditional land uses such as the Catalan donkey (Equus asinus var. catalana), are also at risk of extinction, but can provide environmental services while recovering traditional landscapes. In Puy de Cinca, a village in mountainous northeast Spain, we studied how grazing by Catalan donkeys reduces pasture biomass and the effects on plant diversity in pastures. We used Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a biomass sensitive spectral index, throughout the grazing period to monitor pasture biomass and compared it to pastures without grazing. We also calculated several plant diversity indicators in pastures with and without grazing donkeys. Furthermore, we studied land use changes over the last seven decades using old (1956) and current (2018) aerial images, with forest, agricultural lands, and trails interconnecting the village being mapped to understand landscape changes. The results indicated a great increase in the forested area (348.3 +/- 17.0 ha). Meanwhile, a severe decrease in cropland area (73 %) and trail length (62.5 %) was also observed. Concerning the effect of donkey grazing, biomass was lower in pastures with grazing donkeys, with NDVI values decreasing once donkeys started grazing. Nevertheless, plant diversity was higher in pastures with grazing donkeys than in abandoned pastures. This study demonstrated the capacity of lowtomoderate-intensity donkey grazing to improve plant diversity and reduce biomass in pastures. Furthermore, the study of land use changes allowed an understanding of landscape dynamics, which can help address the social and environmental recovery of the village.

TI  - Hyperspectral fruit image restoration using non-convex optimization
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral (HS) imaging captured at low proximity ranges has become an effective method for assessing the quality and safety of food products in recent years. The majority of Hyperspectral cameras are push-broom type, which often contributes random noise and stripes to the spectral images. As a result, the quality of the collected HS images and the precision of the subsequent processing will both suffer. Despite the fact that there are several denoising techniques that have been studied and recorded in the literature, they frequently fail to fully restore the original HS images when there are strong stripe noises and other intricate mixed noises. In this study, we introduce a new method based on tensor logarithmic Schatten-p norm minimization with anisotropic spatial spectral total variation (ASSTV) regularization for simultaneous denoising and destriping of line scan-based hyperspectral images. Tensor logarithmic Schatten-p norm improves denoising performance by deleting the smaller singular values while protecting the larger singular values. Through the application of ASSTV, stripes and Gaussian noise are eliminated while maintaining the spatial-spectral smoothness of HS images and the directional characteristics of the stripes. The augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) approach is used to address the ensuing optimization problem. The quantitative and visual assessments reveal that the suggested technique has improved performance than its counterparts.

TI  - Impacts of urban forests and landscape characteristics on land surface temperature in two urban agglomeration areas of China
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate characterization of urban forest change can help quantify its impact on the urban thermal environment. Taking Hangzhou City and Zhaoqing City, China as two cases, we proposed a deep learning-based approach to extract forest/non-forest types using China's Gaofen data and the labels it generates. We then explored the impacts of urban forest patterns on land surface temperature (LST). Our results indicate that Gaofen-1/6 images performed well for urban forest/non-forest mapping with an accuracy of over 90%. We found that afforestation and deforestation exerted a net cooling of -0.62 & PLUSMN;0.30 degrees C and -1.23 & PLUSMN;0.26 degrees C and warming of 1.71 & PLUSMN;0.16 degrees C and 1.29 & PLUSMN;0.14 degrees C in Hangzhou and Zhaoqing, respectively. Balancing the LST changes of both afforestation and deforestation found total warming due to deforestation, especially in Hangzhou. Latitudinal reduced cooling and enhanced warming were found from Zhaoqing to Hangzhou, which can be explained by strong evaporative effects and inconsistent albedo effects. Moreover, a more pronounced cooling when other types converted to landscape core type and a weaker warming when landscape core type converted to other types were detected, especially in Zhaoqing. This study highlights the importance of designing rational afforestation plans, avoiding deforestation activities, and reducing forest fragmentation in delineating effective climate mitigation strategies.

TI  - The association of asthma and air pollution: Evidence from India
T2  - ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last two decades, air pollution has increased throughout India resulting in the deterioration of air quality. This paper estimates the prevalence of self-reported asthma in women aged 15-49 years and examines the link between outdoor air pollution and disease prevalence in India by combining satellite data on particulate matter (PM2.5) and the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), 2015-16. The results indicate that both indoor pollution as well as outdoor air pollution are important risk factors for asthma in women as both independently increase the probability of asthma among this group. Strategies around the prevention of asthma need to recognize the role of both indoor as well as outdoor air pollution. The other significant risk factors for asthma are smoking, second-hand smoking, type of diet and obesity.

TI  - Exploring the Relationship Between Land Use Land Cover and Land Surface Temperature: a Case Study in Bangladesh and the Policy Implications for the Global South
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) have a considerable impact on land surface temperature (LST) and they are a major driver of climate change. Comprehending the relationship between LULC and LST is crucial when developing effective measures to mitigate the effects of climate change, especially since people in the global south are particularly vulnerable. This study aimed to assess the relationship between LULC and LST in the Barapukuria coal mining region of Bangladesh using Landsat satellite images from 1990 to 2020. Specifically, the study evaluated the distribution of LST in various landforms, developed a cross-sectional profile, and investigated the impact of LULC on LST. The study's findings indicate a significant conversion of vegetated areas into urban spaces. Over the past 30 years, approximately 56% of the agricultural land in the study area has been converted into settlements and bare land. The area of bare land and settlements expanded by 16% and 11%, respectively, while the areas of agricultural land and vegetation dropped by 24% and 4%, respectively. LST was found to increase with the expansion of bare land and human settlements, with the maximum mean temperature observed for bare land in 2020 at 23.02 & DEG;C. Zonal statistics and correlation analysis established a significant positive correlation between LST and settlements, as well as bare land. The results suggest that changes in LULC significantly influence variations in LST, leading to temperature increases as bare land and settlements expand. Additionally, we found that agricultural land had a lower LST compared to other land cover types, possibly due to evapotranspiration. Our research suggests that to create effective policies for climate change mitigation and adaptation, policymakers in the global south need to use a holistic approach that considers the relationships between LULC and LST. We also recommend that policy interventions focus on promoting urban green spaces, encouraging sustainable agriculture practices, and regulating urban expansion and deforestation to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change.

TI  - Intraoperative assessment of axillary sentinel lymph nodes by telepathology.
T2  - Breast cancer research and treatment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: Although axillary dissection is no longer indicated for many breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive axillary sentinel lymph nodes (ASLN), intraoperative ASLN assessment is still performed in many institutions for patients undergoing mastectomy or neoadjuvant therapy. With recent advancements in digital pathology, pathologists increasingly evaluate ASLN via remote telepathology. We aimed to compare the performance characteristics of remote telepathology and conventional on-site intraoperative ASLN assessment.METHODS: Data from ASLN evaluation for breast cancer patients performed at two sites between April 2021 and October 2022 was collated. Remote telepathology consultation was conducted via the Aperio eSlideManager system.RESULTS: A total of 385 patients were identified during the study period (83 telepathology, 302 on-site evaluations). Although not statistically significant (P=0.20), the overall discrepancy rate between intraoperative and final diagnoses was slightly higher at 9.6% (8/83) for telepathology compared with 5.3% (16/302) for on-site assessment. Further comparison of performance characteristics of ASLN assessment between telepathology and conventional on-site evaluation revealed no statistically significant differences between deferral rates, discrepancy rates, interpretive or sampling errors, major or minor disagreements, false negative or false positive results as well as clinical impact and turn-around time (P≥0.12).CONCLUSION: ASLN assessment via telepathology is not significantly different from conventional on-site evaluation, although it shows a slightly higher overall discrepancy rate between intraoperative and final diagnoses (9.6% vs. 5.3%). Further studies are warranted to ensure accuracy of ASLN assessment via telepathology.

TI  - Tree canopy extent and height change in Europe, 2001-2021, quantified using Landsat data archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - European forests are among the most extensively studied ecosystems in the world, yet there are still debates about their recent dynamics. We modeled the changes in tree canopy height across Europe from 2001 to 2021 using the multidecadal spectral data from the Landsat archive and calibration data from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and spaceborne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidars. Annual tree canopy height was modeled using regression tree ensembles and integrated with annual tree canopy removal maps to produce harmonized tree height map time series. From these time series, we derived annual tree canopy extent maps using a >= 5 m tree height threshold. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) for both ALS-calibrated and GEDI-calibrated tree canopy height maps was <= 4 m. The user's and producer's accuracies estimated using reference sample data are >= 94% for the tree canopy extent maps and >= 80% for the annual tree canopy removal maps. Analyzing the map time series, we found that the European tree canopy extent area increased by nearly 1% overall during the past two decades, with the largest increase observed in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, and the British Isles. However, after the year 2016, the tree canopy extent in Europe declined. Some regions reduced their tree canopy extent between 2001 and 2021, with the highest reduction observed in Fennoscandia (3.5% net decrease). The continental extent of tall tree canopy forests (>= 15 m height) decreased by 3% from 2001 to 2021. The recent decline in tree canopy extent agrees with the FAO statistics on timber harvesting intensification and with the increasing extent and severity of natural disturbances. The observed decreasing tree canopy height indicates a reduction in forest carbon storage capacity in Europe.

TI  - Ecotope-Based Diversity Monitoring of Wetland Using Infused Machine Learning Technique
T2  - WATER CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of ecotope-based diversity in inaccessible wetlands at a spatio-temporal scale is facilitated by remote sensing and GIS technique, cost-effectively. This study pertains to the characterization and change detection of ecotopes for Harike wetland (Ramsar site) of India using Machine Learning (ML) tools adopting a Random Forest (RF) classifier upon Surface Reflectance Tier 1 data products of Landsat images (1990-2020) in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The customized algorithms inferred ten distinct ecotopes in the wetland based on unique homogenous hydrological, anthropogenic, and vegetation characteristics. The novelty of this study is that it has been applied to ecotopes mix of land, water, and vegetation communities with complex boundaries of varying sizes, acted upon by anthropogenic factors. The multi-temporal study indicates increased aquatic vegetation and its interchange within the ecotopes, a rise in water pollution, decreased ponded area, and the conversion of wetland to agricultural area over the selected time frame. As evident from satellite data, the wetland receives loads of polluted water, mainly contributed by the river Satluj through Buddha Nala (drain), the main receptor of Ludhiana city's domestic and industrial sewage. The study signifies regular monitoring of ecotopes on a scientific basis for better preservation and health management of the wetland on a sustainable basis.

TI  - A comprehensive review of spatial-temporal-spectral information reconstruction techniques
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Fine spatial resolution remote sensing images are crucial sources of data for monitoring the Earth's surface. Due to defects in sensors and the complicated imaging environment, however, fine spatial resolution images always suffer from various degrees of information loss. According to the basic attributes of remote sensing images, the information loss generally falls into three dimensions, that is, the spatial, temporal and spectral dimensions. In recent decades, many methods have been developed to cope with this information loss problem in the three dimensions, which are termed spatial reconstruction, temporal reconstruction and spectral reconstruction in this paper. This paper presents a comprehensive review of all three types of reconstruction. First, a systematic introduction and review of the achievements is provided, including the refined general mathematical framework and diagram for each of the three parts. Second, the applications in various areas (e.g., meteorology, ecology and environmental science) are introduced. Third, the challenges and recent advances of spatial-temporal-spectral information reconstruction are summarized, such as the efforts for dealing with abrupt land cover changes in spatial reconstruction, inconsistency in multi-scale data acquired by different sensors in temporal reconstruction, and point spread function (PSF) effect in spectral reconstruction. Finally, several thoughts are given for future prospects.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 data for identifying deformation risk of hydraulic engineering in seasonally frozen salinization regions
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydraulic engineering has positive effects on agricultural production and soil desalination. However, freeze--thaw cycles can cause instability in canal slopes, emphasizing the need for effective deformation monitoring. Using Sentinel-1B data acquired from November 2017 to August 2019 and applying the small baseline subset (SBAS) InSAR method, two unstable canal segments with vertical deformation rates exceeding -40 mm/year were identified in Songyuan, Northeast China. The canal slopes uplifted in winter and experienced accelerated subsidence in spring, with the shady slope experiencing a deformation rate approximately 10 mm/year faster than the sunny slope. Further investigation, integrating Landsat-8 data collected from November 2017 to August 2019, revealed that the shady slope received less thermal radiation than the sunny slope, with an average annual temperature difference on the land surface of approximately 1 celcius. In winter, the saline-alkali soil particles formed a thick unfrozen water film, which, driven by temperature and soil-water gradients, migrated towards the freezing front, froze, and caused soil frost heave. The shady slope experienced longer freezing periods and deeper frozen depths, up to 240 cm, causing more unfrozen water migration and greater uplift deformation than the sunny slope. In spring, as temperature rose, the soil thawed from the surface downward. Notably, the shady slope thawed at a slower rate than the sunny slope, forming a frozen lens near a depth of 100 cm. Frozen lens acted as a barrier for meltwater infiltration, impeding the dissipation of pore water pressure, making the shady slope prone to surface landslides. The integration of multiple data sources is beneficial for identifying deformation risk in hydraulic engineering.

M3  - Article
AB  - City clusters are important spatial carriers for countries to participate in global competition. The continuous monitoring of a city's status can be performed through sensors and processors applied within the real-world infrastructure. Based on the DMSP/OLS and NPP-VIIRS night-time light remote sensing data of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) and Boswash (BW) urban agglomerations from 2000 to 2019, this study used the methods of dynamic threshold and spatial statistical SDE, with the support of GIS technology, to portray the spatial morphology and evolutionary logic of BTH and BW. The analysis used urban life entity theory. The results showed that BTH is in the middle stage of growth and development, with large differences in internal development, centered on the two major growth poles of Beijing and Tianjin. It is expanding in a circular wave-like pattern in all directions, characterized by fast metabolism and strong self-adaptation. BW is in the mature stage, with its overall development level well ahead of BTH's. The cities within are developed in a balanced manner, with a ribbon-like corrugated pattern in all directions, and its development is characterized by slow metabolism and strong self-adaptability.

TI  - Fully automatic training sample collection for detecting multi-decadal inland/seaward urban sprawl
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely monitoring of urban sprawl using remote sensing provides valuable insights for urban management and sustainable development. While existing studies have explored methods for large-scale monitoring of urban sprawl, most of them rely on the collection of manually labeled training samples for supervised classification. Additionally, previous studies generally focused on inland urban sprawl, neglecting the process of urban sprawl towards sea areas, known as seaward urban sprawl, which has profound ecological implications for coastal ecosystems. Here we develop a fully automatic algorithm for detecting urban sprawl, named Fully Automatic Detection of Urban Sprawl (FADUS), using the time-series Landsat imagery without manually collecting training samples or existing urban maps for reference. FADUS automatically generates initial samples through a sequential binary unsupervised clustering technique and then updates them by removing the spectral outliers to obtain a high-quality training set for subsequent supervised classification. A tidal module is included in FADUS to avoid pseudo-urban changes caused by tidal fluctuations so that both inland and seaward urban sprawl can be detected. By applying the algorithm to 75 coastal cities in China, the most rapidly urbanizing region in the world, we uncovered a neglected but dramatic seaward urban sprawl process that has converted sea areas to urban space since 1985. Our results indicate that 9904.36 km2 of coastal wetlands and nearshore seawater areas have been converted to land area, of which 44.83% is currently covered by built-up area. With our method, the fully automatic detection of urban dynamics is now possible for both coastal and inland cities worldwide. Our derived map of seaward urban sprawl in China provides valuable references for coastal land-cover change monitoring, wetland protection and restoration, and integrated coastal management.

TI  - Improved CNN-based CatBoost model for license plate remote sensing image classification
T2  - SIGNAL PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has brought profound technical changes to many traditional industries, among which intelligent transportation has become a hot spot for development in the traditional transportation field. Remote sensing license plate image recognition technology is extensively emphasized in such domains as intelligent transportation and intelligent vehicle management. However, in the practical traffic environment, low visibility scenes caused by complex environmental factors such as rain, snow, haze and cloudy days influence the recognition and classification of license plates, while the distortion of license plate images that may be caused by irregular movements of vehicles bring challenges to license plate recognition classification. The CNN-CatBoost model proposed in this paper divides the license plate recognition classification into two stages. The first stage uses the excellent performance of convolutional neural network in processing image data to extract various license plate image features; the second stage uses the CatBoost module to further process the image feature data and finally obtain the remote sensing license plate information. The model achieves outstanding results in the experiments and has practical application value. Through comparison with other network models, the CNN-CatBoost model proposed in this paper has superior performance.

TI  - A balanced random learning strategy for CNN based Landsat image segmentation under imbalanced and noisy labels
T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat image segmentation is important for obtaining large-scale land cover maps. The accuracy of CNN-based Landsat image segmentation highly depends on the quantity and quality of the training samples. However, enough accurate labels for Landsat images are difficult to access. Fortunately, traditional classifier induced segmentation results can be considered as an alternative, although they are noisy and unbalanced to a certain extent. To resist noisy labels and alleviate the impact of imbalanced samples, this paper proposes a confidence interval based balanced random learning strategy. Firstly, a confidence interval-based mask is employed to control the random learning rate of the network from the entire noisy training set. Then, the multi-layer feature maps of CNN are fully utilized to compensate for the information loss in random learning, in which down sampled labels are used to decrease the uncertainty brought by up-sampling CNN feature maps. In addition, considering the corruption of noisy labels on different classes, a balanced random learning with different confidence levels is performed on each class to further improve the learning ability of CNN. Experimental results on two widely used backbones, namely VGGNet and ResNet, demonstrate that the proposed balanced random learning strategy can effectively improve the performance of CNN under imbalanced and noisy labels, which can be improved by 3.41%.

TI  - Calibrating a hydrodynamic model using water surface elevation determined from ICESat-2 derived cross-section and Sentinel-2 retrieved sub-pixel river width
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate observations of river water surface elevation (WSE) are critical for hydrodynamic (HD) model calibration in poorly gauged regions. This study presents a new river WSE retrieval approach that combines ICESat-2 derived cross-sections and Sentinel-2 observed sub-pixel river widths to achieve an effective HD model calibration. The unknown channel Manning coefficient, river bed elevation and cross-sectional shape in the HD model are calibrated simultaneously through a Bayesian optimization algorithm. The complete workflow is implemented in a flood-prone reach in Yiluo River basin. Results show that the WSE retrieved by the new approach has a higher spatiotemporal resolution in narrower rivers than that of Sentinel-3 altimetry derived WSE, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) varies from 0.25 to 0.59 m against in-situ WSE. The HD model calibrated by WSE retrieved by the new approach simulates the WSE with RMSE of 0.36 m and the flood extent with critical success index (CSI) of 0.60 in validation, outperforming the results of the HD model calibrated by Sentinel-3 altimetry derived WSE, with corresponding results of 0.49 m and 0.58, respectively. Additional case studies in the Maqu and Lingkou reaches further demonstrate the applicability of the WSE retrieval approach proposed in this study for HD model calibration in different types of rivers. This study highlights the potential of the proposed WSE retrieval approach in HD model calibration to improve flood forecasting in poorly gauged regions.

TI  - Discussion. Has the human population become a sentinel for the adverse effects of PFAS contamination on wildlife health and endangered species?
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Global contamination with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) poses a threat to both human health and the environment, with significant implications for ecological conservation policies. A growing list of peer-reviewed publications indicates that PFAS can harm wildlife health and that the adverse effects associated with PFAS exposure in wildlife are in concordance with human epidemiological studies. The correlation of cross-species data supports a unique perspective that humans can be regarded as a sentinel for PFAS effects in other species. The health harms due to PFAS are potentially most concerning for populations of endangered and threatened species that are simultaneously exposed to PFAS and other toxic pollutants, and also face threats to their survival due to habitat loss, degradation of ecosystems, and over-harvesting. Human epidemiological studies on the PFAS doses associated with health harm present a rich source of information about potential impacts on wildlife health due to PFAS. Our analysis suggests that national and international efforts to restrict the discharges of PFAS into the environment and to clean up PFAS-contaminated sites present an opportunity to protect wildlife from chemical pollution and to advance species conservation worldwide.

TI  - Assessing urban wetlands dynamics in Wuhan and Nanchang, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban wetlands play a crucial role in sustainable social development. However, current research mainly focuses on specific wetland types, and fine extraction of urban wetlands remains a challenge. This study proposes a fine extraction framework based on hierarchical decision trees and shape features for urban wetlands, using Sentinel2 remote sensing data to obtain detailed wetland data of Wuhan and Nanchang from 2016 to 2022. Our framework applies random forests to classify land cover, extracts urban fine wetlands by hierarchical decision trees and shape features, and assesses the dynamics of wetlands in the two cities. We also analyzed and discussed the characteristics of urban wetlands in the two cities. The results show that wetland accuracies of Wuhan and Nanchang are greater than 84.5 % and 82.9 %, respectively. The wetland areas of Wuhan in 2016, 2019, and 2022 are 1969.4 km2, 1713.8 km2, and 1681.1 km2, while those in Nanchang are 1405.9 km2, 1361.6 km2, and 766.9 km2. Inland wetlands are the main wetland types in both regions, with lake wetlands accounting for the highest proportion (over 40 %). The urban wetlands in the two cities exhibit different spatial and temporal evolution patterns, with varying change trends of wetland area and the structural proportions of fine wetlands. Besides, Wuhan's urban wetlands are primarily located in the south, while Nanchang's urban wetlands are concentrated in the east, exhibiting higher spatial and temporal dynamics. Analysis suggests that the reduced urban wetlands from 2016 to 2022 are related to fluctuating decreasing precipitation, growing population, and gross domestic product (GDP). Our study provides support for the conservation of urban wetland resources in Wuhan and Nanchang and highlights the need for targeted management strategies.

TI  - Drought conditions, aridity and forest structure control the responses of Iberian holm oak woodlands to extreme droughts: A large-scale remote-sensing exploration in eastern Spain
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how Mediterranean forests respond to the increasing frequency of extreme droughts and forest densification is crucial for effective land management in the present context of climate change and land abandonment. We study the responses of Iberian holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) woodlands to recent extreme droughts during 2000-2019 along broad gradients of climate aridity and forest structure. To this purpose, we apply largescale remote-sensing using MODIS EVI as a primary production proxy in 5274 Q. ilex sites distributed within a 100,000 km2 region in eastern Spain. These woodlands were extensively affected by two extreme drought events in 2005 and 2012. Resistance, assessed as the capacity of the ecosystems to maintain primary production during drought, was significantly lower for semi-arid than for sub-humid and dry-transition conditions. Holm oak woodlands located in semi-arid areas of the region showed also poorer resilience to drought, characterized by low capacity to fully recover to their pre-drought production levels. Further, drought intensity and both pre- and post-drought hydric conditions controlled the variations of resistance, recovery and resilience between the two analyzed extreme drought events. Drought effects were particularly negative for dense Q. ilex stands under semiarid climate conditions, where strong competition for scarce water resources reduced drought resistance. The observed drought vulnerability of semi-arid holm oak woodlands may affect the long-term stability of these dry forests. Adaptive management strategies, such as selective forest thinning, may be useful for improving drought responses in these more vulnerable semi-arid woodlands. Conversely, natural rewilding may more appropriately guide management actions for more humid areas, where densely developed Q. ilex woodlands show in general a high ability to maintain ecosystem primary production during drought.

TI  - Understanding the indirect impacts of urbanization on vegetation growth using the Continuum of Urbanity framework
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies investigated the direct impacts of urbanization on the loss and fragmentation of vegetated lands associated with urban expansion. Fewer studies, however, have examined the indirect impacts of urbanization on vegetation related to changes in livelihoods, lifestyles, and connectivity in non-urbanized areas, especially in the context of large-scale urban-rural migration. Here, we employ the Continuum of Urbanity framework to examine how changes in livelihoods, lifestyles, and connectivity in non-urbanized areas associated with urbanization affect vegetation, and thereby to understanding the indirect impacts of urbanization. We found there was a significant trend in human-induced EVI (HEVI) increase in non-urban areas, and such trend was coupled with decreased population density (PD) in forest land and grassland, but increased population density in cropland. The negative correlation between PD and HEVI became increasingly stronger from 2000 to 2011, but weakened since 2011. Livelihood income, lifestyles represented by consumption, and information connectivity to the outside world indirectly impacted HEVI by driving PD changes in non-urban areas. This indirect effect has shifted from positive to negative over the 20 years. These findings suggest that the indirect impacts of urbanization on vegetation growth are complicated and multifaceted, and understanding such impacts would be critically important to help turn urbanization into an opportunity for regional sustainable development.

TI  - Tracking air quality trends and vehicle traffic dynamics at urban scale using satellite and ground data before and after the COVID-19 outbreak
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The implications of the COVID-19 outbreak are subjected to an increasing number of studies. So far, air quality trends related to the lockdown due to the pandemic have been analysed in large cities or entire regions. In this work, the region studied is the metropolitan area of Cagliari, which is the main city on the island of Sardinia (Italy) and can be representative of a coastal city that includes industrial settlements. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of restrictions related to the COVID-19 outbreak on air quality levels and the traffic dynamics in this type of urban area. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels before, during and after COVID-19 lockdown have been investigated using data acquired from the Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI satellite combined with on-site measurements. Both TROPOMI detected and ground-based data have revealed higher levels of NO2 before and after the lockdown, compared to those during the period of COVID-related restrictions, in particular in the urban area of Cagliari. On the other hand, NO2 registered in the oil refinery area did not show significant differences associated with lockdown. The correlation of TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric column with ground data (surface NO2) on a monthly mean basis showed different values based on the background and the highest Pearson's coefficient was of about 0.78 near to the city centre, where traffic can be considered a significant source of emission. In addition, a comparison of the air pollution level with the dynamics of vehicle traffic was investi-gated. The study highlighted a remarkable correlation between the reduction of the number of vehicles and the corresponding tropospheric NO2 values that decreased on a weekly mean basis.

TI  - Dynamic landscapes and the influence of human activities in the Yellow River Delta wetland region.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The Yellow River Delta (YRD) wetland is one of the largest and youngest wetland ecosystems in the world. It plays an important role in regulating climate and maintaining ecological balance in the region. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal changes in land use, wetland migration, and landscape pattern from 2013 to 2022 using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 data in YRD. Then wetland landscape changes and the impact of human activities are determined by analyzing correlation between landscape and socio-economic indicators including nighttime light centroid, total light intensity, cultivated land area and centroid, building area and centroid, economic and population. The results show that the total wetland area increased 1426km2 during this decade. However, the wetland landscape pattern tended to be fragmented from 2013 to 2022, with wetlands of different types interlacing and connectivity decreasing, and distribution becoming more concentrated. Different types of human activities had influences on different aspects of wetland landscape, with the expansion of cultivated land mainly compressing the core area of wetlands from the edge, the expansion of buildings mainly disrupting wetland connectivity, and socio-economic indicators such as total light intensity and the centroid mainly causing wetland fragmentation. The results show the changes of the YRD wetland and provide an explanation of how human activities effect the change of its landscape, which provides available data to achieve sustainable development goals 6.6 and may give an access to measure the change of wetland using human-activity data, which could help to adject behaviors to protect wetlands.

TI  - Generating high spatial resolution exposure estimates from sparse regulatory monitoring data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Random Forest algorithms have extensively been used to estimate ambient air pollutant concentrations. How-ever, the accuracy of model-predicted estimates can suffer from extrapolation problems associated with limited measurement data to train the machine learning algorithms. In this study, we developed and evaluated two approaches, incorporating low-cost sensor data, that enhanced the extrapolating ability of random-forest models in areas with sparse monitoring data. Rochester, NY is the area of a pregnancy-cohort study. Daily PM2.5 con-centrations from the NAMS/SLAMS sites were obtained and used as the response variable in the model, with satellite data, meteorological, and land-use variables included as predictors. To improve the base random-forest models, we used PM2.5 measurements from a pre-existing low-cost sensors network, and then conducted a two-step backward selection to gradually eliminate variables with potential emission heterogeneity from the base models. We then introduced the regression-enhanced random forest method into the model development. Finally, contemporaneous urinary 1-hydroxypyrene was used to evaluate the PM2.5 predictions generated from the two approaches. The two-step approach increased the average external validation R2 from 0.49 to 0.65, and decreased the RMSE from 3.56 mu g/m3 to 2.96 mu g/m3. For the regression-enhanced random forest models, the average R2 of the external validation was 0.54, and the RMSE was 3.40 mu g/m3. We also observed significant and comparable relationships between urinary 1-hydroxypyrene levels and PM2.5 predictions from both improved models. This PM2.5 model estimation strategy could improve the extrapolating ability of random forest models in areas with sparse monitoring data.

TI  - Lateral moraine failure in the valley of the Djankuat Catchment (Central Caucasus) and subsequent morphodynamics
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Moraine failures are severe events in proglacial areas that lead to major surface changes. On July 1, 2015, a lateral moraine collapsed within the 9.1 km2 glacierized Djankuat Catchment in the Northern Caucasus. This study quantifies the surface changes over a 7-year period after the collapse and proposes the main event triggers using hydrometeorological measurements and remote sensing data. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), derived from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) surveys and satellite images for the 2010-2022 period, were used to estimate erosion/deposition associated with the event and further surface changes in several zones: the breach, the fan, the headward erosion area and gully erosion on lateral moraine slopes. The failure occurred due to an extreme precipitation event (7-day cumulative sum: 227 mm, 24 h prior: 60 mm), simultaneous snowmelt within the whole upstream catchment, and continuous positive temperatures. During the 2015 event, approximately 200,000 m3 of material was instantly eroded, corresponding to a surface lowering of 1.91 m a-1 (over 52,227 m2). Only 25 % of the eroded material redeposited on the fan. Later in 2017-2019, the breach underwent infilling with a 10 m deposition layer in the bottom (net change ca. 14,600 m3), while the stream in the headward erosion area continued to incise (ca. -12,900 m3). From 2019 to 2022, the dynamics decreased, and a positive sediment budget was assessed for all zones except the intensive local erosion on the fan in 2021-2022 (ca. -15,200 m3). Gully changes suggested a constant erosion of 90-100 mm a-1. Based on daily rainfall measurements for the 2008-2022 period, we proposed a 3-day and prior 15-day cumulative precipitation threshold that outlines major erosional events in the Djankuat River valley. A cumulative 3-day precipitation of 100 mm could be a sufficient but not necessary condition since some significant sediment export was recorded below that threshold.

TI  - An operational approach for large-scale mapping of water clarity levels in inland lakes using landsat images based on optical classification
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity is a critical parameter of water, it is typically measured using the setter disc depth (SDD). The accurate estimation of SDD for optically varying waters using remote sensing remains challenging. In this study, a water classification algorithm based on the Landsat 5 TM/Landsat 8 OLI satellite was used to distinguish different water types, in which the waters were divided into two types by using the ad(443)/ap(443) ratio. Water type 1 refers to waters dominated by phytoplankton, while water type 2 refers to waters dominated by non-algal particles. For the different water types, a specific algorithm was developed based on 994 in situ water samples collected from Chinese inland lakes during 42 cruises. First, the Rrs(443)/Rrs(655) ratio was used for water type 1 SDD estimation, and the band combination of (Rrs(443)/Rrs(655) -Rrs(443)/Rrs(560)) was proposed for water type 2. The accuracy assessment based on an independent validation dataset proved that the proposed algorithm performed well, with an R2 of 0.85, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 25.98%, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.23 m. To demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm, it was extensively evaluated using data collected from Lake Erie and Lake Huron, and the estimation accuracy remained satisfactory (R2 = 0.87, MAPE = 28.04%, RMSE = 0.76 m). Furthermore, compared with existing empirical and semi-analytical SDD estimation algorithms, the algorithm proposed in this paper showed the best performance, and could be applied to other satellite sensors with similar band settings. Finally, this algorithm was successfully applied to map SDD levels of 107 lakes and reservoirs located in the Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain (MLYP) from 1984 to 2020 at a 30 m spatial resolution, and it was found that 53.27% of the lakes and reservoirs in the MLYP generally show an upward trend in SDD. This research provides a new technological approach for water environment monitoring in regional and even global lakes, and offers a scientific reference for water environment management of lakes in the MLYP.

TI  - Thermokarst lake changes along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway during 1991-2020
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermokarst lake development significantly affects hydrologic systems, infrastructure stability and biogeo-chemical processes, while the spatial and temporal changes in thermokarst lakes remain largely unknown. Here, we created a thermokarst lake dataset on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) using a threshold-based mapping method based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) data associated with visual inspection. The dataset includes a thermokarst lake inventory on the QTP at a 10 m resolution produced from Sentinel-2A images and a multi-temporal inventory along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway (QTH) from Landsat and Sentinel-2A images. We analyzed the temporal and spatial changes in thermokarst lake area and their relationships to environmental factors. Our results showed that thermokarst lakes on the QTP permafrost region covered a total area of 1572 +/- 184 km(2), with most of the thermokarst lakes <10,000 m(2) in area. The spatial distributions of thermokarst lakes are affected by the ground thermal stability, active layer thickness, vegetation type, and ground ice content. Over the past 30 years, the number and surface area of thermokarst lakes along the QTH have increased by 58.8 % and 83.1 %, respectively, with the increase in lakes likely caused by climate warming and precipitation increasing. This study provides deep insight in the long-term interannual variations and its driving factors in thermokarst lakes along the QTH.

TI  - The spatiotemporal evolution and impact mechanism of energy consumption carbon emissions in China from 2010 to 2020 by integrating multisource remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal evolution patterns of carbon emissions and their influence mechanisms are important topics for regional climate change monitoring and research on sustainable development goals. At present, due to the limitation of statistical data collection scale, it is difficult to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of carbon emission and its influence mechanism at a finer scale in China. With the development of new remote sensing platforms and technologies, multisource remote sensing data such as nighttime light remote sensing data and XCO2 concentration data have become important information resources for carbon emission monitoring. Therefore, this study monitors the spatiotemporal evolution of carbon emissions in China based on multisource remote sensing data and conducts impact mechanism research. The main conclusions of this study include: (1) The partial least squares carbon emission estimation model and the downscaled inversion model estimate carbon emissions with high accuracy. The estimated carbon emissions of both have high correlation with statistical carbon emissions, with R2 of 0.86 and 0.87, respectively, and no significant overestimation or underestimation. (2) The overall spatial pattern of energy consumption carbon emissions in China from 2010 to 2018 is high in the east and low in the west and high in the north and low in the south, but this spatial distribution pattern is gradually weakening. China's energy consumption carbon emissions varied considerably from 2010 to 2018, with an overall slow positive growth trend. (3) The mechanisms of population growth, economic development, urbanization and industrialization on carbon emissions are more complex, and most of their influencing factors promote carbon emission generation, while carbon emission impacts have spatial spillover. This study designs and studies a regional energy consumption carbon emission estimation model in China based on multisource remote sensing data, and explores the characteristics of regional multiscale carbon emission spatiotemporal variation and its influence mechanism, so as to provide scientific references for China's carbon emission reduction targets.

TI  - Minute level smartphone derived exposure to greenness and consumer wearable derived physical activity in a cohort of US women
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Inconsistent results have been found in the literature on associations of greenness, or vegetation quantity, and physical activity. However, few studies have assessed associations between mobility-based greenness and physical activity from mobile health data from smartphone and wearable devices with fine spatial and temporal resolution.Methods: We assessed mobility-based greenness exposure and wearable accelerometer data from participants in the US-based prospective Nurses' Health Study 3 cohort Mobile Health (mHealth) Substudy (2018-2020). We recruited 500 female participants with instructions to wear devices over four 7-day sampling periods equally spaced throughout the year. After restriction criteria there were 337 participants (mean age 36 years) with n = 639,364 unique observations. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data were derived from 30 m x 30 m Landsat-8 imagery and spatially joined to GPS points recorded every 10 min. Fitbit proprietary algorithms provided physical activity summarized as mean number of steps per minute, which we averaged during the 10min period following a GPS-based greenness exposure assessment. We utilized Generalized Additive Mixed Models to examine associations (every 10 min) between greenness and physical activity adjusting for neighborhood and individual socioeconomic status, Census region, season, neighborhood walkability, daily mean temperature and precipitation. We assessed effect modification through stratification and interaction models and conducted sensitivity analyses.Results: Mean 10-min step count averaged 7.0 steps (SD 14.9) and greenness (NDVI) averaged 0.3 (SD 0.2). Contrary to our hypotheses, higher greenness exposure was associated non-linearly with lower mean steps per minute after adjusting for confounders. We observed statistically significant effect modification by Census region and season.Discussion: We utilized objective physical activity data at fine temporal and spatial scales to present novel estimates of the association between mobility-based greenness and step count. We found higher levels of greenness were inversely associated with steps per minute.

TI  - Disk-integrated and disk-resolved photometry of the Moon with GaoFen-4 space observations
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The GaoFen-4 (GF-4) satellite obtained high-resolution images of the entire lunar disk in a single exposure without atmospheric disturbance. These data are favorable for the study of both disk-resolved and disk -integrated photometric properties of the Moon. Using the GF-4 observations, we modeled the lunar reflectance phase functions with the Hapke model and analyzed the lunar photometric properties. The results indicate that the lunar surface exhibits pronounced backscattering, and the maria appear to be smoother compared to the highlands. The disk-resolved and disk-integrated models produced different best-fit parameters for the whole Moon, with the disk-integrated model fitting the small phase angle data better, and the disk-resolved model showing a more favorable appearance at large phase angles. By calculating the disk-integrated phase function with a disk-resolved method, the study confirms the equivalence of the two models, albeit with a small discrepancy due to an imperfect approximation of the roughness function. This discrepancy is due to the different forms of the phase function used in the models. The geometric albedo of the Moon derived from the disk-resolved model is 0.137 and the spherical albedo is 0.063 for Band 3 of GF-4 at 560.6 nm. This study observed an arched phase curve of the ratio of reflectance in two wavelengths, indicating a phenomenon of phase reddening at small phase angles and bluing at large phase angles.

TI  - A novel approach suggestion for assessing the impact of topographic shading on the estimation of the floating photovoltaic technical potential
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a novel approach for the implementation of floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems at the Ayvali hydroelectric power plant (HPP) in Turkiye. The method proposed in this study accounts for dynamic changes in water levels to accurately calculate the shading effects induced by topography. First, the minimum reservoir surface for the FPV system was calculated using remote sensing (RS). The minimum reservoir surface area, which was determined as 504.69 ha using 60 Sentinel-2 satellite images, was calculated using machine learning al-gorithms on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, support vector machines (SVM) and automatic water extraction index (AWEI). In the second stage, new digital elevation model (DEM) maps were produced by overlapping monthly changes in water height with ALOS PALSAR data and solar analysis was performed on them. An annual global horizontal irradiance (GHI) map was produced using these maps, and it was divided into five classes to emphasize differences in production potential. The results revealed that 1083.45 GWh of elec-tricity can be produced annually by installing FPV in very high and high potential areas. However, as the moderate, low, and very low regions represent only 5.02% of the reservoir surface and there is a 1.68-fold difference in production potential between the highest and lowest areas due to topography-induced shading near the coastline, it was concluded that FPV installation would not be efficient in those regions. This study highlights the significance of incorporating topography-induced shading and emphasizes the importance of employing RS and geographic information system (GIS) techniques to achieve this objective.

TI  - Long-term analysis of glaciers and glacier lakes in the Central and Eastern Himalaya
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Himalayan glaciers represent both an important source of water and a major suite of geohazards for inhabitants of their downstream regions. Recent climate change has intersected with local topographic, geomorphic, and glaciological factors to drive complex patterns of glacier thinning, retreat, velocity change, and lake development. In this study, we analyze the long-term variations in surface elevation change and velocity of the glaciers in the Central and Eastern Himalaya using existing and newly generated datasets spanning 1975 to 2018. We have used modelled (e.g., debris and ice thickness) and remote sensing datasets (e.g., Corona, Hexagon, and Landsat images) to investigate the impact of debris cover and the evolution of proglacial lakes on the glacier response in the region. We found that lake-terminating glaciers (lake TGs) have significantly higher thinning, velocity, and deceleration over time than land-terminating glaciers (land TGs). Lakes have shown an overall growth of 98 % in area and 40 % in number during 1975-2017. New proglacial lakes will likely continue to develop, and existing ones will keep expanding, influencing the frontal changes and dynamics of the lake-terminating glaciers. Debriscovered glaciers have undergone similar thinning compared to clean-ice glaciers, both for lake and land TGs; however, variations exist across the ablation zones between clean and debris-covered glaciers which this study further explores using a data-driven approach. Overall, the proglacial lakes development, changes in debris coverage, and topography significantly affect the glacier responses in the regions.

TI  - Anthropogenic debris ingestion in a tropical seabird community: Insights from taxonomy and foraging distribution
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceans have been considered as an unlimited supply of goods and services, but resource extraction and waste disposal became ubiquitous and have been damaging the health of marine ecosystems. Finding suitable sentinel species of the human impacts on the oceans is thus imperative, since they may work as early warnings of disruptive situations. In this study, we investigated how taxonomy and foraging distribution influenced the occurrence of anthropogenic debris among five seabird species inhabiting the tropical Atlantic region. Occurrence of anthropogenic debris was assessed using faeces of breeding individuals as a proxy of ingestion. A total of 268 particles were extracted from all samples. The categories "fragments" and "fibres", as well as the colour "blue", were the most prevalent characteristics across species. There was a high diversity of polymers from cellulosic particles to synthetic plastics (Anthropogenic Cellulosic 26.9 %; Polyester 7.7 %; Varnish 5.8 %; Polypropylene 1.9 %). Species with a more coastal foraging strategy exhibited higher occurrence and number of anthropogenic debris when compared to species foraging comparably more in pelagic areas. This suggests that anthropogenic debris are more prevalent in coastal foraging areas, where human activities occur in higher number and frequency (e.g., fisheries) and sources of freshwater input from inland are at close distance. These results provide more evidence to the growing perception on the ubiquity and diversity of anthropogenic debris in the marine environment, and further support the usefulness of using seabirds as bio-indicators of anthropogenic pollution in both neritic and oceanic regions.

TI  - Present and future scopes and challenges of plant pest and disease (P&D) monitoring: Remote sensing, image processing, and artificial intelligence perspectives
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the dawn of agriculture, farmers have been at the stake of dealing with pests and diseases. Chemical pesticides are a reliable source of controlling pests and pathogens, but indiscriminate use of pesticides can cause severe consequences for human health and the ecosystem. Therefore, sustainable crop production is to be followed where pests and pathogens infestation should be detected at the very initial stage of infection so that judicious management practices could be undertaken. Initial detection of pests and pathogens in standing crops is a big challenge. Many approaches, such as traditional visual and molecular detection, are used to detect pathogens invasively at a very small scale in the field and require laboratory facilities. However, the recent advancement of remote sensing and image analysis-based technologies have been used to detect the occurrence of pests and pathogens precisely in vast areas, in real-time, and in a non-invasive way. This paper discussed the latest achievements in monitoring pests and diseases using remote sensing technologies coupled with image processing and spectroscopy-based methods. We also discussed the opportunities and challenges of P & D monitoring using these technologies. Despite many challenges, these cutting-edge technologies could be used to ensure sustainable and safe crop production by avoiding the excessive yet expensive and harmful use of pesticides in crop protection and ensuring precision agriculture.

TI  - Testing a novel pasture quality index using remote sensing tools in semiarid and Mediterranean grasslands
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the nutritional value of herbage is a core aspect of livestock pasture management. Quantitative information related to significant findings is essential for assessing nutritional provision and preventing pasture degradation. Here, we developed a new Pasture Quality Index (PQI) that indicates the nutritional quality of pastures based on their nutritional value and the composition of plant functional groups of the vegetation. We applied the model on a regional scale using VEN & mu;S satellite data, collected more than 450 plant samples, and applied pasture quality parameters analysis. Pasture samples were collected from paddocks under two different grazing intensities in Israel in a semiarid and a Mediterranean grassland. Pasture quality was estimated five times over two years at mid- and peak vegetation growth stages. The PQI included: protein content, fiber content, dry matter digestibility and the proportion of unpalatable spiny thistles. A support vector machine regression model was used to train statistical models that relate ground truth PQI data to the reflectance values of the VEN & mu;S satellite. Large-scale forage quality maps at 5 m spatial resolution were created. Fine-resolution drone orthomosaics were used to enhance the satellite-based predictions accuracy, resulting in a model accuracy of R2 = 0.86. We observed that nutritional quality showed strong dependence on seasonality and the grazing regime, with higher quality observed during mid-growth compared to peak growth. Higher quality was also observed under grazing compared to ungrazed paddocks. The occurrence of unpalatable thistles in grazed paddocks significantly reduced the pasture quality at the Mediterranean grassland. To summarize, the PQI enables the integration of several quality indicators into an index that helps in detecting the effects of grazing management on rangelands. In addition, high accuracy was achieved in relating the overall PQI and high spatiotemporal resolution satellite imagery data. Our developed methodology enables site-specific, spatially explicit, frequent, and area-extensive pasture quality assessment that can aid in optimizing livestock management in various ecosystems.

TI  - Employing molecular, chemical and physiological techniques using Crassostrea virginica to assess ecosystem health along coastal South Carolina and North Carolina, United States
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural and anthropogenic environmental impacts can introduce contaminants into sensitive habitats, threatening ecosystems and human health. Consistent monitoring of coastal areas provides critical environmental assessment data. Sediments and Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) tissues were collected at fourteen South Carolina (SC) and four North Carolina (NC) sites as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Mussel Watch environmental monitoring program. Cellular and molecular techniques were employed to measure C. virginica stress response, specifically, Lipid Peroxidation (LPx), Glutathione (GSH), and qPCR techniques. Gene specific primers targeted for detecting oxidative stress and cellular death were developed in C. virginica to gauge response to current environmental conditions using gill and hepatopancreas (HP) tissue. In order to validate gene specific markers as additional assessment tools, a 96 h zinc (Zn) laboratory exposure was performed. Cellular biomarker data revealed tissue specific responses. Hepatopancreas data showed C. virginica exhibited stress through the lipid peroxidation assay amongst sampling sites, however, response was managed through glutathione detoxification. Gill tissue data had significantly lower levels of cellular biomarker response compared to hepatopancreas. Molecular biomarkers targeting these cellular stress pathways through qPCR analysis show upregulation of Metallothionein in hepatopancreas and gill tissue with a concurrent > 2-fold upregulation in the detoxification marker Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) at three NC sites. SC sites displayed higher stress levels through LPx assays and down-regulation in GPx gene activity. Laboratory zinc exposure revealed no significance in cellular biomarker results, however, molecular data showed gills responding to zinc treatment through upregulation of Metallothionein, SOD and Cathepsin L, indicating an acute response in gills. Collectively, chemical, cellular and molecular methods clarify sentinel stress response of biological impacts and aid in evaluating environmental health in coastal ecosystems. This combined methodological approach provides a detailed analysis of environmental conditions and improves land-use management decisions.

TI  - Impact of land use and land cover change on land surface temperature over Lake Tana Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Isolation of climate and Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes and their compounded effect is complicated since the two influence each other through forcing-feedback cycles. This study investigates the changes in LULC and its contribution to the change in surface and air temperature in the Lake Tana Basin using data obtained from MODIS remote sensing satellites, ground observation and reanalysis model. Observation minus reanalysis (OMR) method and various analysis tools are used to estimate the impact of LULC changes on temperature. The analysis of LULC change indicates that an increase of Savanna and other type of forest cover by about 519 km2 from year 2001 to year 2020. Wetland increased by about 83.7 km2 during the said period. During the period 2001-2020, about 56.5% baren-land areas are being converted into wetland. The conversion of water bodies and baren land to wetland is likely due to the increase of water hyacinth on both the water body and nearby baren-land whereas the increase in Savanna is linked to an on-going eucalyptus tree plantation. The negative correlation between LST and NDVI (reaching a value of -0.60) is noticed over the Basin throughout the year on inter-annual time scale. An increase in vegetation cover such as Savanna and broad leaf forest coincides with the decreasing LST with an average rate of 0.08%/decade. Also, a reduction in temperature, derived from OMR, at an average cooling rate of about 0.87%/decade is observed in the study period. However, an increase in the LST change rate over built-up and grassland is about 0.03%/decade. Therefore, we conclude that the consistent associations of the increase in areal coverage of the some LULC types with lowest LSTs, 2m-temperature and temperature trend derived from NDVI-LST and LULC-LST associations as well as OMR temperature and LST are unambiguous signatures of the effect of LULC change on temperature over Lake Tana Basin, distinct from that arising due to climate change.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects caused by urbanization and associated anthropogenic activities have adverse environmental and social impacts. The social impacts of UHIs on Indian cities are not well documented. To fill this void, the current paper examines the spatial variation of the UHI effects on the populations of two Indian cities: Bangalore and Hyderabad. Land Surface Temperature (LST) data for the past two decades is obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor to analyse the spatial and temporal variation of the thermal environment of the cities. The regions experiencing different levels of UHI effects within the cities, along with the population in these zones, are identified in the study. The average UHI intensity for the past two decades in Bangalore and Hyderabad is found to be 1.9 & DEG;C and 2.44 & DEG;C, respectively. The UHI intensity in Bangalore and Hyderabad is found to be increasing annually at a rate of 0.040 & DEG;C per year and 0.033 & DEG;C per year, respectively. Around 1 million people in Bangalore and 1.8 million people in Hyderabad are inhabitants of the high temperate zone, experiencing an average LST of 3.14 & DEG;C and 3.55 & DEG;C higher than the rest of the population, respectively. The study emphasizes the need for regionally scaled UHI mitigation strategies and identifies the most vulnerable regions within the study area to prioritize mitigation strategies.

TI  - Assessment of the environmental impacts of gold mining activities at Gankombol (Adamawa-Cameroon) using Leopold matrix, Fecteau grid and remote sensing approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the environmental impacts of gold mining activities at Gankombol (Adamawa Cameroon) are assessed over four-year period. The Leopold matrix and the Fecteau grid are used to identify the environmental impacts and to determine their absolute importance. The spatio-temporal variation of spectral indices and land degradation are assessed using remote sensing analysis. The approach adopted is based on the calculation of spectral indices and spatio-temporal analysis. For this purpose, from Sentinel-2 satellite images, spectral indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the brightness index (BRI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), the bare soil index (BSI) and the dry bare soil index (DBSI) are computed during four years (2016, 2019, 2020 and 2021). The environmental degradation maps are generated by using supervised Random Forests (RF) algorithm and field observations. Finally, the confusion matrix and the kappa coefficient are used to check the performance and the accuracy of the classification maps. The environmental impact assessment by the Leopold matrix and the Fecteau grid reveal that the environmental impacts of mining activities are mainly negative and manifested by deforestation, degradation of water and soil quality, and high risks to human health. These impacts have a major absolute importance. The analysis of the spectral indices suggest a clear difference between the values obtained for each year due to the evolution of the mining activity over time. The environmental degradation maps which made it possible to discriminate water bodies, exploited area, vegetation and barren soils show that the values of water bodies decrease from 16.33 to 11.69 km2 between 2016 and 2020, then increase to 13.46 km2 in 2021. The exploited area increases from 0.00 to 13.75 km2 between 2016 and 2021. Vegetation cover decreases from 24.49 to 15.25 km2 between 2016 and 2021, while barren soils increase from 19.65 to 21.53 km2 between 2019 and 2021. These results reveal significant environmental degradation in the study area due to mining activities.

Besides, Fusion satellite images have been implemented to monitor and investigate fodder corn in three study areas. In the remote sensing stage, after implementing the downscaling algorithm and producing the leaf area index (LAI) time series, the results were compared with the estimated values from Landsat 8 and MODIS images, which were associated with overestimation in all cases. Furthermore, the results exhibited statistically significance with R-2 > 95% and P-value < 0.05. The AquaCrop model was first calibrated and implemented in the crop modeling section at each growth stage based on the observational data measured in each field. The accuracy of the simulated model was checked according to the results of statistical indicators with high accuracy (NRMSE = 10% and RMSE = 0.03 (Ton/ha)) at significant level (95%) and was associated with underestimation. Using the SVM decision support algorithm, the relationship between downscaled LAI and calibrated CC (crop canopy) was estimated. This relationship was generated with 70% of the data and subsequently validated using the remaining 30% (R-2 = 0.99, NRMSE = 0.01). On this basis, CC values were predicted. Finally, biomass values were compared with observed biomass values. According to the results of statistical indicators (RMSE = 0.19 (Ton/ha), NRMSE = 0.01, R-2 = 0.96, P-value < 0.05), biomass estimation was highly accurate. These results demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the model and the proposed method for simulating and estimating biomass before harvesting.

TI  - Investigating the effectiveness of Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI satellite data in monitoring the effects of drought on surface water resources in the Western Cape Province, South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought frequency and magnitude are increasing, posing significant risks to surface water bodies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Leveraging on moderate resolution satellite data, such as Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), offers unique opportunities for monitoring surface water availability and drought impacts. In this study, we assessed the extent to which Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI satellite data can be used to characterise and monitor the impacts of drought on water resources in the Western Cape, South Africa. Multispectral indices including Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI+5) were computed to determine the most suitable method for surface water detection and drought monitoring. Sentinel-2-derived NDVI emerged as the most suitable index for mapping surface waterbodies, demonstrating an overall accuracy of 77.27%. However, LSWI+5 exhibited limitations, misclassifying built-up and mountainous areas as surface waterbodies. SPI, VCI, and WRSI effectively identified drought periods and correlated well with climate data, revealing low rainfall and high evapotranspiration rates during the 2016-2018 drought period. These findings provide valuable insights into surface water variability and the impacts of drought on water resources. Overall, our study underscores the feasibility of utilizing moderate resolution datasets to assess drought impacts on surface water resources, enabling improved water resource management, drought detection, and preparedness efforts in resource limited environments.

TI  - Land degradability mapping using remote sensing data and soil chemical properties
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Selection of the most influential soil properties to land degradability (LDy) mapping and their association is unclear. Accordingly, this study developed a geo-environmental modelling approach using multi-source datasets including remote sensing imagery, meteorological data, and soil properties (electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic matter (SOM), and calcium carbonate (CaCO3)) to LDy mapping in Jajrud and Karaj basin of Iran. LDy reference map obtained from soil properties data and Hedged Product overlay method was used to train and validate the random forest model. A sensitivity analysis was performed, which showed that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is the most effective variable in LDy mapping. Under data constraints, the combination of biological soil crust index, leaf area index, and maximum wind speed is the best dataset for LDy mapping. Results revealed that the study area's most degraded lands were primarily barelands, followed by farmlands, grasslands, and fallow lands, respectively. Besides, considering their lower EC, the highlands and fallowlands did not witness land degradation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has recently been accepted to evaluate nodal status in endometrial cancer at early stage, which is key to tailoring adjuvant treatments. Our aim was to evaluate the national implementation of SLN biopsy in terms of accuracy to detect nodal disease in a clinical setting and oncologic outcomes according to the volume of nodal disease.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 29 Spanish centers participated in this retrospective, multicenter registry including patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma at preoperative early stage who had undergone SLN biopsy between 2015 and 2021. Each center collected data regarding demographic, clinical, histologic, therapeutic, and survival characteristics.RESULTS: A total of 892 patients were enrolled. After the surgery, 12.9% were suprastaged to FIGO2009 stages III-IV and 108 patients (12.1%) had nodal involvement: 54.6% macrometastasis, 22.2% micrometastases, and 23.1% isolated tumor cells (ITC). Sensitivity of SLN biopsy was 93.7% and false negative rate was 6.2%. After a median follow up of 1.81 years, overall surivial and disease-free survival were significantly lower in patients who had macrometastases when compared with patients with negative nodes, micrometastases or ITC.CONCLUSIONS: In our nationwide cohort we obtained high sensitivity of SLN biopsy to detect nodal disease. The oncologic outcomes of patients with negative nodes and low-volume disease were similar after tailoring adjuvant treatments. In total, 22% of patients with macrometastasis and 50% of patients with micrometastasis were at low risk of nodal metastasis according to their preoperative risk factors, revealing the importance of SLN biopsy in the surgical management of patients with early stage EC.

TI  - Can land surface phenology from Sentinel-2 time-series be used as an indicator of Macaronesian ecosystem dynamics?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP), the study of phenological patterns of vegetation using vegetation index (VI) time-series derived from multi-spectral satellite imagery, has helped to improve the understanding of the seasonal dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems from local to global scale. High spatial resolution satellite observations have emerged as a new possibility for monitoring the seasonal dynamics of heterogeneous ecosystems. Under-studied Macaronesian ecosystems have specific characteristics that make LSP estimation a complex task (e. g., frequent cloud cover, frequent presence of atmospheric aerosols, different degrees of vegetation density, diversity of plant species, landscape heterogeneity). Thus, this study aims to analyse the potential of LSP based on Sentinel-2 data to monitor the phenological dynamics of vegetation in the Macaronesian ecosystems of Canary Islands (Spain). NDVI time-series were generated using Sentinel-2 data from January 2018 to December 2021. NDVI time-series were smoothed using double logistic function. Three phenometrics, such as the start of the growing season (SOS), the end of the growing season (EOS) and the length of the growing season (LOS), were extracted using a threshold-based method (20%) only for pixels where the mean NDVI value of the smoothed four-year time-series was higher than 0.2. Growing season of the major of Macaronesian vegetation started between late summer and late autumn (start of the wet season) and ended between early spring and early summer (end of the wet season). The most representative Macaronesian tree species had a clear and marked seasonality, except for the laurel forest species. SOS of Juniperus phoenicea subsp. turbinata was slightly later than for Olea europaea var. sylvestris and Pinus canariensis, while the mean EOS was slightly later for Olea europaea var. sylvestris. The intra-specific variability of SOS and EOS in the laurel forests was very high. LSP derived from Sentinel-2 data contributed to understand the seasonal dynamics of the main Macaronesian ecosystems. However, the heterogeneity of laurel forests made it difficult the LSP estimation in laurel forests. Thus, complementary phenological approaches are suggested to improve the knowledge of the seasonal dynamics of this Macaronesian ecosystem.

TI  - Geostatistical analysis of the relationship among geomorphology, land cover, and AOD at the local scale in a South American desert region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims to assess the particle matter distribution in Tulum Valley, San Juan, Argentina, during 2019, in relation to geomorphology. Random forest supervised classifications were performed to obtain customized annual landform and seasonal land cover maps using Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance (OLI); Sentinel-1 SAR, SRTM digital elevation images, and a set of spectral indices. Geostatistical analyses, including Linear Mixed Models, were performed considering the ln of the mean, the ln of the standard deviation, and the Angstrom Exponent of the MAIAC Aerosol Optical Depth product as response variables, and landforms, landforms + land cover, Land Surface Temperature, and Moisture Stress Index as explanatory variables. The models allowed statistically significant differentiation of the Aerosol Optical Depth means of the landform and landform + land cover classes. The percentage of residual standard error for the means obtained from the model was up to 4.02%. The Angstrom Exponent values below 0.0858, along with the spatial distribution of the three response variables, indicate that the primary aerosol source in the study area is wind-driven soil/sediment erosion, which shows a strong relationship with emission areas. No long-distance transport of aerosols was observed.

TI  - Primary tumor site for localized Merkel cell carcinoma drives different management strategies without impacting oncologic outcomes.
T2  - Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinically localized Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) has been associated with high rates of disease relapse. This study examines how primary tumor anatomic site drives patterns of care and outcomes in a large cohort treated in the contemporary era.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patterns of care and associated outcomes were evaluated for clinically Stage I-II MCC patients treated at our institution with adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) to the primary site and/or regional nodal basin as a component of their curative intent therapy between 2014-2021.RESULTS: Of 80 patients who met inclusion criteria, the primary tumor anatomic site was head and neck (HN) for 42 (53%) and non-head and neck (NHN) for 38 (47%). Primary tumor risk factors were similar between cohorts. Fewer patients with HN tumors had wide local excision (WLE; HN-81% vs. NHN-100% p<0.01). Of those undergoing WLE, patients with HN tumors received higher dose adjuvant RT (>50Gy: HN-70% vs. NHN-8%; p<0.01). Patients with HN tumors were less likely to undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy (HN-62%vs. NHN-100%; p<0.01) and more likely to have elective nodal RT (HN-48% vs. NHN-0%). Despite varying management strategies, there was no significant difference in local recurrence-free survival (3-yr LRFS HN-94% vs. NHN-94%; p=0.97), nodal recurrence-free survival (3-yr NRFS HN-89% vs. NHN-85%; p=0.71) or overall recurrence-free survival (3-yr RFS 73% HN vs. 80% NHN; p=0.44).CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with primary MCC who had RT as a component of their initial treatment strategy, anatomically-driven heterogeneous treatment approaches were associated with equally excellent locoregional disease control.

TI  - Impact of AWiFS derived land use/land cover over the intensely urbanised domain of National Capital Region (NCR) - Delhi in simulating monsoon weather
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-Use/Land-Cover (LULC) plays a crucial role in meteorological models because they determine the crustal properties that interfere with the exchange of energy, momentum, and moisture between the land surface and the atmosphere. The current study integrates a legitimate ground truth LULC based on the Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model framework for simulating short-term monsoon weather over the National Capital Region (NCR Delhi), the biggest urban settlement in the Monsoon Zone. AWiFS provides LULC data at 56 m spatial resolution. The newly implemented AWiFS LULC precisely distinguishes the WRF model default Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) classification and urban representation. Both simulations most well capture the urban meteorological influence over the urban core. However, the AWiFS more accurately depicts NCR urban Land Use (LU), highlighted in the spatial and Probability Density Function (PDF) distributions of various meteorological variables, and captures numerous small-scale suburban settlements outside the central core zone. The impact of the omission of the Noida suburban in MODIS LU is also notable in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Convective parameters and precipitation correlate strongly, and the AWiFS simulation considerably enhanced Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), Convective Inhibition (CIN) and other associated variables. Further, it indicates that a higher magnitude (>200 J kg(-1) in difference) of CAPE is simulated over Faridabad, likely an urban-induced downwind effect due to the accurate representation of the Noida suburban in AWiFS. The study highlights the importance of updated LULC in enhancing model realisation, and AWiFS-based simulation showed improved performance.

TI  - Development of a geographic human heat balance equation to support public health analyses: An Arizona urban sun corridor application
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) estimates often serve as urban heat islands maps and to infer human thermal comfort. Parallel to this, physiological heat balance calculations have been well documented to measure changes in body core temperature and measure risk of heat-related illness. However, there is a need for an improved spatially explicit method to assess human thermal comfort. Using spatial climate data measuring temperature, airflow, and humidity, we developed a geographic body heat storage (BHS) model based on heat exchange and evaporative heat loss from the human body. As proof of concept, we used heat-related illness emergency department visits in two Arizona metropolitan areas to demonstrate that BHS can improve LST's shortcomings, with its increased explanatory power of and linear fit to emergency records. The BHS model can support decision making for public health outcomes as heat risk increases with climate change and urban overheating to more closely approximate the human heat experience. BHS allows can be implemented in different climate regions and with investigations of additional physiological and community variables to better describe risk of heat-related illness.

TI  - Improving crop mapping in Brazil's Cerrado from a data cubes- derived Sentinel-2 temporal analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2/MultiSpectral Instrument (S2/MSI) expands the frequency of satellite observations, which is relevant to elaborate detailed and timely land use and land cover (LULC) classifications. However, storing, managing, and processing big data is costly and challenging, inducing a dimensionality reduction by modeling images as composite products. Contrastingly, it obliterates the temporal resolution improvement. As LULC changes are subtle over time, little is said about how much detail we lost by degrading temporal resolution. Data cube architectures enable storing, accessing, and modeling big data, mitigating losses. Brazil Data Cube (BDC) produces multidimensional data cube collections from different medium-resolution satellite data for Brazil, including S2/MSI. Here, we evaluated three BDC S2/MSI data cubes (two 16-day composites and one unblended, with the MSI original temporal resolution) to map a dynamic-and-representative region in the far-Western Bahia agricultural belt frontier, Cerrado biome, at crop type level. We incorporate spectral indices, ground samples, and crop calendars into a Random Forest-based temporal analysis. Overall accuracies (0.91 and 0.92 for composites, and 0.96 reached for the unblended) highlight the S2/MSI temporal resolution for improving mapping tasks. Given the impact of the cropland frontier expansion over Cerrado in Brazil's commodity production, detecting subtle landscape variations can improve agri-environmental policies.

TI  - Mapping center pivot irrigation systems in global arid regions using instance segmentation and analyzing their spatial relationship with freshwater resources
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensuring freshwater availability and supply sufficient for socio-economic development is important for human health and productivity. Globally, increasing industrial agriculture is driving crop productivity, with increasing surface water and groundwater being withdrawn for irrigation. This study mapped center pivot irrigation systems (CPIS), which are indicators of intensified industrial agriculture and large-scale investment in agriculture, with satellite data using a convolutional neural network in global arid areas. A cascade instance segmentation network was adopted, and both the convolutional block attention module technique and PointRend technique were used to increase the performance of off-the-shelf algorithms. Geospatial analysis methods were used to derive the relationships between CPIS and freshwater resources. Overall there were about 10.26 million hectares (Mha) of irrigated areas equipped with CPIS in global arid areas in 2021, and there were 4.41 Mha of CPISequipped irrigated fields added in the past twenty years at a relative increase of 75% compared with those at the beginning of this century. Although the largest extent of increased CPIS-equipped irrigated fields was in North America, the other five continents had higher relative increases, with Africa having the highest relative growth of 253%. The analysis of spatial relationships between CPIS and freshwater resources indicates that the stress on freshwater resources from industrial agriculture is intensifying in arid areas globally. Overall, the world's arid regions with the highest water stress from CPIS are mostly located in western North America, northern Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula. The results facilitate a better understanding of the current status of freshwater stress and ecosystem sustainability in relation to the development of agricultural intensification in global arid areas. The outcomes support governments to judge better the environmental consequences of agricultural modernization and further help them make balanced agriculture and water management policies.

TI  - Satellite data reveals a recent increase in shifting cultivation and associated carbon emissions in Laos
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although shifting cultivation is the major land use type in Laos, the spatial-temporal patterns and the associated carbon emissions of shifting cultivation in Laos are largely unknown. This study provides a nationwide analysis of the spatial-temporal patterns of shifting cultivation and estimations of the associated carbon emissions in Laos over the last three decades. This study found that shifting cultivation has been expanding and intensifying in Laos, especially in the last 5 years. The newly cultivated land from 2016 to 2020 accounted for 4.5% (+/- 1.2%) of the total land area of Laos. Furthermore, the length of fallow periods has been continuously declining, indicating that shifting cultivation is becoming increasingly intensive. Combining biomass derived from Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation and shifting cultivation maps and area estimates, we found that the net carbon emissions from shifting cultivation declined in 2001-2015 but increased in 2016-2020. The largest carbon source is conversion from intact forests to shifting cultivation, which contributed to 89% of the total emissions from 2001 to 2020. In addition, there were increased emissions from intensified use of fallow lands. This research provides useful information for policymakers in Laos to understand the changes in shifting cultivation and improve land use management. This study not only supports Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation reporting for Laos but also provides a methodology for tracking carbon emissions and removals of shifting cultivation.

TI  - Defining and quantifying histopathologic risk factors for regional and distant metastases in a large cohort of vulvar squamous cell carcinomas.
T2  - Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (vSCC) is a rare tumor with a good prognosis when treated at a localized stage. However, once regional/distant metastasis occurs, vSCC can be rapidly fatal. Thus, it is important to identify tumor prognostic features so that high-risk cases can be prioritized for further diagnostic workup and treatment.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of regional/distant metastasis at presentation and sentinel lymph node status for vSCC based on histopathologic characteristics.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 15,188 adult vSCC cases from the National Cancer Database diagnosed from 2012 to 2019.RESULTS: We provide specific estimates of the risk of clinically positive nodes and metastatic disease at presentation and sentinel lymph node positivity according to tumor size, moderate/poor tumor differentiation, and lymph-vascular invasion. These histopathologic factors were all significantly associated with the tested clinical outcomes in a multivariable analysis. Moderate (hazard ratio, 1.190; P<.001) and poor differentiation (hazard ratio, 1.204; P<.001) and lymph-vascular invasion (hazard ratio, 1.465; P<.001) were also associated with significantly poorer overall survival.LIMITATIONS: Data on disease-specific survival not available in the data set.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the association of the histopathologic characteristics of vSCC with clinicallyimportant outcomes. These data may provide individualized information when discussing diagnostic/treatment recommendations, particularly regarding sentinel lymph node biopsy. These datamayalso guide future staging and risk stratification efforts for vSCC.

TI  - Spectral library of crops and discrimination of major vegetables grown in the eastern Himalayan ecosystem: A proximal hyperspectral remote sensing approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying, characterising and mapping, unique vegetable crops grown on small mixed lands in the eastern Himalayan mountain ecosystem (EHME) using traditional methods is a challenge. The exploration of high-resolution, multispectral optical satellite data for vegetable mapping is hindered by heavy rainfall, clouds, and year-round fog/snow cover. Hyperspectral imaging is restricted in the region that borders several international countries because of security concerns. In the global literature on spectroscopy, information on vegetable crops cultivated in the Himalayan ecosystem is marginal or never covered. Thus, we used a portable Field Spec Handheld2 (ASD) spectroradiometer for spectral characterization of 28 important vegetables, from 10 different families. During the summer and winter seasons of 2020-2022, they were grown without stress and in good health in the experimental field at Umiam, Meghalaya. The ground radiometer was able to achieve a spectral resolution of <3 nm in the 325 to 1075 nm wavelength range. At critical growth stages, data were acquired on cloudless days in 1100 and 1300 nm, with a height of 1 m above the crop and a field of view (FOV) <25. Cropspecific sensitive wavebands were identified and estimated 12 vegetation indices (VI) that relate to biophysical and biochemical properties for crop discrimination. The near infrared region (NIR: 700-1070 nm) was effective for crop discrimination. Of the 10 families, the mean NDVI values varied in the following descending order: Umbelliferae(0.878) > Malvaceae(0.863) > Cucurbitaceae(0.802) > Lamiaceae(0.732) > Solanaceae(0.721) > Leguminosae(0.651) > Cruciferae (0.607) > Amarantha ceae(0.604) > Zingiberaceae(0.595) > Liliaceae(0.531). Among vegetables, the highest NDVI was reported for Fenugreek (0.922) and the lowest for Broccoli (0.421). The position on the red edge (700-750 nm) varied greatly. Similarly, crop families had varying VI values for chlorophyll, carotenoid, xanthophyll and anthocyanin pigments. The ranges of these indices were defined as healthy or stressed crops for the region. From the multi-season spectral signature, a spectral crop library (CSL) for all vegetables was developed under clearly defined conditions (e.g. growth stage, time and year, soil, cultivar type, and climate). The CSL generated from the study provides a reference spectral source for spatial mapping and quantitative spectral modelling to assess crop conditions and prescribe measures. This will be a crucial step in promoting precision agriculture in the eastern Himalayas and other similar ecosystems.

TI  - A double two-sources energy-water balance model for improving evapotranspiration estimates and irrigation management in fruit trees fields
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the use of water in irrigated agriculture is meaningful in a period of increasing water scarcity conditions. A more accurate estimate of evapotranspiration (ET) and its components thus becomes fundamental to better quantify the irrigation water volumes. Many existing models, based on different remote sensing data, provide daily estimates of latent heat flux (LE) from correlation between net radiation and instantaneous estimates of LE, computed as residual component of the energy balance equation or from a correlation of land surface temperature (LST) with vegetation indices., However, they mainly lack of solutions which are continuous in time (e.g. hourly), independent from satellite LST availability and a simultaneous estimation of soil moisture. Addressing this gap, a double two-sources energy-water balance model (FEST-2x2-EWB) is developed based on the decoupling of both water and energy fluxes between the bare soil or grass interrow and the trees rows. This novel parameterization approach enables the differentiation of water uptake from the root zone, which varies between tall trees and grass, considering the dynamics of soil moisture (SM) in the superficial and deep layers. Additionally, it provides partitioned values for transpiration and evaporation. The new model has been evaluated in two irrigated trees fields in the North of Italy, a walnut trees field from 2019 to 2021 and a pear trees field, for the year 2022. Results of the study showcased a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of about 55 W m  2 and a bias of about 40 W m  2 for hourly latent and sensible heat fluxes when compared to the eddy covariance stations located in the fields, while a RMSE of 2 degrees C (bias of 1.5 degrees C) for LST and of 0.04 for SM. The FEST-2x2-EWB model significantly enhances the accuracy of ET simulation in fruits trees areas in respect to the original one source and one-layer version of the same model. Finally, the application of an irrigation optimization strategy with this new model, allowed to demonstrate its potentiality in water saving (about 90 mm in a year) in respect to farmers applied irrigation, and with a difference of about 60 mm between using the double two-sources model and single source one.

TI  - Multi-biomarker approach for the (eco)toxicity of UV-filter environmental pollution on the Mediterranean mussel<i> Mytilus</i><i> galloprovincialis</i> in a multiple stressor context. The case of 4-MBC under salinity shifts.
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine-coastal ecosystems are rapidly transforming because of climate change (CC). At the same time, the im-pacts of emerging organic contaminants (i.e., organic UV-filters) on these ecosystems are intensifying. In the Mediterranean, the consequences of these disturbances are occurring at a fast pace making this area a potential sentinel site to be investigated. While singular effects of organic UV-filters or CC-related factors on marine biota have been relatively described, their combined impact is still largely unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the long-term responses of the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis towards anticipated salinity changes (decreases-S20 or increases-S40) when exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of the UV-filter 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC). An integrated multi-biomarker approach was applied, featuring general and oxidative stress, antioxidant and biotransformation enzyme capacity, energy metabolism, genotoxicity, and neurotoxicity biomarkers. Results showed that both projected salinities, considered separately, exerted non-negligible impacts on mussels' health status, with greater biological impairments found at S 40. Combining both stressors resulted in an evident increase in mussels' susceptibility to the UV-filter, which exacerbated the toxicity of 4-MBC. The dominant influence of salinity in the climate change-contaminant interaction played a crucial role in this outcome. The most severe scenario occurred when S 20 was combined with 4-MBC. In this situation, mussels exhibited a decrease in filtration rate, metabolic capacity and deployment of energy reserves increased, with an upregulation of biotransformation and inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activities. This exposure also led to the observation of cellular and DNA damage, as well as an increase in AChE activity. Furthermore, salinity-dependent bioaccumulation patterns were evaluated revealing that the lowest values in contaminated mussels are found at S 20. Overall, the present findings provide evidence that projected CC/pollutant scenarios may represent high risks for mussels' populations, with global relevant implications for the ecosystem level.

TI  - Remotely sensed imagery and machine learning for mapping of sesame crop in the Brazilian Midwest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The changes in landscapes have been followed more intensely in recent decades thanks to scientific advances, both in the field of technological improvement of satellites and in remote sensing techniques. Advanced and efficient machine learning techniques have helped remote sensing professionals to determine these changes, from the simplest to the most complex landscapes, allowing the identification of the most varied land uses and occupation, as well as the estimation of the areas that these uses occupy, allowing a more dynamic management of natural resources, especially in agricultural exploitation, providing reliable information to decision makers. Thus, the objective of this work is, through machine learning techniques, to estimate the area of sesame (Sesamum indicum) cultivation in the crop season 2021/2022, in the municipality of Canarana, in the state of Mato Grosso, comparing the performance of the Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers, using images from the Landsat 8/OLI satellite. As a source of information for the supervised classification, control points in geographic coordinates were collected in the study area to identify the areas cultivated with sesame. The vegetation indices NDVI, EVI, NDBI, PVI and SAVI were used for the elaboration of thematic maps, along with the Landsat 8/OLI images. Global Accuracy and Kappa index were used as a rule of thumb in the evaluation of the thematic maps, compared by the Z test, with significance at & alpha; = 0.05. The test revealed that the Random Forest classifier showed better performance in identifying the sesame cultivated areas, with Global Accuracy of 0.95 and Kappa of 0.90, when compared to SVM, which showed 0.91 and 0.81, respectively. The use of machine learning techniques in Landsat 8/OLI images proved satisfactory in estimating areas cultivated with sesame in the municipality of Canarana-MT, demonstrating confidence in the mapping. The way Random Forest structures its training model, creating as many decision trees as necessary, ended up mitigating more classification errors , proved to be more promising when compared to SVM. As a rule, both algorithms showed potential for mapping the sesame crop.

TI  - Spectral variables as criteria for selection of soybean genotypes at different vegetative stages
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the association between variables obtained by multispectral imaging, such as plant canopy reflectance at different wavelengths and vegetation indices (VIs), and agronomic traits of interest for soybean is crucial for breeding programs. This approach, associated with the evaluation of the best stage for spectral data collection, can identify easier-to-measure variables to be used in the indirect selection of genotypes for more expensive-to-measure traits or those that are expressed later, resulting in a faster, labor-saving, and large-scale selection process. The hypothesis of this study is the possibility of identifying promising variables for the selection of soybean genotypes through the use of vis and that different times of collection of information regarding reflectance interfere in the selection responses. Thus, our objectives were: i) to estimate heritability (h(2)) for agronomic traits and VIs; ii) to estimate the gains with direct selection (DS) on the VIs and indirect selection (IS) for the agronomic traits selected by the higher heritability; iii) to estimate correlations between spectral variables, VIs, and agronomic traits; iv) to identify the most promising populations for the evaluated variables; and vi) to identify the most adequate phenological stage for spectral data collection. We installed a field experiment in a randomized block design with four repetitions, 28 F-3 soybean populations, and four control treatments. Agronomic traits evaluated were: days to maturity (DM), plant height (PH), first pod insertion height (PIH), number of branches (NB), and grain yield (GY). Spectral collections were performed at the V8 (45 days after emergence), R1 (60 days after emergence) and R5 (80 days after emergence) stages. Correlations between agronomic traits, reflectance at 790 nm (near-infrared), 735 nm (RedEdge), 660 nm (red), 550 nm (green), and 450 nm (blue) wavelengths, and VIs were esti-mated. The heritability were estimated for agronomic traits and VIs. Our findings reveal that it is possible to select soybean genotypes using spectral variables based on heritability and pheno-typic aspects. Enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) have high heritability values (>75%) at V8. It is possible to obtain satisfactory selection gains for agronomic traits, especially GY, based on selection on EVI and SAVI at V8 stage. By this ap-proach, the F-3 segregating populations that provided the highest selection gains were P7, P8, P9, P14, P27, and P28. Spectral data collection at V8 stage provided higher h(2) for VIs and agronomic traits, while R5 is the most suitable stage for estimating associations between VIs and agronomic traits.

TI  - Micrometastases in the sentinel node after neoadjuvant therapy. Is axillary dissection still required?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER PREVENTION
M3  - Review
AB  - The present review intends to discuss the controversies and strengths in clinically node-positive patients with axillary nodal status ypNi+/mi after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Over the past 20 years, a de-escalation approach toward axillary surgery has been observed in patients with breast cancer. The worldwide use of sentinel node biopsy in the upfront setting and after primary systemic therapy substantially reduced surgical complications or late sequelae and eventually improving quality of life of patients. However, the role of axillary dissection is still unclear in patients with low residual disease post-chemotherapy, namely those with micrometastases in the sentinel node, and its prognostic role is still not very clear. The aim of the present narrative review is to report the available evidence on this topic, discussing the pros and cons of performing axillary lymph node dissection in the infrequent finding of micrometastases in the sentinel node after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We will also describe the ongoing prospective studies which are expected to shed light and guide future decisions.

TI  - Mangrove monitoring revealed by MDPrePost-Net using archived Landsat imageries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Acting as a global vital entity in the coastal ecosystem, mangroves are currently facing major threats to destruction due to anthropogenic activities. Restoration and rehabilitation measures of mangroves are being carried out, including in Indonesia. To support conservation actions in many islands in Indonesia, spatio-temporal information on mangroves is required. Remote sensing with advanced techniques such as machine learning and deep learning has proven the capability to spatially observe mangroves. This study aims to monitor mangrove change in three study areas, i.e., South Sumatra, North Kalimantan, and Southeast Sulawesi, using a fully convolutional network (FCN)-based MDPrePost-Net. This method was developed originally to assess the man-grove degradation due to a major event (i.e., Hurricane irma 2017 in southwest Florida), whereas this study adopts it for an extended observation period (1989-2022 for South Sumatra, 1991-2021 for North Kalimantan, and 1990-2021 for Southeast Sulawesi) using medium-resolution Landsat imageries. We observed that the mangroves remain stable within the national parks designated by the government. Outside the national parks, mangrove conversion massively occurred even though the areas are assigned as protection forests. The classification results showed satisfactory accuracy values of more than 84%. The maps produced have an advantage in the spatial change analysis compared to the global datasets such as Global Mangrove Watch version 3.0. Our method has a limitation when cloudless images are not available. The integration with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and a rigorous cloud removal method for the optical images may improve the results of mangrove monitoring.

TI  - Sustainable restoration in sandy lands is challenged by the divergent responses of grassland functional types to disturbance
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effective management of regional grassland degradation requires a deep understanding of how different grassland types respond to climate change and human disturbance over different spatial and temporal scales. This study examined the dynamics and underlying driving mechanisms of various grassland types in the Otindag Sandy Land over 36 years (1986-2021) by integrating time-series Landsat images and extensive climate and socio-environmental data. We found that the dynamics and driving factors of different grassland types varied significantly. In low-cover grasslands, the area of desert grassland fluctuated with a decreasing trend after the breakpoint, while that of sandy grassland increased continuously without any breakpoints. In high-cover grasslands, the area of typical grassland only increased after the breakpoint, whereas that of temperate savanna grasslands first decreased and then increased insignificantly. Additionally, the desert grassland area was significantly negatively correlated with annual precipitation (AP), whereas the sandy grassland area was negatively correlated with annual mean wind speed (AMWS). The dynamics of typical grasslands were jointly influenced by climate and human factors, with temperate savannas mainly driven by the AP and AMWS. Moreover, high-cover grasslands were more sensitive to human activities than low-cover grasslands, and the most significant driving factors changed before and after the breakpoint in the area dynamics. These findings provide valuable insights into the monitoring and conservation of sandy land ecosystems.

TI  - Estimation of global ocean surface winds blending reanalysis, satellite and buoy datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Data derived from reanalysis projects and satellites are often used to increase the ocean surface wind data's spatiotemporal resolution available at buoy stations. All available datasets present variable accuracies and different performances on wind estimations due to: (i) the proximity to the coast; (ii) the wind strength; (iii) the geographical location; and (iv) the assumption of near -neutral atmospheric stability. An assessment of the effect of these aspects on estimating winds was carried out. To partly reduce the observed inaccuracies, a methodology is proposed to correct available spatiotemporal gridded datasets of ocean surface winds. It resulted in a hybrid model blending reanalysis and satellite, as usual, but additionally enriched with information from buoy measurements. This model shows potential to correct reanalysis datasets even for cases when re-analysis outperforms satellite wind accuracy. This model led to accuracy improvements ranging from 9% to 161% compared with wind estimations from newer and older generations of reanaly-sis models. The blended model was calibrated and validated between 2011 and 2016 using obser-vations at 155 ocean-moored buoys located in 6 oceanic regions. The estimated wind fields pre-sented the highest accuracy for mid-to-high winds (5-20 m/s) with an overall Mean Absolute Er-ror (MAE) of 0.96 m/s and 11.6 & DEG; for wind speed and wind direction, respectively.

TI  - Impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on forest vegetation cover, health, and diversity within Doma forest reserve, Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest encroachment is a common practice that has led to the destruction of canopy trees in the Guinea savanna part of Nigeria. This study investigated the influence of human activities on vegetation health and species composition of Doma forest reserve located in Nasarawa State, Nigeria. Landsat satellite data from 1986 to 2021 were utilized to assess forest cover change, land surface temperature (LST), and vegetation indices (VIs). The results show that dense woodland vegetation in the Doma forest reserve depreciated between 1991 and 1999 by 17.82% before increasing by 7.37% between 1999 and 2021. Similarly, vegetation greenness (measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (GCVI), and leaf area index (LAI)) of the forest mirrored the changes observed in the forest cover. The LST extracted for each year was correlated with all VIs, and an inverse relationship was observed in all relationships analyzed. The decline in greenness between 1999 and 2011 was attributed to increasing lumbering, bush burning, and sand dredging activities. Results also showed the current diversity state (H1 = 0.23), evenness (0.63), and the volume of tree (1.31 m3) species in the heart of the Doma forest reserve. However, a high (25%) native tree species in the Fabaceae family correlated with a dramatic increase in the VIs and an increase in dense woodland cover indicating the importance of Fabaceae in forest ecosystem regeneration.

TI  - Spatial mapping of hydrologic soil groups using machine learning in the Mediterranean region
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil and water conservation is one of the major tasks of hydrologic soil groups (HSGs), which play an increasing role in the hydrological process. This research attempts to produce maps of soil classification into four hydrologic groups in the Upper Oum Er-Rbia basin (Morocco), which has many environmental risks due to specific climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities. The study was based on soil physical parameters (texture, organic matter, and bulk density) identified by extensive field surveys and remote sensing data (Digital Elevation Model, Landsat-9, European Reanalysis-5, and Soil Moisture Active Passive). The soil category mapping was prepared using four machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), Knearest neighbor (K-NN), and nave Bayes (NB). From 202 hydrologic soil groups, inventory locations were constructed and then randomly divided into a ratio of 70/30% for the training and validating models. Twentynine causative factors and indices were prepared and subdivided into four dataset types: whole variables (A), important variables (B), noncollinear variables (C), and HSG-specific variables (D) for HSG classification. The ML models' performance and robustness were evaluated using six accuracy metrics: Overall Accuracy (OA), Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Kappa coefficient, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) value. The experimental results revealed that the performance of models varies according to the datasets used. Based on the AUC results, all models performed comparably well, with very high accuracies. However, RF had a better classification performance (OA = 0.788), followed by NB (OA = 0.757), SVM, and K-NN (OA = 0.742), especially when using datasets related to HSGs. In addition, according to maps, HSG D had the highest rate and dominated the study area. However, saturated hydraulic conductivity is the main contributor to modeling HSG. Hence, the developed approach and maps produced from this study provide a new contextual planning tool for decision-makers to devise adaptation strategies to avoid environmental risks and conserve soil water resources.

TI  - Virtual reality-based training and pre-operative planning for head and neck sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is crucial for managing head and neck skin cancer. However, variable lymphatic drainage can complicate SLN detection when using Single-Photon Emission Computed To-mography (SPECT) or lymphoscintigraphy. Virtual Reality (VR) can contribute to pre-operative planning by simulating a realistic 3D model, which improves orientation. VR can also facilitate real-patient training outside the operating room. This study explored using a VR platform for pre-operative planning in head and neck skin cancer patients undergoing SLNBs and assessed its value for residential training.Materials and methods: In this prospective technology pilot study, attending surgeons and residents who per -formed 21 SLNB operations on patients with head and neck skin cancers (81% males, mean age 69.2 & PLUSMN; 11.3) used a VR simulation model based on each patient's pre-operative SPECT scan to examine patient-specific anatomy. After surgery, they completed a questionnaire on the efficiency of the VR simulation as a pre -operative planning tool and training device for residents.Results: The attending surgeons rated the VR model's accuracy at 8.3 & PLUSMN; 1.6 out of 10. Three-quarters (76%) of residents reported increased confidence after using VR. The physicians rated the platform's contribution to residents' training at 7.4 & PLUSMN; 2.1 to 8.9 & PLUSMN; 1.3 out of 10.Conclusion: A VR SLNB simulation can accurately portray marked sentinel lymph nodes. It was rated high as a surgical planning and teaching tool among attending surgeons and residents alike and may play a role in pre -operative planning and resident training. Further studies are needed to explore its applications in practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To improve patient selection for sentinel node (SN) biopsy, the Melanoma Institute of Australia (MIA) created a predictive model based on readily available clinicopathologic factors.OBJECTIVES: Validation of the MIA nomogram using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), a nationwide oncology outcomes database for >1500 Commission-accredited cancer programs in the United States.METHODS: A total of 60,165 patients were included in the validation. The probability of SN positivity was calculated for each patient. Using calculated probabilities, a receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to assess the model's discrimination ability.RESULTS: At baseline, the NCDB cohort had different clinicopathologic characteristics compared with the original MIA data set. Despite these differences, the MIA nomogram retained high-predictive accuracy within the NCDB dataset (C-statistic, 0.733 [95% CI, 0.726-0.739]), although calibration weakened for the highest risk decile.LIMITATIONS: The NCDB collects data from hospital registries accredited by the Commission on Cancer.CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study validated the use of the MIA nomogram in a nationwide oncology outcomes database collected from >1500 Commission-accredited cancer programs in the United States, demonstrating the potential for this nomogram to predict SN positivity and reduce the number of negative SN biopsies.

TI  - Evaluating Direct Assimilation of Satellite-Based Potential Evapotranspiration into SWAT for Improving Hydrological Modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A correct estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is required to determine the amount of available water in any watershed. Potential evapotranspiration (PET) is used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (AET). The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has different methods to compute PET; in data-scarce watersheds hydrological modeling is typically challenging. Although there are a lot of remotely sensed PET (RS-PET) data, validation of hydrological models using these data has rarely been studied in such watersheds. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to assess the impacts of direct assimilation of RS-PET on water balance components using SWAT for a basin in Iran with limited data. To this end, we changed the SWAT source code to automatically integrate RS-PET data. The performance of the model was then evaluated using streamflow data and AET for the period 2001-2005. The results reveal that the Default PET model overestimates soil moisture, underestimates AET, and ultimately fails to appropriately capture streamflow at the watershed's outlet. However, by incorporating RS-PET, the model improves the accuracy of PET, AET, soil moisture, and streamflow. For example, in the Default PET scenario, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency streamflow was 0.66, whereas it was 15% higher in the RS-PET scheme. The findings also demonstrate the SWAT parameters' sensitivity to PET values and the efficiency of RS-PET in enhancing hydrologic modeling in regions with limited data.

TI  - Rate of decline of fetal base excess after neuraxial anesthesia for scheduled cesarean delivery.
T2  - AJOG global reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: In scheduled cesarean deliveries, the rate of decrease in the umbilical artery pH is related to the severity of maternal hypotension and the interval from spinal placement to delivery. Base excess values have greater use than umbilical artery pH values to time the duration of fetal acidemia because they demonstrate a linear rather than logarithmic correlation with the degree of acidosis.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the rate of decline in the fetal base excess in scheduled cesarean deliveries that were converted to emergency cesarean delivery owing to fetal bradycardia following spinal anesthesia.STUDY DESIGN: All cases of scheduled cesarean deliveries in gestations at >34 weeks' gestation under spinal anesthesia that were converted to emergency cesarean deliveries owing to fetal bradycardia in the period May 2019 to May 2021 were reviewed. Included were those with (1) a preoperative reactive nonstress test and (2) fetal acidemia (umbilical artery pH <7.20). Excluded were those with anesthesia other than spinal and a birthweight below the 10th percentile for gestational age. Time intervals between the completion of spinal anesthesia and delivery were calculated and related to umbilical cord gas analytes.RESULTS: From a cohort of 1064 scheduled cesarean deliveries, 7 fulfilled the study criteria yielding 8 neonates. Mean ± standard error of the mean interval of spinal anesthesia to delivery was 15.0±1.9 minutes, and the decrease in mean blood pressure after spinal anesthesia was 39.1±3.0 mm Hg. Umbilical artery base excess ranged from -5.2 to -16.6 mmol/L (median, -8.0). Based on published normative data of prelabor fetal umbilical artery base excess (-2±0.6 mmol/L), the mean rate of base excess decrease was 0.38±0.25 mmol/minute.CONCLUSION: The rate of decrease in base excess when scheduled cesarean deliveries are converted to emergency cesarean deliveries owing to fetal bradycardia related to spinal anesthesia (1 mmol/2.6 min) matches the estimated rate of loss of base excess (1 mmol/2-3 minutes) reported in cases of severe bradycardia or sentinel events during labor.

TI  - An in-situ defect detection method for aluminum alloy bobbin tool friction stir welding assisted by lateral force
T2  - MATERIALS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a force-driven method for in-situ defect detection in aluminum alloy bobbin tool friction stir welding (BTFSW). The variations of the three component forces in BTFSW, including traverse force (Fx), lateral force (Fy) and plunge force (Fz) are studied. The mean value of Fy exhibits the highest correlation with tunnel defects. Numerical simulation results show that higher stress on the retreating side due to insufficient material flow and severe material jam results in an abnormal increase of Fy for defective joints, revealing the response mechanism of Fy to tunnel defects. The proposed method offers a promising approach for real-time detecting tunnel defects in aluminum alloy BTFSW.

TI  - Understanding carbon sequestration trends using model and satellite data under different ecosystems in India
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study discusses carbon sequestration variability in different ecosystems of India. Four different biosphere regions, each over 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees area, have been selected considering the geospatial and climatic variability of these regions expanding from Central India (CI), the Northeast region (NER), the Western Ghats (WG), and the Western Himalayan region (WHNI). The climatic conditions of these four regions are different so are the biosphere constituents of these regions. We expect the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) to enhance during the all India summer monsoon rainfall season but in varied magnitudes suggesting a role of climatic parameters and flora in these regions. The GPP from FLUXCOM for the duration of 2001 to 2019 (19 years) and satellite-derived vegetation indices like the Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) are used in this study to understand the response of regional vegetation to this variability. EVI seems to be better related to GPP in comparison to NDVI in the preliminary analysis. Further analysis suggests LAI correlates better to GPP than EVI and NDVI in different seasons in these four regions. Also, meteorological parameters like surface temperature, rainfall, soil water, and other derived parameters like Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) are studied. It is also observed that the year-to-year variability in the climatic conditions could also have a role to play in the observed features. It is proven that the climate around the world is experiencing changes. Vegetation is one of the potent markers to monitor the impact of climate change. These long-term data and trends were studied to understand if there is any significant impact of the changing climatic conditions on the vegetation in these regions. Our study shows that there is an increasing (positive) trend in GPP at these locations though at different rates. WG and WHNI have shown a significant high rate of increase (6.44 and 5.36 gCm-2 y-1 , respectively) in GPP over the last two decades.

TI  - Potential risks of soil erosion in North-Central Vietnam using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Unsustainable exploitation activities (UEAs), combined with the increasing impacts of global climate change are the key causes that lead to soil erosion in the North-Central Vietnam. Mountainous areas in the North-Central Vietnam commonly have steep slopes and sandy clay in the surface soil layer, which contribute to enhancing the soil erosion, resulting in a serious loss of life and property. This study investigates the land cover change (LCC) across the Thanh Chuong district by combining Remote Sensing Technique (RST) data with Geographic Information System (GIS) and further, establishing erosion risk hazard maps based on the RUSLE model simulation. To achieve these objectives, Sentinel and Landsat satellite images from the period 2010_2021 were acquired. It was verified that the forest area gradually decreased from 2010_2021, and the average annual soil loss was approximately 25 t per year. The amount of erosion that led to a soil loss of up to 18% of the total land area is related to weather conditions, terrain features, and the soil texture. The decline in the vegetation cover is expected to be the main cause of increasing trends in erosion and soil loss.

TI  - Impacts of meteorological variables and machine learning algorithms on rice yield prediction in Korea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As crop productivity is greatly influenced by weather conditions, many attempts have been made to estimate crop yields using meteorological data and have achieved great progress with the development of machine learning. However, most yield prediction models are developed based on observational data, and the utilization of climate model output in yield prediction has been addressed in very few studies. In this study, we estimate rice yields in South Korea using the meteorological variables provided by ERA5 reanalysis data (ERA-O) and its dynamically downscaled data (ERA-DS). After ERA-O and ERA-DS are validated against observations (OBS), two different machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are trained with different combinations of eight meteorological variables (mean temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, diurnal temperature range, solar irradiance, mean wind speed, and relative humidity) obtained from OBS, ERA-O, and ERA-DS at weekly and monthly timescales from May to September. Regardless of the model type and the source of the input data, training a model with weekly datasets leads to better yield estimates compared to monthly datasets. LSTM generally outperforms SVM, especially when the model is trained with ERA-DS data at a weekly timescale. The best yield estimates are produced by the LSTM model trained with all eight variables at a weekly timescale. Altogether this study shows the significance of high spatial and temporal resolution of input meteorological data in yield prediction, which can also serve to substantiate the added value of dynamical downscaling.

TI  - The simulation of urban development with the consideration of ground deformation threats in Sidoarjo Regency, East Java Province of Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sidoarjo plays a role as buffer zone for the expanding urban growth of Surabaya City, which results in the rapid development of built areas. After the Lapindo mudflow in 2006, subsidence occurred in the surrounding area of Porong District. Land subsidence is a slow-onset disaster that impact people's lives due to vertical displacement. Urban development in areas that are geologically prone to subsidence may have long-term impacts, both on settlements and infrastructure. Therefore, it is necessary to acknowledge its ground deformation trait and how it interacts with urban spatial development. The characteristics of ground deformation were identified utilizing Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) processing with Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method which resulted in 10 levels of ground deformations. The map of ground deformation level was overlaid with the map of future land use of 2041 which was generated from Cellular Automata (CA) based land use simulation. Areas with alarming ground deformation level, that are "at-risk", are found around the Lapindo area, and extends to Sidoarjo's north side. Meanwhile, the built area is estimated to grow around the major roads, in the central side from north to south, and in the middle-south part of Sidoarjo. The interaction between urban development and ground deformation provides an overview of areas that may encounter ground deformation threats, such as land subsidence and uplift movement, in the future. The results of this study can be used for spatial planning decisions with consideration of ground deformation threats by directing urban development to the "safe" areas.

TI  - Evaluating geomorphological changes and coastal flood vulnerability of the Nijhum Dwip Island using remote sensing techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research critically assesses the spatiotemporal changes in morphology of the Nijhum Dwip Island caused by the dynamic wave action of the Bay of Bengal. Using image analysis techniques on Landsat Satellite Data (ETM+, OLI), the nature of shoreline alterations, erosion-accretion, and lob shifting from 2003 to 2021 has been identified. The findings reveal that since 2013, the island's morphology and geographical extent have undergone considerable changes, and it has gradually reached its current stable state in the Bay of Bengal. The fluvial sediments brought by the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river system influenced by tide is mainly responsible for the sedimentary accretion in and around the island. Due to the complex wave action, the island has experienced alternating erosion and accretion domination scenarios. Compared with its extent in 2003, up until 2021, it has lost approximately 2.57 km2 area, erosion and accretion mostly occurring in the southern part, geometrically transforming the island from a rectangular to a subrounded shape. The depocenter shifting of the island was predominantly in the south-eastern direction during the whole period but has shifted to reverse direction in 2021. The minimum and maximum lob shifting occurred in 2006 and 2015, respectively, at approximately 600 m and 1800 m. ALOS PALSAR DEM (12.5m) in combination with secondary data from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department has been used to develop and simulate flood inundation scenarios under different surge heights. The projections illustrate that in the case of 2 m, 3 m, and 4 m surge heights, approximately 46.45%, 56.51%, and 61.42% of the total land will go underwater, respectively. In all scenarios, cropland and bare ground are the most affected classes.

TI  - Application of a regional climate model on autumn dust events over the Urmia Basin
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust events have occurred over the Urmia Lake Basin in northwestern Iran for many years. In this study, we identified the mechanism and source of dust events in the region and assessed the ability of the Regional Climate Model (RegCM) to simulate these events. The observation data includes horizontal visibility and present weather phenomena achieved in Tabriz, Urmia, and Saqez stations. The ERA5, MERRA-2, and CAMS data were prepared for this research. The long-term dusty day analysis was conducted from 2000 to 2019. The synoptic-dynamic analysis and RegCM simulations were done during dust events on 28-31 October 2017-the HYSPLIT model and MODIS image usage to consider more detail. The results show that the Urmia Basin experiences two peaks, dusty days in the May and autumn months, including September and October. The persistent and widespread dust event in Urmia resulted from the approaching trough at 500 hPa to the north of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, trigged low pressure and increasing wind speed over the area. Based on the synoptic-dynamic analysis, MODIS satellite images, and the outputs of HYSPLIT, Iraq deserts were the primary source of dust on 28-31 October 2017. The dust distribution in the RegCM model, MERRA-2 data, and MODIS image agree. The RegCM aerosol optical depth (AOD) output time series agreed with MERRA-2 data, with a correlation coefficient of 0.84 and an index of agreement (IOA) of 0.56 in Urmia stations. The local dust source detected by the surface emission flux in the eastern Lake Urmia close to Tabriz can be a reason for the dustiest day in Tabriz. The AOD diurnal variation obtained from RegCM, MERRA-2, and CAM are similar in Tabriz and Urmia. The AOD of RegCM is underestimated compared to MERRA-2 and CAM in three selected stations.

TI  - Flaring volumes in the intermountain west region: A geospatial analysis of satellite and operator-reported data with viable mitigation strategies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Burning associated gas has been a prevailing problem across the world for decades. This practice consumes billions of (US) dollars' worth of valuable natural gas, contributes billions of metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere, and releases volatile chemicals to nearby communities. To assess the prevalence of wellbore flaring within the Intermountain West (I-West) region, we analyzed data from the Nightfire project and contrasted it with wellbore surface hole locations. Consequently, we will permit the analysis of the flare data on a geospatial scale and compare it with operator self-reported flaring volumes. Through this analysis, we found that New Mexico is by far the largest flaring state in the I-West region, with most of its flare gas coming from the Permian Basin. Additionally, we found that satellite data estimated volumes that were 165% larger than those self-reported by the operators. Although some of this could be an overestimation from the Nightfire project, the size of the discrepancy indicates that there may be an underestimation of flared volumes that operators report to the state. A better understanding of the discrepancy source can be identified by linking the satellite flare volume to individual wells and operators, and potential solutions may be implemented to assist New Mexico's recent waste laws in reducing Permian flared volumes. We also proposed economic solutions that could substantially reduce the flared volume through flare gas utilization through on-site processing, the construction of small spur lines, and the development of a local sink for methane.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a comprehensive methodological framework and application designed to enhance the processing capabilities of SAR imagery. Our approach utilizes cloud computing and deep learning techniques for the search, detection, and monitoring of hydrocarbon slicks on the ocean surface originating from subsea oil and gas sources. Our methodology, which specifically focuses on identifying and monitoring natural methane seeps, is based on an efficient semi-automatic approach and multi-temporal analysis. It has been tested in 6 locations of known floating oil slicks by natural methane seeps activity and two oil spills around the globe. Leveraging the capabilities of Google Earth Engine, our application allowed us to synergize the advantages and coverage of free Sentinel 2 imagery, the parallel processing power of GEE cloud, and the accuracy of deep learning algorithms to develop models for slick behavior under diverse climatic and hydrodynamic conditions. Our results may be useful to the hydrocarbon industry by reducing exploration and processing costs of remote prospecting data and deriving accurate and indirect estimates of the deposits.

TI  - Newly discovered shallow creep along the Gozha Co fault in northwestern Tibet: Spatial extent, rate and temporal evolution
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Whereas most continental faults are interseismically locked, some exceptions have been observed to exhibit aseismic slip over a range of depths in the Earth's upper crust, i.e. shallow creep. This unusual slip behaviour helps probe frictional properties of natural faults. Here, we investigate the kinematic features of a newly discovered shallow creeping fault, the Gozha Co fault in northwestern Tibet, using Sentinel-1 radar interferometry. High-resolution velocities derived from 4 tracks of Sentinel-1 data reveal a 120-km-long creeping section on the Gozha Co fault, with a mean surface fault-parallel rate of -3 mm/yr. We use a simple elastic dislocation model to invert for the rate and depth extent of creep. Results show that creep occurs at all depths in the crust at the tectonic loading rate, -5 mm/yr, indicating that the discovered shallow creep is steady-state in response to continued tectonic loading, which is supported by the analysis of surface creep time-series that yields a time-independent creep rate. The Sentinel-1 velocities also show that the Longmu Co fault, part of the commonly called Longmu-Gozha Co fault system, has no measurable motion, and therefore may be inactive. Present-day deformation within the Tianshuihai Terrane, 3.8 +/- 0.8 mm/yr E-W shear and 0.6 +/- 0.6 mm/yr N-S shortening as the GPS velocities show, is in fact accommodated by motion on the Gozha Co fault.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The role of species composition in montane reforested areas to offset carbon emissions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural reforestation may represent an opportunity for ecosystem restoration but is highly depen-dent on the socioeconomic context, which may modify succession rates and forest species compo-sition. Plant species dominance determines the functioning of the forests and their capacity to off-set Carbon emissions, however, few studies have discriminated the role of species composition and assessed their quantitative balance compared with regional emissions. Here, we quantify the contribution of forests dominated by different plant species to Carbon stocks and sequestration in a northwestern Argentina watershed. We integrate field and remote sensing data for the last three decades to estimate Carbon stock and sequestration in native and non-native forests compared with governmental emission estimates. We found that a 9% gain in forest area contributed to a 5% increase in aboveground C stocks and forests dominated by non-native species (Ligustrum lu-cidum) showed a significant capacity to store C compared to native ones; but the contribution of new forests to Carbon sequestration was far outweighed by local anthropogenic emissions.

TI  - Winter wheat yield prediction in the conterminous United States using solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence data and XGBoost and random forest algorithm
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting crop yield before harvest and understanding the factors determining yield at a regional scale is vital for global food security, supply chain management in agribusiness, crop and insurance pricing and optimising crop production. Often satellite remote sensing data, environmental data or their combinations are used to model crop yield at a regional scale. However, their contribution, including that of recently developed remote sensing data like solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), are not explored sufficiently. This study aims to assess the contribution of weather, soil and remote sensing data to estimate wheat yield prediction at a regional scale. For this, we employed four types of remote sensing data, thirteen climatic variables, four soil variables, and nationwide yield data of 14 years combined with statistical learning methods to predict winter wheat yield in the Conterminous United States (CONUS) and access the role of predicting variables. Machine-learning algorithms were used to build yield prediction models in different experimental settings, and predictive performance was evaluated. Further, the relative importance of predictor variables for the models was assessed to gain insight into the model's behaviour. NIRv and SIF data are found to be promising for crop yield prediction. The model with only NIRv data explained up to 64% of the variability in yield, and adding SIF data improved it to 69%. We also found that vegetation indices, SIF, climate and soil data all contribute unique and overlapping information to crop yield prediction. The study also identified important variables and the time of the growing period when these variables have higher explanatory power for winter wheat yield prediction. This study enhanced our knowledge of yield-predicting variables, which will contribute to optimising the yield and developing better yield prediction models.

TI  - Spatial-temporal mapping of forest vegetation cover changes along highways in Brunei using deep learning techniques and Sentinel-2 images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Infrastructure development is a leading driver of forest cover loss in the tropics, resulting in a significant decrease in biodiversity. With recent advancements in digital image processing and satellite imagery techniques, this study presents an approach for tracking forest cover alterations along a recently constructed highway in Brunei. Specifically, this paper harnesses the power of cutting-edge deep learning (DL) models; U-Net and Deeplabv3+, to classify forest and non-forest features from Sentinel-2 satellite images captured along the Telisai-Lumut highway between 2018 and 2022. A computational performance analysis and network comparison revealed that the Deeplabv3+ had a remarkable semantic segmentation performance, with a mean intersection over union of 0.9247, followed by an ensemble of four networks, with a mean intersection over union of 0.9171. The best model consistently outperformed other models in segmenting forest and non-forest features, with an intersection over union (IOU) of 0.9463 and 0.9031, respectively. Moreover, deploying hyperparameter optimization allowed us to assess the model's sensitivity to different hyperparameters for better results. Furthermore, forest change statistics were computed using the best model's generated forest change maps, and the results indicated a 16.7% gain in the overall forest vegetation cover along the highway, demonstrating the validity of the results. These reproducible findings will provide forest managers and ecologists with near real-time information on the status, health, and extent of forest ecosystems. This study's results have critical implications for using DL to monitor forest cover changes and will be of great interest to the scientific community as they open new avenues for future research and underline the need for continued innovation in this important field.

TI  - Exploring the landscape scale influences of tree cover on crop yield in an agroforestry parkland using satellite data and spatial statistics
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees in agroforestry parklands influence crops both through competitive and facilitative mechanism, but the effects are challenging to disentangle due to the complexity of the system with high variability in tree cover structure and species diversity and crop combinations. Focusing on a landscape in central Burkina Faso dominated by Vitellaria paradoxa and Parkia biglobosa, this paper examines how tree cover influences crop yield at landscape scale using satellite data and spatial statistics. Our analysis is based on data from 2017 to 2018 with differences in rainfall to assess the stability in identified relationships. Our findings showed that tree canopy cover and tree density inside the fields tended to decrease crop yield because of competition, but also that these variables when considering the surrounding landscape exerted an opposite effect because of their buffering effects. The explanatory variables representing soil properties did have limited effects on crop yield in this study. These patterns were consistent during the two years of monitoring. Overall, our results suggest that farmers in this area might manage the tree cover in a way that optimizes sustainable yields as canopy cover and tree density in most parklands is below the limits identified here where competition outweight the facilitative effects.

TI  - Incorporation of neighborhood information improves performance of SDB models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of water depth in nearshore waters is important for safe navigation and other human uses of coastal areas. Optical satellite imagery offers a cost-efficient source of data for this pur-pose. Several methods have been developed for satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB), but the de-tails of their implementation, as well as their relative performance and its dependence on the data and environmental context, is unclear. We compared five SDB models, calibrated and tested against airborne lidar data from southern Corsica. We used a blocked strategy to split data into calibration, validation, and test data, because randomly splitting the data resulted in spatial auto -correlation between these data sets and underestimation of model prediction errors. In general, the non-parametric random forest and neural network models outperformed the parametric multi-band and band-ratio models. The convolutional neural network (CNN) model performed the best, especially in relatively deep (10-20 m) areas, and it could be near-optimally tuned with only & SIM;1000 data points. However, developing this CNN model was an iterative trial-and-error process that took several months. Using the random forest model, we demonstrated that using in-formation from more than two bands in the visible and near-infrared spectrum contributed to im-proving model performance, as did incorporation of information from the local neighborhood. We suggest that the use of more than two bands, and the inclusion of spatial contextual informa-tion in addition to the values of the individual pixel, should become standard practice in SDB.

TI  - Analysis of the spatial and temporal patterns in land use land cover in Belize city from 1991 to 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban theorists and planning researchers ignore small cities with ports. Rectifying this neglect, we focus on Belize City. We assess the spatial and temporal patterns of land use and cover changes, utilizing remote sensing analysis and multiyear Landsat satellite images. Focusing on the contemporary period (1991-present), we analyze the impacts of the rapid development of the Port of Belize and its consequent effect on the expansion of the urban built environment of Belize City. In addition to analyzing land use land cover changes, we calculated key indices such as NDVI, NDBI, and LST in Belize City. Importantly, local-level clustering of differences in NDBI and NDVI values is analyzed using LISA analysis. Our results show that the urbanized area has increased in the past 30 years, with corresponding reductions in the area under forest and water. Our analyses reveal three distinctive periods of urban changes: 1991-2001, 2001-2011, and 2011-2021. From 1991 to 2001 most of the urban expansion occurred along the Belize River. Significant urban expansion from 2001 to 2011 is related to a private company managing and developing the port, accelerating construction around the port. Finally, from 2011 to 2021, the process of urban sprawl slowed, with only sporadic new construction in the suburbs, due to the master planning at the port. Nevertheless, masterplan implementation delays, numerous appeals, and weak enforcement of regulations have not curbed unplanned urbanization.

AB  - The large surface area and porous structure of MOF materials could provide binding sites for fluorescent moieties for bioimaging. Herein, we reported the preparation of fluorescent MOF material Zn(BDC) by 8-hydroquinoline modification [Zn(BDC)-8HQ]. Zn(BDC)-8HQ emitted strong fluorescence at 507 nm. The fluorescent Zn(BDC)8HQ had a hydrodynamic radius of 255 nm, suitable for lymph node tracing. After subcutaneous injection, a bright spot could be distinguished at the injection site. The injections to front extremities resulted in sentinel lymph node accumulations. The low toxicity of Zn(BDC)-8HQ was evidenced by serum biochemical index and histopathological observations.

TI  - Ensemble-based assimilation of wave model predictions: Contrasting the impact of assimilation in nearshore and offshore forecasting at different distances from assimilated data
T2  - APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate wave predictions are crucial for many marine-related activities, including offshore operations, navigation, and marine renewable energy. To improve the forecast performance, this study presents a data assimilation system that utilizes the WAVEWATCH III wave model and the local Ensemble Optimal Interpolation scheme to assimilate significant wave heights data from HY-2B altimeter in the China Seas. The effects of assimilation are analyzed in both coastal and offshore regions at different distances from assimilated satellite data points during a forecast period. The results show that systematic bias in wave forecasting for both offshore and nearshore locations can be effectively reduced through the use of data assimilation, with localization employed to minimize the influence of random errors. Nearshore forecasting benefits from assimilation to a greater extent than offshore forecasting, with a more enduring improvement observed. Additionally, the decline in forecast improvement with increasing distance from assimilated data highlights the necessity of assimilating a greater quantity of observational satellite data. Furthermore, careful consideration should be given to the size of the ensemble when using a specific localization radius, as the improvement in skill may stagnate with larger ensembles. Finally, assimilating additional nearshore satellite data does not negatively impact the predictive precision.

TI  - Heterogeneity, marginality, stagementation and driving forces in the Otindag Sandy Land and its ecotones based on GIMMS NDVI3g v1.0
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to differences in spatial and temporal scales and perspectives, there are academic debates about the un-derstanding of the ecological evolution in Otindag Sandy Land. How vegetation in the sandy hinterland and marginal intersects interacts with the regional climate system and how it responds to human activities remain to be addressed. The motivation for this study is to try to clarify the abovementioned geographical mis-understandings. By setting up a core area (CA), a check area (CK) and four ecotones, various datasets such as the remote sensing vegetation index products GIMMS NDVI3g v1.0 (1982-2015), meteorological data (1982-2015), night-time lighting data (1984-2020), population data (1986-2016) and livestock data (1986-2016) were adopted; and maximum value composite (MVC), average value composites (AVC), linear regression analysis (& theta;slope), phenology analysis (SOS, LOS, and EOS), coefficient of variation (Cov) analysis.and Hurst index (H) prediction were performed; and partial data consistency was validated by MODIS NDVI (2000-2015) dataset. The study found that: (1) vegetation coverage had spatial heterogeneity; (2) vegetation phenology exhibited a spatial differentiation; (3) vegetation growth rate had spatial differences; (4) vegetation response to climate change was regional and significant; (5) the coefficient of variation (Cov) of vegetation was segmental and regional; and(6) the response of vegetation to human activities was not significant. The results demonstrate that the NDVI development in the Otindag Sandy Land and its ecoregions is spatially heterogeneous, regional, marginal and temporally segmental and is more sensitive to climate change than to human activities.

TI  - Eyes from the sky: Application of satellite-based indices to assess vegetation casualty on Grand Bahama Island one year post-Hurricane Dorian
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last two decades, major hurricanes have devastated the forest landscape of Grand Bahama. To capture the extent of the pine forest loss on Grand Bahama, we used satellite-based indices (NDVI, NDMI, and NBR) from Landsat and Sentinel-2 images and the support vector machine algorithm to estimate vegetation casualty pre-and post-Hurricane Dorian. We estimated that from 2004 to 2020, Grand Bahama lost 90.9% and 58.6% of its pine and mangrove forests, respectively. In the 15 years before Hurricane Dorian (2004-2019), stressors that included three major hurricanes (Hurricane Jeanne, Frances, and Wilma) resulted in a 44.5% (246.0 km2) loss of the pine forest vegetation on the island. Later, Hurricane Dorian, a Category 5 tropical cyclone, made landfall in Grand Bahama in 2019 and resulted in further loss of pine vegetation (46.3% of the original vegetation [256.1 km2]) and more than half of the mangrove forests after flooding 67.0% (919.3 km2) of the island. Although mean NDVI and NDMI began to exhibit pre-hurricane seasonal patterns half a year after Hurricane Dorian struck, their values remained abated one year following the storm. To account for the effects of seasonal fires, we evaluated pine vegetation for evidence of forest fires during the dry and wet cycles of the year from 2018 to 2020. We found that seasonal forest fires temporarily reduced the pine forest understory vegetation but minimally impacted the pine vegetation between the reported years. The total area of forest impacted by fires was 11.3%. These low-intensity fires burned 67.3 km2 (22.5%; 2018), 31.8 km2 (10.6%; 2019), and 21.3 km2 (7.1%; 2020) of the intact mature pine forest (299.5 km2) pre-and immediately post-Hurricane Dorian. Even though we were able to detect and map areas of pine regeneration in previously hurricane-killed pine forest, Hurricane Dorian eliminated these young pines. Overall, Grand Bahama experience a significant loss of its forest after the major hurricanes of 2004, 2005, and 2019. This research reports new findings on hurricane-related damage to the pine forest ecosystem in Grand Bahama, providing valuable information regarding the ecological consequences of severe hurricanes on these types of forests.

TI  - Quantifying Thermal Infra-Red directional anisotropy using Master and Landsat-8 simultaneous acquisitions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations in the Thermal Infra-Red (TIR) domain provide valuable information on Land Surface Temperatures, Evapo-Transpiration and water use efficiency and are useful for monitoring vegetation health, agricultural practices and urban planning. By 2030, there will be 3 new high-resolution global coverage satellite TIR missions in space, all of them with fields of view larger than & PLUSMN; 30 degrees. Directional anisotropy in TIR can affect the estimation of key application variables, such as temperature, and are typically studied by means of field campaigns or physical modelling. In this work, we have evaluated directional effects using simultaneous measurements from Landsat-8 and the & PLUSMN; 45 degrees field of view MASTER airborne TIR sensor from NASA. Differences as high as 6 K are observed in the surface temperatures derived from these simultaneous observations. Those differences are attributed to directional effects, with the greatest differences associated with hotspot conditions, where the solar and satellite viewing directions align. Five well studied parametric directional models have then been fitted to the temperature differences, allowing the amplitude of the measured directional effects to be reduced below 1 K, with small variations between models. These results suggest that a simple correction for directional effects could be implemented as part of the ground segment processing for the upcoming missions.

TI  - Max-Neef (2005) and the great transdisciplinary swindle: Lack of originality or something more worrisome?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - This commentary seeks to right what is now an old wrong - to attribute Manfred Max-Neef's (2005) model of disciplinary interactions in transdisciplinarity to Erich Jantsch (1970). When I first discovered this erroneous situation, it was a startling realisation. It seemed that Manfred Max-Neef had certainly copied and possibly plagiarised Erich Jantsch. We might ask why it is that although both authors are regularly referenced together, a doctoral dissertation (Buchanan, 2016) is the sole published document pointing out this irregularity. In the process of piecing together this (hi)story, I uncovered further documents that point toward something more common and perhaps more insidious than lack of originality. Manfred Max-Neef seems to have made a choice, conscious or otherwise, to not engage with, and perhaps even to dismiss, the scholarly purpose and intent of Erich Jantsch's transdisciplinary model. Recent neurological studies suggest that although this kind of behaviour has deep biological roots, it is not unavoidable. I wonder whether dismissing another scholar's beliefs may be a more serious indictment of our shared scholarly enterprise than plagiarism. My hope is that this salutary tale sets the record a little straighter, and acts as a reflective and reflexive trigger for scholars everywhere.

TI  - Automated identification and counting of predated Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) eggs using deep learning image analysis
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Predation or kill rate of biological control agents is often used as a proxy to evaluate the efficacy of different species of natural enemies and under different conditions. For generalist predators and many egg parasitoids, eggs of the Mediterranean flour moth Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) are used as factitious prey or hosts in laboratory and field experiments, as they are widely available from mass rearings of the biological control industry. Evaluating the predation or parasitism activity of natural enemies on E. kuehniella is a valuable tool for biological control practitioners around the world. However, manual assessments are laborious and prone to error, as observations may be subjective and depend on the individual performing the task. Here, we developed an automated protocol based on the deep learning object detection algorithm YOLOv5, for the accurate estimation of predated E. kuehniella eggs by piercing-sucking generalist predators. The application of the trained deep learning model achieved high precision (0.90) and recall (0.93) in the identification of predated eggs among intact eggs in our test experiment and was more accurate and faster than two independent observers that performed manual counting under a stereo microscope based on the mean absolute percentage error metric. Furthermore, a case study is presented where the predation activity of the generalist predators Orius laevigatus, Orius majusculus, Orius minutus, Nesidiocoris tenuis, Macrolophus pygmaeus, and Dicyphus errans is compared. Further applications and expansions of the protocol are discussed.

TI  - Reflectance material classification using optimized deep learning and change detection of LANDSAT surface reflectance images
T2  - ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The time-series changes that are affected by a specific alteration cannot be accurately found using change detection techniques. However, there are not many techniques available for identifying seasonal changes. This study develops a new deep model for identifying reflectance materials depending on optimization. At time instances "t"and "t-1"the images are accumulated in this instance. The Type 2 Fuzzy and Cuckoo Search Based Filter (T2FCS) is used for the pre-processing of two images. Then, Fuzzy Local Information C-Means (FLICM) is used to segment both images. On the image accumulated at time "t"the feature extraction is performed to extract statistical features like mean, variance, kurtosis, energy, skewness, and standard deviation as well as imperative features like Local Optimal Oriented Pattern (LOOP), Local Ternary Pattern (LTP), Local Gabor XOR Pattern (LGXP), and others. The reflectance material is then categorized using a Deep Neuro-Fuzzy Network (DNFN) with segments created from images collected at time instance "t-1"and features collected from "t". The proposed Jaya Student psychology-based optimization (JSPO), which was created by fusing the Jaya algorithm and the Student psychology-based optimization method(SPBO), is used here to train the DNFN. The segmented output that was collected at times "t"and "t-1"is then used to do the change detection. With the highest accuracy (94.1%) and maximum sensitivity (93.8%), the proposed JSPO-based DNFN demonstrated improved performance. For applications involving optical imagery, the Landsat program is crucial.

TI  - Combining Landsat time series and GEDI data for improved characterization of fuel types and canopy metrics in wildfire simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) and other radioactively contaminated areas threaten human health and well-being with the potential to resuspend radionuclides. Wildfire behavior simulation is a necessary tool to examine the efficiency of fuel treatments in the CEZ, but it requires systematically updated maps of fuel types and canopy metrics. The objective of this study was to demonstrate an effective approach for mapping fuel types, canopy height (CH), and canopy cover (CC) in territories contaminated by radionuclides using Landsat time series (LTS) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR observations. We combined LTS and GEDI data to map fuel types and canopy metrics used in wildfire simulations within the CEZ. Our classifi-cation model showed an adequate overall accuracy (75%) in mapping land covers and associated fuel types. The phenology metrics extracted from LTS reliably distinguished spectrally similar vegetation types (such as grass-lands and croplands) which exhibit different flammability through the year. We also predicted a suite of relative heights metrics and CC at Landsat 30-m pixel level (R2 = 0.23-0.26) using the nearest neighbor technique. The imputed maps adequately captured the dynamics of CH and CC in the CEZ after recent large wildfires occurred in 2015, 2020, and 2022. Thus, we illustrate a LTS processing approach to produce wall-to-wall maps of canopy characteristics that are important for wildfire simulations. We conclude that continuous updating of land cover and canopy fuel data is crucial to ensure relevant fire management of radioactively contaminated landscapes and support local decision-making.

TI  - Are open-source hydrodynamic models efficient in quantifying flood risks over mountainous terrains? An exhaustive analysis over the Hindu-Kush-Himalayan region
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hindu-Kush-Himalaya is abode to numerous severely flood-prone mountainous stretches that distress vulnerable communities and cause massive destruction to physical entities such as hydropower projects. Adopting commercial flood models for replicating the dynamics of flood wave propagation over such regions is a major constraint due to the financial economics threaded to flood management. For the first instance, the present study attempts to investigate whether advanced open-source models are skillful in quantifying flood hazards and population exposure over moun-tainous terrains. While doing so, the performance of 1D-2D coupled HEC-RAS v6.3 (the most recent version developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) is reconnoitred for the first time in flood management literature. The most flood-prone region in Bhutan, the Chamkhar Chhu River Basin, housing large groups of communities and airports near its floodplains, is considered. HEC-RAS v6.3 setups are corroborated by comparing them with 2010 flood imagery derived from MODIS through performance metrics. The results indicate a sizable portion of the central part of the basin experiences very-high flood hazards with depth and velocities exceeding 3 m, and 1.6 m/s, respectively, during 50, 100, and 200-year return periods of floods. To affirm HEC-RAS, the flood hazards are compared with TUFLOW at 1D and 1D-2D coupled levels. The hydrological similarity within the channel is reflected at river cross-sections (NSE and KGE > 0.98), while overland inundation and hazard statistics differ, however, very less significant (<10 %). Later, flood hazards extracted from HEC-RAS are fused with the World-Pop population to estimate the degree of population exposure. The study ascertains that HEC-RAS v6.3 is an efficacious option for flood risk mapping over geographically arduous regions and can be preferred in resource-constrained environments ensuring a minimal degree of anomaly.

TI  - The green divide: A spatial analysis of segregation-based environmental inequality in Vienna
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities, as the human habitat of the 21st century, will increasingly face climate change-related risks. Extreme weather events, hot spells, and rising air pollution already have widespread impacts on people, affecting their health and well-being. Urban vegetation is a proposed nature-based solution to address these challenges. However, the equitable distribution of urban vegetation is not always ensured. The study applies two innovative segregation-based inequality indices, recently developed by Schaeffer and Tivadar (2019), which reference to the residential segregation literature as a source of insight for the measurement of environmental inequalities within urban areas. Using high-resolution satellite data and demographic data on a 250 m2 grid level, this study is able to deliver robust evidence on the existence of environmental inequalities with respect to ethnic minorities and urban vegetation. It is observed that minorities consistently experience higher levels of segregation from urban vegetation compared to non-minorities, even when accounting for interactions with wider neighbourhoods. Additionally, the application of a Jackknife simulation provides insights for local policy interventions, mapping hotspots of urban inequalities and provides a solid starting point to tackle these issues on the ground.

TI  - Using R-A theory and the optimal distinctiveness perspective to understand the strategic marketing approaches used by platform-based organizations: The cases of Facebook and Twitter in digital ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drawing on R-A theory and the optimal distinctiveness perspective, we explore the marketing strategies of two platform-based organizations (PBOs) that provide users the ability to build social networks/relationships with others, and marketers the opportunity to communicate with users and access user data. Using a longitudinal dataset (2010-2017) containing 360 market offerings and 39 acquisitions of Facebook and Twitter, we benchmark one PBO against another under temporal contingency. Our analysis reveals that PBOs that cater to multiple stakeholders in digital ecosystems use service innovations as part of their conformity (legitimacy argument of institutional theory) efforts and ecosystem facilitation as part of their differentiating (unique positioning and competitive distinction argument of strategic management) efforts. In addition, we find that PBOs that can better use their digital ecosystems for structural flexibility, controlled structural integrity, shared worldview, and reduced cognitive dissonance are likely to outperform those who do not. We discuss the implications of this research for PBOs, different user groups utilizing such PBOs. We conclude with a discussion on our contributions to the optimal distinctiveness perspective and R-A theory.

TI  - Supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches using Sentinel data for flood mapping and damage assessment in Mozambique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural hazards, such as flooding, have been negatively impacting developed and emerging economies alike. The effects of floods are more prominent in countries of the Global South, where large parts of the population and infrastructure are insufficiently protected from natural hazards. From this scope, a lot of effort is required to mitigate these impacts by continuously providing new and more reliable tools to aid in mitigation and preparedness, during or after a flood event. Flood mapping followed by damage assessment plays an important role in all these stages. In this work we investigate a new dataset provided by DrivenData Labs based on Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery (VH, VV imagery and labels) to help map floods in the city of Beira in Mozambique. Exploiting Google Earth Engine (GEE), we deployed supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) methods on a dataset comprising imagery from 13 countries worldwide. We first mapped the floods country-by-country including Mozambique. This first part was helpful to understand the sensitivity of each method when applied to data from different regions and with different polarizations. We then trained the supervised model globally (in all 13 countries) and used it to predict floods in Beira. To assess the accuracy of the experiments we used the intersection over the union (IoU) metric, results of which we compared with the benchmark IoU achieved by the winner in the DrivenData competition for flood mapping in 2021. The implementation of unsupervised and supervised ML using VH and VV+VH produced satisfactory results, and showed to be better than using VV imagery; in Cambodia and Bolivia with VH polarization yielded IoUs values ranging from 0.819 to 0.856 which is above the benchmark (0.8094). The predictions in Beira using VH imagery yielded IoU of 0.568, which is a reasonable outcome. The proposed approach is a reliable alternative for flood mapping, especially in Mozambique due to its low cost and time effectiveness as even with unsupervised approaches, relatively high-quality results are yielded in near real-time. Finally, we used Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery for a land cover classification to perform damage assessment in Beira and integrated population data from Beira to enhance the quality the results. The results show that 20% of agricultural area and about 10% of built up area were flooded. Flooded built up area includes highly populated neighborhoods such as Chaimite and Ponta Gea that are located in the center of the city.

T2  - MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely identification of regions damaged by a natural disaster is critical for assessing the damages and reducing the human life cost. The increasing availability of satellite imagery and other remote sensing data has triggered research activities on development of algorithms for detection and monitoring of natural events. Here, we introduce an unsupervised subspace learning-based methodology that uses multi-temporal and multi-spectral satellite images to identify regions damaged by natural disasters. It first performs region delineation, matching, and fusion. Next, it applies subspace learning in the joint regional space to produce a change map. It identifies the damaged regions by estimating probabilistic subspace distances and rejecting the non-disaster changes. We evaluated the performance of our method on seven disaster datasets including four wildfire events, two flooding events, and a earthquake/tsunami event. We validated our results by calculating the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and accuracy of classification between our disaster maps and ground-truth data. Our method produced average DSC values of 0.833 and 0.736, for wildfires and floods, respectively, and overall DSC of 0.855 for the tsunami event. The evaluation results support the applicability of our method to multiple types of natural disasters.

TI  - Prediction of soil organic matter by Kubelka-Munk based airborne hyperspectral moisture removal model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining high-precision soil organic matter (SOM) spatial distribution information is of great significance for applications such as precision agriculture. But in the current hyperspectral SOM inversion work, soil moisture greatly influences the representation of the sensitive information of SOM on the spectrum. Therefore, a KubelkaMunk theory based spectral correction model for soil moisture removal is proposed to improve the spectral sensitivity of SOM. Firstly, the soil moisture content was obtained by the use of a Kubelka-Munk based physical soil moisture model and an unmixing method. Then, the spectral correction model for soil moisture removal was implemented based on the quantitative description of the Beer-Lambert law. The results show that the proposed spectral correction model for soil moisture removal can significantly enhance the expression of the sensitive spectral features of SOM, especially for the short-wave infrared range. After moisture removal, the imaging spectral data were used for inversion, using the sensitive band at 0.69 mu m and a support vector machine regression (SVR) modeling method. The Kubelka-Munk moisture removal model for soil moisture removal can improve the accuracy of SOM inversion by at least 22% comparing with the 0.69 mu m original spectral inversion model, with R2 of 0.42. Moreover, the proposed model can also improve the accuracy of SOM inversion by 19% for the SVR statistical regression method, with R2 of 0.69. Finally, the SOM distribution maps based on sensitive band model and SVR regression method were analyzed. Findings show that the two methods have high consistency, but the statistical method obtains better details of the SOM spatial distribution, due to its higher accuracy.

TI  - Modelling aboveground biomass of a multistage managed forest through synergistic use of Landsat-OLI, ALOS-2 L-band SAR and GEDI metrics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand forest carbon budgets and design forest-based climate change mitigation solutions, reliable biomass estimation is critical. Integrating multi-sensor remote sensing data can improve forest monitoring and evaluation. This study adopted a one-hectare plot size sampling design to improve the integration of GEDI footprints with in-situ, optical, and SAR data for the estimation of forest above-ground biomass (AGB). The study was carried out for a managed tropical forest in the Himalayan foothills of India. The space-borne GEDI retrieved the canopy height of the study area with an RMSE of 3.36 m and Adj. R2 of 0.70. Extrapolating GEDI footprint heights (RH95) with Landsat 8 indices using Random Forest (RF) yielded a spatial canopy height of the study area with an R2 of 0.97 and RMSE of 2.32 m. Using the GEDI canopy height, foliage density, and plant area index, the AGB at GEDI footprints level was estimated using RF, with an R2 of 0.91 and an RMSE of 20.10 Mg ha-1. The spatial AGB model that only considered ALOS-2 SAR variables had an R2 of 0.61 and an RMSE of 18.27 Mg ha-1, whereas the RF model that considered both SAR variables and canopy height had a superior R2 of 0.77 and a lower RMSE of 13.86 Mg ha-1. The addition of canopy height data reduced the RMSE of the AGB model by 4.41 Mg ha-1 and also predicted a higher range of AGB. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining GEDI data with other sensors (optical and SAR data) to provide precise AGB of multistage managed forests using a onehectare plot size sampling design.

TI  - Evaluation of <i>RASSF1A</i> methylation in the lysate of sentinel lymph nodes for detecting breast cancer metastasis: A diagnostic accuracy study
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The restriction enzyme-based digital methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (RE-dMSP) assay is useful for diagnosing sentinel lymph node (SN) metastasis in patients with breast cancer, by detecting tumor-derived methylated Ras association domain-containing protein 1 (RASSF1A). In addition, this assay has high concordance (95.0%) with one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA). The present study aimed to perform RE-dMSP using OSNA lysate from more patients and to re-evaluate its clinical usage. Overall, 418 SNs from 347 patients were evaluated using both OSNA and RE-dMSP. The concordance rate was 83.3% (348/418). RASSF1A methylation of the primary tumors was negative in 36 patients. When these patients were excluded, the concordance rate improved to 88.2% (330/374). Of the 79 OSNA-negative cases, 19 were RE-dMSP-positive, although all were positive for cytokeratin 19 expression in the primary tumor, suggesting that RE-dMSP can detect tumor-derived DNA with a higher sensitivity. The percent of methylated reference of the breast tumors showed a wide variety in the 16 OSNA-positive/RE-dMSP-negative cases, and such variability of methylation could have affected the results in these patients. In conclusion, although RE-dMSP can diagnose SN metastasis with high sensitivity and accuracy, and can be a supplementary tool to OSNA in breast cancer, RE-dMSP showed certain discordance with OSNA and critically depended on the absence or heterogeneity of DNA methylation in breast tumors. Further research is expected to develop an assay targeting other DNA alterations, such as mutations.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil organic carbon using remote sensing data: A systematic review
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Review
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) has attracted a lot of attention in the soil science community. Freely available remote sensing data combined with advanced digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques has led to a better understanding and management of SOC. This paper has considered the published literature with a focus on digital mapping of SOC using remote sensing data within 2010 to 2023 intervals. The objective was to consider all the important aspects of SOC prediction and mapping, including different land-use types, DSM algorithms, environmental variables, and remote sensing data sources. According to this review conducted on the 217 papers, cropland was the most popular type of land use. Regarding the DSM algorithms, random forest (RF) appeared in the largest number of studies. The terrain and spectral variables derived from the digital elevation model (DEM) and remote sensing images, were the highest demanding among all those used as input predictors. In addition, satellite platforms provided the largest portion of the remote sensing data used for the calibration of DSM models. This review provides quantitative insight into recent trends of SOC digital mapping using remote sensing technology while suggesting some directions for future development of the topic.

TI  - Evaluation of water hyacinth utility through geospatial mapping and in situ biomass estimation approach: a case study of Deepor beel (wetland), Assam, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As an invasive species, water hyacinths (Eichhornia crassipes) are known to progressively proliferate and cause the ecological invasions of the aquatic environment. The incursions of the water hyacinths not only cause the disappearance of native species but gradually degrade the natural habitats of freshwater regimes. The control and management of these species are laborious task; however, transforming weed into wealth can substantially serve a sustainable approach to reduce the efforts. Therefore, the present study intends to utilize the application of geospatial techniques for mapping the water hyacinths growth in the Deepor beel (wetland) of Assam, India. Sentinel based image analysis has shown that pre-monsoon seasons has encountered massive productivity and area coverage of water hyacinth, whereas in post-monsoon seasons, productivity of water hyacinths reduces to half. Furthermore, in situ biomass estimation of the water hyacinth samples, same around the productive season has been collected and was analyzed as 6 kg (green biomass) and 1 kg (dry biomass after sun-dried). Finally, this hybrid approach evaluated the production and revenue generation from Moorhen yoga mat (handicraft item) made from the dried water hyacinths. After assuming the actual availability of 50% of total mass yield of water hyacinths, around similar to 0.8 million (8.8 lakhs) yoga mats can be commercially produced within the most productive seasons. The revenue generation from the yoga mat in the domestic and international markets evaluated around US $12.79 million (Rs. 105.85 crore) and US $15.99 million (Rs. 132.31 crore), respectively, from a single productive season. Thus, applicative intent of this study can boost potential market in Assam, renovate the weed waste of water hyacinth into wealth generation, and sustainably support the livelihoods of the local communities.

AB  - This study examines the effects of the land registration and certification programme introduced in 1998 in the Tigray region of Ethiopia on agricultural productivity, climate change mitigation and adaptation. We use satellite-based measures of greenness and implement a difference-in-differences approach, comparing pixels on both sides of the Tigray-Amhara regional border. Results show positive and persistent effects of the programme on agricultural productivity and climate change mitigation. By examining years when adverse climate and weather events occurred, we also find evidence of increased adaptation to climate change. We show that our results are consistent with the reform enhancing farmers' tenure security and inducing an increase in the adoption of climate smart agricultural practices.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Micro milling offers the best way to create micro channels; however, the burr formation and surface roughness of the micro channel are difficult to control. Micro channel fabrication and their characterization of stir cast Al6061 are rarely investigated. In the present study, Al6061 alloy was processed by the bottom pouring stir casting method. The micro channels were fabricated on a base and stir cast Al6061 alloys using TiSIN-coated micro end mill tools. The influence of micromachining parameters such as spindle speed, feed rate, and depth of cut on burr formation, cutting force, burr size, and surface roughness was investigated. A comparison was made between the findings obtained from the micro milling of the base and stir cast Al6061 alloys. The surface morphology of fabricated micro channels was analysed and correlated with the roughness profile to understand the channel profile and burr formation. The top burr formation mechanism in stir cast Al6061 alloy was investigated in detail. Low feed rate, low depth of cut, and high spindle speed produced the micro channel with fewer burrs, low surface roughness, and low cutting forces. At the optimum parameter, stir cast Al6061 alloy showed an approximate 420%, 16%, and 300% increase in Fy, Fz, and Ra, respectively, as compared to the base Al6061 alloy. Adhesion wear, built-up edge, and microchipping were found to be the main tool wear mechanisms in micro machining of stir cast alloy. This study directs the choice of cutting parameters for the stir cast micro milling process.

TI  - Changes in submerged aquatic vegetation cover off the northern Yucatán Peninsula detected with Sentinel-2 imagery using a fuzzy classification system
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) plays a major role in various coastal ecological processes, providing habitat and food to a marine community and environmental benefits to people. However, seagrass meadow extensions around the world are shrinking. The objective of this study was to analyze recent variation in SAV coverage along the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, acoustic echosounder field surveys, and a fuzzy classification system, we produced binary cartographic models of SAV coverage for 2016, 2018, and 2019. In a study area of approximately 16342 km2, we estimated SAV coverage of 5957.90 km2 in 2016, with a decline to 2873.55 km2 by 2019. Coverage in protected areas decreased from 2376.03 km2 to 1690.89 km2 over the same period. The Federal Protected Area for Flora and Fauna of YumBalam showed an estimated gain of 48.3 km2 (r = 11.63%), but that of Laguna de Terminos an estimated reduction of 508.50 km2 (r = -29.77%), and coverage in the Los Petenes Biosphere Reserve decreased by 186.5 km2 (r = -5.35%). These changes are likely part of a complex dynamic in the study area, one that may include anthropic effects.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMISTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring natural resource access for Indigenous groups has become a recent policy focus. We combine satellite data and robust difference-in-difference methods to estimate the causal effect of Native American water right settlements on land and water use on reservations in the western United States over 1974-2012. We find that settlements increase cultivated agricultural land use (crops and hay/pasture) by 8.7%. Our estimates of tribal water use indicate that, even after accounting for water leased off-reservation, many tribes are utilizing only a fraction of their entitlements, forgoing as much as $938 million-$1.8 billion in revenue. We provide evidence suggesting that this gap is driven, in part, by land tenure constraints and a lack of irrigation infrastructure.

TI  - Urbanization and its impacts on land surface temperature and sea surface temperature in a tourist region in Mexico from 1990 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Nations World Tourism Organization has stated that Mexico is the sixth most visited country, with nearly 40 million international tourists. However, tourism can be one of the key contributors to rapid urbanization, contributing to climate change and environmental impacts. One of the tourist areas with the highest urban growth in the Mexican Pacific is Mazatlan, receiv- ing more than 2 million tourists each year. The goal of this study was to analyze urban expansion and its impacts on land surface temperature and sea surface temperature in a tourist region in Mexico from 1990 to 2020. A supervised classification was carried out using the support vector machine algorithm on Landsat images taken over the last 30 years, analyzing the relationship of this growth to land surface temperature (LST). We also analyze whether increases in LST on ur- ban land are related to increases in ocean temperature (SST) adjacent to the city. It was found that in the 1990s the urban area, currently 80 km2, was 25 km2. Urban growth has been exponen- tial, and greater than in some other coastal megacities that have 5 times the population of Mazatlan. The median LST in the 1990s was 30.8 and is currently & SIM;32.9 & DEG;C, but in an analysis of the city's temperatures by pixel we found areas with temperatures as high as 40 & DEG;C; e.g., malls and residential developments. These LST values are higher than those reported in other coastal cities located at similar latitudes. Median SST values were between 19.2 and 20.8 & DEG;C, so SST was not re- lated to LST. From the 1990s to the 2020s, the city's urban area has grown by 303%. Therefore, LST values in summer could reach 40 & DEG;C, which would give this coastal city one of the highest LSTs in the world, with a non -permeable surface that would cause flooding throughout the hotel zone.

TI  - Vegetation fuel characterization using machine learning approach over southern Portugal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the role of fire in the water and carbon cycles is crucial for understanding the Earth's system. Remote sensing is a valuable tool for this purpose as it covers large areas consistently over time. Furthermore, fire propagation models use vegetation parameters to gather information about wildfire conditions, thus reinforcing the need for vegetation dynamics comprehension. Hence, the study aims to improve vegetation representation of fuel load and moisture content, through remote sensing and in-situ data in Southern Portugal. In this study, three above-ground biomass (AGB) datasets and, for live fuel moisture content (LFMC), biweekly samples over two field sites (Herdade da Mitra and Serra de Ossa) were collected during the period between April and October 2022, counting 246 field samples. These samples combined with satellite data information derived from Sentinel-2 (spectral bands and indices) were used in a machine learning approach, the Random Forest (RF) classifier, considering 30 variables to predict the AGB and LFMC. Results showed reasonable agreement between predicted and observed values, with r2 and RSME values of 0.56 (0.69) and 17.56 ton ha-1 (6.47%) for AGB (LFMC). Finally, the RF model generated wall-to-wall dynamic AGB and LFMC maps. This study allowed a product derived from remote sensing data combined with an RF model to produce reliable information about vegetation conditions essential for wildfire risk assessment and atmosphere fire modelling in Southern Portugal.

TI  - Reassessment of Reservoir Sedimentation Rates under a Monsoon Climate with Combined Optical and Microwave Remote Sensing: A Case Study of Three Reservoirs in the Upper Godavari Basin, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is widely used for monitoring reservoir capacities. The relationship between two water levels (WLs) and the corresponding satellite-derived water spread areas provides the reservoir volume between the two WLs. However, the accuracy of this method depends on the ability to capture the water spread areas at fine increments of WLs so that the cross section of a reservoir is represented in adequate detail. In a monsoon climate, persistent cloud cover during the rainy season limits the number of usable optical satellite images. Hence, the time interval between two successive WLs for which cloud-free images are available is generally large. Using only a few WLs increases the likelihood of missing a significant break of slope in the reservoirs that may lead to gross error in the storage measurement. We showed that the combination of freely available optical (e.g., Landsat 8) and cloud-penetrating microwave [e.g., European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1] images may improve storage estimation and mitigate the inherent uncertainty of using remote sensing data for monitoring reservoir sedimentation. Three reservoirs in the Upper Godavari Basin in India constituted the study area. Findings show that the average annual sedimentation rate was overestimated by & SIM;10% when using only Landsat-8 images compared to combined radar and optical remote sensing databases (2016 and 2017). The suggested method made significant improvements in the estimation of reservoir capacities for narrow-bottomed and convex-edged reservoirs.The capacity of a reservoir is typically monitored on a periodic basis as a means of determining the reservoir's overall health. This is a common application of satellite imagery. Satellite images are used to determine the volume of water stored in a reservoir by analyzing the relationship between two water levels and the area covered by the water. The greater the difference between the two water levels, the less precise this measurement will be. Under monsoon climate, cloud cover prevents the use of optical images during the rainy season when reservoir levels fluctuate greatly. Because there are fewer water levels to choose from due to the lack of images, the accuracy of the estimate suffers. Using three reservoirs in the monsoon region of peninsular India, this study shows that combining optical data from satellites like Landsat-8 with publicly available cloud-penetrating Sentinel-1 radar images greatly increases the number of water spread area-water level data points and decreases the error and uncertainty in the storage estimation. Based on our findings, it appears that the reported rate of capacity loss, derived from limited optical images, is likely to be inaccurate. The authors also found that the storage estimates of the narrow-bottomed conical-shaped reservoirs will be greatly improved by increasing the number of water levels in volume calculation.

TI  - Land cover modelling for tropical forest vulnerability prediction in Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to estimate the vulnerability of tropical forest in Kalimantan, Indonesia, from simulated land cover changes using the Weighted Normalised Likelihood-Markov Chain model (WNL-MC) for the period 2018-2050 under a forest conservation and a no-conservation scenario. Predictions of future vulnerability and forest change were based on land cover maps for 2010 and 2014 developed using the integration of Landsat, ALOS PALSAR, and Sentinel-1 data. The four main land cover classes in the region were oil palm and rubber plantations, native forests, and non-forested areas. The performance of the WNL-MC model was evaluated by comparing the simulated and actual land cover maps for 2018 and validating them against high-resolution images. Kappa accuracy for the simulated maps was >85%, and overall accuracy was >90%. Under the scenario of no forest conservation, native forest showed approximately 50% loss over the next 30 years, while the forest conservation scenario showed a slowing of current deforestation by 18% from 2018 to 2030 and by 5.95% from 2030 to 2050. Native forest outside forest conservation zones was most vulnerable to conversion to other land uses, particularly in lowland areas close to settlements and roads. Estimations of native forest loss, particularly under the no-conservation scenario, emphasise the need for policies to preserve and conserve remaining native forest areas.

TI  - Hourly global horizontal irradiance over West Africa: A case study of one-year satellite- and reanalysis-derived estimates vs. in situ measurements
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) from reanalysis and satellite-based data are the most important information for the design and monitoring of PV systems in Africa, but their quality is unknown due to the lack of in situ measurements. In this study, we evaluate the performance of hourly GHI from state-of-the-art reanalysis and satellite-based products (ERA5, MERRA-2, CAMS, and SARAH-2) with 37 quality-controlled in situ measurements from novel meteorological networks established in Burkina Faso and Ghana under different weather conditions for the year 2020. The effects of clouds and aerosols are also considered in the analysis by using common performance measures for the main quality attributes and a new overall performance value for the joint assessment. The results show that satellite data performs better than reanalysis data under different atmospheric conditions. Nevertheless, both data sources exhibit significant bias of more than 150 W/m2 in terms of RMSE under cloudy skies compared to clear skies. The new measure of overall performance clearly shows that the hourly GHI derived from CAMS and SARAH-2 could serve as viable alternative data for assessing solar energy in the different climatic zones of West Africa.

TI  - Accurate classification of land use and land cover using a boundary-specific two-level learning approach augmented with auxiliary features in Google Earth Engine
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing images is a valuable resource in various fields such as climate change, urban development, and land degradation monitoring. The city of Madurai in India is known for its diverse geographical elements and rich heritage, which includes the cultural sport of "Jallikattu": whose main competitor, the zebusare deeply affected by the conversion of their waterbodies and pastures into concrete jungles. Hence, monitoring land degradation is vital in preserving the geography and cultural heritage of the study area, Madurai. The "Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager tier_2 collection_2 Level_2 Surface Reflectance" image was taken for this study. The LULC classification is performed based on the following classes: forest, agriculture, urban, water bodies, uncultivated land, and bare land. The objective of the study is to incorporate auxiliary features to spectral and textural features along with a simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC) segmentation algorithm and implement a boundary-specific two-level learning approach based on support vector machines (SVM) and k nearest neighbors (kNN) classification algorithms. The overall accuracy (OA) of 95.78% and 0 .94 Kappa score (K) were obtained using a boundary-specific two-level model augmented with auxiliary feature and SNIC algorithm in comparison to PB, OB, and OBS, which achieve OA (K) of 81% (0.76), 91% (0.89), and 94.42% (0.92), respectively. The results demonstrate a notable enhancement in overall classification accuracy when augmenting the features and refining classification decisions using a boundary-specific two-level learning approach.

TI  - Uncovering the effects of Urmia Lake desiccation on soil chemical ripening using advanced mapping techniques
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urmia Lake in Iran has been gradually drying up since the 2000 s, revealing soil that was once underwater. There is limited research on how this drying process affects the distribution of soil chemical ripening in the lakebed sediments. To investigate this, 131 surface soil samples were collected in July 2017 from six zones based on their distance from the lake's shoreline. Elemental concentrations in the samples were measured using a portable Xray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer. Five geochemical indices (GCIs) were calculated: Titanium/Zirconium, Barium/Strontium, Silicon/Aluminium, Silicon/R2O3, and the Darmody index. A remote sensing image (Landsat8 OLI) from the same sampling period was used as environmental covariates to explain the spatial distribution of GCIs. Random forests (RF) and cubist tree models were employed to model and map these GCIs. The bootstrapping method was used to assess the uncertainty of the maps. Results indicated that the RF model performed better than the cubist model based on the concordance values in the validation dataset. Remotely sensed clay minerals ratio and normalized burn ratio were identified as the most significant covariates in making predictions. The study found that the distribution of all geochemical indices was directly related to their distance from the shoreline. Ba/Sr emerged as the best index for detecting soil chemical ripening in the study area. The index displayed the most significant differences between the drying zones. This research demonstrated that combining satellite imagery with GCIs using the digital soil mapping (DSM) technique can effectively detect soil ripening progression.

TI  - Emergence and evolution of a new glacial lake during last climate normal by using remote sensing and GIS in Sikkim, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are important indicators of climate change. Melting of glaciers in the Himalayan region has resulted in formation of many glacial lakes. A newly formed lake was observed near the snout of the glacier. This study investigates evolution of this glacial lake using remote sensing satellite data from Landsat mission in last climate normal of around 30 years. Cloud-free data from years 1990, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2010, 2017, and 2021 are used for analysis. Normalized Differential Water Index and Normalized Differential Snow Index thresholding are applied to extract the surface area of the glacial lake and surface glacier cover. It was observed that during beginning of the last climate normal, lake area was 900 m(2), and in 2021 it reached 51,300 m(2). The clean glacial area decreased from 3,593,700 m(2) in 1990 to 3,230,100 m(2) in 2021. These changes are indicative of rapid deglaciation and an increase in debris cover as melting ice exposes and deposits debris previously embedded within the glacier. Land Surface Temperature (LST) change was analyzed using empirical equations to understand its relation with observed changes. It was observed that in last climate normal, the average LST was increased by +1.76 degrees C. The snout regions showed the highest LST change of +3.14 degrees C. Polynomial, spline and logarithmic regression was applied to access quality of results. A strong correlation between lake area and glacier area was observed with r(2) of 0.93. An accuracy of 96.45% was achieved for the estimated changes of the lake with latest field-based result and 96.89% with latest Landsat image. This study successfully generated baseline data for the newly emerged East Rathong Glacial lake during the last climate normal, utilizing normalized differential index time series thresholding of glacier and lake, along with LST change detection.

TI  - Integrating chemical and biological data by chemometrics to evaluate detoxification responses of a neotropical bivalve to metal and metalloid contamination.
T2  - Chemosphere
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Mangroves represent a challenge in monitoring studies due to their physical and chemical conditions under constant marine and anthropogenic influences. This study investigated metals/metalloids whole-body bioaccumulation (soft tissues) and the risk associated with their uptake, biochemical and morphological detoxification processes in gills and metals/metalloids immobilisation in shells of the neotropical sentinel oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae from two Brazilian estuarine sites. Biochemical and morphological responses indicated three main mechanisms: (1) catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione played important roles as the first defence against reactive oxygen species; (2) antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals, glutathione S-transferase, metallothionein prevent protein damage and (3) metals/metalloids sequestration into oyster shells as a mechanism of oyster detoxification. However, the estimated daily intake, target hazard quotient, and hazard index showed that the human consumption of oysters would not represent a human health risk. Among 14 analysed metals/metalloids, chemometrics indicate that Mn, As, Pb, Zn and Fe overload the antioxidant system leading to morphological alterations in gills. Overall, results indicated cellular vacuolization and increases in mucous cell density as defence mechanisms to prevent metals/metalloids accumulation and the reduction in gill cilia; these have long-term implications in respiration and feeding and, consequently, for growth and development. The integration of data from different sites and environmental conditions using chemometrics highlights the main biological patterns of detoxification from a neotropical estuarine bivalve, indicating the way in which species can cope with metals/metalloids contamination and its ecological consequences.

TI  - Exploratory study of the Sentinel-3 level 2 product for monitoring chlorophyll-a and assessing ecological status in Danish seas
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ Chl-a data were used to perform empirical calibration and validation of Sentinel-3 level 2 product in Danish marine waters. Comparing in situ data with both same-day and & PLUSMN;5 days moving averaged Sentiel-3 Chl-a values yielded two similar positive correlations (p > 0.05) with rpearsonvalues of 0.56 and 0.53, respectively. However, as the moving averaged values resulted in significantly more available data than daily matchups (N = 392 vs. N = 1292) at a similar quality of correlation with similar model parameters (slope (1.53 and 1.7) and intercept (-0.28 and -0.33) respectively), which were not significantly different (p > 0.05), the further analyses were focused on & PLUSMN;5 days moving averaged values. A thorough comparison of seasonal and growing season averages (GSA) also showed a very good agreement, except for a few stations characterized by very shallow depth. Overestimation by the Sentinel-3 occurred in shallow coastal areas and was attributed to the interferences from benthic vegetation and high levels of Colored Dissolved Organic matter (CDOM) interfering with the Chl-a signals. Underestimation observed in the inner estuaries with shallow Chl-a rich waters, however, seen as a result of self-shading at high Chl-a concentrations, reducing effective absorption by phytoplankton. Besides the observed minor disagreements, there was no significant difference when the GSA values from in situ and Sentinel-3 were compared for all three water types (p > 0.05, N = 110). Analyzing Chla estimates along a depth gradient showed significant (p < 0.001) non-linear trends of declining concentrations from shallow to deeper waters for both in situ (explaining 15.2 % of the variance (N = 109)) and Sentinel-3 data (explaining 36.3 % of the variance (N = 110)), with higher variability in shallow waters. Furthermore, Sentinel-3 enabled full spatial coverage of all 102 monitored water bodies providing GSA data at much higher spatial and temporal resolutions for good ecological status (GES) assessment compared to only 61 through in situ sampling. This underlines the potential of Sentinel-3 for substantially extending the geographical coverage of monitoring and assessment. However, the systematic over- and underestimation of Chl-a in shallow nutrient rich inner estuaries through Sentinel-3 requires further attention to enable routine application of the Sentinel-3 level 2 standard product in the operational Chl-a monitoring in Danish coastal waters. We provide methodological recommendations on how to improve the Sentinel-3 products' representation of in situ Chl-a conditions. Continued frequent in situ sampling remains important for monitor-ing as these measurements provide essential data for empirical calibration and validation of satellite based estimates to reduce possible systematic bias.

TI  - Soil texture mediates the surface cooling effect of urban and peri-urban green spaces during a drought period in the city area of Hamburg (Germany)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) and peri-urban green spaces (P-UGS) play a crucial role in reducing the land surface temperature within the urban environment, especially during heat waves. Although their cooling effect generally is due to shading and evaporation, the role of soil texture and soil water availability on surface cooling remains largely unexplored. This study investigated the impact of soil texture on the spatio-temporal patterns of LST in different UGSs and P-UGSs in Hamburg (Germany) during a hot summer drought period. The LST and the Normalized Differentiated Moisture and Vegetation Indices (NDMI, NDVI) were calculated based on two Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images from July 2013. Non-spatial and spatial statistical approaches such as stepwise backward regression or Hotspot (Getis-Ord Gi*) analyses were applied explaining LST distributions in relation to soil texture within each UGS and P-UGS. All GSs were clearly characterized as surface cooling islands whereas, for each GS, an individual thermal footprint was observed. Within all GSs, the LST patterns showed a significant negative relationship to NDMI values, whereas the NDVI values and the elevation were of minor importance. Soil texture was found to influence the LST distribution significantly in most UGSs and P-UGSs, where sites on clay-rich soils showed the highest LST values compared to sites on sand- or silt-rich soils. For example, in parks, clayey soils showed a mean LST of 25.3 & DEG;C whereas sand-dominated sites had a mean LST of only 23.1 & DEG;C. This effect was consistent throughout all statistical approaches, for both dates and across most GSs. This unexpected result was explained by the very low unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in clayey soils which limits plant water uptake and transpiration rates responsible for the evaporative cooling effect. We concluded that soil texture has to be considered for understanding and managing the surface cooling capacity of UGSs and P-UGSs.

TI  - Applying random forest to oil and gas exploration in Central Sumatra basin Indonesia based on surface and subsurface data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil and gas exploration in Indonesia currently requires novel methods during the initial screening of exploration areas that are effective, inexpensive, and utilize open data. This is expected to increase exploration interest, which has continued to decrease, and many oil and gas exploration areas will be returned to the government (up to 100 working areas). The study aimed to examine the utilization of random forest classification for oil and gas exploration in the Central Sumatra Basin based on subsurface and surface data. Subsurface data included gravity data, basement structure maps, seismic interpretation maps (6 variables), and surface data, including Landsat 8 OLI data, SRTM DEM, surface geological maps, drainage pattern maps, and topographical maps (32 variables). The method used in this research is a random forest with sample training in oiland gas-proven and potential areas (6 classes) and non-oil- and gas-potential areas (5 classes). Based on the Ntree 600 parameter, Mtry k, and node size 2, unexplored oil and gas potential areas were identified, consisting of (1) a very high potential area in the south of the Bengkalis graben; (2) three locations of high potential areas located on the banks of the Kiri trough and close to the Aman and Balam grabens; (3) two locations of medium potential category II located east and northwest of the Bengkalis graben; and (4) a medium potential area category I located east of the Bengkalis graben.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of air pollutants and their relationship with land surface temperature in Bengaluru, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid development and urbanization in most of the cities of the world have led to increased vehicular traffic, industrial activities, and construction. Air pollution in most cities of developing countries, like India, often exceeds the limits given in relevant national/international standards. Rapid urbanization in Bengaluru is causing increased air pollution and land surface temperature (LST). The present study examines the relationship of LST with air pollutants, meteorological parameters, surface indices, and selected urbanization parameters. The study also aims to find out the air pollutant have the maximum effect on LST during different seasons. Air pollutants and meteorological data were collected from air quality monitoring stations, while LST data of MODIS satellite was downloaded from the internet. Data for the period 2018-2022 was utilized for the current research. The results indicated that PM2.5 concentrations exceeded WHO standards, and Hombegowda Nagar (B9), Peenya (B5), and Bapuji Nagar (B4) were identified as pollution hot-spots. A strong association of LST with air pollutants and meteorological parameters was observed during the winter season (R2 = 0.87 to 0.91), which was stronger than the corre-sponding association during summer (R2 = 0.72 to 0.79). The association further improved after incorporating spectral indices (NDVI and NDBI), global population density (GPD), digital eleva-tion model (DEM), and road line density (RLD) and a very strong association was obtained (R2 value of 0.91 in summer and 0.96 in winter). The study also revealed a strong relationship be-tween the Urban Heat Island index and the combination of all parameters, both for urban and rural areas as well as during both the summer and winter seasons. PM2.5 and SO2 were identified as the main air pollutants affecting LST variations during the summer season, while NO2 and CO were more influential during the winter season. The study concludes that variation in the LST of an area is governed not only by the surface characteristics but it is also affected by air pollutants and meteorological conditions as well as conditions of urbanization that can be represented by different parameters/indices. The findings of this study hold significant implications for future scientific research, and it may pave the way for the integration of effective mitigation strategies to combat the dual challenges of increasing LST and air pollution in urban areas.

TI  - Revealing the effect of an industrial flash flood on vegetation area: A case study of Khusheh Mehr in Maragheh-Bonab Plain, Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are one of the most significant environmental hazards that can have harmful effects on agricultural activities and vegetation. The primary objective of this study is to analyze the destructive after-effects of an industrial flash flood on the vegetation of the Khusheh Mehr region. This flash flood occurred due to a break in the wastewater ponds of the Kaveh Soda factory on April 25, 2010. Using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from time-series Landsat data over the period of 2000-2020, we analyzed the changes in wastewater ponds and regional vegetation before and after the wastewater flood occurred. We also investigate the quantitative and qualitative changes in vegetation during the past 20 years and detect the flood passage through this area. The results show that 538 ha out of the total 2123 ha of Khusheh Mehr were directly affected by the runoff resulting from the 2010 flood, and 1250000 m3 of industrial wastewater was discharged in the study area. The analysis of the vegetation in 2010 showed that during May and July, the efficiency and expansion of vegetation in these areas (NDVI >0.3) decreased by 90% and 55%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2009 and 2006. The study is significant because it can help evaluate the effects of the flash flood not only on wastewater ponds and vegetation but also on the contamination of underground and surface waters as chemicals and industrial wastewater held in natural and artificial environments are discharged during a flood and directly affect vegetation. The findings can provide useful information for hazard and land use management and support policymakers, e.g., payment for financial loss of farmers.

TI  - Using PlanetScope images to investigate the evolution of small glaciers in the Alps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Small glaciers (having an area smaller than 1 km2) dominate in terms of total number in the Alps and it is important to study their evolution. In this study we assessed the potential of daily, high resolution (3 m pixel size) PlanetScope images for investigating small Alpine glaciers. We compared the evolution of five small glaciers, covering an area lower or slightly higher than 1 km2, located in different areas of the Alps and having different characteristics and meteorological conditions. The investigated glaciers are: Bors (0.645 km2, Piedmont, Italy), Seewjinen (1.339 km2, Valais, Switzerland), Pizzo Ferre (0.442 km2, Lombardy, Italy), Gran Zebra (0.579 km2, Lombardy, Italy) and Solda Orientale (0.829 km2, South Tirol, Italy). We manually mapped the glacier outline and the highest position of the transient snowline (TSL) through PlanetScope images from the end of the ablation season for each year from 2017 to 2021 and each glacier. The snow cover area ratio (SCAR) was retrieved using the TSLs. We found that the glaciers lost between 4 and 14% of their area between 2017 of 2021, with a mean area loss of -1.5% per year. The strongest shrinkage (14%) is recorded at the smallest glacier (Pizzo Ferre). The highest TSL showed a variability from year to year. For two glaciers, a supervised classification of the surface facies (snow, ice and supraglacial debris) was performed on all the available cloud-free images from the 2017-2021 ablation seasons. PlanetScope images, with their high spatial and temporal resolution proved to be a valuable tool for studying small glaciers. They permitted to map small glaciers with small uncertainties (between 2.2 and 5.1% of the glacier area), much lower than with medium resolution satellite data (e.g. Landsat 15/30 m, Sentinel 10 m) and to increase the number of images available for analysis. The daily repeat cycle is well suited for increasing the probability to find images from the end of the ablation season with minimum snow cover, in order to identify the real end-ofsummer snowline.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of near-surface CO2 and its affecting factors over Mongolia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the spatiotemporal variability of near-surface CO2 concentrations in Mongolia from 2010 to 2019 and the factors affecting it over four climate zones of Mongolia based on the Ko & BULL;ppen-Geiger climate classification system, including arid desert climate (BWh), arid steppe climate (BSk), dry climate (Dw), and polar frost climate (ET). Initially, we validate the near-surface CO2 datasets obtained from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) using ground-based CO2 observations obtained from the World Data Center for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) and found good agreement. The results showed that CO2 concentrations over Mongolia steadily increased from 389.48 ppmv in 2010 to 409.72 ppmv in 2019, with an annual growth rate of 2.24 ppmv/year. Spatially, the southeastern Gobi desert region has the highest annual average CO2 concentration, while the northwestern Alpine and Meadow steppe region exhibits the most significant growth rate. Additionally, significant monthly and seasonal variations were observed in each climate zone, with CO2 levels decreasing to a minimum in summer and reaching a maximum in spring. Furthermore, our findings revealed a negative correlation between CO2 concentrations and vegetation parameters (NDVI, GPP, and LAI) during summer when photosynthesis is at its peak, while a positive correlation was observed during spring and autumn when the capacity for carbon sequestration is lower. Understanding CO2 concentrations in different climate zones and the uptake capacity of vegetation may help improve estimates of carbon sequestration in ecosystems such as deserts, steppes and forests.

TI  - Introducing a novel dust source identification method based on edge points and paths extracted from integration of time-series MODIS products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a novel method for identifying dust sources in the Middle East using multi-temporal MODIS images was introduced. This method was utilized to identify the sources of 14 Sand and Dust Storms (SDSs) events that occurred between 2008 and 2012 in Ahwaz city, in southwestern Iran. For this purpose, the SDS extents were detected using the proposed Thermal Infrared (TIR) algorithm consisting of MODIS TIR bands 20, 31, and 32, and the Brightness Temperatures Difference between the two bands 31 and 32. The true color RGB MODIS image of the study area showed that the proposed SDS detection algorithm was highly efficient in separating these storms. In the next step, potential dust sources were obtained based on the proposed algorithm, which included the main sub-steps of separating the major SDS extents and calculating the centroids and the edges of each, computing the angles between each point of the obtained edges with the centroid of the corresponding SDS extent, and applying two thresholds to separate potential sources. The dust source map was produced by overlaying all dilated potential dust sources and classifying them based on the number of overlapped layers. This map illustrated that dust sources were scattered in eastern Syria, northwestern and southeastern Iraq, and southwestern Iran. Interpretation of the results demonstrated that the degradation of vegetation covers and reducing the width of rivers and dry lake-beds were the main characteristics of these sources. From the results of this research, it was concluded that the proposed novel method is a promising and efficient algorithm for identifying dust sources.

T2  - PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work the time variability of MODIS satellite evapotranspiration data was investigated by using the informational Fisher-Shannon analysis and the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to reveal the presence of Xylella Fastidiosa in olive trees, a very dangerous phytobacterium capable to induce a severe disease in olive trees, known as olive quick decline syndrome. Several hundred pixels of infected and healthy sites located in southeastern Italy were analysed. Our results suggest that the informational (Fisher Information Measure and Shannon entropy) and multifractal (hq- range, multifractal width W and maximum alpha 0) parameters allow a good discrimination between infected and healthy sites, envisaging the use of the combination of this two methods as an operational tool for early diagnosis of plant deterioration due to the bacterium.

T2  - Clinical nuclear medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - ABSTRACT: In recent years, many articles have described the adverse events associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We report the case of a 63-year-old woman with bilateral lung shadows after 1-year pembrolizumab immunotherapy following surgery for the right-foot melanoma because of positive sentinel lymph nodes. Follow-up 18 F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated bilateral diffuse mass-like peribronchovascular opacities with marked FDG uptake. Clinically, melanoma metastases with lymphangitic spread were suspected, and bronchoscopy was performed, although no evidence of malignancy was found. The lung shadow was mostly resolved after steroid treatment. Pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis can be a mimicker of melanoma metastasis with lymphangitic spread.

TI  - Single-Institution Prospective Evaluation of Moderately Hypofractionated Whole-Breast Radiation Therapy With Simultaneous Integrated Boost With or Without Lymphatic Drainage Irradiation After Breast-Conserving Surgery
T2  - ADVANCES IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: We report treatment outcomes for patients who received adjuvant moderate hypofractionated whole-breast radiation therapy with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB-mhWBRT) after breast-conserving surgery.Methods and Materials: SIB-mhWBRT for patients with breast cancer was introduced in our department in July 2017. This prospective evaluation includes 424 consecutive patients treated with SIB-mhWBRT for stage I-III invasive breast cancer (n = 391) and/or ductal carcinoma in situ (n = 33) until December 2021. SIB-mhWBRT was applied with 40 Gy in 15 daily fractions over 3 weeks according to the START B trial, with an SIB dose to the tumor bed of 48 Gy according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1005/UK-IMPORT-HIGH, delivered as 3-dinemsional conformal radiation therapy (RT; n = 402), intensity modulated RT (n = 4), or volumetric modulated arc therapy (n = 18). The mean patient age was 60 years (range, 27-88). Since May 2018, patients with indications for lymphatic pathway RT were included (n = 62). Baseline parameters and follow-up data were recorded and reported, including objective assessment of treatment-related outcomes and subjective patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).Results: Mean/median follow-up was 29/33 months (range, 2-60). Acute toxicity grade 0, 1, 2, and 3 was observed in 25.0%, 61.4%, 13.3%, and 0%, respectively, at the completion of RT. Data of 281, 266, 243, 172, and 58 patients were available for 6-month and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year follow-up, respectively. Grade 2 late effects were identified in 8.5%, 6.0%, 4.9%, 2.2%, and 10.2% and grade 3 in 2.8%, 1.1%, 1.2%, 0%, and 0% of patients at 6-month and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year follow-up, respectively. Medical treatment of breast edema was the only grade 3 late effect observed. PROM cosmesis results were evaluated as excellent-good, fair, and poor in 97.2%, 2.5%, and 0.4%; 96.5%, 3.1%, and 0.4%; 97.4%, 2.2%, and 0.4%; 97.5%, 2.5%, and 0%; and 96.5%, 3.5%, and 0.0% at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, and 4 years post-RT, respectively. For all patients, the 3-year overall, cancer-specific, and disease-free survival rates were 98.2%, 99.1%, and 95.9%, respectively. Three-year risk of any locoregional recurrence was 0.6%. No mortality or relapse was observed in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ.Conclusions: SIB-mhWBRT demonstrated very favorable side effect profiles and cosmesis/PROMs. Three-year results demonstrate excellent locoregional control. This short-term regimen offers substantial patient comfort and improves institutional efficacy.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

TI  - Estimating surface-level nitrogen dioxide concentrations from Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI observations in Finland
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, satellite instruments have been providing observations of air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with global coverage. Since late 2018, the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on-board the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite has produced NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) with the best spatial resolution (currently 5.5 x 3.5 km2 at nadir). In this paper, we test and adapt two previously published methods to estimate surface-level NO2 concentrations from TROPOMI VCD retrievals in the specific conditions of Finland. Satellite-based estimates show good correlation with co-located surface NO2 measurements from the Finnish AQ network, although not accounting for the level of NO2 mixing within the boundary layer leads to underestimation. We also use a linear relation between in situ measurements and surface-level estimates to correct for the observed negative bias in the estimates. Finally, we use chemical transport model simulations to estimate the ratio of the annual mean surface concentrations to the values sampled according to TROPOMI observation times, and use it to correct our surface-level NO2 estimates for compatibility with annual limit values defined in AQ legislation.Overall, the results provide new information to complement traditional ground-based AQ measurements, especially over areas where the surface AQ networks are sparse, and to support national environmental authorities in air quality assessment and reporting.

TI  - Determining the critical threshold of meteorological heat damage to tea plants based on MODIS LST products for tea planting areas in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) is a daily drink in modern life throughout the world. Global warming increases the exposure of tea plants to elevated heat conditions during the summer picking period. Therefore, it is a fundamental function of the meteorological service to determine the critical temperature threshold that triggers heat damage (HD) to tea plants. In this study, MODIS daytime land surface temperature (LST) products obtained from the Aqua satellite (MYD11A1), annual land cover type products (MCD12Q1), and actual HD records were jointly used to determine the critical LST threshold resulting in HD to tea planting areas in China. An LST dataset of HD and HD-free samples was constructed based on actual HD records. The box-plot method was then used to delineate the range of LST outliers in HD to tea plants. The cumulative frequency distribution (CFD) method was adopted to determine the critical LST threshold by searching for the maximum slope of CFD within the range of LST outliers based on 2901 actual HD samples from 42 agrometeorological stations in 11 provinces in China. Results showed that the critical LST threshold triggering HD to tea plants was 30.1 degrees C. Two different HD data sources (i.e., 68 counties in eight provinces from the Meteorological Disaster Management System (MDMS) and 37 counties in six cities from a published book) were used as HD validation samples. Validation accuracy analysis revealed that a critical LST threshold of 30.1 degrees C was reasonable, with an average accuracy of between 60% and 90% for the published-book dataset, and 75.7% in the northern Yangtze River area and 86.3% in the southern Yangtze River area for the MDMS dataset. This study confirmed that using remotely sensed LST products is an effective method for identifying temperature-related agrometeorological disasters owing to the method's ability to intuitively capture the surface temperature distribution of the disaster-affected object. The findings will be helpful for identifying the timing and location of HD to tea plants, and thereby potentially preventing HD to tea plants.

TI  - Developing a satellite-based combined land degradation index for monitoring environmental change: A case study in Tana-Beles watershed, Upper Blue Nile, Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation is one of the most pressing environmental challenges due to its effect on the people and ecosystem. Early detection of land degradation could help to avoid further deterioration and work on reversing the trend. This would require an integrated approach combining indicators such as vegetation condition, soil health (i.e., soil salinity), and soil exposure (i.e., albedo) to characterize land degradation comprehensively. Therefore, this study aims at developing a satellite image-based combined land degradation index to monitor the spatial extent of land degradation in the Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. In addition, the study also evaluates the environmental change associated with land degradation across the Tana-Beles watershed. The combined land degradation index (CLDI) was developed by integrating multiple indicators, including normalized vegetation Index (NDVI), salinity index (SI), and albedo, for two periods spanning between 1990 and 2000 (1990s) and 2010 to 2020 (2010s). The individual indicators were combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by assigning weights to the individual indicators. The analysis indicated that, in the 2010s, the vegetation condition deteriorated over 98.5% of the study area, while soil salinity and albedo increased by 82% and 97% in the 1990s, respectively. The combined land degradation index developed with the PCA indicated in the 2020s a fraction of the study area similar to 2% is extremely degraded, while 18%, 43%, 27%, and 10% of the site is strongly, moderately, slightly, and not degraded, respectively. Monitoring land degradation is important for countries like Ethiopia, where most of the county are occupied by semi-arid and arid climate zones.

TI  - A review of remote sensing image spatiotemporal fusion: Challenges, applications and recent trends
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - In remote sensing (RS), use of single optical sensors is frequently inadequate for practical Earth observation applications (e.g., agricultural, forest, ecology monitoring) due to trade-offs between spatial and temporal resolution. The advent of spatiotemporal fusion (STF) of RS images has allowed the production of images with high resolution at both spatial and temporal scales. Despite the development of more than 100 STF models in the past two decades, many of these models have not been practically applied due to the possibility of limited understanding of the models. Therefore, this study aims to provide a comprehensive review of STF methods, including their conception, development, challenges, and applications. This study focuses primarily on deep learning-based STF models, which achieved superior performance and significantly increased the number of STF models. This review can guide the selection and design of STF models, as well as proposes future directions for STF modeling. The findings of this review facilitate further STF research to improve the accuracy and application of fused RS images in the field of agriculture, forestry, and ecological monitoring.

TI  - Application of remote sensing monitoring to the spatiotemporal variation in debris flow activity in the catastrophic Wenchuan seismic area
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Debris flows are typical compounded geohazards with long-term activity in earthquake-stricken areas. Numerous debris flows were simultaneously induced by subsequent extreme precipitation and caused serious property losses and casualties. Monitoring the dynamic variation in debris flow activity and its decay process over time is key for debris flow risk management and mitigation of the impact of debris flows. In this study, the spatio-temporal variation in debris flow activity of the Wenchuan seismic area over the past ten years was monitored based on multiperiod satellite data and field monitoring. The hillslope landslide sediment delivery to the channel gradually decreased, and the area with higher sediment transfer potential gradually changed from southern Wenchuan County to the northern area, which caused the area with high susceptibility to debris flows to gradually move towards northern Wenchuan County. Impacted by the decrease in available materials and coarsening of channel materials, the power of rainfall runoff required for driving debris flows gradually increased. This resulting debris flow is more likely to occur in this basin with a larger catchment area, longer channel length, and higher elevation difference. The changes in the debris flow activity index indicated that the debris flow activity evolves with an impulse type, and it may last for decades. The decay processes of the debris flow activity were summed up in three periods, i.e., high-activity period (2008-2015), unstable period (2015-2035), and recession period (after 2035), based on the dynamic evolution of material, hydrodynamics, and the coefficient of debris flow activity. Simultaneously, the active characteristics of debris flows in different periods were revealed, which is of great significance to the risk management of debris flows in the next period.

TI  - Improving extraction phenology accuracy using SIF coupled with the vegetation index and mapping the spatiotemporal pattern of bamboo forest phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring plant phenology is vital to maintaining the global carbon balance and management under climate change. Bamboo forest is an essential forest type in subtropical China with a strong carbon sequestration capacity. In recent years, vegetation indices (VIs), which characterize canopy structural parameters, and solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), indicating the photosynthetic activity of vegetation, have provided new perspectives on plant phenology at regional and global scales. However, the best data sources and methods for extracting the phenology of bamboo forests remain to be explored. In this study, new vegetation indices were innovatively constructed by normalizing the VIs (enhanced vegetation index (EVI), two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv)) based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and SIF products (GOSIF) based on OCO-2 satellites and then taking the mean values of the normalized VIs (EVI, EVI2 and NIRv) and SIF. We called the new indices SVs (SIF and VIs combined indices, including Se (SIF and EVI combined index), Se2 (SIF and EVI2 combined index), or Sn (SIF and NIRv combined index)). Two time series reconstruction methods (asymmetric Gaussian (AG) function fitting and double logistic (DL) function) and two extractive phenology parameter methods (dynamic threshold method (DT) and comparative threshold method (CT)) were employed to extract phenological information. The advantages of SVs for extracting bamboo forest phenology (BFP) were verified by comparing the extraction performance of VIs, SIF, and SVs on the SOS and EOS of bamboo forests. Thus, the best way to extract BFP was explored, and the spatial distribution and spatial-temporal variation characteristics of BFP in China from 2011 to 2020 were analyzed. The results are described as follows: (1) SVs are better able to extract BFP parameters compared with VIs and SIF, especially in bamboo forest-specific off-years and on-years; (2) SIF has better accuracy than VIs in extracting BFP, where both SOS and EOS values obtained from VIs are overestimated, and SIF can reflect BFP information earlier; and (3) the best data sources for extracting SOS and EOS in bamboo forests are Sn and Se, respectively, and the optimal methods are AG_CT and DL_DT, respectively. Compared with SIF, the R2 values of Sn and Se extracted SOS and EOS are improved by 40.7% and 7.7%, and the RMSE values are reduced by 24.7% and 0.7%, respectively; and (4) the SOS for bamboo forests in China from 2011 to 2020 was mainly concentrated in 80-100 days, with an overall advancing trend; the EOS was mainly concentrated in 300-320 days, with an overall delay. The results show that the SVs obtained by coupling VIs and SIF can better track the BFP information, providing a practical reference for macroscopic monitoring of BFP based on medium resolution time series data.

TI  - Improved tropical deep convective cloud detection using MODIS observations with an active sensor trained machine learning algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical deep convective clouds (DCCs) play an essential role in the Earth system. However, separating DCCs from thick anvils with satellite passive measurements is challenging. In this work, a day/night unified tropical DCC detection approach for MODIS observations is developed with a CloudSat active sensor measurement trained machine learning model. This approach combines brightness temperatures (BTs) at 6.7 mu m (BT6.7) and 11 mu m (BT11) with derived variables describing horizontal structures of DCCs and improves the tropical DCC probability of detection (POD) from 45.0% for the widely-used BT11 < 215 K method to 67.9%, while the false alarm ratio (FAR) decreases from 43.9% to 32.6%. The Heidke skill score (HSS) of the new algorithm is 0.425, which is more than doubled compared to the HSS of the BT11 < 215 K method (0.182). Moreover, the new algorithm has small biases in DCC's total amount and spatial distribution compared with the CloudSat results. The monthly DCC variations from MODIS wide-swath measurements with the new algorithm demonstrate the ability to reliably provide high temporal and spatial resolution DCC distributions to support intra-seasonal to interannual climate variability studies, which the CloudSat narrow-swath measurements lack enough samples to do. Meanwhile, the new algorithm can also be applied to measurements from other satellite passive sensors when BT6.7 and BT11 are available.

TI  - Extrapolation of electromagnetic pointing error corrections for Sentinel-1 Doppler currents from land areas to the open ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - By utilizing single-look complex data from synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the Doppler centroid anomaly method (DCA) can be employed to determine the velocity of the sea surface current field along the radar line-of-sight direction. However, due to the influence of platform or antenna perturbations, SAR Doppler shift measurements are subject to electromagnetic pointing error (EPE). These errors can typically be reduced by using echo information from land areas (including islands) within the SAR images to correct the Doppler shift. This allows the successful estimation of Doppler shifts due to sea surface factors and, in turn, the retrieval of ocean currents in the radar line-of-sight. However, in cases where SAR images lack data over land, uncorrectable EPE can result in significant inaccuracies in the retrieval of ocean currents. This study utilizes data captured by Sentinel-1A on four orbits in the Florida Strait region of the Gulf Stream from July 2020 to October 2022 to investigate the variation characteristics of EPE. To address the issues of calculating these in SAR images lacking land data, an EPE fitting method is proposed. The correction significantly reduces the error of S1A retrieved current velocity compared with line-of-sight current velocity from the HYCOM model and in situ HF radar, indicating that the proposed method provides an effective way to reduce the impact of EPE in SAR images, even when land is not directly observed.

TI  - Exploring the diurnal variations of the driving factors affecting block-based LST in a "Furnace city" using ECOSTRESS thermal imaging
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have explored the spatial variations of land surface temperature (LST). However, few have analyzed the diurnal variations of LST and its driving factors at the block scale, nor have they utilized the Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) LST products. To fill the gap, this study divided 1865 urban blocks into nine block categories and explored the diurnal variations of the driving factors influencing LST in a "Furnace city" using ECOSTRESS LST data. Our results revealed that the spatial patterns of LST varied diurnally; high LST tended to be distributed in blocks with low-rise high-density buildings in the daytime, whereas in high-rise high-density blocks at nighttime. The diurnal variations of the driving factors were explored according to correlation and stepwise regression analyses. The correlation co-efficients between urban structures and LST varied diurnally, and this variance was most apparent in different block types. The stepwise regression analyses indicated that the driving factors considered in this study could explain over 35% of the variations in LST in the nighttime and daytime. Meanwhile, the adaptive planning strategies for different block categories were developed. Our findings provide a new perspective for block-level mitigation of the urban thermal environment.

TI  - Pan-Greenland mapping of supraglacial rivers, lakes, and water-filled crevasses in a cool summer (2018) and a warm summer (2019)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal distribution and variability of surface water remained poorly known at the pan-Greenland scale, and its dominant features (supraglacial rivers, lakes, and water-filled crevasses) were rarely studied collectively. We present pan-GrIS surface water extent and volume for a relatively cool (2018) and a relatively warm (2019) summer, using 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 imagery, a semi-automated multi-scale water extraction algorithm, and the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO). While the 10 m resolution of Sentinel-2 imagery prevents inclusion of all water-filled crevasses and narrow rivers, our findings include: (1) strong interannual differences are observed in total surface water area (4903km(2) vs. 9988 km(2)), volume (3.5 km(3) vs. 6.8 km(3)), and mean elevation limit (1407 m a.s.l. vs. 1545 m a.s.l.) in response to a low (cool) (265 Gt/yr) and high (warm) (510 Gt/yr) runoff year; (2) large spatial contrasts in surface water extent, volume, elevation limit, and drainage pattern among the eight major GrIS basins; (3) supraglacial rivers dominate GrIS surface water appearance, accounting for 57%/48% of total surface water area/volume, respectively, over the two years (in contrast, water-filled crevasses and supraglacial lakes account for 33%/32% and 10%/20%, respectively); (4) ratio of remotely sensed water volume to RACMO-simulated cumulative surface runoff declines during the cool (2.6%) vs. the warm (1.8%) year; and from north (4.5%) to south (1.1%) Greenland. In summary, this study reveals strong temporal and spatial differences in GrIS surface water extent, volume, and drainage pattern and raises prospects for improved understanding of pan-Greenland Ice Sheet surface hydrology.

TI  - A framework for estimating actual evapotranspiration through spatial heterogeneity-based machine learning approaches
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration (ET) is a key variable controlling the exchange of energy and water in terrestrial ecosystems. The spatial heterogeneity of ET patterns poses a great challenge for regional ET estimation over heterogeneous landscapes. In this study, we proposed a framework for estimating ET through interactive detector for spatial associations (IDSA)-based machine learning (ML) approaches by combining data from remote sensing and four flux towers distributed in the Hai River Basin. The IDSA model was applied to explore individual and interactive determinants of ET over the Hai River Basin. In addition, the geographical regions of ET were determined according to the spatial heterogeneity. Then we simulated ET in each geographical region separately using three ML models, including random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, and Cubist. General ML models without considering spatial heterogeneity were used for comparison, and evaluations were conducted with the eddy covariance flux tower observations at the site scale, also with water balance ET at the basin scale. The results demonstrated that the spatial patterns of ET were difficult to be explained by individual environmental variables (64.9 %). The maximum interpretability was improved by about 11.2 % through the interaction of air temperature (T) and normalized different vegetation index (NDVI). The framework developed in this study had excellent performance with coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.807 to 0.811, root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.654 mm/day to 0.661 mm/day, and mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.470 mm/day to 0.485 mm/day. It was superior to general ML models at the site and basin scales. Additionally, the ET simulated by IDSA-based ML models were in good agreement with the reference product, further illustrating its reliability. The proposed framework provides a theoretical basis for in-depth understanding of spatial heterogeneity of ET and a new perspective for ET prediction over large scales.

TI  - Monitoring spring leaf phenology of individual trees in a temperate forest fragment with multi-scale satellite time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fragmentation has been increasingly exacerbated by deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion. Monitoring the forest fragments via the lens of tree-crown scale leaf phenology is critical to understand tree species phenological responses to climate change and identify the fragment species vulnerable to environmental disturbance. Despite advances in remote sensing for phenology monitoring, detecting tree-crown scale leaf phenology in fragmented forests remains challenging. Simultaneous tracking of key spring phenological events that are crucial to ecosystem functions and climate change responses is also neglected. To address these challenges, we develop a novel tree-crown scale remote sensing phenological monitoring framework to characterize all the critical spring phenological events of individual trees of deciduous forest fragments, with Trelease Woods in Champaign, Illinois as a case study. The novel framework comprises four components: 1) generate high spatiotemporal resolution fusion imagery from multi-scale satellite time series with a hybrid deep learning fusion model; 2) calibrate PlanetScope imagery time series with fusion data using histogram matching; 3) model tree-crown scale phenology trajectory with a Beck logistic-based method; 4) detect a diversity of treecrown scale phenological events using several phenological metric extraction methods (i.e., threshold- and curve feature-based methods). Combined with weekly in-situ phenological observations of 123 individual trees across 12 broadleaf species from 2017 to 2020, the framework effectively bridges the satellite- and field-based phenological measures for the key spring phenological events (i.e., budswell, budburst, leaf expansion, and leaf maturity events) at the tree-crown scale, particularly for large individuals (RMSE <1 week for most events). Calibration of PlanetScope imagery using multi-scale satellite fusion data in consideration of landscape fragmentation is critical for monitoring tree phenology of forest fragments. Compared to curve feature-based methods, threshold-based phenometric extraction methods demonstrate enhanced capability in detecting spring leaf phenological dynamics of individual trees. Among the phenological events, full leaf out and early leaf expansion events are retrieved with high accuracy using calibrated PlanetScope time series (RMSE from 3 to 5 days and R-squared higher than 0.8). With both intensive satellite and field phenological efforts, this novel framework is at the forefront of interpreting tree-crown scale remotely sensed phenological metrics in the context of biologically meaningful field phenological events in fragmented forest setting.

TI  - Performance of heat spots obtained from satellite datasets to represent burned areas in Andean ecosystems of Cusco, Peru
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The combustion of biomass is a prevalent practice in the Andes. Often, these burns escape control and escalate into wildfires. However, the investigation of unreported fire incidents has not re-ceived the same level of attention as reported wildfires. Satellite provide an alternative informa-tion source for studying wildfires. Given the scarcity of wildfire response tools, it is imperative to develop strategies to prevent burns in regions where human activity typically triggers wildfires. This study aims to assess the efficacy of heat spot data obtained from satellite datasets in identify-ing fire activity in the Peruvian Andes. The study utilized MODIS (MCD14DL product) and VIIRS (SUOMI and JPSS-1 products) satellite datasets to characterize fire activity through heat spot de-tection. Additionally, the study employed the normalized burned area index (NBR), a valuable in-dicator for mapping burned areas. Our findings indicate that MODIS and VIIRS heat spots demon-strate a high level of reliability in detecting active fires (commission errors of .1%). However, the detection of burned areas not captured by MODIS or VIIRS heat spots was significantly high (omission errors of .90%). Nevertheless, this detection deficiency decreased for larger burn areas (errors of omission between 10 and 30% for burned areas between 50 and 100 ha, using JPSS-1 VIIRS). These results suggest that satellite heat spots are inadequate for identifying burn prac-tices, which encompass small-scale and short-duration fire activities (lasting only hours). The outcomes of this study enhance our understanding of the suitability of heat spot detection for wildfire prevention in the Peruvian Andes.

TI  - A remote sensing method for mapping alpine grasslines based on graph-cut.
T2  - Global change biology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Climate change has induced substantial shifts in vegetation boundaries such as alpine treelines and shrublines, with widespread ecological and climatic influences. However, spatial and temporal changes in the upper elevational limit of alpine grasslands ("alpine grasslines") are still poorly understood due to lack of field observations and remote sensing estimates. In this study, taking the Tibetan Plateau as an example, we propose a novel method for automatically identifying alpine grasslines from multi-source remote sensing data and determining their positions at 30-m spatial resolution. We first identified 2895 mountains potentially having alpine grasslines. On each mountain, we identified a narrow area around the upper elevational limit of alpine grasslands where the alpine grassline was potentially located. Then, we used linear discriminant analysis to adaptively generate from Landsat reflectance features a synthetic feature that maximized the difference between vegetated and unvegetated pixels in each of these areas. After that, we designed a graph-cut algorithm to integrate the advantages of the Otsu and Canny approaches, which was used to determine the precise position of the alpine grassline from the synthetic feature image. Validation against alpine grasslines visually interpreted from a large number of high-spatial-resolution images showed a high level of accuracy (R2 , .99 and .98; mean absolute error, 22.6 and 36.2m, vs. drone and PlanetScope images, respectively). Across the Tibetan Plateau, the alpine grassline elevation ranged from 4038 to 5380m (5th-95th percentile), lower in the northeast and southeast and higher in the southwest. This study provides a method for remotely sensing alpine grasslines for the first-time at large scale and lays a foundation for investigating their responses to climate change.

AB  - Indigenous Peoples' health is directly linked to the health of the waters. In Canada, First Nation communities are often the first to be affected by unhealthy waters regardless of Canada having a vast amount of fresh water. Indigenous Peoples view health as wholistic encompassing the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being that relies on healthy waters. They understand that health is directly linked to the health of the waters and have been stating so for several years. Water has become a human right but colonial water decision-making continues to allow for water pollution ignoring the Indigenous worldview that water is medicine. How can you have healthy people when the waters are contaminated. The Indigenous worldview and knowledge can provide solutions in water decision-making to ensure the waters continue to live their responsibility of providing health to humans and all life.

TI  - A retrospective study of sentinel lymph node biopsy for skin cancer in Japan: Comparison with breast cancer and evaluation of factors related to its use.
T2  - Cancer medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) underuse has been reported for skin cancers; however, actual performance rates have not been compared. The objective of this study was to investigate the SLNB performance rate in skin cancers covered by health insurance in Japan and compare it with that in breast cancer.METHODS: This was a retrospective study of the SLNB performance rate in SLNB-eligible patients with breast or skin cancer from 2018 to 2019, utilizing a database linked to the Hospital-Based Cancer Registry and Diagnosis Procedure Combination survey. Demographic and tumor characteristics were analyzed using logistic regression.RESULTS: A total of 71,652 patients were included in this study. SLNB was performed in 86.4% (57,904/67,036) of the patients with breast cancer, 44.7% (694/1552) with melanomas, 3.1% (89/2849) with squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and 13.5% (29/215) with Merkel cell carcinomas (MCCs). The performance rate of SLNB was significantly lower for skin cancers than for breast cancers (odds ratio [OR], 0.03; p<0.001). In addition, the performance rates of SLNB were significantly lower for SCCs and MCCs than for melanomas (SCC: OR, 0.04; p<0.001; MCC: OR, 0.19; p<0.001). Factors associated with SLNB performance included age, sex, year of incidence, primary tumor site, T stage, and number of hospital beds.CONCLUSIONS: SLNB is underutilized for skin cancer. Further investigation is required to explore the reasons for its underutilization so that it may be implemented more universally.

TI  - Impact of Imaging-Guided Localization on Performance of Tailored Axillary Surgery in Patients with Clinically Node-Positive Breast Cancer: Prospective Cohort Study Within TAXIS (OPBC-03, SAKK 23/16, IBCSG 57-18, ABCSG-53, GBG 101).
T2  - Annals of surgical oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tailored axillary surgery (TAS) is a novel surgical concept for clinical node-positive breast cancer. It consists of the removal of the sentinel lymph nodes (LNs), as well as palpably suspicious nodes. The TAS technique can be utilized in both the upfront and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) setting. This study assessed whether/how imaging-guided localization (IGL) influenced TAS.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study preplanned in the randomized phase-III OPBC-03/TAXIS trial. IGL was performed at the surgeon's discretion for targeted removal of LNs during TAS. Immediate back-up axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) followed TAS according to TAXIS randomization.RESULTS: Five-hundred patients were included from 44 breast centers in six countries, 151 (30.2%) of whom underwent NACT. IGL was performed in 84.4% of all patients, with significant variation by country (77.6-100%, p < 0.001). No difference in the median number of removed (5 vs. 4, p = 0.3) and positive (2 vs. 2, p = 0.6) LNs by use of IGL was noted. The number of LNs removed during TAS with IGL remained stable over time (p = 0.8), but decreased significantly without IGL, from six (IQR 4-6) in 2019 to four (IQR 3-4) in 2022 (p = 0.015). An ALND was performed in 249 patients, removing another 12 (IQR 9-17) LNs, in which a median number of 1 (IQR 0-4) was positive. There was no significant difference in residual nodal disease after TAS with or without IGL (68.0% vs. 57.6%, p = 0.2).CONCLUSIONS: IGL did not significantly change either the performance of TAS or the volume of residual nodal tumor burden.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03513614.

TI  - The radiology department as a sentinel in fall prevention among Filipino older adult patients.
T2  - Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Accidental falls are a serious yet underreported form of adverse event in hospitals. Falls account for the leading cause of injury and mortality among older adults. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2021 reported that an estimated 64,000 individuals die annually from falls globally. In the Philippines, about 53.6% of older Filipinos are experiencing falls from a small population-specific setting and they are more likely to experience functional declines than the younger population. The radiology departments and radiologic technologists (RTs) play a vital role in preventing accidental falls among Filipino older adult patients. Despite the existing safety standards promulgated by national health agencies, awareness of healthcare professionals such as radiologic technologists (RTs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as the Philippines remains limited. As such, promoting a safety culture is deemed a main strategy for patient safety from adverse occurrences of falls among Filipino older adults. In doing so, there is a need to establish an incident reporting system for sentinel events, develop risk assessment tools, and define the needed competencies of RTs in preventing catastrophic falls involving Filipino older adult patients. To the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to better understand the safety and predisposing risks for falling among older adults in the field of radiology in the Philippines.

T2  - [Nihon koshu eisei zasshi] Japanese journal of public health
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective　Mutsuzawa town, Chiba Prefecture, relocated a "health-supportive" roadside station in 2019. The underlying hypothesis is that older people who use the roadside station will have better self-rated health than those who do not use it. We aimed to verify whether roadside station use was associated with a decrease in poor self-rated health.Method　This was a longitudinal study that compared and evaluated the roadside station use and non-use groups using three-wave panel data before and after relocation of the roadside station in September 2019. To obtain three-wave panel data, self-administered questionnaires were mailed three times: in July 2018 (FY 2018) before the station was relocated and in November 2020 (FY 2020) and January 2022 (FY 2021) after the relocation in 2019. The dependent variable was poor self-rated health in FY 2021, and the independent variable was use of the roadside station as of FY 2020. Covariates included basic characteristics from FY 2018, as well as going out, social participation, and interacting on social networks in FY 2018 and FY 2020. A multivariate analysis was conducted using multiple imputation to complete missing values for the Crude model, which included the basic attributes of FY 2018 (Model 1); going out, social participation, and interacting on social networks in FY 2018 (Model 2); and going out, social participation, and interacting on social networks in FY 2020 (Model 3). The cumulative incidence rate ratio (CIRR), 95% confidence intervals, and P-values were calculated using a modified Poisson regression analysis for each model.Results　Of the 576 participants, 344 (59.8%) were roadside station users. The multivariate analysis adjusted for basic attributes revealed that the number of people with poor self-rated health in the user group was significantly lower than that in the non-user group, with a CIRR of 0.67 (95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.99, P=0.043). However, the adjusted model showed a CIRR of 0.71 (95% confidence interval: 0.48-1.06, P=0.096) for going out, social participation, and interacting on social networks in FY2020 after the roadside station opened.Conclusion　Findings of this study revealed that, after adjusting for confounding factors prior to relocation of the roadside station, the number of people with poor self-rated health decreased in the user group. Thus, such commercial facilities as roadside stations, which give users an opportunity to go out and meet people, can provide a "naturally healthy" environment.

TI  - Cloud and Precipitation Variability Associated With the Madden-Julian Oscillation Over the Maritime Continent
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reexamines cloud and precipitation variability associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) over the Maritime Continent (MC), mainly using data acquired in 1998-2013 by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite. Infrared data indicated uniform, moderately deep stratiform cloud cover over the MC during MJO active phases, suggesting that an apparent MJO bypass of Borneo and New Guinea, observed in the brightness temperature anomaly distribution, was an artifact of climatologically low average brightness temperatures above the islands. Although previous satellite precipitation products indicated negligible anomalies over Borneo during MJO active phases, we identified positive precipitation anomalies in precipitation radar data and other recent satellite products. We hypothesize that previous satellite precipitation data products underestimated stratiform precipitation over Borneo during MJO active phases because ice-particle scattering was weak. This is consistent with the moderately deep stratiform cloud layer identified from infrared data.In this study, we investigated cloud and precipitation over the Maritime Continent, the region comprising thousands of islands between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, associated with a tropical intraseasonal oscillation propagating eastward along the equator. Previous studies reported that clouds associated with this oscillation apparently bypassed Borneo and New Guinea. Our analysis showed that the climatologically averaged cloud height over Borneo and New Guinea reached higher altitudes than in the surrounding areas. Previous satellite precipitation data products did not indicate notable rainfall variations over Borneo during active phases. However, analyzing more recent data from satellite instruments, including from a precipitation radar, we identified positive precipitation anomalies. This suggests that previous satellite data products underestimated widespread weak precipitation over Borneo during the active phases of the tropical intraseasonal oscillation, probably because scattering by ice particles was weak.Bypass of the Maritime Continent by the Madden-Julian Oscillation seen in brightness temperature anomaly is a climatology-induced artifactPrevious satellite precipitation products underestimated Madden-Julian Oscillation precipitation anomalies over the Maritime ContinentThe conventional understanding of processes governing cloud and precipitation variability over the Maritime Continent must be updated

TI  - County-level artificial light at night (ALAN) in the contiguous US (2012-2019): spatial variations, temporal trends, and environmental justice analyses.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a growing environmental hazard with economic, ecological, and public health implications. Previous studies suggested a higher burden of light pollution and related adverse effects in disadvantaged communities. It is critical to characterize the geographic distribution and temporal trend of ALAN and identify associated demographic and socioeconomic factors at the population level to lay the foundation for environmental and public health monitoring and policy-making. We used satellite data from the Black Marble suite to characterize ALAN in all counties in contiguous US and reported considerable variations in ALAN spatiotemporal patterns between 2012 and 2019. As expected, ALAN levels were generally higher in metropolitan and coastal areas; however, several rural counties in Texas experienced remarkable increase in ALAN since 2012, while population-level ALAN burden also increased substantially in many metropolitan areas. Importantly, we found that during this period, although the overall ALAN levels in the USA declined modestly, the temporal trend of ALAN varied across areas with different racial/ethnic compositions: counties with a higher percentage of racial/ethnic minority groups, particularly Hispanic populations, exhibited significantly less decline. As a result, the differences in ALAN levels, as measured by the Black Marble product, across racial/ethnic groups became larger between 2012 and 2019. In conclusion, our study documented variations in ALAN spatiotemporal patterns across America and identified multiple population correlates of ALAN patterns that warrant further investigations. Future studies should identify underlying factors (e.g., economic development and decline, urban planning, and transition to newer lighting technologies such as light emitting diodes) that may have contributed to ALAN disparities in the USA.

TI  - Difference-guided multiscale graph convolution network for unsupervised change detection in PolSAR images
T2  - NEUROCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image change detection is important in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image analysis and interpretation. However, improving its accuracy is challenging because of the interference of multiplicative speckle noise. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised PolSAR image change detection method based on a multiscale graph convolutional network (GCN). First, a Shannon entropy difference image is introduced and improved to obtain an enhanced difference image (EDI) that can effectively suppress speckle noise while preserving edge information. The generated EDI can be further utilised to construct a pseudo-label set required for unsupervised change detection. Subsequently, a difference constraint joint graph construction (DCJGC) module is proposed to obtain the object-level input information of the network. This uses the joint superpixels of multitemporal PolSAR images as graph nodes, and then introduces the difference information in the EDI to constrain the formation process of the edges between the nodes, efficiently and accurately constructing undirected graphs. Finally, a difference-guided multiscale GCN (DGMGCN) is designed for PolSAR image change detection. The network utilises difference information to eliminate the adverse effect of speckle noise on change detection and fully capture the change-aware features of multitemporal PolSAR images at fine and coarse scales, thereby improving feature discriminability. Experimental results on six real Gaofen-3 PolSAR datasets validate the superiority of the proposed approach over other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Analysis of spatiotemporal patterns of atmospheric CO2 concentration in the Yellow River Basin over the past decade based on time-series remote sensing data.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial and temporal variations of CO2 column concentration (CO2-CCs) is crucial for tackling climate change and promoting sustainable human development. This study provides an in-depth analysis of CO2 dynamics in the Yellow River Basin, an area significantly affected by both natural and anthropogenic factors. Using data from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) and the Fourier transformation spectrometer (FTS) of the GOSAT satellite remote sensing sensors, supplemented with ground station data from the Waliguan station, we scrutinized the CO2 levels in the region from 2013 to 2022. The regional CO2-CC displayed a 12-month cyclical variation and a continuous upward trend, escalating by approximately 4.26% over the 10-year period. Spatiotemporal differences were evident in the monthly variation of CO2-CC, with peak and minimum values occurring in May and August respectively. Geographically, the highest CO2-CC was found in the central part of the basin, while the lowest was in the northern part of Inner Mongolia. This study underscores the increased significance of the region's CO2-CC, which showed an increase from 17.0ppm at the start of the period to 21.0ppm by the end, representing an overall growth of between 4.35 and 5.25%. The findings highlight the urgency of targeted measures to mitigate CO2 emissions and adapt to their consequences in the Yellow River Basin, contributing to the global efforts against climate change and towards sustainable development.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aqua satellite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 1-km observations are collocated with Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) fields of view taken during July 2008 afternoon satellite passes over the equatorial western Pacific Ocean. Radiation simulations are compared with collocated CERES observations to better understand the sensitivity of computed fluxes to two ice cloud broadband radiation parameterization schemes and inferred ice cloud characteristics. In particular, the radiation computational schemes and ice cloud property retrievals are based on two respective ice particle models, the MODIS Collection 6 (MC6) aggregate model and a more microphysically consistent two-habit model (THM). The simulation results show that both MC6 and THM overestimate the shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) cloud radiative effects at the top of the atmosphere, as compared to the CERES observations; the difference between the MC6 and THM-based ice cloud retrievals is too small to compensate for the differences between the two model-based radiation schemes. Therefore, the present finding suggests that broadband radiative simulations are more sensitive to the radiation parameterization scheme than to the input cloud properties retrieved using the corresponding ice cloud particle optical property model.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study of Pericardial Fat Area in 28161 UK Biobank Participants.
T2  - Journal of the American Heart Association
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) is the visceral adipose tissue compartment surrounding the heart. Experimental and observational research has suggested that greater PAT deposition might mediate cardiovascular disease, independent of general or subcutaneous adiposity. We characterize the genetic architecture of adiposity-adjusted PAT and identify causal associations between PAT and adverse cardiac magnetic resonance imaging measures of cardiac structure and function in 28161 UK Biobank participants. METHODS AND RESULTS The PAT phenotype was extracted from cardiac magnetic resonance images using an automated image analysis tool previously developed and validated in this cohort. A genome-wide association study was performed with PAT area set as the phenotype, adjusting for age, sex, and other measures of obesity. Functional mapping and Bayesian colocalization were used to understand the biologic role of identified variants. Mendelian randomization analysis was used to examine potential causal links between genetically determined PAT and cardiac magnetic resonance-derived measures of left ventricular structure and function. We discovered 12 genome-wide significant variants, with 2 independent sentinel variants (rs6428792, P=4.20*10-9 and rs11992444, P=1.30*10-12) at 2 distinct genomic loci, that were mapped to 3 potentially causal genes: T-box transcription factor 15 (TBX15), tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial (WARS2) and early B-cell factor-2 (EBF2) through functional annotation. Bayesian colocalization additionally suggested a role of RP4-712E4.1. Genetically predicted differences in adiposity-adjusted PAT were causally associated with adverse left ventricular remodeling. CONCLUSIONS This study provides insights into the genetic architecture determining differential PAT deposition, identifies causal links with left structural and functional parameters, and provides novel data about the pathophysiological importance of adiposity distribution.

TI  - Clinicopathologic and mutational profiles of primary breast diffuse large B cell lymphoma in a male patient: case report and literature review.
T2  - World journal of surgical oncology
M3  - Review
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Primary breast lymphoma (PBL) is rare, and most cases occur in female patients, with few reported cases in male patients. The clinical presentation is similar to that of breast cancer, but the condition needs to be well understood, as treatment options and clinical course vary. Hence, we provide a relatively rare case of primary breast diffuse large B cell lymphoma (PB-DLBCL) in a male, including its complete clinicopathological features, radiological findings, genomic mutational profiles, and clinical course.CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old male presented with a lump in his right breast for 1week and was pathologically diagnosed with breast malignancy after a breast puncture biopsy at the local hospital. He came to our hospital for further treatment and underwent breast ultrasound and systemic positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging, followed by right mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Histomorphology showed diffuse hyperplasia of tumor cells with clear boundaries and surrounding normal breast ducts. The adhesion of tumor cells was poor with obvious atypia. Immunohistochemical results showed that the tumor cells were positive for CD20, Bcl6, and MUM-1 but negative for CK (AE1/AE3), ER, PR, CD3, and CD10. Forty percent of the tumor cells were positive for c-Myc, and 80% of tumor cells were positive for Bcl2. The Ki-67 proliferation index was up to 80%. The tumor cells were negative for MYC and BCL2 rearrangements but positive for BCL6 rearrangement by fluorescent in situ hybridization. No abnormality was found in the pathological examination of bone marrow aspiration. Therefore, the male was diagnosed with PB-DLBCL, nongerminal center (non-GCB) phenotype, dual-expression type. The sample were sequenced by a target panel of 121 genes related to lymphoma. Next-generation sequencing revealed six tumor-specific mutated genes (IGH/BCL6, TNFAIP3, PRDM1, CREBBP, DTX1, and FOXO1). The patient was given six cycles of orelabrutinib plus R-CHOP chemotherapy and two cycles of intrathecal injection of cytarabine. The last follow-up was on April 13, 2023 (17months). No recurrence or metastasis was found in laboratory and imaging examinations.CONCLUSION: We reported a relatively rare PB-DLBCL in a male, non-GBC phenotype, dual-expression type. It is worth mentioning that this case had IgH/BCL6 fusion, nonsense mutations in TNFAIP3, frameshift mutations in PRDM1, and missense mutations in CREBBP, DTX1, and FOXO1. To the best of our knowledge, this case is the first report of genomic mutational profiles of PB-DLBCL in males.

We aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (CS-2034, CanSino, Shanghai, China) in adults without COVID-19 infection from China.METHOD: This is a multicenter Phase I clinical trial with a randomized, double-blinded, dose-exploration, placebo-controlled design. The trial recruited 40 seronegative participants aged 18-59 years who had neither received any COVID-19 vaccine nor been infected before. They were divided into a low-dose group (administered with either the CS-2034 vaccine containing 30mug of mRNA or a placebo of 0.3ml type 5 adenovirus vector) and a high-dose group (administered with either the CS-2034 vaccine containing 50mug of mRNA or a placebo of 0.5ml type 5 adenovirus vector). Participants were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either the mRNA vaccine or a placebo on days 0 and 21 according to a two-dose immunization schedule. The first six participants in each dosage group were assigned as sentinel subjects. Participants were sequentially enrolled in a dose-escalation manner from low to high dose and from sentinel to non-sentinel subjects. Blood samples were collected from all participants on the day before the first dose (Day 0), the day before the second dose (day 21), 14 days after the second dose (day 35), and 28 days after the second dose (day 49) to evaluate the immunogenicity of the CS-2034 vaccine. Participants were monitored for safety throughout the 28-day follow-up period, including solicited adverse events, unsolicited adverse events, adverse events of special interest (AESI), and medically attended adverse events (MAE). This report focuses solely on the safety and immunogenicity analysis of adult participants aged 18-59 years, while the long-term phase of the study is still ongoing. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05373485.FINDINGS: During the period from May 17, 2022, to August 8, 2022, a total of 155 participants aged 18-59 years were screened for this study. Among them, 115 participants failed the screening process, and 40 participants were randomly enrolled (15 in the low-dose group, 15 in the high-dose group, and 10 in the placebo group). Throughout the 28-day follow-up period, the overall incidence of adverse reactions (related to vaccine administration) in the low-dose group, high-dose group, and placebo group was 93.33% (14/15), 100.00% (15/15), and 80.00% (8/10), respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of local adverse reactions (soreness, pruritus, swelling at the injection site) among the low-dose group, high-dose group, and placebo group (P=0.002). All adverse reactions were mainly of severity grade 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate), and no adverse events of severity grade 4 or higher occurred. Based on the analysis of Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (S-RBD) IgG antibodies against the BA.1 strain, the seroconversion rates of antibodies at day 21 after the first dose were 86.67%, 93.33%, and 0.00% in the low-dose group, high-dose group, and placebo group, respectively. The geometric mean titer (GMT) of antibodies was 61.2(95%CI 35.3- 106.2), 55.4(95%CI 36.3-84.4), and 15.0(95%CI 15.0-15.0), and the geometric mean fold increase (GMI) was 4.08(95%CI 2.35-7.08), 3.69(95%CI 2.42-5.63), and 1.00(95%CI 1.00-1.00) for each group. At day 28 after the full vaccination, the seroconversion rates of antibodies were 100.00%, 93.33%, and 0.00%, and the GMT of antibodies was 810.0(95%CI 511.4-1283.0), 832.2(95%CI 368.1-1881.6), and 15.0(95%CI 15.0-15.0), and the GMI was 54.00(95%CI 34.09-85.53), 55.48(95%CI 24.54-125.44), and 1.00(95%CI 1.00-1.00) for each group, respectively. Based on the analysis of CD3+/CD4+ cell cytokine response, the percentages of IL-2+, IL-4+, IFN-gamma+, and TNF-alpha+ cells increased after 14 days and 28 days of full vaccination in both the low-dose group and high-dose group. The increase was most pronounced in the high-dose group.INTERPRETATION: At day 28 after the full vaccination, both the low-dose and the high-dose CS-2034 vaccine were able to induce the production of high titers of S-RBD IgG antibodies against the BA.1 strain. Adverse reactions in the low-dose and high-dose groups were mainly of severity grade 1 or 2, and no trial-limiting safety concerns were identified. These findings support further development of this vaccine.FUNDING: The project was supported by the Capital's Funds for Health Improvement and Research (2022-2Z-20215) and (2022-2Z-20216).

TI  - Geometric Boundary Guided Feature Fusion and Spatial-semantic Context Aggregation for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images.
T2  - IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images aims to achieve pixel-level semantic category assignment for input images. This task has achieved significant advances with the rapid development of deep neural network. Most current methods mainly focus on effectively fusing the low-level spatial details and high-level semantic cues. Other methods also propose to incorporate the boundary guidance to obtain boundary preserving segmentation. However, current methods treat the multi-level feature fusion and the boundary guidance as two separate tasks, resulting in sub-optimal solutions. Moreover, due to the large inter-class difference and small intra-class consistency within remote sensing images, current methods often fail to accurately aggregate the long-range contextual cues. These critical issues make current methods fail to achieve satisfactory segmentation predictions, which severely hinder downstream applications. To this end, we first propose a novel boundary guided multi-level feature fusion module to seamlessly incorporate the boundary guidance into the multi-level feature fusion operations. Meanwhile, in order to further enforce the boundary guidance effectively, we employ a geometric-similarity-based boundary loss function. In this way, under the explicit guidance of boundary constraint, the multi-level features are effectively combined. In addition, a channel-wise correlation guided spatial-semantic context aggregation module is presented to effectively aggregate the contextual cues. In this way, subtle but meaningful contextual cues about pixel-wise spatial context and channel-wise semantic correlation are effectively aggregated, leading to spatial-semantic context aggregation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results on ISPRS Vaihingen and GaoFen-2 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Assessment of groundwater aquifer using geophysical and remote sensing data on the area of Central Sinai, Egypt.
T2  - Scientific reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The study aims to assess groundwater resources in Sinai's central area using remote sensing, geoelectric, and well-logging data, utilising techniques for modelling hydrogeological frameworks and evaluating desert regions' groundwater potential. Its utilized satellite image sources, soil maps, and geological maps to map the effects of various factors on groundwater potentiality recharge, dividing it into five zones. Eighteen deep VES stations were used to examine the upper part of the groundwater aquifer in Central Sinai, Egypt, comparing it with available borehole information (Well-1, and JICA-1) to establish subsurface geology and hydro-geology positioning. Borehole data, VES interpretation results, hydro-geophysical maps, and four geoelectrical cross-sections were used to visualize the rearward expansion of eight lithological units, groundwater-bearing sections, and aquifer-filled thicknesses. From interpretation data output reveal three zones with significant recharge and storage potential, including two groundwater aquifers. The shallow aquifer has a saturation thickness of the fractured limestone of 35-250m, while the deep aquifer Nubian sandstone is detected at depths ranging from 660-1030m. NW-SE and NE-SW faults likely recharge conduits connecting shallow and deep aquifers, providing sites with acceptable groundwater potential for living, agriculture, and development in Sinai.

TI  - Land cover and forest health indicator datasets for central India using very-high resolution satellite data.
T2  - Scientific data
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Satellite imagery has been used to provide global and regional estimates of forest cover. Despite increased availability and accessibility of satellite data, approaches for detecting forest degradation have been limited. We produce a very-high resolution 3-meter (m) land cover dataset and develop a normalized index, the Bare Ground Index (BGI), to detect and map exposed bare ground within forests at 90m resolution in central India. Tree cover and bare ground was identified from Planet Labs Very High-Resolution satellite data using a Random Forest classifier, resulting in a thematic land cover map with 83.00% overall accuracy (95% confidence interval: 61.25%-90.29%). The BGI is a ratio of bare ground to tree cover and was derived by aggregating the land cover. Results from field data indicate that the BGI serves as a proxy for intensity of forest use although open areas occur naturally. The BGI is an indicator of forest health and a baseline to monitor future changes to a tropical dry forest landscape at an unprecedented spatial scale.

TI  - Predicting the distribution of Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus in Europe: a comparison of climate niche modelling approaches.
T2  - Parasites & vectors
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ticks Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus are two of the most important vectors in Europe. Climate niche modelling has been used in many studies to attempt to explain their distribution and to predict changes under a range of climate change scenarios. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of different climate niche modelling approaches to explain the known distribution of I. ricinus and D. reticulatus in Europe.METHODS: A series of climate niche models, using different combinations of input data, were constructed and assessed. Species occurrence records obtained from systematic literature searches and Global Biodiversity Information Facility data were thinned to different degrees to remove sampling spatial bias. Four sources of climate data were used: bioclimatic variables, WorldClim, TerraClimate and MODIS satellite-derived data. Eight different model training extents were examined and three modelling frameworks were used: maximum entropy, generalised additive models and random forest models. The results were validated through internal cross-validation, comparison with an external independent dataset and expert opinion.RESULTS: The performance metrics and predictive ability of the different modelling approaches varied significantly within and between each species. Different combinations were better able to define the distribution of each of the two species. However, no single approach was considered fully able to capture the known distribution of the species. When considering the mean of the performance metrics of internal and external validation, 24 models for I. ricinus and 11 models for D. reticulatus of the 96 constructed were considered adequate according to the following criteria: area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve>0.7; true skill statistic>0.4; Miller's calibration slope 0.25 above or below 1; Boyce index>0.9; omission rate<0.15.CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive analysis suggests that there is no single 'best practice' climate modelling approach to account for the distribution of these tick species. This has important implications for attempts to predict climate-mediated impacts on future tick distribution. It is suggested here that climate variables alone are not sufficient; habitat type, host availability and anthropogenic impacts, not included in current modelling approaches, could contribute to determining tick presence or absence at the local or regional scale.

TI  - Intussusception risk following oral monovalent rotavirus vaccination in 3 Asian countries: A self-control case series evaluation.
T2  - Vaccine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Rotavirus vaccines have substantially decreased rotavirus hospitalizations in countries where they have been implemented. In some high- and middle-income countries, a low-level of increased risk of intussusception, a type of acute bowel obstruction, has been detected following rotavirus vaccination. However, no increased risk of intussusception was found in India, South Africa, or a network of 7 other African countries. We assessed the association between a 2-dose monovalent rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) and intussusception in 3 early-adopter low-income Asian countries -- Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Pakistan. Children<12months of age admitted to a sentinel surveillance hospital with Brighton level 1 intussusception were eligible for enrollment. We collected information about each child's vaccination status and used the self-controlled case series method to calculate the relative incidence of intussusception 1-7days, 8-21days, and 1-21days following each dose of vaccine and derived confidence intervals with bootstrapping. Of the 585 children meeting the analytic criteria, the median age at intussusception symptom onset was 24weeks (IQR: 19-29). Overall, 494 (84%) children received the first Rotarix dose and 398 (68%) received the second dose. There was no increased intussusception risk during any of the risk periods following the first (1-7days: 1.01 (95%CI: 0.39, 2.60); 8-21days: 1.37 (95%CI: 0.81, 2.32); 1-21days: 1.28 (95%CI: 0.78, 2.11)) or second (1-7days: 0.81 (95%CI: 0.42, 1.54); 8-21days: 0.77 (95%CI: 0.53, 1.16); 1-21days: 0.78 (95%CI: 0.53, 1.16)) rotavirus vaccine dose. Our findings are consistent with other data showing no increased intussusception risk with rotavirus vaccination in low-income countries and add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating safety of rotavirus vaccines.

TI  - Digital mapping and spatial modeling of some soil physical and mechanical properties in a semi-arid region of Iran.
T2  - Environmental monitoring and assessment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The soil's physical and mechanical (SPM) properties have significant impacts on soil processes, such as water flow, nutrient movement, aeration, microbial activity, erosion, and root growth. To digitally map some SPM properties at four global standard depths, three machine learning algorithms (MLA), namely, random forest, Cubist, and k-nearest neighbor, were employed. A total of 200-point observation was designed with the aim of a field survey across the Marvdasht Plain in Fars Province, Iran. After sampling from topsoil (0 to 30 cm) and subsoil depths (30 to 60 cm), the samples were transferred to the laboratory to determine the mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) of aggregates in the laboratory. In addition, shear strength (SS) and penetration resistance (PR) were measured directly during the field survey. In parallel, 79 environmental factors were prepared from topographic and remote sensing data. Four soil variables were also included in the modeling process, as they were co-located with SPM properties based on expert opinion. For selecting the most influential covariates, the variance inflation factor (VIF) and Boruta methods were employed. Two covariate dataset scenarios were used to assess the impact of soil and environmental factors on the modeling of SPM properties including SPM and environmental covariates (scenario 1) and SPM, environmental covariates, and soil variables (scenario 2). From all covariates, nine soil and environmental factors were selected for modeling the SPM properties, of which four of them were the soil variables, three were related to remote sensing, and two factors had topographic sources. The results indicated that scenario 2 outperformed in all standard depths. The findings suggested that clay and SOM are key factors in predicting SPM, highlighting the importance of considering soil variables in addition to environmental covariates for enhancing the accuracy of machine learning prediction. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm was found to be highly effective in predicting SPM, while the random forest algorithm yielded the highest R2 value (0.92) for penetration resistance properties at 15-30 depth. Overall, the approach used in this research has the potential to be extended beyond the Marvdasht Plain of Fars Province, Iran, as well as to other regions worldwide with comparable soil-forming factors. Moreover, this study provides a valuable framework for the digital mapping of SPM properties, serving as a guide for future studies seeking to predict SPM properties. Globally, the output of this research has important significance for soil management and conservation efforts and can facilitate the development of sustainable agricultural practices.

TI  - Hepatitis A Vaccination Coverage Among People With Chronic Liver Disease in England (HEALD): Protocol for a Retrospective Cohort Study.
T2  - JMIR research protocols
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatitis A outbreaks in the United Kingdom are uncommon. Most people develop mild to moderate symptoms that resolve, without sequelae, within months. However, in high-risk groups, including those with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD), hepatitis A infection can be severe, with a higher risk of mortality and morbidity. The Health Security Agency and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence recommend preexposure hepatitis A vaccination given in 2 doses to people with CLD, regardless of its cause. There are currently no published reports of vaccination coverage for people with CLD in England or internationally.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe hepatitis A vaccination coverage in adults with CLD in a UK primary care setting and compare liver disease etiology, sociodemographic characteristics, and comorbidities in people who are and are not exposed to the hepatitis A vaccine.METHODS: We will conduct a retrospective cohort study with data from the Primary Care Sentinel Cohort of the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub database, which is nationally representative of the English population. We will include people aged 18 years and older who have been registered in general practices in the Research and Surveillance Centre network and have a record of CLD between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2022, including those with alcohol-related liver disease, chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, nonalcohol fatty liver disease, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, and autoimmune hepatitis. We will carefully curate variables using the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms. We will report the sociodemographic characteristics of those who are vaccinated. These include age, gender, ethnicity, population density, region, socioeconomic status (measured using the index of multiple deprivation), obesity, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Hepatitis A vaccination coverage for 1 and 2 doses will be calculated using an estimate of the CLD population as the denominator. We will analyze the baseline characteristics using descriptive statistics, including measures of dispersion. Pairwise comparisons of case-mix characteristics, comorbidities, and complications will be reported according to vaccination status. A multistate survival model will be fitted to estimate the transition probabilities among four states: (1) diagnosed with CLD, (2) first dose of hepatitis A vaccination, (3) second dose of hepatitis A vaccination, and (4) death. This will identify any potential disparities in how people with CLD get vaccinated.RESULTS: The Research and Surveillance Centre population comprises over 8 million people. The reported incidence of CLD is 20.7 cases per 100,000. International estimates of hepatitis A vaccine coverage vary between 10% and 50% in this group.CONCLUSIONS: This study will describe the uptake of the hepatitis A vaccine in people with CLD and report any disparities or differences in the characteristics of the vaccinated population.INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/51861.

TI  - The Value of Percutaneous Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound in Sentinel Lymph Node Identification, Metastatic Status and Burden Diagnosis in Early Breast Cancer.
T2  - Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of percutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound (PCEUS) in the identification and characterization of sentinel lymph node (SLN).METHODS: A total of 102 breast cancer patients were collected and underwent preoperative PCEUS, which was used to identify SLN and lymphatic drainage. SLNs were classified into 4 enhancement patterns, including 6 subtypes: homogeneous (I), featured inhomogeneous (II) including inhomogeneous hypoenhancement (IIa) and annular or semi-annular enhancement (IIb), focal filling defect (III) including filling defect area<50% (IIIa) and filling defect area≥50% (IIIb), and no enhancement (IV). The enhancement patterns of SLNs were compared with the final pathological diagnosis.RESULTS: The identification rate of SLNs using PCEUS was 100% (102/102); the rate of identification of LCs was 100% (102/102), and the coincidence rate was 98.0% (100/102). Four lymphatic drainage patterns (LDPs) including 5 subtypes were found: single LC/single SLN(74.5%), multiple LCs/ single SLN (13.7%) including 2 subtypes:2 LCs/1 SLN and 3 LCs/1 SLN, single LC/multiple SLNs (7.8%), and multiple LCs/multiple SLNs (3.9%). A total of 86.3% (44/51) of patients without axillary metastasis could be safely selected for types I, IIa, and IIb, while the axillary metastasis rates of types III and IV were 74.4%and 87.5%, respectively (P<.001). Compared with grayscale US, the PCEUS significant improvement in diagnosing metastatic SLNs (.794 versus .579, P<.001). For the SLN metastatic burden, Types I, IIa, IIb, and IIIa had ≤2 SLNs metastases, with a pathological coincidence rate of (64/67, 95.5%), and types IIIb and IV had >2 SLNs metastases, with a pathological coincidence rate of (25/35, 71.4%) (P<.001). The AUC of PCEUS for the diagnosis of SLN metastatic status and burden was .794 and .879, respectively (P<.001).CONCLUSION: PCEUS has a high identification rate for SLN and has good potential for diagnosing SLN metastatic status and burden by enhancement patterns.

TI  - Modern diagnostics and treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma.
T2  - Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology : JDDG
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive skin cancer with epithelial and neuroendocrine differentiation, the incidence of which has increased substantially during the last decades. Risk factors include advanced age, fair skin type, UV exposure, and immunosuppression. Pathogenetically, a type caused by the Merkel cell polyomavirus is distinguished from a UV-induced type with a high tumor mutational burden. Clinically, MCC presents as a mostly painless, rapidly growing, reddish-violet tumor with a shiny surface, which is preferentially localized in the head-neck region and at the distal extremities. A reliable diagnosis can only be made based on histological and immunohistochemical features. At initial diagnosis, 20-26% of patients show locoregional metastases and 8-14% distant metastases, making staging examinations indispensable. If there is no clinical evidence of metastases, a sentinel lymph node biopsy is recommended. Essential columns of therapy are surgery, adjuvant or palliative radiotherapy and, in advanced inoperable stages, medicamentous tumor therapy. The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors has led to a paradigm shift, as they provide a considerably longer duration of response and better survival rates than chemotherapy. The PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab is approved for treatment of metastatic MCC in Germany, but the PD-1 antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab are also used with success. Adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment concepts, immune combination therapies and targeted therapies as monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors are in the clinical trial phase.

TI  - A geospatial analysis of cardiometabolic diseases and their risk factors considering environmental features in a midsized city in Argentina.
T2  - Geospatial health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - New approaches to the study of cardiometabolic disease (CMD) distribution include analysis of built environment (BE), with spatial tools as suitable instruments. We aimed to characterize the spatial dissemination of CMD and the associated risk factors considering the BE for people attending the Non-Invasive Cardiology Service of Hospital Nacional de Clinicas in Cordoba City, Argentina during the period 2015-2020. We carried out an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study performing non-probabilistic convenience sampling. The final sample included 345 people of both sexes older than 35 years. The CMD data were collected from medical records and validated techniques and BE information was extracted from Landsat-8 satellite products. A geographic information system (GIS) was constructed to assess the distribution of CMD and its risk factors in the area. Out of the people sampled, 41% showed the full metabolic syndrome and 22.6% only type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), a cluster of which was evidenced in north-western Cordoba. The risk of DM2 showed an association with high values of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (OR= 0.81; 95% CI: - 0.30 to 1.66; p=0.05) and low normalized difference built index (NDBI) values that reduced the probability of occurrence of DM2 (OR= -1.39; 95% CI: -2.62 to -0.17; p=0.03). Considering that the results were found to be linked to the environmental indexes, the study of BE should include investigation of physical space as a fundamental part of the context in which people develop medically within society. The novel collection of satellite-generated information on BE proved efficient.

TI  - Metabolic and Oxidative Stress Effects on the Spectroelectrochemical Behavior of Single Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cells.
T2  - Chemical & biomedical imaging
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen capable of causing a wide range of diseases in immunocompromised patients. In order to better understand P. aeruginosa behavior and virulence and to advance drug therapies to combat infection, it would be beneficial to understand how P. aeruginosa cells survive stressful conditions, especially environmental stressors. Here, we report on a strategy that measures potential-dependent fluorescence of individual P. aeruginosa cells, as a sentinel, for cellular response to starvation, hunger, and oxidative stress. This is accomplished using a micropore electrode array capable of trapping large numbers of isolated, vertically oriented cells at well-defined spatial positions in order to study large arrays of single cells in parallel. We find that conditions promoting either starvation or oxidative stress produce discernible changes in the fluorescence response, demonstrated by an increase in the prevalence of fluorescence transients, one of three canonical spectroelectrochemical behaviors exhibited by single P. aeruginosa cells. In contrast, more modest nutrient limitations have little to no effect on the spectroelectrochemical response when compared to healthy cells in the stationary phase. These findings demonstrate the capabilities of micropore electrode arrays for studying the behavior of single microbial cells under conditions where the intercellular spacing, orientation, and chemical environment of the cells are controlled. Realizing single-cell studies under such well-defined conditions makes it possible to study fundamental stress responses with unprecedented control.

TI  - Exploring diagnosis and therapeutic complexities of an aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma: A case report and review of the literature.
T2  - Oral oncology
M3  - Letter
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive and rare cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma that predominantly affects the sun-damaged skin of the head and neck region, extremities, and trunk of older white individuals. Microscopically, MCC is characterized by nests or sheets of uniform small round blue cells with scant cytoplasm, granular nuclei with a salt-and-pepper chromatin pattern, high proliferative activity, and occasional necrosis. They are usually positive for epithelial and neuroendocrine markers, particularly for cytokeratin 20 and AE1/AE3 in a paranuclear dot-like staining. We herein contribute by reporting a case of MCC affecting the auricular pavilion of a 66-year-old female patient from Campinas, Brazil. Additionally, a review of the current literature is also included to analyze all the cases that have been reported in the English-language literature, totalizing 27 cases of MCC on the external ear. The 5-year overall survival rate for individuals with localized MCC is 50% and the most common treatment choice is the combination of surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy and sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Clinical Utility of Melanoma Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Nomograms.
T2  - Journal of the American College of Surgeons
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: For patients with melanoma, the decision to perform sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is based on the estimated risk of lymph node metastasis. We assessed three melanoma SLNB risk-prediction models' statistical performance and their ability to improve clinical decision making (clinical utility) on a cohort of melanoma SLNB cases.STUDY DESIGN: Melanoma patients undergoing SLNB at a single center from 2003 to 2021 were identified. The predicted probabilities of sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity using the Melanoma Institute of Australia (MIA), Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), and Friedman nomograms were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration curves were generated. Clinical utility was assessed via decision curve analysis, calculating the net SLNBs that could have been avoided had a given model guided selection at different risk thresholds.RESULTS: Of 2,464 melanoma cases that underwent SLNB, 567 (23.0%) had a positive SLN. The areas under the ROC curves for the MIA, MSK, and Friedman models were 0.726 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.702-0.750), 0.720 (95% CI, 0.697-0.744), and 0.721 (95% CI, 0.699-0.744), respectively. For all models, calibration was best at predicted positivity rates below 30%. The MSK model underpredicted risk. At a 10% risk threshold, only the Friedman model would correctly avoid a net of 6.2 SLNBs per 100 patients. The other models did not reduce net avoidable SLNBs at risk thresholds ≤10%.CONCLUSION: The tested nomograms had comparable performance in our cohort. The only model that achieved clinical utility at risk thresholds ≤10% was the Friedman model.

TI  - Assessment of land use and land cover, water nutrient and metal concentration related to illegal mining activities in an Austral semi-arid river system: A remote sensing and multivariate analysis approach.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The mining sector in various countries, particularly in the sub-Saharan African region, faces significant impact from the emergence of small-scale unlicensed artisanal mines. This trend is influenced by the rising demand and prices for minerals, along with prevalent poverty levels. Thus, the detrimental impacts of these artisanal mines on the natural environment (i.e., rivers) have remained poorly understood particularly in the Zimbabwean context. To understand the consequences of this situation, a study was conducted in the Umzingwane Catchment, located in southern Zimbabwe, focusing on the variations in water nutrient and metal concentrations in rivers affected by illegal mining activities along their riparian zones. Using multi-year Sentinel-2 composite data and the random forest machine learning algorithm on the Google Earth Engine cloud-computing platform, we mapped the spatial distribution of illegal mines in the affected regions and seven distinct land use classes, including artisanal mines, bare surfaces, settlements, official mines, croplands, and natural vegetation, with an acceptable overall and class accuracies of ±70 % were identified. Artisanal mines were found to be located along rivers and this was attributed to their large water requirements needed during the mining process. The water quality analysis revealed elevated nutrient concentrations, such as ammonium and nitrate (range 0.10-20.0 mg L-1), which could be attributed to mine drainage from the use of ammonium nitrate explosives during mining activities. Additionally, the prevalence of croplands in the area may have potentially contributed to increased nutrient concentrations. The principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis revealed three clusters, with one of these clusters showing parameters like Ca, Mg, K, Hg and Na, which are usually associated with mineral gypsum found in the drainage of artisanal mines in the selected rivers. Cluster 2 consisted of B, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Mn, which are likely from the natural environment and finally, cluster 3 contained As, Cd, Cr, and Zn, which were likely associated with both legal and illegal mining operations. These findings provide essential insights into the health of the studied river system and the impacts of human activities in the region. They further serve as a foundation for developing and implementing regulatory measures aimed at protecting riverine systems, in line with sustainable development goal 15.1 which focuses on preserving and conserving terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems, including rivers. By acting on this information, authorities can work towards safeguarding these vital natural resources and promoting sustainable development in the area.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics and driving factors of vegetation coverage around linear cultural heritage: A case study of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal.
T2  - Journal of environmental management
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Linear cultural heritage, which plays significant roles in safeguarding the world's cultural and maintaining global civilization, has obtained rising concerns in purpose of sustainability. However, in view of existing publications, most attention has been paid on its values of recreation, history and culture. Its ecological environment is still poorly understood. As the longest linear cultural heritage in the world and spiritual symbol of China, the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal (BHGC) was selected as the study area in this study. We focused on the vegetation coverage around the BHGC from 2000 to 2020 and aimed to practically investigate whether and why vegetation distributes imbalanced along the entire BHGC. The annual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from Landsat images, was used to indicate the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation coverage. Based on ten natural and human interference factors, the geographic detector model was applied to analyze its driving mechanism. Results show that (1) vegetation coverage around the BHGC presented apparently spatial heterogeneity. Cities located at both ends of the BHGC showed lower vegetation coverage, whereas those in the middle were relatively higher. (2) Vegetation coverage in 23 cities around the BHGC was relatively stable over time, i.e., nearly 76.39% of the study area was measured unchanged trend. The slight degradation mainly occurred to the sub-urban and extra-urban areas. (3) The driving forces of human interferences on vegetation coverage dynamics around the BHGC surpassed natural factors from 2000 to 2020. Population density, GDP and cultural heritage density presented higher explanatory powers of vegetation growth compared to other seven factors. These findings provide a scientific basis for local governments to intervene in vegetation changes and ecological restoration through natural and human factors within the favorable scope.

TI  - Determination of long-term volume change in lakes by integration of UAV and satellite data: the case of Lake Burdur in Turkiye.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Monitoring the water levels and volume changes of lakes and reservoirs enables us to understand the importance of better protection and managing water resources in an ecologically optimum manner. Although some lakes, such as Burdur Lake, are not a source of drinking water, they are home to many endangered animals, endemic plants, and some species. Therefore, monitoring the changes in these lakes over time is important for various reasons. While water level measurement stations in lakes and wetlands provide important information, it may not always be possible to obtain this data. In this study, we investigated the long-term changes in Burdur Lake, a Ramsar site, by integrating the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) obtained by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with shoreline information obtained from the Landsat mission. This study aimed to investigate the usability, advantages, and disadvantages of the UAV-Landsat integration for volume calculation. As a result, we successfully determined the water level as r= 0.999 and the cumulative volume loss at a rate of 97.5%. Burdur Lake experienced a significant reduction in its area decreasing from 206 to 120 km2 (42%) between 1984 and 2022. Furthermore, the water volume of the lake decreased by 2.70 km3 over a span of 38 years. This study demonstrates the potential and limitations of the presented UAV-remote sensing integration. Our proposed method is beneficial for determining short and long-term water levels and volumetric changes with high accuracy.

TI  - Remote sensing for chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) monitoring research 2003-2022: A bibliometric analysis based on the web of science core database.
T2  - Marine pollution bulletin
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) occupies a critical part in biogeochemistry and energy flux of aquatic ecosystems. CDOM research spans in many fields, including chemistry, marine environment, biomass cycling, physics, hydrology, and climate change. In recent years, a series of remarkable research milestone have been achieved. On the basis of reviewing the research process of CDOM, combined with a bibliometric analysis, this study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the development and applications of remote sensing in monitoring CDOM from 2003 to 2022. The findings show that remote sensing data plays an important role in CDOM research as proven with the increasing number of publications since 2003, particularly in China and the United States. Primary research areas have gradually changed from studying absorption and fluorescence properties to optimization of remote sensing inversion models in recent years. Since the composition of oceanic and freshwater bodies differs significantly, it is important to choose the appropriate inversion method for different types of water body. At present, the monitoring of CDOM mainly relies on a single sensor, but the fusion of images from different sensors can be considered a major research direction due to the complex characteristics of CDOM. Therefore, in the future, the characteristics of CDOM will be studied in depth inn combination with multi-source data and other application models, where inversion algorithms will be optimized, inversion algorithms with low dependence on measured data will be developed, and a transportable inversion model will be built to break the regional limitations of the model and to promote the development of CDOM research in a deeper and more comprehensive direction.

TI  - Remote sensing algorithm for retrieving global-scale sea surface solar irradiance.
T2  - Environmental monitoring and assessment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This paper presents a new remote sensing (RS) algorithm for retrieving instantaneous sea surface solar irradiance (SR) by using the XGBoost (XGB) package in RStudio and available remote sensing data along with ground-truth solar irradiance data. By means of XGB, the new RS algorithm, called LSU model, was structurally built with nine key RS parameters, including photosynthetically available radiation (PAR); instantaneous PAR (iPAR); water leaving reflectance Rrs at wavelengths 412, 443, 469, and 488 nm; angstrom; aerosol optical thickness (aot_869); and latitude that represent major sources and sinks of solar irradiance, as model input variables. Among the nine parameters, the most important four parameters are PAR, iPAR, latitude, and aot_869. It was found that the sea surface SR is highly affected by conditions in both the atmosphere and the seawater. The aot_869 is by far the most important factor describing the effects of the atmospheric absorption and scattering of SR before reaching the sea surface. The most important factors describing the effects of seawater characteristics on solar irradiance are PAR, iPAR, and latitude. Comparisons with existing SR models indicate that LSU model is scientifically sound due to the use of major source and sink factors of SR as model input variables. LSU model is also technically accurate due to its fine resolution (1*1 km) and overall best performance in predicting instantaneous SR. More importantly, LSU model is globally applicable as it can be utilized to obtain global-scale SR data for any day, any time, and anywhere in the world.

TI  - Trends in the pre-operative diagnosis and surgical management of axillary lymph node metastases in women with screen-detected breast cancer.
T2  - Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - AIM: The aim of the current study was to investigate time-trends in pre-operative diagnosis and surgical treatment of axillary lymph node metastases in breast cancers detected at screening mammography.METHODS: We included all women who underwent screening mammography in the South of the Netherlands between 2005 and 2020. During a follow-up period of at least two years, data on clinical radiological examinations, biopsy procedures and surgical interventions were obtained. The 15 years of inclusion were divided into five cohorts of three years each.RESULTS: Of the 4049 women with invasive breast cancer, 22.1% (896/4049) had axillary lymph node metastasis at pathology (ALN+). Percutaneous axillary biopsy was performed in 39.6% (355/896) of these women, with the proportions of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) decreasing from 97.6% (40/41) in 2005-2007 to 41.6% (37/89) in 2017-2019 and core needle biopsy (CNB) rising from 2.4% (1/41) in 2005-2007 to 58.4% (52/89) in 2017-2019 (P<0.001). Sensitivity of FNAB and CNB was comparable (77.4% (188/243, 95%CI=71%-82%) versus 82.4% (103/125), 95%CI=74%-88%) (P=0.26). Pre-operative confirmation of ALN+by percutaneous biopsy ranged from 27.3% (56/205) in 2011-2013 to 39.0% (80/205) in 2017-2019, with no significant trend changes over time (P=0.103). The proportion of ALN+women who underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) decreased from 96.0% (97/101) in 2005-2007 to 16.6% (34/205) in 2017-2019 (P<0.001).CONCLUSION: Pre-operative confirmation of axillary lymph node metastasis by ultrasound-guided biopsy did not rise despite the increased use of CNB at the expense of less invasive FNAB. A significant reduction in ALND was observed through the years.

TI  - Assessing the suitability of lakes and reservoirs for recreation using Landsat 8.
T2  - Environmental monitoring and assessment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Water clarity has long been used as a visual indicator of the condition of water quality. The clarity of waters is generally valued for esthetic and recreational purposes. Water clarity is often assessed using a Secchi disk attached to a measured line and lowered to a depth where it can be no longer seen. We have applied an approach which uses atmospherically corrected Landsat 8 data to estimate the water clarity in freshwater bodies by using the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) and Contrast Theory to predict Secchi depths for more than 270 lakes and reservoirs across the continental US. We found that incorporating Landsat 8 spectral data into methodologies created to retrieve the inherent optical properties (IOP) of coastal waters was effective at predicting in situ measures of the clarity of inland water bodies. The predicted Secchi depths were used to evaluate the recreational suitability for swimming and recreation using an assessment framework developed from public perception of water clarity. Results showed approximately 54% of the water bodies in our dataset were classified as "marginally suitable to suitable" with approximately 31% classed as "eminently suitable" and approximately 15% classed as "totally unsuitable-unsuitable". The implications are that satellites engineered for terrestrial applications can be successfully used with traditional ocean color algorithms and methods to measure the water quality of freshwater environments. Furthermore, operational land-based satellite sensors have the temporal repeat cycles, spectral resolution, wavebands, and signal-to-noise ratios to be repurposed to monitor water quality for public use and trophic status of complex inland waters.

TI  - Bionomics of malaria vectors in Lao PDR, 2018-2020: entomological surveillance as a key tool for malaria elimination.
T2  - Malaria journal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Lao PDR National Strategic Plan for malaria control and elimination for year 2021-2025 emphasizes the importance of routine entomological surveillance being conducted in areas with high transmission and in active malaria foci in elimination targeted areas. The collection of entomological surveillance data that is closely linked to recent epidemiological data is crucial for improving impact, as it contributes to the evidence package that supports operational and strategic decision-making of national malaria programmes, as they accelerate their last mile of elimination.METHODS: The Center for Malariology Parasitology and Epidemiology (CMPE) entomology team conducted entomological surveillance activities at 13 sentinel sites in 8 provinces and at active transmission foci sites from 2018 to 2020. The techniques used for the mosquito collection were indoor and outdoor human landing collections (from houses and from cultivation areas) and cattle baited net trap collections.RESULTS: There were 5601 Anopheles mosquito females captured and identified throughout the study, on both human and cow bait. They represented 15 different species or species complexes. The primary malaria vectors as well as the secondary vectors were present in all collection sites in the south, indicating that people living in these rural areas with high malaria incidence are exposed to the vectors. The vectors were highly zoophilic, but they still bite humans throughout the night with a high peak of activity before midnight, both indoors and outdoors. Overall, 17% of the malaria vectors were collected indoors when the people are sleeping. This confirms the importance of bed net use during the night. Thirty-two percent of primary and secondary vectors were collected outdoors at times when people are usually awake and outdoors, which shows that people are exposed to potentially infectious mosquitoes and the importance of personal protection at these times. The findings showed that residual transmission may occur outdoors in the villages, and outside the villages in cultivation fields and forested areas. Epidemiological data showed that transmission was higher in surveillance sites which were targeted as part of a malaria response rather than sentinel sites.CONCLUSIONS: Understanding where and how transmission is persisting, monitoring and mapping vector species distribution in areas with active transmission, monitoring biting trends, and designing evidence based and effective vector control interventions are critical to accelerating progress toward malaria elimination. In this context, the role of entomological surveillance combined with epidemiological data should be considered as a cornerstone in achieving malaria elimination.

AB  - Potential acute and chronic human health effects associated with exposure to cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins, including respiratory symptoms, are an understudied public health concern. We examined the relationship between estimated cyanobacteria biomass and the frequency of respiratory-related hospital visits for residents living near Green Bay, Lake Michigan, Wisconsin during 2017-2019. Remote sensing data from the Cyanobacteria Assessment Network was used to approximate cyanobacteria exposure through creation of a metric for cyanobacteria chlorophyll-a (ChlBS). We obtained counts of hospital visits for asthma, wheezing, and allergic rhinitis from the Wisconsin Hospital Association for ZIP codes within a 3-mile radius of Green Bay. We analyzed weekly counts of hospital visits versus cyanobacteria, which was modelled as a continuous measure (ChlBS) or categorized according to World Health Organization's (WHO) alert levels using Poisson generalized linear models. Our data included 2743 individual hospital visits and 114 weeks of satellite derived cyanobacteria biomass indicator data. Peak values of ChlBS were observed between the months of June and October. Using the WHO alert levels, 60% of weeks were categorized as no risk, 19% as Vigilance Level, 15% as Alert Level 1, and 6% as Alert Level 2. In Poisson regression models adjusted for temperature, dewpoint, season, and year, there was no association between ChlBS and hospital visits (rate ratio [RR] [95% Confidence Interval (CI)]=0.98 [0.77, 1.24]). There was also no consistent association between WHO alert level and hospital visits when adjusting for covariates (Vigilance Level: RR [95% CI] 0.88 [0.74, 1.05], Alert Level 1: 0.82 [0.67, 0.99], Alert Level 2: 0.98 [0.77, 1.24], compared to the reference no risk category). Our methodology and model provide a template for future studies that assess the association between cyanobacterial blooms and respiratory health.

TI  - What are the characteristics of participatory surveillance systems for influenza-like-illness?
T2  - Journal of global health
M3  - Systematic Review
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Seasonal influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 9.4 million hospitalisations and 290000-650000 respiratory related-deaths globally each year. Influenza can also cause mild illness, which is why not all symptomatic persons might necessarily be tested for influenza. To monitor influenza activity, healthcare facility-based syndromic surveillance for influenza-like illness is often implemented. Participatory surveillance systems for influenza-like illness (ILI) play an important role in influenza surveillance and can complement traditional facility-based surveillance systems to provide real-time estimates of influenza-like illness activity. However, such systems differ in designs between countries and contexts, making it necessary to identify their characteristics to better understand how they fit traditional surveillance systems. Consequently, we aimed to investigate the performance of participatory surveillance systems for ILI worldwide.Methods: We systematically searched four databases for relevant articles on influenza participatory surveillance systems for ILI. We extracted data from the included, eligible studies and assessed their quality using the Joanna Briggs Critical Appraisal Tools. We then synthesised the findings using narrative synthesis.Results: We included 39 out of 3797 retrieved articles for analysis. We identified 26 participatory surveillance systems, most of which sought to capture the burden and trends of influenza-like illness and acute respiratory infections among cohorts with risk factors for influenza-like illness. Of all the surveillance system attributes assessed, 52% reported on correlation with other surveillance systems, 27% on representativeness, and 21% on acceptability. Among studies that reported these attributes, all systems were rated highly in terms of simplicity, flexibility, sensitivity, utility, and timeliness. Most systems (87.5%) were also well accepted by users, though participation rates varied widely. However, despite their potential for greater reach and accessibility, most systems (90%) fared poorly in terms of representativeness of the population. Stability was a concern for some systems (60%), as was completeness (50%).Conclusions: The analysis of participatory surveillance system attributes showed their potential in providing timely and reliable influenza data, especially in combination with traditional hospital- and laboratory led-surveillance systems. Further research is needed to design future systems with greater uptake and utility.

TI  - Bayesian regression versus machine learning for rapid age estimation of archaeological features identified with lidar at Angkor.
T2  - Scientific reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Lidar (light-detection and ranging) has revolutionized archaeology. We are now able to produce high-resolution maps of archaeological surface features over vast areas, allowing us to see ancient land-use and anthropogenic landscape modification at previously un-imagined scales. In the tropics, this has enabled documentation of previously archaeologically unrecorded cities in various tropical regions, igniting scientific and popular interest in ancient tropical urbanism. An emerging challenge, however, is to add temporal depth to this torrent of new spatial data because traditional archaeological investigations are time consuming and inherently destructive. So far, we are aware of only one attempt to apply statistics and machine learning to remotely-sensed data in order to add time-depth to spatial data. Using temples at the well-known massive urban complex of Angkor in Cambodia as a case study, a predictive model was developed combining standard regression with novel machine learning methods to estimate temple foundation dates for undated Angkorian temples identified with remote sensing, including lidar. The model's predictions were used to produce an historical population curve for Angkor and study urban expansion at this important ancient tropical urban centre. The approach, however, has certain limitations. Importantly, its handling of uncertainties leaves room for improvement, and like many machine learning approaches it is opaque regarding which predictor variables are most relevant. Here we describe a new study in which we investigated an alternative Bayesian regression approach applied to the same case study. We compare the two models in terms of their inner workings, results, and interpretive utility. We also use an updated database of Angkorian temples as the training dataset, allowing us to produce the most current estimate for temple foundations and historic spatiotemporal urban growth patterns at Angkor. Our results demonstrate that, in principle, predictive statistical and machine learning methods could be used to rapidly add chronological information to large lidar datasets and a Bayesian paradigm makes it possible to incorporate important uncertainties-especially chronological-into modelled temporal estimates.

TI  - Comparing NISAR (Using Sentinel-1), USDA/NASS CDL, and Ground Truth Crop/Non-Crop Areas in an Urban Agricultural Region.
T2  - Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A general limitation in assessing the accuracy of land cover mapping is the availability of ground truth data. At sites where ground truth is not available, potentially inaccurate proxy datasets are used for sub-field-scale resolution investigations at large spatial scales, i.e., in the Contiguous United States. The USDA/NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a popular agricultural land cover dataset due to its high accuracy (>80%), resolution (30 m), and inclusions of many land cover and crop types. However, because the CDL is derived from satellite imagery and has resulting uncertainties, comparisons to available in situ data are necessary for verifying classification performance. This study compares the cropland mapping accuracies (crop/non-crop) of an optical approach (CDL) and the radar-based crop area (CA) approach used for the upcoming NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) L- and S-band mission but using Sentinel-1 C-band data. CDL and CA performance are compared to ground truth data that includes 54 agricultural production and research fields located at USDA's Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) in Maryland, USA. We also evaluate non-crop mapping accuracy using twenty-six built-up and thirteen forest sites at BARC. The results show that the CDL and CA have a good pixel-wise agreement with one another (87%). However, the CA is notably more accurate compared to ground truth data than the CDL. The 2017-2021 mean accuracies for the CDL and CA, respectively, are 77% and 96% for crop, 100% and 94% for built-up, and 100% and 100% for forest, yielding an overall accuracy of 86% for the CDL and 96% for CA. This difference mainly stems from the CDL under-detecting crop cover at BARC, especially in 2017 and 2018. We also note that annual accuracy levels varied less for the CA (91-98%) than for the CDL (79-93%). This study demonstrates that a computationally inexpensive radar-based cropland mapping approach can also give accurate results over complex landscapes with accuracies similar to or better than optical approaches.

TI  - Inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, screen identifies host factors in coronavirus innate immune response as therapeutic targets.
T2  - Communications biology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the beta-coronavirus (beta-CoV) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to cause significant global morbidity and mortality. While vaccines have reduced the overall number of severe infections, there remains an incomplete understanding of viral entry and innate immune activation, which can drive pathology. Innate immune responses characterized by positive feedback between cell death and cytokine release can amplify the inflammatory cytokine storm during beta-CoV-mediated infection to drive pathology. Therefore, there remains an unmet need to understand innate immune processes in response to beta-CoV infections to identify therapeutic strategies. To address this gap, here we used an MHV model and developed a whole genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening approach to elucidate host molecules required for beta-CoV infection and inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in macrophages, a sentinel innate immune cell. Our screen was validated through the identification of the known MHV receptor Ceacam1 as the top hit, and its deletion significantly reduced viral replication due to loss of viral entry, resulting in a downstream reduction in MHV-induced cell death. Moreover, this screen identified several other host factors required for MHV infection-induced macrophage cell death. Overall, these findings demonstrate the feasibility and power of using genome-wide PANoptosis screens in macrophage cell lines to accelerate the discovery of key host factors in innate immune processes and suggest new targets for therapeutic development to prevent beta-CoV-induced pathology.

TI  - Land cover dataset of the China Central-Asia West-Asia Economic Corridor from 1993 to 2018.
T2  - Scientific data
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Land Cover (LC) maps offer vital knowledge for various studies, ranging from sustainable development to climate change. The China Central-Asia West-Asia Economic Corridor region, as a core component of the Belt and Road initiative program, has been experiencing some of the most severe LC change tragedies, such as the Aral Sea crisis and Lake Urmia shrinkage, in recent decades. Therefore, there is a high demand for producing a fine-resolution, spatially-explicit, and long-term LC dataset for this region. However, except China, such dataset for the rest of the region (Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Iran) is currently lacking. Here, we constructed a historical set of six 30-m resolution LC maps between 1993 and 2018 at 5-year time intervals for the seven countries where nearly 200,000 Landsat scenes were classified into nine LC types within Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. The generated LC maps displayed high accuracies. This publicly available dataset has the potential to be broadly applied in environmental policy and management.

TI  - Fisheries data management systems inthe NW Mediterranean: from data collection to web visualization.
T2  - Database : the journal of biological databases and curation
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The European Union Data Collection Framework (DCF) states that scientific data-driven assessments are essential to achieve sustainable fisheries. To respond to the DCF call, this study introduces the information systems developed and used by Institut Catala de Recerca per a la Governanca del Mar (ICATMAR), the Catalan Institute of Research for the Governance of the Seas. The information systems include data from a biological monitoring, curation, processing, analysis, publication and web visualization for bottom trawl fisheries. Over the 4years of collected data (2019-2022), the sampling program developed a dataset of over 1.1 million sampled individuals accounting for 24.6 tons of catch. The sampling data are ingested into a database through a data input website ensuring data management control and quality. The standardized metrics are automatically calculated and the data are published in the web visualizer, combined with fishing landings and Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) records. As the combination of remote sensing data with fisheries monitoring offers new approaches for ecosystem assessment, the collected fisheries data are also visualized in combination with georeferenced seabed habitats from the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet), climate and sea conditions from Copernicus Monitoring Environment Marine Service (CMEMS) on the web browser. Three public web-based products have been developed in the visualizer: geolocated bottom trawl samplings, biomass distribution per port or season and length-frequency charts per species. These information systems aim to fulfil the gaps in the scientific community, administration and civil society to access high-quality data for fisheries management, following the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) principles, enabling scientific knowledge transfer.

TI  - Snowshoe hare virus: discovery, distribution, vector and host associations, and medical significance.
T2  - Journal of medical entomology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Snowshoe hare virus (SSHV), within the California serogroup of the genus Orthobunyavirus, family Peribunyaviridae, was first isolated from a snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) in Montana, United States, in 1959. The virus, closely related to LaCrosse virus (LACV) and Chatanga virus (CHATV), occurs across Canada and the northern latitudes of the United States, primarily in the northern tier of states bordering Canada. Reports of SSHV in northern Europe and Asia are probably the closely related to CHATV, or the less closely related Tahyna virus. Vertebrate associations include snowshoe hares and ground squirrels, demonstrated by field isolation of virus from wild-caught animals, seroconversion of snowshoe hares, seroconversion of sentinel rabbits, isolation of virus from sentinel rabbits, and experimental infections demonstrating viremia. Isolations of virus from field populations of mosquitoes include primarily univoltine and boreal mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, Culiseta impatiens and Culiseta inornata; and, rarely, certain multivoltine floodwater Aedes species. Experimental transmission studies in mosquitoes show infection in and transmission by boreal Aedes and Culiseta inornata. Isolation of SSHV from larval Aedes on three occasions, and experimentation in Culiseta inornata, reveal transovarial transmission of the virus in mosquitoes. Serosurveys reveal exposure to SSHV in human and domestic animals, with rates of seropositivity commonly high in some settings in Alaska and Canada, but disease in humans or horses has rarely been reported, only in Canada.

TI  - Introducing seasonal influenza vaccine in Bhutan: Country experience and achievements.
T2  - Vaccine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Bhutan successfully introduced multiple vaccines since the establishment of the Vaccine Preventable Disease Program in 1979. Surveillance and subsequent introduction of influenza vaccination became a public health priority for the Ministry of Health following the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. Sentinel surveillance for influenza in Bhutan began in 2008, and a study of severe acute respiratory infection was conducted in 2017, which found the highest influenza burden in children aged <5years and adults ≥50years. Following review of surveillance and burden of disease data, the National Technical Advisory Group presented recommendations to Bhutan's Ministry of Health which approved influenza vaccine introduction for all five high-risk groups in the country. Upon the official launch of the program in June 2018, the Vaccine Preventable Disease Program began planning, budgeting, and procurement processes with technical and financial support from the Partnership for Influenza Vaccine Introduction, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Bhutan Health Trust Fund, and the World Health Organization. Influenza vaccination for high-risk groups was integrated into Bhutan's routine immunization services in all health care facilities beginning in November 2019 and vaccinated all populations in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Coverage levels between 2019 and 2022 were highest in children aged 6-24months (62.5%-96.9%) and lowest in pregnant women (47.7%-62.5%). Bhutan maintained high coverage levels despite the COVID-19 pandemic by continued provision of influenza vaccine services at health centers during lockdowns, conducting communication and sensitization efforts, and using catch-up campaigns. Bhutan's experience with introducing and scaling up the influenza vaccine program contributed to the country's capacity to rapidly deploy its COVID-19 vaccination program in 2021.

TI  - Molybdenum target mammography-based prediction model for metastasis of axillary sentinel lymph node in early-stage breast cancer.
T2  - Medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is closely related to axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. However, SLN biopsy has certain limitations due to invasiveness and diagnostic efficiency. This study aimed to develop a model to predict the risk of axillary SLN metastasis in early-stage breast cancer based on mammography, a noninvasive, cost-effective, and potential complementary way. Herein, 649 patients with early-stage breast cancer (cT1-T2) who received SLN biopsy were assigned to the training cohort (n = 487) and the validation cohort (n = 162). A prediction model based on specific characteristics of tumor mass in mammography was developed and validated with R software. The performance of model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis. Tumor margins, spicular structures, calcification, and tumor size were independent predictors of SLN metastasis (all P < .05). A nomogram showed a satisfactory performance with an AUC of 0.829 (95% CI = 0.792-0.865) in the training cohort and an AUC of 0.825 (95% CI = 0.763-0.888) in validation cohort. The consistency between model-predicted results and actual observations showed great Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit (P = .104). Patients could benefit from clinical decisions guided by the present model within the threshold probabilities of 6% to 84%. The prediction model for axillary SLN metastasis showed satisfactory discrimination, calibration abilities, and wide clinical practicability. These findings suggest that our prediction model based on mammography characteristics is a reliable tool for predicting SLN metastasis in patients with early-stage breast cancer.

T2  - International journal of biological macromolecules
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In the work, zein-yeast carboxymethyl glucan (ZY) particles were fabricated by a novel ultrasonic assisted anti-solvent precipitation (ASP) method, which was a good delivery system for resveratrol. The particle size and zeta-potential of ZY samples were detected by Zetasizer Pro analyzer, they gradually increased as the mass ratio of zein and yeast carboxymethyl glucan (YCG) changed from 10:1 to 10:5. The intermolecular interactions were investigated by zeta-potentiometric analyzer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. Electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effects between zein and YCG molecules were identified as the main driving forces in the formation of ZY particles. The optimized ZY (10:3) binary particles were used as delivery system for encapsulating and protecting resveratrol. They had high encapsulation efficiency (85.4 %) and loading capacity (6.1 %), and increased the retention rate of resveratrol by 2.10 and 1.21 folds after exposure to light and heat conditions, effectively protect resveratrol against light and thermal degradation. These particles also delayed the release of resveratrol in simulated gastrointestinal digestion, which might improve its oral bioavailability. In conclusion, ZY binary particles could be regarded as a useful and promising delivery vehicle, which might contribute to the application of hydrophobic bioactive ingredients in functional foods.

TI  - Greater predisposition to second generation anticoagulant rodenticide exposure in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) weakened by suspected infectious disease.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Anticoagulant rodenticide (AR) exposure in wild carnivores is a current and global concern due to continuous and widespread use worldwide. We studied the prevalence of ARs in liver samples of 25 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), 3 European badgers (Meles meles) and 2 genets (Genneta genneta) from Alicante (Spanish Levante region) obtained in 2021 and 2022. In addition to trauma, poisoning by pesticides is the most frequent cause of death in wild carnivores in this region. The present research aims to explain a possible association between the fact of suffering from an infectious disease and the increase in ARs concentrations in the affected animals. Both first- and second-generation ARs were analysed by HPLC/MS/TOF in liver samples. Apart from the cause of death, the influence of other variables such as age, sex and body weight were also assessed on AR liver concentrations. Potential health risks for individuals and populations in the study area have also been studied. Our research detected higher AR concentrations in the group of red foxes clinically diagnosed with infectious disease compared to the group of apparently healthy red foxes, mostly killed by trauma. Furthermore, our results lead us to suggest that red fox could be considered a good sentinel species for the risk of exposure to ARs in other wild mammals. All the livers analysed contained ARs and the most detected compounds in red fox were difenacoum, bromadiolone, brodifacoum, present in all the samples analysed, and flocoumafen (in 96%). Additionally, 53% of the animals had at least one second generation anticoagulant rodenticide (SGAR) above the threshold value reported as triggering adverse health effects (200ng/g). Regarding this, the level of risk in red fox in this area might be classified as high and worrying. Moreover, we suggest that individuals and populations with weakened health due to other diseases (for example, infectious or parasitic diseases) might be more prone to high exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides and, very probably, would be more sensitive to suffering serious effects at lower doses of ARs.

TI  - Multiple existential threats and attitudes towards Muslims in Finland and Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY & APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - We are currently living in a time of several existential threats: the global pandemic COVID-19, climate change, and the 'refugee crisis' caused by violent conflicts and humanitarian catastrophes in Syria, Afghanistan, and Ukraine. These threats do not only affect our well-being but also our sense of control and security, as well as identities and worldviews having also intergroup consequences. In this study, we investigated the links between perceived existential threats (i.e. COVID-19, climate change, and refugee crisis in 2015 that multiplied Muslim population in Europe), national and religious identities, and attitudes towards Muslims (i.e. Muslim refugees, Muslim minority, and Muslim converts) among Christian national majority group members in Finland and Italy in 2020. The results were analysed with multigroup structural equation modelling, and they demonstrated some key differences between how threats perceived from climate change and the refugee crisis in 2015 are translated into the reactions towards Muslims. While threats associated with the refugee crisis were detrimental to outgroup attitudes, climate change threats elicited more positive attitudes towards the outgroups studied. Our preliminary analyses suggested that COVID-19, in turn, seems to elicit feelings of worldview defence through higher levels of national identification with no negative attitudinal ramifications. While Abrahamic identity as a believer was directly associated with more positive attitudes towards Muslims in Italy, it did not account for the link between existential threats and outgroup attitudes. The results are discussed in light of how different threats increase or decrease intergroup harmony.

AB  - Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Boat Detection (VBD) data have been widely used to study the patterns of fishing grounds and their linking to fishery targets, particularly species mainly caught by jiggers. In line with most species in the Ommastrephidae family, the population of Todarodes pacificus is made up of various splinter cohorts concerning the timing and location of hatching. Therefore, the satellite-recorded fishing grounds consist of groups with complex age structures and different migration directions within cohorts. This study examined the age composition of harvestable stocks (age spectrum) of T. pacificus in the Japan Sea based on an early life history individual-based model of T. pacificus and VBD data. Using the age spectrum, we analysed the relationship between fishery effort and the age of the target group. It was found that jiggers most prefer individuals around 310 +/- 20 days. Furthermore, the correlation between ambient water temperature and fishing effort revealed that T. pacificus migrated to colder waters, reaching the coldest waters at 250 +/- 7.5 days before moving back towards warmer waters. We discussed a possible way to use the age-temperature relationship to analyse the flow of VBD distributions to record the movements related to the migration of the fishing target. The results show migration-like trajectories, which are initially parallel to the isotherm, gradually deflect towards lower temperature sides over several months, sharply turn for about a month and then move back with a slight angle to the isotherms. The method provides a potential framework to improve our understanding of the active migration of oceanic squid.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The objective of this study is to establish the detection rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies and to determine the sensitivity and false-negative rate of SLN biopsies compared with those of systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomies in endometrial cancer.Methods: This prospective cohort study enrolled patients with endometrial cancer who were scheduled for surgical staging. Patients with a history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, an abnormal liver function test, or an allergy to indocyanine green (ICG) were excluded. All patients underwent surgical staging with an ICG injection at the cervix. SLNs were identified by a near-infrared fluorescent camera. All SLNs were sent to a pathologist for ultrastaging.ResultsFrom November 2019 to June 2023, 142 patients underwent SLN mapping and surgical staging. SLNs were not detected bilaterally in 8 patients. The detection rate of the SLN biopsies in this study was 91.2%. Thus, the accuracy of the SLN biopsies was 97.6%. The sensitivity for finding metastatic SLNs was 84.2%, with a negative predictive value of 97.22%.Conclusions: A SLN biopsy in endometrial cancer has a high detection rate and high accuracy. However, surgical expertise and a learning curve are required.

TI  - Insight into antimicrobial resistance at a new beef cattle feedlot in western Canada
T2  - MSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In North America, beef production relies on the administration of antimicrobials to manage disease. Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most significant disease of beef cattle, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to conventional therapies presents an existential risk to animal welfare and food production. While AMR surveillance programs are poised to help facilitate antimicrobial stewardship and decision making at feedlots, monitoring strategies for large numbers of animals at an individual or group level are time consuming and costly. Accordingly, we completed a pilot investigation of feedlot water bowls, which is an understudied interface between cattle and bacteria. By performing cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent studies, we demonstrate that water bowl-dwelling bacteria can act as sentinel organisms for clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and that cattle have an impact on the microbial communities in the bowls. Moreover, by sampling water at a feedlot site before animal arrival, we detected resistance to two antibiotics: florfenicol and tulathromycin. After just 4 weeks of operation, multidrug-resistant bacteria were routinely found in most water bowls. A comparison of ARGs encoded by five water bowl bacterial isolates along with previously reported source and wastewater metagenomes to those found in BRD pathogens confirmed the utility of using water samples for AMR surveillance.

T2  - RIBAGUA-REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DEL AGUA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Rio de la Plata estuary, located in southeast South America, is of great social and environmental relevance for the region. In the summer of 2018-2019, an exceptional cyanobacterial bloom was detected along the northern coast of the estuary, which greatly affected tourism and recreation, as reported in previous studies and the public press. This is the first work that uses satellite images to quantitatively monitor the evolution of this bloom in an intermediate zone of the estuary, including its initial and ending stages. Chlorophyll-a threshold maps of 10 and 24 mu g/L were detected from Sentinel-2 imagery between November 2018-May 2019, while the presence of cyanobacteria was confirmed from phytoplankton field samples and a continuous (point) record of phycocyanin fluorescence. The combination of both satellite and in-situ information was crucial to analyze the spatiotemporal variability of the bloom, and to study its qualitative relationship to environmental drivers: local winds, discharge of the Rio de la Plata main tributaries, discharge of a local tributary, water temperature and salinity. Our study shows the complexity of short-term bloom dynamics in a coastal region of the Rio de la Plata, particularly highlighting the role of local winds on surface transport and mixing conditions.

T2  - Transfusion clinique et biologique : journal de la Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The discovery of the Duffy antigen is of great significance, given its essential role in immune response and various physiological processes. Genetic mutations in the Duffy gene not only affect antigen expression but also result in different antigen types. This underscores the importance of genetic characterization for clinical studies and exploring genetic diversity within the population. This study primarily aims to genetically characterize the Duffy blood group within three Algerian populations: the Zenata, Reguibat, and Oran populations. Methods The genetic polymorphism of the Duffy erythrocyte group was examined, focusing on five allelic versions of the ACKR1 locus: FY*01, FY*02, FY*X, and silent alleles FY*01N.01 and FY*02N.01. A total of 223 Algerian individuals, including 90 from the Oran population, 66 from the Zenata population, and 67 from the Reguibat population, were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primer (PCR-SSP) method. The results revealed the presence of the silent alleles (FY*01N.01 and FY*02N.01) in all three populations, with a total frequency of 78.03% in the Zenata population. Additionally, the FY*X allele was exclusively detected in the Reguibat population, with a frequency of 0.75% Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the allele and genotypic frequencies of the Duffy system in the Zenata, Reguibat and Oranpopulations, contributing to our understanding of the genetic history and origins of the Algerian population. Further research incorporating additional genetic markers and establishing a comprehensive database would enhance our knowledge in this area.

TI  - Intraspecific genetic lineages of a marine mussel show behavioural divergence when exposed to microplastic leachates.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Worldwide, microplastic pollution has numerous negative implications for marine biota, exacerbating the effects of other forms of global anthropogenic disturbance. Mounting evidence shows that microplastics (MPs) not only cause physical damage through their ingestion, but also act as vectors for hazardous compounds by leaching absorbed and adsorbed chemicals. Research on the effects of plastic pollution has, however, largely assumed that species respond uniformly, while ignoring intraspecific diversity (i.e., variation within a single species). We investigated the effects of plastic leachates derived from factory-fresh (virgin) and beached microplastics on the behavioural responses of two genetic lineages of the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Through laboratory behavioural experiments, we found that during exposure to leachates from beached microplastics (beached MPLs), Atlantic specimens moved significantly less than Mediterranean individuals in terms of both (i) proportion of individuals responding through movement and (ii) net and gross distances crawled. In contrast, no significant intraspecific differences were observed in the behaviour of either adults or recruits when exposed to MPLs from virgin microplastics (virgin MPLs). Additionally, the reception of cues from three amino acids (L-cysteine, proline and L-leucine) at increasing concentrations (10-5 M to 10-3 M in charcoal-filtered seawater) was tested by electrophysiological analysis using mussels exposed to beached MPLs or control seawater. We found significant intraspecific differences in response to 10-3 M L-cysteine (regardless of treatment) and 10-4 M L-cysteine (in mussels exposed to beached MPLs) and to 10-3 M proline (in mussels exposed to beached MPLs) and 10-5 M L-leucine. Our study suggests that intraspecific variation in a marine mussel may prompt different responses to plastic pollution, potentially triggered by local adaptation and physiological variability between lineages. Our work highlights the importance of assessing the effects of intraspecific variation, especially in environmental sentinel species as this level of diversity could modulate responses to plastic pollution.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns and control mechanism of the ecosystem carbon use efficiency across the Mongolian Plateau.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Carbon use efficiency (CUE) is a crucial parameter that reflects the carbon storage within ecosystems, providing insight into the potential for carbon sequestration at the ecosystem scale and its feedback on climate change. The Mongolian Plateau exemplifies an arid and semi-arid region with a delicate ecological environment that displays heightened sensitivity to global climate change. Understanding the variation and control of CUE is critical for assessing regional carbon. However, few studies have focused on the interaction of factors influencing CUE; furthermore, how CUE responds to climate change and anthropogenic activities remains unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate spatiotemporal patterns and their control mechanisms by generating CUE data based on multi-source remote sensing data. CUE demonstrated a slow downward trend from 2000 to 2018, with higher values in relatively dry-cool regions and lower values in relatively humid-warm regions. Furthermore, CUE values were ranked by biome as follows: grassland > sandy vegetation > cropland > shrubs > forest, driven by climate characteristics, vegetation coverage, water stress, stand age, and management practices. Additionally, climatic factors affected CUE more than the soil variables, except for alpine meadows. The climate factors of precipitation (PPT), index of water availability (IWA) (QPPT=0.487, QIWA=0.444), and soil factors, e.g., pH and soil organic content (SOC) (QPH=0.397, QSOC=0.372), had the greatest influence on CUE. Finally, most two explanatory factors interacted to effectively enhance the explanation of CUE; the synergy of the IWA and PPT contributed the most to CUE (QIWAPPT=0.604). Moreover, the joint effect of climate change and anthropogenic activities was identified as the major contributor (68%) to the decline in CUE within this region. This study presents compelling evidence highlighting the importance of considering climate change and anthropogenic disturbances in ecosystem management and conservation efforts in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Deep learning to predict breast cancer sentinel lymph node status on INSEMA histological images.
T2  - European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is a clinically important prognostic biomarker in breast cancer and is used to guide therapy, especially for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative cases. However, invasive lymph node staging is increasingly omitted before therapy, and studies such as the randomised Intergroup Sentinel Mamma(INSEMA) trial address the potential for further de-escalation of axillary surgery. Therefore, it would be helpful to accurately predict the pretherapeutic sentinel status using medical images.METHODS: Using a ResNet 50 architecture pretrained on ImageNet and a previously successful strategy, we trained deep learning (DL)-based image analysis algorithms to predict sentinel status on hematoxylin/eosin-stained images of predominantly luminal, primary breast tumours from the INSEMA trial and three additional, independent cohorts (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cohorts from the University hospitals of Mannheim and Regensburg), and compared their performance with that of a logistic regression using clinical data only. Performance on an INSEMA hold-out set was investigated in a blinded manner.RESULTS: None of the generated image analysis algorithms yielded significantly better than random areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves on the test sets, including the hold-out test set from INSEMA. In contrast, the logistic regression fitted on the Mannheim cohortretained a better than random performance on INSEMA and Regensburg. Including the image analysis model output in the logistic regression did not improve performance further on INSEMA.CONCLUSIONS: Employing DL-based image analysis on histological slides, we could not predict SLN status for unseen cases in the INSEMA trial and other predominantly luminal cohorts.

TI  - Quantum Honeypots.
T2  - Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Quantum computation offers unique properties that cannot be paralleled by conventional computers. In particular, reading qubits may change their state and thus signal the presence of an intruder. This paper develops a proof-of-concept for a quantum honeypot that allows the detection of intruders on reading. The idea is to place quantum sentinels within all resources offered within the honeypot. Additional to classical honeypots, honeypots with quantum sentinels can trace the reading activity of the intruder within any resource. Sentinels can be set to be either visible and accessible to the intruder or hidden and unknown to intruders. Catching the intruder using quantum sentinels has a low theoretical probability per sentinel, but the probability can be increased arbitrarily higher by adding more sentinels. The main contributions of this paper are that the monitoring of the intruder can be carried out at the level of the information unit, such as the bit, and quantum monitoring activity is fully hidden from the intruder. Practical experiments, as performed in this research, show that the error rate of quantum computers has to be considerably reduced before implementations of this concept are feasible.

TI  - High-resolution maps show that rubber causes substantial deforestation.
T2  - Nature
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Understanding the effects of cash crop expansion on natural forest is of fundamental importance. However, for most crops there are no remotely sensed global maps1, and global deforestation impacts are estimated using models and extrapolations. Natural rubber is an example of a principal commodity for which deforestation impacts have been highly uncertain, with estimates differing more than fivefold1-4. Here we harnessed Earth observation satellite data and cloud computing5 to produce high-resolution maps of rubber (10m pixel size) and associated deforestation (30m pixel size) forSoutheast Asia. Our maps indicate that rubber-related forest loss has been substantiallyunderestimated in policy, by the public and in recent reports6-8. Our direct remotely sensed observations show that deforestation for rubber is at least twofold to threefold higher than suggested by figures now widely used for setting policy4. With more than 4million hectares of forest loss for rubber since 1993 (at least 2million hectares since 2000) and more than 1million hectares of rubber plantations established in Key Biodiversity Areas, the effects of rubber on biodiversity and ecosystem services in Southeast Asia could be extensive. Thus, rubber deserves more attention in domestic policy, within trade agreements and in incoming due-diligence legislation.

TI  - Near real-time flood inundation and hazard mapping of Baitarani River Basin using Google Earth Engine and SAR imagery.
T2  - Environmental monitoring and assessment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Flood inundation mapping and satellite imagery monitoring are critical and effective responses during flood events. Mapping of a flood using optical data is limited due to the unavailability of cloud-free images. Because of its capacity to penetrate clouds and operate in all kinds of weather, synthetic aperture radar is preferred for water inundation mapping. Flood mapping in Eastern India's Baitarani River Basin for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 was performed in this study using Sentinel-1 imagery and Google Earth Engine with Otsu's algorithm. Different machine-learning algorithms were used to map the LULC of the study region. Dual polarizations VH and VV and their combinations VV*VH, VV+VH, VH-VV, VV-VH, VV/VH, and VH/VV were examined to identify non-water and water bodies. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) map derived from Sentinel-2 data validated the surface water inundation with 80% accuracy. The total inundated areas were identified as 440.3 km2 in 2018, 268.58 km2 in 2019, 178.40 km2 in 2020, 203.79 km2 in 2021, and 321.33 km2 in 2022, respectively. The overlap of flood maps on the LULC map indicated that flooding highly affected agriculture and urban areas in these years. The approach using the near-real-time Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and GEE platform can be operationalized for periodic flood mapping, helps develop flood control measures, and helps enhance flood management. The generated annual flood inundation maps are also useful for policy development, agriculture yield estimation, crop insurance framing, etc.

TI  - LULC change detection using support vector machines and cellular automata-based ANN models in Guna Tana watershed of Abay basin, Ethiopia.
T2  - Environmental monitoring and assessment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Recurrent changes recorded in LULC in Guna Tana watershed are a long-standing problem due to the increase in urbanization and agricultural lands. This research aims at identifying and predicting frequent changes observed using support vector machines (SVM) for supervised classification and cellular automata-based artificial neural network (CA-ANN) models for prediction in the quantum geographic information systems (QGIS) plugin MOLUSCE. Multi-temporal spatial Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imageries, Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus 7 (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were used to find the acute problem the watershed is facing. Accuracy was assessed using the confusion matrix in ArcGIS 10.4 produced from ground truth data and Google Earth Pro. The results acquired from kappa statistics for 1991, 2007, and 2021 were 0.78, 0.83, and 0.88 respectively. The change detection trend indicates that urban land cover has an increasing trend throughout the entire period. In the future trend, agriculture land may shoot up to 86.79% and 86.78% of land use class in 2035 and 2049. Grassland may attenuate by 0.03% but the forest land will substantially diminish by 0.01% from 2035 to 2049. The increase of land specifically was observed in agriculture from 3128.4 to 3130 km2. Judicious planning and proper execution may resolve the water management issues incurred in the basin to secure the watershed.

TI  - Determining urban growth in response to land use dynamics using multilayer perceptron and Markov chain models in a metropolitan city: past and future
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Monitoring changes in land use and land cover over a specific timeframe and predicting future trends is paramount due to its increasing influence on local, regional and global environments. This study analyzes the dynamics of land use and land cover patterns, rapid urban expansion and the underlying driving forces in the past three decades in Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), West Bengal. To establish the relationship between land use/land cover dynamics and built-up expansion from 1990 to 2040, this study utilizes multi-temporal satellite data (Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-8 OLI) and census data, employing models such as MLP-based Markov chain models. The analysis reveals that the highest transformation occurred in green spaces, followed by fallow lands and water bodies, as they were converted into built-up areas and also there is potentiality of expansion around 6129.06 ha area of built-up at the cost of 1053.35 ha water body, 164.48 ha fallow land and 4911.23 ha green spaces up to the year 2040. Kolkata, the third-ranking megacity in India and the capital of West Bengal, faces immense pressure for land transformation due to its Kolkata Municipal Corporation floating population 6 million, surpassing the total residential population of 4.5 million. This rapid urbanization is driven by the need for residential facilities, administrative services, business and commercial services, and employment opportunities. Statistical analysis demonstrates a strong correlation (coefficient of determination = 0.93) between built-up expansion and population growth. These results will support government officials, urban planners and researchers in making decisions and planning for future cities, with a focus on environmentally friendly and sustainable urban development, not just in Kolkata Municipal Corporation but also in other major urban areas.

TI  - Comparing Three Methods of Selecting Training Samples in Supervised Classification of Multispectral Remote Sensing Images.
T2  - Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Selecting training samples is crucial in remote sensing image classification. In this paper, we selected three images-Sentinel-2, GF-1, and Landsat 8-and employed three methods for selecting training samples: grouping selection, entropy-based selection, and direct selection. We then used the selected training samples to train three supervised classification models-random forest (RF), support-vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN)-and evaluated the classification results of the three images. According to the experimental results, the three classification models performed similarly. Compared with the entropy-based method, the grouping selection method achieved higher classification accuracy using fewer samples. In addition, the grouping selection method outperformed the direct selection method with the same number of samples. Therefore, the grouping selection method performed the best. When using the grouping selection method, the image classification accuracy increased with the increase in the number of samples within a certain sample size range.

TI  - Assessment of the regeneration of landslides areas using unsupervised and supervised methods and explainable machine learning models
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Regeneration after landslides is how an ecosystem recovers itself following a landslide event. Natural systems can recover and regenerate over time. The main objective of the current work is to identify and characterise the regeneration pattern after a great landslide event in 2013 in the Guerrero state (Mexico) using remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and machine learning techniques. Remarkably, the authors consider normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy of part of this "regeneration" in the present work. A first methodology attempt presented here was to monitor and characterise the "regeneration" after severe landslide events. First, the authors calculated and identified the (1) losses, (2) speed and (3) recovery time through a continuous change detection and classification algorithm (CCDC) in Google Earth Engine (GEE) from a NDVI-Landsat time series (from 1984 to 2021). Second, these three factors were introduced as variables in a not supervised machine-learning model to get 5 clusters that characterise the different regeneration patterns followed from 2013 to 2021 in the landslide zones. Finally, we studied 16 variables like elevation, slope, or soil pH. The authors included those variables in a supervised machine learning classification to find the most important main drivers related to the NDVI regeneration of the landslide areas. The results showed that the cluster called Group 0 had a low loss of NDVI value, speed and medium recovery time. Group 1 showed a medium-high loss, high speed and low recovery time. Group 2 reached a high loss, a low speed, and an increased recovery time. Group 3 with a medium loss, a medium speed, and a low recovery time. Finally, Group 4 with a high loss of NDVI, a medium speed, and a medium recovery time. Distance to the edge of the landslide, precipitation, land cover type and lithology are highlighted as the main drivers in landslide regeneration.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of dam construction on extreme shrinkage of Urmia Lake using spatial data.
T2  - Environmental monitoring and assessment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In this study, the extreme shrinkage of Urmia Lake is investigated, aiming to assess the impact of anthropogenic factors, particularly the over-construction of dams and natural anomalies associated with climate change. Historically available multispectral spatial data obtained from Landsat missions 4-5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI were utilized which totally covers a period of 36 years (1967-2020). Additionally, this data was employed to identify the locations of constructed water reservoirs and determine their construction timelines by analyzing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). To examine the temporal patterns of annual precipitation in the lake basin, we obtained time series data from historical precipitation records, which were then converted into rasterized format. Our findings indicate that approximately 22% of the lake basin has been designated for feeding dam reservoirs. The impact of precipitation anomalies on the lake's water level was found to be relatively less significant when compared to the increased storage capacity of the dams. Furthermore, the construction of dams prior to 2000 contributed to enhancing the lake's stability during periods of drought. However, the substantial increase in the total storage capacity of dams after 2000 has significantly accelerated the shrinkage process. As a result, it was concluded that any effective rescue plan should prioritize ignoring a considerable portion of the reservoirs' storage capacity by releasing stored water, thereby allowing the lake to attain a stable condition.

TI  - Expression of taste sentinels, T1R, T2R, and PLCSS2, on the passageway for olfactory signals in zebrafish.
T2  - Chemical senses
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The senses of taste and smell detect overlapping sets of chemical compounds in fish, e.g. amino acids are detected by both senses. However, so far taste and smell organs appeared morphologically to be very distinct, with a specialized olfactory epithelium for detection of odors and taste buds located in the oral cavity and lip for detection of tastants. Here we report dense clusters of cells expressing T1R and T2R receptors as well as their signal transduction molecule PLCSS2 in nostrils of zebrafish, i.e. on the entrance funnel through which odor molecules must pass to be detected by olfactory sensory neurons. Quantitative evaluation shows the density of these chemosensory cells in the nostrils to be as high or higher than that in the established taste organs oral cavity and lower lip. Hydrodynamic flow is maximal at the nostril rim enabling high throughput chemosensation in this organ. Taken together, our results suggest a sentinel function for these chemosensory cells in the nostril.

TI  - Prophylactic complex physiotherapy in gynecologic cancer survivors: patient-reported outcomes based on a lymphedema questionnaire
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ObjectiveLower extremity lymphedema secondary to cancer treatment impacts quality of life for gynecological cancer survivors. Complex decongestive physiotherapy is applied when lymphedema is diagnosed, but prophylactic physiotherapy is not yet a standard of care. The aim of this study is to evaluate prophylactic complex physiotherapy in patients with gynecological cancer and its effects on patient-reported symptoms based on the Gynecologic Cancer Lymphedema Questionnaire.MethodsThe data of patients diagnosed with gynecological cancers who underwent lymphadenectomy from July 2021 to June 2022 was evaluated. All patients were referred to the physiotherapy unit before adjuvant treatment. Patients who accepted prophylactic physiotherapy were informed and massage and exercise training were implemented, whereas patients who declined were solely informed. Bilateral lower extremity circumferences were measured at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months at the levels of 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm above the heels. A translated form of the Gynecologic Cancer Lymphedema Questionnaire was administered to all patients at the last visit.ResultsA total of 100 patients were included in the study. Patients were diagnosed with endometrial (50%), ovarian (32%), cervical (16%), and vulvar (2%) cancer. Overall, 70% underwent systematic pelvic +/- para-aortic lymphadenectomy whereas sentinel lymph node mapping was performed in 30%. Lymphedema was seen in 5% (n=3) of the prophylactic physiotherapy positive group and in 60% (n=24) of the physiotherapy negative group. The median score was 3 (range 1-5) in the physiotherapy positive group and 16 (range 9-20) in the physiotherapy negative group. In patients diagnosed with lymphedema in the physiotherapy negative group, systematic lymphadenectomy was performed in 91.7% (n=22) and a higher number of lymph nodes was extracted (median 45.5; p=0.002).ConclusionProphylactic complex physiotherapy is associated with lower rates of lymphedema and better patient-reported symptom scores according to the Gynecologic Cancer Lymphedema Questionnaire.

TI  - Using MammaPrint on core needle biopsy to guide the need for axillary staging during breast surgery.
T2  - Surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, the only opportunity to omit axillary staging is with Choosing Wisely criteria for women ages >70 y with cT1 2N0 estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer. However, many women are diagnosed when pathologic node status-negative, raising the question of additional opportunities to omit sentinel lymph node biopsy. We sought to investigate the association between MammaPrint, a genomic test that estimates estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer recurrence risk, and pathologic node status, with the aim that low-risk MammaPrint could be considered for omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy if associated with pathologic node status-negative.METHODS: A single-institution database was queried for all women with cT1 2N0 estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative invasive breast cancer with breast surgery as their first treatment and MammaPrint performed from 2020 to 2021. Patient and tumor factors, including MammaPrint score, were compared with axillary node status for correlation.RESULTS: A total of 668 women met inclusion criteria, with a median age of 66 y. MammaPrint was low-risk luminal A in 481 (72%) and high-risk luminal B in 187 (28%). At the time of breast surgery, 588 (88%) had sentinel lymph node biopsy, 27 (4%) had axillary lymph node dissection, and 53 (7.9%) had no axillary staging. Most women in both the pathologic node status-negative and pathologic node status-positive cohorts had low-risk MammaPrint (355 [73.3%] pathologic node status-negative vs 91 [69.5%] pathologic node status-positive), and women with low-risk MammaPrint did not have a significantly lower risk of pathologic node status-positive (P= .377).CONCLUSION: Low-risk MammaPrint does not predict lower risk of pathologic node status-positive breast cancer. Based on our results, genomic testing does not appear to provide additional personalization for the ability to omit sentinel lymph node biopsy for patients outside of the Choosing Wisely guidelines.

TI  - How Long Do Runoff-Generated Debris-Flow Hazards Persist After Wildfire?
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Runoff-generated debris flows are a potentially destructive and deadly response to wildfire until sufficient vegetation and soil-hydraulic recovery have reduced susceptibility to the hazard. Elevated debris-flow susceptibility may persist for several years, but the controls on the timespan of the susceptible period are poorly understood. To evaluate the connection between vegetation recovery and debris-flow occurrence, we calculated recovery for 25 fires in the western United States using satellite-derived leaf area index (LAI) and compared recovery estimates to the timing of 536 debris flows from the same fires. We found that the majority (>98%) of flows occurred when LAI was less than 2/3 of typical prefire values. Our results show that total vegetation recovery is not necessary to inhibit runoff-generated flows in a wide variety of regions in the western United States. Satellite-derived vegetation data show promise for estimating the timespan of debris-flow susceptibility.

TI  - A Convolutional Neural Network with Spatial Location Integration for Nearshore Water Depth Inversion.
T2  - Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Nearshore water depth plays a crucial role in scientific research, navigation management, coastal zone protection, and coastal disaster mitigation. This study aims to address the challenge of insufficient feature extraction from remote sensing data in nearshore water depth inversion. To achieve this, a convolutional neural network with spatial location integration (CNN-SLI) is proposed. The CNN-SLI is designed to extract deep features from remote sensing data by considering the spatial dimension. In this approach, the spatial location information of pixels is utilized as two additional channels, which are concatenated with the input feature image. The resulting concatenated image data are then used as the input for the convolutional neural network. Using GF-6 remote sensing images and measured water depth data from electronic nautical charts, a nearshore water depth inversion experiment was conducted in the waters near Nanshan Port. The results of the proposed method were compared with those of the Lyzenga, MLP, and CNN models. The CNN-SLI model demonstrated outstanding performance in water depth inversion, with impressive metrics: an RMSE of 1.34 m, MAE of 0.94 m, and R2 of 0.97. It outperformed all other models in terms of overall inversion accuracy and regression fit. Regardless of the water depth intervals, CNN-SLI consistently achieved the lowest RMSE and MAE values, indicating excellent performance in both shallow and deep waters. Comparative analysis with Kriging confirmed that the CNN-SLI model best matched the interpolated water depth, further establishing its superiority over the Lyzenga, MLP, and CNN models. Notably, in this study area, the CNN-SLI model exhibited significant performance advantages when trained with at least 250 samples, resulting in optimal inversion results. Accuracy evaluation on an independent dataset shows that the CNN-SLI model has better generalization ability than the Lyzenga, MLP, and CNN models under different conditions. These results demonstrate the superiority of CNN-SLI for nearshore water depth inversion and highlight the importance of integrating spatial location information into convolutional neural networks for improved performance.

TI  - Warm Clouds Biases in CMIP6 Models Linked to Indirect Effects of Falling Ice-Radiation Interactions Over the Tropical and Subtropical Pacific
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine the spatial distributions of CMIP6-simulated cloud liquid water path (CLWP) and content (CLWC) against MODIS and CloudSat synthesized data over the tropical and subtropical Pacific. Three subsets of models are categorized based on their treatments of frozen ice-radiative interactions. CLWP/CLWC are generally well simulated in subset with separately-calculated radiative effects of cloud ice and falling ice (SON2). Too much warm clouds above 750 hPa are produced in either subset with total frozen ice radiative effects (SON1) or subset without radiative effects of falling ice (NOS) and thus CLWP/CLWC are overestimated over the open ocean including the trade-wind regions. Stratocumulus clouds off the coasts of North and South America are severely underestimated in NOS models. We attribute the overestimates of clouds above the trade-wind boundary layers to anomalous ascending motion associated with warmer sea surface temperature and weaker surface wind stress linked to indirect effects of falling ice-radiation interactions.We explore how different formulations of frozen particle radiative effects in global climate models have effects on the simulation of warm clouds in the subtropical and tropical Pacific. Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models are divided into three subsets for this study. We find that models with a separated treatment of floating ice and falling ice radiative effects (SON2) perform better than models with floating ice radiative effects only (NOS) or combined frozen ice radiative effects (SON1) in terms of biases of cloud liquid water content and cloud liquid water path against satellite measurements. This study suggests that biases in broad-scale meteorological environments such as anomalous ascending motion, warmer sea surface temperature and weaker surface wind stress may cause excessive amounts of warm clouds above the trade-wind boundary layers in NOS and SON1, thereby leading to excessive cloud liquid water.CloudSat-MODIS synthesized estimates of warm cloud liquid water path/content (CLWP/CLWC) are used to evaluate three CMIP6 model subsetsCLWP/CLWC are simulated well with separately-calculated radiative effects of cloud ice and falling ice over subtropical and tropical PacificProduce too much liquid water above 750 hPa over the trade-wind regions in subsets with cloud ice only or total frozen ice radiative effects

TI  - S-5P/TROPOMI-Derived NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> Emissions From Copper/Cobalt Mining and Other Industrial Activities in the Copperbelt (Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia)
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We have analyzed Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data over the Copperbelt mining region (Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia). Despite high background values, annual 2019-2022 means of TROPOMI NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) show local enhancements consistent with six point sources (four copper/cobalt mines, two cities) where high-emission industrial activities take place. We have quantified annual NOx (nitrogen oxides) emissions from these point sources, identified temporal trends in emissions, and found strong correlations with production data from colocated mines and one oil refinery. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Global Anthropogenic (CAMS-GLOB-ANT) version 5 inventory underpredicts TROPOMI-derived emissions and lacks the temporal trends observed in TROPOMI and mine/refinery production. These results demonstrate the potential for satellite monitoring of mining and other industrial activities, often unreported or underestimated, which impact the air quality of local communities. This is particularly important for Africa, where mining is increasing aggressively.

TI  - Imaging the Spatiotemporal Evolution of Plate Coupling With Interferometric Radar (InSAR) in the Hikurangi Subduction Zone
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The coupling at the interface between tectonic plates is a key geophysical parameter to capture the frictional locking across plate boundaries and provides a means to estimate where tectonic strain is accumulating through time. Here, we use both interferometric radar (InSAR) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data to investigate the plate coupling of the Hikurangi subduction zone beneath the North Island of New Zealand, where multiple slow slip cycles are superimposed on the long-term loading. We estimate the plate coupling across the subduction zone over three multi-year observational periods targeting different stages of the slow slip cycle. Our results highlight the importance of the observational time period when interpreting coupling maps, emphasizing the temporal variability of plate coupling. Leveraging multiple geodetic data sets, we demonstrate how InSAR provides powerful constraints on the spatial resolution of both plate coupling and slow fault slip, even in a region where a dense GNSS network exists.Plate coupling as a concept describes to what degree the boundaries between tectonic plates are locked and building up stress. Such accumulated stress (over hundreds to thousands of years) will eventually be released in earthquakes, and therefore provides important information about the potential for future earthquakes. Our study uses satellite data to investigate how coupling between tectonic plates along the Hikurangi subduction zone (New Zealand's largest and most dangerous plate boundary fault) changes with time. We analyzed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar and Global Navigation Satellite System data to map the areas where the plates are stuck together (coupled) and where they move past each other (uncoupled). We show that plate coupling varies significantly in space over 2, 4, and 10-year time scales, highlighting the importance of carefully considering the observational time period when interpreting coupling maps.Integration of high-resolution displacement maps from radar imagery captures plate coupling at fine scalesEstimates of plate coupling depend strongly on the time period over which surface velocities are measuredTemporal variations in plate coupling highlight when and where slow slip dominates the slip budget

TI  - Dominant Cloud Controlling Factors for Low-Level Cloud Fraction: Subtropical Versus Extratropical Oceans
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve cloud feedback understanding and simulation, observations have been used to quantify the rate of change of cloud radiative properties as a function of specific environmental metrics (or cloud controlling factors; CCFs). The study focuses on low-level cloud dominated regions during 2006-2010. For each ocean gridpoint, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients of daily mean observed cloud fraction versus (a) 10-m wind, (b) sensible heat flux (SHF), (c) sea surface temperature, (d) estimated inversion strength (EIS), (e) 850 hPa vertical velocity, and (f) the M parameter ( increment & theta;skin800hPa ${\increment}{\theta }_{\text{skin}}<^>{800\text{hPa}}$) are sorted to identify the dominant CCFs in both extratropics (30 & DEG;-60 & DEG;N/S) and subtropics (30 & DEG;S-30 & DEG;N). A novel map for visualizing dominant CCFs for low-level cloud fraction reveals that: increment & theta;skin800hPa ${\increment}{\theta }_{\text{skin}}<^>{800\text{hPa}}$ dominates in the subtropical stratocumulus regions while 10-m winds dominate in shallow cumulus regions but in the extratropics, a different inversion structure diagnostic (EIS) dominates, while SHF dominates in western boundary current areas.Clouds in the lower levels of the atmosphere cover up to 80% of the oceans in some specific areas within the & PLUSMN;30 & DEG; latitude band (i.e., the subtropics regions) but also cover a large portion of the mid-latitude oceans (i.e., the extratropics). In the subtropics, cloud cover has been found to depend principally on sea surface temperature and the stability or thermal structure of the lower levels of the troposphere. Using satellite observations and reanalysis data, we test whether these relationships are found everywhere, and importantly, we find that these dependencies are not uniform across the global oceans. Where cloud cover is large, stability is the strongest driver of cloud cover, but the atmospheric vertical structure of this stability most strongly correlated with the clouds differs between the subtropics and extratropics. Where cloud cover is relatively small, near surface wind speed has the strongest relationship with cloud cover in the subtropics, while at higher latitudes and more specifically in the western boundary current regions, air-sea energy exchanges (i.e., sensible heat flux) dominate. These regionally varying relationships are depicted with a novel map of dominant cloud controlling factors. This map can help with evaluation and development of climate models.A novel map of dominant controlling factors for low-level oceanic cloud fraction reveals regionally varying patternsSubtropical and extratropical low clouds depend on stability, but the dominant stability metric varies by region, challenging modelsSurface wind speed dominates in cumulus-dominated regions, sensible heat fluxes dominate in western boundary current regions in winter

TI  - The influence of Amazon River connectivity to littoral meanders on long-term carbon accumulation: A case study of Lake Yahuarcaca.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the recent changes in the accumulation of organic matter and carbon on the Yahuarcaca lake system, by means of a multiproxy paleolimnological study. The methodology based on lithological descriptions of 210Pb/137Cs-dated cores allowed us to infer the centennial sedimentation processes and carbon accumulation rates. Sedimentary facies, grain size, magnetic susceptibility, loss on ignition, carbonate, chlorophyll derivatives, stable isotopes of delta13C/delta15N, and carbon accumulation rate were analyzed. LANDSAT and photographic record of satellite images were used to reconstruct the historical geomorphological evolution of the Lake. Sediment cores yielded basal ages of 1827 and 1828 Common Era, representing the formation of lakes as a consequence of the Amazon meandering process. Two main paleolimnological stages were identified, with a boundary transition set at 1980-1984 Common Era, attributed to the geomorphological closure and complete lake separation from the Amazon and the onset of full lentic conditions. This inference was mainly based on both sharp increases in the sedimentation rate from 0.2 to >1cmyr-1 and carbon accumulation that increased seven-fold (from 2 to 14gm-2yr-1) from 1980 to 1984 Common Era. The flood-pulse and connection to the Amazon defined the magnitude of organic inputs, where areas more distant/isolated from the river showed higher accumulation of carbon from autochthonous production, with an average of 8.9% and 1.10gm-2yr-1 (carbon accumulation rate). Those areas closer and connected to the river were strongly related to the interannual hydrological variability, with a lower mean carbon content (5.9%) and 0.73gm-2yr-1 (carbon accumulation rate). We concluded that carbon burial was highest within the most distant spot from the Amazon River because of the weaker connection to the river itself and the more stable lentic conditions for net sedimentation.

TI  - Exploring the 'January effect' at a university hospital in Pakistan: a retrospective cohort study investigating the impact of trainee turnover on patient care quality outcomes.
T2  - BMC medical education
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There are reports of a potential rise in a teaching hospital's morbidity and mortality rates during the trainee turnover period, i.e., with the induction of new residents and house staffs, and the changeover of clinical teams. The published literature displays mixed reports on this topic with lack of reproducible observations. The current study was conducted to explore existence of any such phenomenon (January effect) in Pakistan.METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. Five-year (2013-2018) record of all the patients in all age groups related to these outcomes was retrieved and recorded in specifically designed questionnaire. Different outcome measures were used as indicators of patient care and change in these outcomes at the time of new induction was related to possible January effect.RESULTS: During the five-year study period, more than 1100 new trainees were inducted into the post graduate medical education program (average of 237 per year) with more than 22,000 inpatient admissions (average of 45,469 per year). Some patterns were observed in frequencies of surgical site infections, medication errors, sentinel events, patient complaints, and adverse drug reactions. However, these were not consistently reproducible and could not be directly attributed to the trainee turnover. All other indicators did not show any pattern and were considered inconclusive. No effect of overlap was observed.CONCLUSIONS: Inconsistency in the patient care quality indicators do not favor existence of January effect in our study. Further research is recommended to establish our results.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - The 2022 revision of the Japanese Breast Cancer Society (JBCS) Clinical Practice Guidelines for surgical treatment of breast cancer was updated following a systematic review of the literature using the Medical Information Network Distribution Service (MINDS) procedure, which focuses on the balance of benefits and harms for various clinical questions (CQs). Experts in surgery designated by the JBCS addressed five areas: breast surgery, axillary surgery, breast reconstruction, surgical treatment for recurrent and metastatic breast cancer, and other related topics. The revision of the guidelines encompassed 4 CQs, 7 background questions (BQs), and 14 future research questions (FRQs). A significant revision in the 2022 edition pertained to axillary management after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in CQ2. The primary aim of the 2022 JBCS Clinical Practice Guidelines is to provide evidence-based recommendations to empower patients and healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding surgical treatment for breast cancer.

TI  - Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of axillary lymph nodes: A reliable diagnostic tool for breast cancer staging
T2  - CANCER CYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Pathologic evaluation of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) samples is crucial for axillary staging in patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Patients with pathologic evidence of nodal metastasis scheduled for upfront surgery typically also undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Although SLNB is the gold standard method for detecting nodal metastasis, axillary lymph node fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) utility has not been thoroughly explored.Methods: Ultrasound-guided axillary lymph node FNAB samples along with concurrent ipsilateral breast tissue samples were searched and reviewed. The control group included histologic findings of axillary dissection or intraoperative SLNB results.Results: A total of 354 axillary lymph node FNAB samples with matched histology were included. Of these, 187 (52.8%) were positive for metastatic carcinoma of breast origin; 143 (40.4%) were negative for metastasis; 12 (3.4%) showed atypical cells; six (1.7%) were suspicious for metastasis; and six (1.7%) were nondiagnostic because of a lack of lymphoid tissue and malignant cells. Of the 143 negative FNAB samples, 22 (15.4%) were positive on either intraoperative SLNB or ALND. When only the positive and negative FNAB samples were accounted for (n = 330; 93.2%), overall diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 89.4% and 99.2%, respectively.Conclusions: Although axillary SLNB is the standard procedure for detecting nodal metastasis of breast origin, axillary lymph node FNAB appears to be a suitable alternative in a significant proportion of patients. A standard SLNB should be performed in cases of negative axillary lymph node FNAB findings, particularly nodes with abnormal imaging findings.

TI  - Trend and Drivers of Satellite-Detected Burned Area Changes Across Arctic Region Since the 21st Century
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic has experienced the frequent and severe fires in recent years. Due to the unique geography and vegetation type in Arctic region, the fire trend and its driving mechanism are different from other regions and still unclear. This study investigated the fire trends across Arctic region based on Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burned area product MCD64A1 during 2001-2020. In addition, the burned area change was attributed at spatial and temporal scales based on 15 natural and anthropogenic factors. Results show that the average burned area in Arctic region during 2001-2020 is 31.2 x 10(3) km(2), with a maximum of 51.9 x 10(3) km(2) in 2019. The change of burned area in Arctic region is spatially heterogeneous, with a significant increasing trend (Z > 1.96) in central Russia and a significant decreasing trend (Z < -1.96) in western Russia. There is a clear seasonality in the occurrence of fires in the Arctic, with a peak in the summer months and almost no fires in the winter. Relative humidity has the largest explanatory power for the spatial variation of burned area (q = 0.487), followed by vapor pressure deficit (q = 0.475) and land surface temperature (q = 0.367). The combined effect of precipitation and land surface temperature is the most powerful interaction (q = 0.587) to explain the spatial variation of burned area. The significant increase in time-series burned area is primarily driven by the decrease of relative humidity. The results of this study are helpful to understand the fire trends and the contribution of climate change to Arctic fires.

TI  - Observed Cloud Type-Sorted Cloud Property and Radiative Flux Changes With the Degree of Convective Aggregation From CERES Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud-radiation interactions are a critical mechanism for convective self-aggregation, especially the longwave radiative cooling of low clouds and environments. In this study, two data products from CERES observations combined with MERRA-2 reanalysis are used to understand the changes of cloud properties and radiative fluxes by cloud type with the degree of convective aggregation at the 1000-km scale, which is represented by the number of cloud objects (N), simple convective aggregation index (SCAI), modified SCAI (MCAI) or convective organization potential (COP). The changes with SCAI are similar to those with N as an index, agreeing with previous studies using grid-averaged properties. For changes from weak to strong degrees of aggregation using N and SCAI, area fractions of middle- and high-level cloud types decrease by up to 4% but those of low-level cloud types increase by up to 2%, and more infrared radiation is emitted to space (2-8 W m-2) from optically thin cloud types but more solar radiation is reflected (2-4 W m-2) from optically-thick cloud types. However, using COP (MCAI to lesser extent), area fractions of optically-thick cloud types increase, which emit less infrared radiation and reflect more solar radiation, whereas the area fractions of low-level clouds decrease. These results can be explained by greater expansion of cloud object sizes for COP than MCAI/SCAI as the degree of convective aggregation increases, which also explains the difference between SCAI and MCAI pertaining to the opposite changes of optically-thick high-level clouds. These results can have implications for understanding convective self-aggregation.Rainstorms are often clustered in ways that depend upon meteorological conditions; this is known as "convective aggregation." The amount of aggregation has a large influence on both weather and climate, so being able to understand how the properties of rainstorms change with the strength of convective aggregation is important for weather and climate modeling. Previous studies used satellite data that only characterized the cold and deep parts of rainstorms. This study provides an analysis of 42 cloud types using the latest satellite data. We assess the changes of cloud area coverage, solar radiation and thermal radiation between two subgroups of data samples with vastly different strengths of aggregation. We find that two of four aggregation measures produce nearly identical changes for cloud area coverages of low- and high-level cloud types, thermal radiation from optically thin cloud types and solar radiation from optically thick cloud types. The other two measures have some differences in how optically-thick cloud types change with aggregation, which are explained by more rapidly-increasing size of rainstorms as the degree of aggregation increases. One of these two measures has the opposite trends in how the low-level cloud area coverages change, which are inconsistent with the other three measures.Changes of cloud properties and radiative fluxes by cloud type with degree of convective aggregation are examined with CERES observationsResults using four convective aggregation indices are largely similar except for optically thick and low-level clouds from two indicesChanges of cloud properties and radiative fluxes by cloud type are primarily related to changes in degree of convective aggregation

TI  - Impact of Nonpharmacological Interventions on Severe Acute Respiratory Infections in Children: From the National Surveillance Database.
T2  - Journal of Korean medical science
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) reduce the incidence of respiratory infections. After NPIs imposed during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ceased, respiratory infections gradually increased worldwide. However, few studies have been conducted on severe respiratory infections requiring hospitalization in pediatric patients. This study compares epidemiological changes in severe respiratory infections during pre-NPI, NPI, and post-NPI periods in order to evaluate the effect of that NPI on severe respiratory infections in children.METHODS: We retrospectively studied data collected at 13 Korean sentinel sites from January 2018 to October 2022 that were lodged in the national Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARIs) surveillance database.RESULTS: A total of 9,631 pediatric patients were admitted with SARIs during the pre-NPI period, 579 during the NPI period, and 1,580 during the post-NPI period. During the NPI period, the number of pediatric patients hospitalized with severe respiratory infections decreased dramatically, thus from 72.1 per 1,000 to 6.6 per 1,000. However, after NPIs ceased, the number increased to 22.8 per 1,000. During the post-NPI period, the positive test rate increased to the level noted before the pandemic.CONCLUSION: Strict NPIs including school and daycare center closures effectively reduced severe respiratory infections requiring hospitalization of children. However, childcare was severely compromised. To prepare for future respiratory infections, there is a need to develop a social consensus on NPIs that are appropriate for children.

TI  - Coupling multi-sensory earth observation datasets, in-situ measurements, and machine learning algorithms for total blue C stock estimation of an estuarine mangrove forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, research on blue carbon (C) has garnered substantial attention worldwide. Nevertheless, we observed a lack of holistic approach, in terms of measurement of total blue C (TBC) potentials. This study focuses on developing a novel approach toward blue C accounting by spatially explicit modelling and estimation of TBC stock in a mangrove wetland of eastern India. A hybrid methodology has been adopted incorporating destructive and non-destructive sampling, allometric and predictive modelling, laboratory-based elemental analysis, and multi-sensory remote sensing (RS) based datasets. Predicted TBC density has been mapped within the wetland influence zone (WIZ) of the study site. Point-specific sample data (n = 250) has been used for the determination of the soil organic C (SOC) prediction model. Spline interpolation, displaying highest R-2 value (R-2 = 0.74) has been chosen for spatially explicit modelling of total SOC stock. Above ground biomass (AGB) was determined using the relationship between remotely sensed data (ALOS PALSAR-2 and Pleiades-1B) and in-situ dendrometric variables (viz. wood density, tree height, and girth at breast height). Here, among the different parametric and nonparametric models to estimate AGB, the BP-ANN models, specifically model number 22 (adjusted R-2 = 0.84, MSE = 1.28, AIC = 3.67, BIC = 1.60), has been identified as the best-fit one with higher adjusted R-2 and lesser AIC and BIC values. Indirect allometric equations involving modelled AGB values had been used to generate spatially explicit community-specific below ground biomass values at per pixel basis (similar to 2 m). Above and below ground C were estimated from these raster data. Integrating all these datasets in a GIS platform, the overall TBC stock of the mangrove was recorded at 246710.91 Mg. The TBC density of mangrove WIZ had revealed considerable variations, ranging from 0.34 Mg ha(-1) to 881.50 Mg ha(-1). Cumulatively, the study attempted to amalgamate all facets of blue C pools with satisfactory accuracy. This holistic methodology may further aid in regional C stock inventorization, management, and policy formulation, thereby strengthening the socioeconomic resilience of coastal communities through carbon trading, reduce emissions from ecosystem degradation as well as support ongoing conservation efforts.

TI  - Residual service life prediction for bridges undergoing slow landslide-induced movements combining satellite radar interferometry and numerical collapse simulation
T2  - ENGINEERING STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an innovative approach for structural prognosis of bridges, that combines displacement information obtained by Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR), applied to satellite data, with structural and collapse analysis performed through numerical modelling. The purpose of this multidisciplinary approach is to recognize potentially critical conditions and predict the time to failure of bridges affected by slow deformation phenomena, such as slow landslide-induced movements. The methodology involves advanced preand post-processing techniques for satellite SAR acquisitions, which allow tracking two-dimensional displacement evolution of multi-span bridges with properly defined error bounds, and uses numerical modelling to simulate damage propagation and structural behaviour up to total collapse. The effectiveness of the proposed synergy between remote displacement measurements and numerical collapse analysis is exemplified through the application to the Albiano-Magra Bridge in Italy, which collapsed on April 8th, 2020. The results have allowed to identify the triggering cause of the collapse and have provided an estimate of the residual service life of the bridge, with increasing reliability as the available satellite monitoring period gets longer. The work demonstrates that a combined analysis considering both satellite measurements and numerical modelling can improve the comprehension of the phenomena concerning the structural collapse due to slow deformations and its prevention.

TI  - Caution is needed across Mediterranean ecosystems when interpreting wall-to-wall fire severity estimates based on spectral indices
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of comprehensive, multi-strata fire severity metrics measured in the field, such as the composite burn index (CBI), is the most commonly used approach to calibrate remote sensing-based products and obtain wall-to-wall fire severity estimates. However, the extent to which specific ecological changes as measured by individual CBI attributes per stratum actually drive the spectral variability in Mediterranean fire-prone ecosystems has not been deciphered yet. In addition, it is not clear if these relationships are consistent across different Mediterranean ecosystems, particularly when fire effects across strata can be decoupled. To bridge these knowledge gaps, we examined the fire severity divergence among CBI strata in different types of Mediterranean forest (both coniferand broadleaf-dominated) and shrubland ecosystems with 240 plots distributed across five wildfires in the westernmost part of the Mediterranean Basin and Chile. Then, we compared the relationship of two spectral fire severity indices with the CBI scores by strata. Finally, we used a wrapper algorithm (VSURF) around Random Forest regression to assess the potential contribution and redundancy of individual CBI attributes in shaping the spectral response of fire severity indices computed from multispectral Sentinel-2 data. The Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR) index fitted CBI field data better than the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). Fire effects were strongly decoupled and, for example, the substrate stratum experienced the lowest severity in conifer forests and shrublands, whereas the upper strata remained largely unaffected in broadleaf forests. This has substantial implications since we found differential responses of the RBR signal to fire effects by strata as measured by distinct individual CBI attributes. Specifically, the fire impact on the green vegetation fraction of upper strata in broadleaf and conifer forests, and on the substrate stratum in shrublands, were identified as non-redundant and most contributing fire effects shaping the spectral signal variability in burned Mediterranean ecosystems. These results, together with decoupled fire severity effects across strata, suggest that aggregated CBI metrics may obscure ecologically relevant fire-induced changes, and noticeable disconnects may exist between wall-to-wall fire severity estimates and actual fire effects in the field.

TI  - Perspectives: The wicked problem of defining and inventorying mature and old-growth forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mature and old-growth forests are valued for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, habitat, hydrologic function, aesthetics, and spirituality, as well as Tribal and Indigenous histories, cultures, and practices. Over the last 500 years, land use change and industrialization have resulted in global declines in the area of older forests (however defined). The goal of this study was to identify concepts and indicators to define mature and old-growth forests across the vegetation types of the United States in order to quantify their abundance and distribution. Defining old growth has been described as a "wicked problem" that involves values, science, and management; requires multiple disciplines; and can be expressed from many contradictory approaches.The most common approach to defining mature and old-growth forests is to place them in a successional continuum of increases in tree size, biodiversity, habitat niches, and structural diversity with forest age. Time since severe disturbance, including human impact, is often a consideration, although humans have influenced the development of many forests for millennia. The successional framework is less useful in low-productivity or frequently-disturbed forests, or where current structural diversity under fire suppression may not reflect historic or desired future conditions. In order to classify forests into "old" and "not old", existing structure-based ap-proaches apply minima of one or more structural or compositional criteria. Site productivity and/or plant as-sociation is an element of many definitions.Once defined, estimating the area of mature and old-growth forest presents challenges. The only compre-hensive, consistent field data of US forests is the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) network of >140,000 forested plots. While the 0.067 ha sample area of FIA plots limits the number of structural metrics that might be useful and the plot density cannot capture fine-scale spatial heterogeneity, measurements enable a granular application of multiple structural and compositional criteria by vegetation type at broad spatial extents, and the ability to track change consistently over time. Spatial models integrate field and remotely-sensed data to predict the distribution of structural classes at finer spatial grain, but with substantial error in high-resolution estimates. There does not seem to be a readily-available method to map mature and old-growth stands across a landscape with a high degree of accuracy. Identifying mature and old growth forests in a stand management context will likely require additional measurements, adjustments to criteria at local scales, and incorporation of social and traditional knowledge within a consistent definition framework.

TI  - Water distribution based on SAR and optical data to improve hazard mapping
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate projections foresee intense precipitation and long-term drought events is increasing with consequent rapid changes in surface water bodies in a short period. In areas with drastic hydrological changes, achieving accurate and rapid mapping of these phenomena in combination with hydrologic variability characteristics is a key of effective emergency management and disaster risk reduction plans. This study presents an automatic method for mapping drought and flood hazards, particularly in regions with significant hydrological changes. We use Sentinel-1/2 and Landsat data to extract surface water and classify permanent and seasonal water bodies in historical periods, which serve as the basis for identifying flood or drought areas. The water extraction method combines index-based analysis for optical data and the region-Otsu method for radar data, ensuring accurate identification of water. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through comparisons with existing products in Poyang Lake (China), the Po River Plain (Italy), and the Indus River Plain (Pakistan). Findings show a high similarity between the two, and our results can provide more specific details. Our method is particularly well-suited for areas with fluctuating hydrological conditions, can also map quickly without optical data. By effectively identifying areas affected by drought and flood hazards while mitigating errors from natural hydrological dynamics, this methodology contributes valuable insights to enhance emergency management and disaster risk reduction plans.

TI  - Evaluation of the storage and evapotranspiration terms of the water budget for an agricultural watershed using local and remote-sensing measurements
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding of the water budget components, especially evapotranspiration and the amount of water stored in the watershed, is key to water resources management and hydrological modeling in general. In this work, we present the analysis of 13 hydrological years' measurements of discharge, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture over two agricultural watersheds in Eastern Nebraska, United States. These data were used to investigate several facets of the hydrological water budget: water-and energy-balance closures, water budget residues (here, the water budget residue is the remaining imbalance after all water budget terms have been considered; see Eq. (13)), storage in the unsaturated and saturated soil layers, and the evapotranspiration derived from the water budget. Remote-sensing data were also used to assess the spatial variability of net radiation and soil moisture over the basins. Adjusting the eddy-covariance measured evapotranspiration to close the energy budget agreed, in the long term, with the water budget evapotranspiration estimates. The evapotranspiration estimated with storage calculated with soil moisture measurements and recession analysis presented the best agreement with the (adjusted) measured evapotranspiration, but considering only either the vadose zone or the saturated zone for storage estimates still produced reasonable results. We found considerable variability in soil moisture over the basins in the final period of the growing season, coinciding with the time of the year when water budget residues were largest.

TI  - Seasonal and interannual variations of surface chlorophyll-a in the Karimata Strait
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics driving seasonal and interannual surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a) variability in the Karimata Strait (KS). The analysis shows that high chl-a concentrations were observed in the KS during December - February (northwest monsoon season) extending northwestward along the eastern coast of Peninsular Malaysia and northeastward along the northern coast of Borneo Island. This high chl-a concentration contrasts with the low chl-a concentration observed along the southern coast of Sumatra and Java during the same season. A substantial upwelling signal was identified in the central-eastern section of the South China Sea and along the northern coast of Java and the eastern coast of Sumatra from December to February. The positive wind stress curl forced downwelling in the southern section of the KS and the northern half of the Java Sea off the coast of Kalimantan. The elevated chl-a concentration in the KS during the northwest monsoon season could not be attributed to wind dynamics alone. The increase in surface chl-a concentration during the northwest monsoon season was associated with an increase in allochthonous nutrients from river discharges caused by increased precipitation over land. On an interannual timescale, a high chl-a concentration was observed during the southeast monsoon season when the La Nina event occurred in the tropical Pacific. The warm SST, associated with favourable downwelling winds, was observed over the entire the KS. It is suggested that anomalous chl-a that bloomed during the La Nina event was associated with anomalously high precipitation over land that transported nutrients to KS through river discharge.

TI  - Physical informed neural network improving the WRF-CHEM results of air pollution using satellite-based remote sensing data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate measurement of air gases concentration are crucial for effective air quality management and minimizing the harm caused by pollution events, as well as providing guidance for healthy travel. We developed develop a physical informed deep learning model that combines a traditional atmospheric chemical transport model and a data-based deep learning model. The model uses multisource observation data to constrain and optimize the results of atmospheric pollution gases concentrations. The accuracy and spatial resolution in central and eastern China (20-45 degrees N, 100-125 degrees E) have been improved compared to the original Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to Chemistry (WRF-CHEM) results by incorporating constraints from ground-based and satellite observations. Compared with the WRF-CHEM results, our model increases the verification Pearson coefficient (R) of NO2 and CNEMC sites from 0.56 to 0.8, and the RMSE decreases from 25.33 to 15.54 & mu;g cm-3. For O3 results, the model increased the verification R of the CNEMC from 0.57 to 0.76, and the RMSE decreased from 24.55 to 20.22 cm-3. We employed independent MAXDOAS monitoring to authenticate the HCHO results. The R was 0.78, while the validation results for satellite HCHO and MAXDOAS exhibited a R of 0.63 and the validation results for WRF-CHEM and MAXDOAS demonstrated a R of 0.11. Additionally, the RMSE was 6.97E15 mole cm-2, whereas the validation results for satellite HCHO and MAX-DOAS had an RMSE of 7.16E15 mole cm-2. By utilizing satellite remote sensing to effectively capture the spatial distribution of pollutants, and by combining satellite data with other sources of monitoring data and optimizing our models, we have improved the accuracy of our results and have overcome the limitation of cloud coverage. As a result, we are now able to better understand the space-time distribution of pollutants in different regions.

TI  - Crop establishment and diversification strategies for intensification of rice-based cropping systems in rice-fallow areas in Odisha
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context or problem: In the Indian state of Odisha, rice-based system productivity is poor due to: (i) low rice yield in the monsoon (wet) season (2-4 t ha(-1) compared to 6-8 t ha(-1) in Punjab or Haryana); and (ii) limited cropping during the post-monsoon (dry) season (59% of the wet season rice area is left fallow in the dry season). Objective: Our study identifies strategies for increasing rice-based system productivity through: (i) alternative crop establishment methods in the wet season (Dry-Direct Seeded Rice or DSR, and mechanical puddled transplanted rice or PTR-M) to traditional methods such as broadcasting followed by post-emergence tillage (locally known as beushening) and manual random puddled transplanted rice (PTR-R); (ii) to identify rice-fallow areas suitable for pulse and oilseed cultivation in the dry season; and (iii) to evaluate the performance of short-duration pulses (green gram, Vigna radiata; black gram, Vigna mungo), and oilseeds (Brassica rapa var. toria, Helianthus annuus) in rice-fallow areas in the dry season. Methods: On-farm experiments were conducted between 2017 and 2019 in three districts of Odisha (Bhadrak, Cuttack and Mayurbhanj) to evaluate DSR compared to beushening and PTR-R; and PTR-M compared to PTR-R and manual line puddled transplanted rice (PTR-L) in the wet season. The data from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-1satellite sensors was used to identify rice-fallow areas, and the daily SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) L-band soil moisture was used for mapping suitable rice-fallow areas for growing pulses and oilseeds. Short duration crops were evaluated in suitable rice-fallow areas. Results: In the wet season, DSR (range -4 to + 53%) had a significant effect on rice yield over beushening. Similarly, PTR-M consistently increased rice yield by 16-26% over PTR-R, and by 5-23% over PTR-L. In the dry season, pulse crops (green gram and black gram) performed well compared to Indian mustard under rainfed cultivation. However, under irrigated conditions, dry-season rice yield was more productive than the rice equivalent yield of green gram, black gram and sunflower. We found that 1.03 M ha (i.e., similar to 50%) of total ricefallow areas of 2.1 M ha were suitable for growing short duration green gram and black gram in the dry season. Conclusions: We conclude that system productivity and cropping intensity can be increased by adoption of DSR and PTR-M in the wet season, and growing of green gram and black gram in the dry season. Implications: Odisha state can potentially produce an additional 0.67 million tonnes pulses if suitable rice-fallow areas are brought under green gram and black gram cultivation in the dry the season.

TI  - Dust detection and susceptibility mapping by aiding satellite imagery time series and integration of ensemble machine learning with evolutionary algorithms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - To mitigate the impact of dust on human health and the environment, it is crucial to create a model and map that identifies the areas susceptible to dust. The present study focused on identifying dust occurrences in the Bushehr province of Iran between 2002 and 2022 using moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. Subsequently, an ensemble machine learning model was improved to prepare a dust susceptibility map (DSM). The study employed differential evolution (DE), genetic algorithm (GA), and flower pollination algorithm (FPA) - three evolutionary algorithms - to enhance the random forest (RF) ensemble model. A spatial database was created for modeling, including 519 dust occurrence points (extracted from MODIS imagery) and 15 factors affecting dust (Slope, bulk density, aspect, clay, altitude, sand, rainfall, lithology, soil order, distance to river, soil texture, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil water content, land cover, and wind speed). By utilizing the differential evolution (DE) algorithm, we determined the significance of these factors in impacting dust occurrences. The results indicated that altitude, wind speed, and land cover were the most influential factors, while the distance to the river, bulk density, and soil texture had less impact on dust occurrence. Data were preprocessed using multicollinearity analysis and the frequency ratio (FR) approach. For this research, three RF-based meta-heuristic optimization algorithms, namely RF-FPA, RF-GA, and RF-DE, were created for DSM. The effectiveness prediction of the constructed models by indexes of root-mean-square-error (RMSE), the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC), and coefficient of determination (R2) from best to worst were RF-DE (RMSE = 0.131, AUC-ROC = 0.988, and R2 = 0.93), RF-GA (RMSE = 0.141, AUC-ROC = 0.986, and R2 = 0.919), RF-FPA (RMSE = 0.157, AUC-ROC = 0.981, and R2 = 0.9), and RF (RMSE = 0.173, AUCROC = 0.964, and R2 = 0.878). The results showed that combining evolutionary algorithms with an RF model improves the accuracy of dust susceptibility modeling.

TI  - Modelling of live fuel moisture content in different vegetation scenarios during dry periods using meteorological data and spectral indices
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are of increasing concern to society, the scientific community and managers. Each year the forest fire season is becoming longer or deseasonalised. One of the main factors in fire behaviour is the live fuel moisture content. Climatological variables such as air humidity, temperature and precipitation directly affect the fuel that is likely to burn. Soil moisture also contributes to fire spread and severity. For these reasons, an analysis of fuel moisture is carried out at 3 sampling sites in the interior of Galicia (Spain), through multiple linear regression models. The 3 plots represent different characteristics for shrub growth: one plot is composed of pine trees, another plot contains a high density of undergrowth and the last plot was burned in 2020 and is regenerating undergrowth. A specific model was generated for each plot from field samples of live fuel and soil field samples collected from September to May, meteorological variables obtained from the stations and Sentinel-2 satellite spectral indices for the field sampling days.The best resulting spectral index for plots without trees was the NDI45, but with a low correlation (R2 < 0.2), while in the plot with pine trees it was the SAVI index (R-2 = 0.85). On the other hand, specific model equations were estimated combining these spectral indices with the soil moisture samples and the average temperature of the last 7 days. In all cases the result was considerably improved (R-2 between 0.72 and 0.91). These models can be helpful in estimating the probability of fire danger, outside the summer season, with long periods of drought, enabling decision making by managers in each region.

TI  - Diclofenac eco-geno-toxicity in freshwater algae, rotifers and crustaceans*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the eco-genotoxic impact of diclofenac (DCF) in sentinel species of the freshwater ecosystem. DCF residues are found in freshwater from few ng/L to tens of & mu;g/L due to the inability of conventional wastewater treatment plants to ensure removal efficiency of the drug. An ample body of literature reports on the acute toxicity of DCF in non-target organisms without addressing potential chronic long-term effects on or-ganisms at actual, environmental concentrations. Herein, assessment for acute and chronic toxicity was per-formed on organisms in vivo exposed to DCF, specifically on the green alga Raphidocelis subcapitata, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and the crustacean Ceriodaphnia dubia. Furthermore, potential DNA damage and expres-sion of antioxidant genes (MnSOD, Cu/ZnSOD and CAT) were evaluated in crustacean neonates. The toxico-logical risk of DCF was assessed as well as its.Genotoxic risk: The acute toxicity was observed at concentrations far from those of environmental concern. Rotifers and crustaceans were much more chronically sensitive than the algae to DCF, observing besides, the median effect concentrations at tens of & mu;g/L. In crustaceans, DNA damage was noted at units of & mu;g/L, revealing concentrations of environmental concern. The dysregulated activity of SOD and CAT also showed the ability of DCF to provoke oxidative stress. On assessment of environmental risk, the chronic Risk Quotient (RQ) was above the threshold value of 1. Nevertheless, the genotoxic RQ was significantly greater than the chronic RQ, thus, the need of regulatory bodies to acknowledge the genotoxic impact as an environmental risk factor. To our knowledge, this study is the first investigation to perform environmental genotoxic risk assessment of DCF.

TI  - Perspective: Monitoring global forests using only structural metrics - problems and solutions from a savanna viewpoint
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate maps of global forest area are important for international commitments such as deforestation monitoring and carbon accounting. Such maps also inform terrestrial biosphere models that contribute to Earth system models for climate change predictions. Recently, at least nine maps showing two, very different views of global forest cover were published, mostly in journals with high, or relatively high, Journal Impact FactorTM scores. The purpose of this perspective piece is to explore reasons underlying the contrasting views, emphasise a major problem inherent in one of the views, and provide recommendations for avoiding the problem. One view exaggerates forest cover because it relies on tree height and tree cover data obtained from satellites, with or without comparable ground data. Structural data are used because of the difficulty in distinguishing between woody and herbaceous vegetation, or between ecologically and functionally different ecosystems or biomes, when using remote sensing. Structural data are also used because they allow monitoring of forest cover according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation's definition of forest. The problem with this approach to mapping forest cover is that tree cover occurs in naturally open biomes at values far above the arbitrary minimum used for the purpose of monitoring forest cover, and trees in open biomes function very differently to trees in forests. For example, savanna trees are shade-intolerant and fire-tolerant, whereas forest trees are shade-tolerant and fireintolerant. Therefore, mapping global forest cover on the basis of tree cover leads to extensive areas of naturally open biomes, such as the cerrado in South America and the miombo in Africa, being misclassified as 'forest', 'deforested' or 'degraded forest'. Misclassification results in exaggerated estimates of global forest loss and forest carbon stocks, as well as misguided restoration initiatives inappropriate for naturally open biomes. The other view of global forest cover is based on a more holistic approach that incorporates ecological, physiological and evolutionary information about the vegetation of interest, together with physical data such as climate and soils. Mapping global forest cover can be improved by combining remotely sensed data on vegetation structure with available products that are known to faithfully map the global cover of open biomes.

TI  - Urban-scale variational flux inversion for CO Using TROPOMI total-column retrievals: A case study of Tehran
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Emission inventories of trace gases and aerosols are a key input for air pollution modelling, yet are subject to significant uncertainties. The aim of this study is to refine urban-scale, gridded estimates of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions for Tehran, Iran; this was done using an inverse-modelling approach. We assimilated total column mixing ratios of CO retrieved from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) using a four-dimensional variational assimilation system based on the Community Multi-Scale Air Quality Model. The inversion system allows for two representations of the temporal profile of emissions at each grid-point: scaling a fixed diurnal profile, or with separate, constant estimates spanning four diurnal time-categories. We evaluate the inversion capability by applying independent surface measurements. We find that the model forced with prior emissions substantially underestimates day-to-day variation in satellite data. However, the posterior emissions show significant improvements in simulating the assimilated data, reducing the bias of modelled mixing ratios by 72% to 91% when using categorised temporal variation in the system and by 35% to 83% with a fixed temporal variation. Comparisons with surface measurements indicate that the posterior emissions also show some improvements in simulating surface observations, although not in all cases. For example, in February 2019, the magnitude of the bias is reduced from 1.1 ppm to 0.9 ppm and 0.2 ppm using the categorised and fixed temporal variation schemes, respectively. The posterior results are sensitive to the specification of temporal emission patterns, and the spatiotemporal pattern of the posterior varies depending on whether we assume the fixed or categorised temporal variation. It is worth noting that TROPOMI samples only once per day, so it cannot define the full diurnal cycle of emissions. Finally, the inability to match simultaneously the surface and column-integrated observations may be due to issues in modelling the vertical tracer transport, however, this was not evaluated in the present work. Notwithstanding these weaknesses, the approach shows considerable promise for regions lacking local inventories.

TI  - Microcystins risk assessment in lakes from space: Implications for SDG 6.1 evaluation
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms release a large number of algal toxins (e.g., Microcystins, MCs) and seriously threaten the safety of drinking water sources what the SDG 6.1 pursues (to provide universal access to safe drinking water by 2030, United Nations Sustainable Development Goal). Nevertheless, algal toxins in lake water have not been routinely monitored and evaluated well and frequently so far. In this study, a total of 100 large lakes (>25 km2) in densely populated eastern China were studied, and a remote sensing scheme of human health risks from MCs based on Sentinel-3 OLCI data was developed. The spatial and temporal dynamics of MCs risk in eastern China lakes since OLCI satellite observation data (2016-2021) were first mapped. The results showed that most of the large lakes in eastern China (80 out of 100) were detected with the occurrence of a high risk of more than 1 pixel (300x300 m) at least once. Fortunately, in terms of lake areas, the frequency of high human health risks in most waters (70.93% of total lake areas) was as less as 1%. This indicates that drinking water intakes can be set in most waters from the perspective of MCs, yet the management departments are required to reduce cyanobacterial blooms. This study highlights the potential of satellite in monitoring and assessing the risk of algal toxins and ensuring drinking water safety. It is also an important reference for SDG 6.1 reporting for lakes that lack routine monitoring.

TI  - Validation and diurnal variation evaluation of MERRA-2 multiple aerosol properties on a global scale
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) provides a spatiotemporal seamless simulation of global aerosol properties. This study focused on evaluating its diurnal AOD accuracy and variation and the performance of multi-aerosol properties (including & Aring;ngstrom exponent (AE), fine mode fraction (FMF), and single scattering albedo (SSA)) using AERONET measurements. The spatial distribution patterns of MERRA-2 AOD are compared with the MODIS (daytime) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO, nighttime) satellite products, respectively. The results show that MERRA-2 AOD exhibits good agreement with AERONET AOD during daytime and nighttime, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) exceeding 0.785, and the fraction of meeting the expected error (EE) exceeding 0.705. The accuracy of daytime AOD is comparable to that of the MODIS AOD product. Furthermore, MERRA-2 AE and FMF have a higher accuracy than MODIS products, with an R > 0.840 and an RMSE of 0.313 for AE and 0.150 for FMF. And iteffectively captures the diurnal variation of aerosol properties, with an R of 0.911, 0.392, and 0.72 for AOD, AE, and FMF at different times of day compared to AERONET. Additionally, MERRA-2's ability to characterize the spatial patterns of daytime and nighttime is comparable to those of satellite products. Overall, this study provides the usage references for MERRA-2 aerosol product, highlighting its high accuracy and ability to capture diurnal variation and spatial patterns.

TI  - Comparing forest and grassland drought responses inferred from eddy covariance and Earth observation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperate forests and grasslands have different drought response strategies. Trees often control their stomatal opening to reduce water loss to prevent hydraulic failure and ensure the sustainable above-ground biomass production. In contrast, grasses generally have a less strong stomatal control and maintain high photosynthesis and transpiration until the soil moisture gets depleted. That is when their leaves wilt and the grasslands reduce their aboveground green biomass. Both the increased stomatal control and the reduction in aboveground biomass decrease the canopy-surface conductance and decrease the exchange of water and carbon between the leaves and the atmosphere. Here, we study to which extent remote sensing data reflect the drought-induced reduction in canopy-surface conductance for forests and grasslands. We use eddy covariance observations over 63 sites across the northern hemisphere to infer the conductance. We identify severe droughts from low soil moisture content and reduced canopy-surface conductance. We further analysed how the drought response is reflected in thermal and optical data derived from MODIS satellite data. The results show that the land surface temperature increases with drought-induced reductions in canopy-surface conductance for both forests and grasslands. By contrast, the optical indices (e.g., the normalized difference vegetation index) show a much stronger response for grasslands as compared to the forests. We conclude that the different canopy-level drought response strategies of trees and grasses are widespread and that these different responses are reflected in remote sensing data. Hence, a combination of thermal and optical satellite data should be used to monitor and study vegetation drought responses of forests and grasslands to ensure accurate inference on the implications on water, energy, and carbon fluxes.

TI  - Consistency and uncertainty of remote sensing-based approaches for regional yield gap estimation: A comprehensive assessment of process-based and data-driven models
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the gap between actual and exploitable yields (Ya and Ye, respectively) at the regional scale is critical for understanding the scope and hotspots for future yield improvements. Remote sensing can provide geospatially continuous observations of crop growth, which is perceived as an effective means to overcome the scaling issue commonly suffered by regional yield gap (YG) studies. However, the consistency and uncertainties of different modeling paradigms (i.e., model-driven or data-driven paradigm) remain to be investigated when integrating remote sensing data into YG analysis. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of processbased and machine learning approaches for estimating rice YG over Northeast China. Three machine learning models are examined for predicting Ya, the results of which reveal a prevalent deviation in the estimation of extreme yields. A rotation scheme is thereby proposed to correct this error, and the outperforming random forest model is selected to be compared with a biophysical process-based model (BEPS). County-scale validation reveals good accuracy of both the process-based and machine learning models in estimating Ya, with RMSEs of 1355.3 kg ha  1 (17.3%) and 1205.0 kg  1 (15.4%), respectively. The process-based model reproduces well the probability distribution of Ya in peaks and tails, which guarantees the reasonable estimation of Ye, given that Ye is derived from the high percentile of Ya. In contrast, the machine learning model trained over county-scale yield statistics underestimates the heterogeneity of Ya, leading to significant shrinkage of Ye and thus YG. Degraded model consistency is found from the estimation of Ya, Ye to YG, yet the discrepancy presents limited impacts on identifying the regional priorities for closing YG. The remote sensing-based estimations under the "top-down" framework are further evaluated against the results of the Global Yield Gap Atlas (GYGA), which follows a "bottom-up" protocol. Multiscale comparisons (i.e., local, subregional and regional) with the GYGA and other reference results suggest that the pixelwise modeling of crop-growing processes constitutes a more reliable approach for estimating rice YG over Northeast China, although uncertainty exists in both remote sensing approaches in the local YG estimation. The need to train machine learning models using representative datasets at the field scale is strongly emphasized. This study contributes to the first comprehensive understanding of different modeling paradigms for YG analysis and has important implications for promoting model development and ensuring food security.

TI  - Four-decade response of land surface temperature to urban expansion in Beijing
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion with increased impervious surface area (ISA) can affect the thermal regimes by altering the water and energy balance. Previous studies have indicated that ISA is the primary surrogate of rising land surface temperature (LST). However, urban-induced LST changes are not yet well quantified because of the temporal limitations of the LST datasets and the uncertainties from climate variabilities. In this study, we integrated multiple satellite-based products (vegetation coverage, albedo and radiation forcing) into a physically-based land surface model i.e., Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC), to detect multi-temporal scale response of LST to the increasing ISA in Beijing. Heat transfer-related parameters in the model were updated along with urbanization processes. The integrated modeling presented high performance for simulating LST, as evaluated with groundbased observations and the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product. We found that the average LST over Beijing increased from 10.3 C in 1980-1990 to 11.2 C in 2010-2020, with nearly 33% contributed by the urban growth. The urban-induced thermal effect was particularly strong in summer daytime and winter nighttime. The frequency of heat days (the day with the maximum LST over 40 C) in a year for Beijing appeared to linearly correlate with the impervious surface fraction (ISF) when ISF > 25%. For the urbanizing area, moreover, the four-decade LST estimates indicated that the annual overheating duration was obviously extended with a rate of about 5 days per decade. We therefore conclude that the urban expansion in Beijing not only amplified heat stress but also altered heat phenology, which have implications for urban planning and the construction of heat mitigation facilities.

TI  - Polar-facing slopes showed stronger greening trend than equatorial-facing slopes in Tibetan plateau grasslands
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The orientation of slopes in alpine zones creates microclimates, e.g. equatorial-facing slopes (EFSs) are generally drier and warmer than are polar-facing slopes (PFSs). The vegetation growing in these microhabitats responds divergently to climatic warming depending on the slope orientation. We proposed a spatial metric, the greenness asymmetric index (GAI), defined as the ratio between the average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on PFSs and EFSs within a given spatial window, to quantify the asymmetry of greenness across aspects. We calculated GAI for each non-overlapping 3 x 3 km(2) (100 x 100 Landsat pixels) grid, and seamlessly mapped it on Tibetan Plateau (TP) grassland using NDVI time series from the Landsat-5, -7 and -8 satellites. PFSs were greener than EFSs (GAI > 1) in warm and dry areas, and EFSs were greener than PFSs (GAI < 1) in cold and wet areas. We also detected a stronger greening trend (0.0040 vs 0.0034 y(-1)) and a higher sensitivity of NDVI to temperature (0.031 vs 0.026 C-degrees(-1)) on PFSs than EFSs, leading to a significant positive trend in GAI (0.00065 y(-1), P < 0.01) in the TP from 1991 to 2020. Our results suggest that global warming exacerbated the greenness asymmetry associated with the slope orientation: PFSs are more sensitive to warming and have been greening at a faster rate than EFSs. The gradient of EFSs and PFSs provided a "natural laboratory" to study interaction of water and temperature limitations on vegetation growth. Our study is the first to detect the effect of aspect on the greening trend in the TP. Future research needs to clarify the full biotic and abiotic determinants for this spatial and temporal asymmetry of greenness across aspects with the support of extensive field measurements and refined high-resolution NDVI products.

TI  - Coupling a light use efficiency model with a machine learning-based water constraint for predicting grassland gross primary production
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Light use efficiency (LUE) model was established to estimate gross primary production (GPP) for understanding the carbon-climate feedbacks of the terrestrial ecosystems. However, water constraints in LUE models can cause large uncertainties in GPP estimates, especially in semiarid grasslands where water is a key forcing factor for multiple ecosystem processes. Here, we proposed a novel LUE-Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) model framework where water scalar is derived from five different water constraints for improving the estimates of grassland GPP over the conterminous United States (CONUS). The performance of LUE-GBRT and ten other GPP models [i.e., LUE-RF, LUE-ERT, GBRT, RF, ERT, LUE-fEF, LUE-fVPD, LUE-fLSWI, LUE-fSM, and LUE-fLST] was evaluated against data from eddy covariance (EC) observations at 25 measurement sites over the CONUS domain from 2000 to 2021. We found that LUE-GBRT improved grassland GPP estimates at all EC sites and yielded the highest Kling-Gupta efficiency (0.85) and the lowest root-mean-square error (1.4 g C m- 2 d-1) when compared with the five individual GPP models. LUE-GBRT also showed a superior performance compared to LUE-RF and LUE-ERT. Compared with GBRT, the improvements were particularly from the responses to extreme surface conditions that were better characterized and estimated. An innovation of this method is that LUE-GBRT takes machine learning complementary to the physical-based LUE framework for an optimal junction between GPP physical process and model accuracy.

TI  - The performance of SPEI integrated remote sensing data for monitoring agricultural drought in the North China Plain
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought is significantly affecting sustainable crop production. One of climate-based drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) calculated by the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET), is being more and more widely employed to characterize the spatio-temporal pattern of agricultural drought. However, substantial uncertainties exist in the current PET methods due to unrealistic configurations of the heterogeneity of crop surface characteristics or complicated parameterization scheme. In this study, standard Penman-Monteith (PM) model is modified and derived by meteorological factors and leaf area index (LAI) and albedo data based on remote sensing. Then, the modified SPEI was calculated by the monthly difference between precipitation and PM model integrated remote sensing data (referred as PMRS) over the North China Plain (NCP) between 1982 and 2016. Comparing with the FAO56 reference evapotranspiration (referred as PMRC) and a simplified version of standard PM over open-water surface (referred as PMOW), this study examines how well the PMRS-SPEI captures drought evolution and impacts on crop growth and yield over the NCP in order to evaluate its performance in agricultural drought monitoring. The comparison of SPEIs based on three evapotranspiration equations with soil water moisture in root depth shows that a 6-month lag can be used as the optimum time scale over the NCP. Additionally, the correlation of PMRSSPEI performs better than PMRC-SPEI and PMOW-SPEI. For typical drought events, PMRS-SPEI6 shows remarkable smaller (larger) severe drought values between April and June (August and October) and a shorter (longer) recovery period in the growing season for wheat (maize). Comparing to PMRC-SPEI6 and PMOW-SPEI6, the PMRSSPEI6 shows better performance when examining the Vegetation Health Index and Composite Index of Crop Yield Reduction. Additionally, climate-induced crop yield correlates with PMRS-SPEI6 better than PMOW-SPEI6 and PMRC-SPEI6, particularly in the emergence and filling stages for winter wheat, and silking stage for summer maize. These results demonstrate that integrating remotely sensed data can enhance the agricultural drought monitoring accuracy of SPEI.

TI  - Nanoparticles and polymers complexes as a harmless shale plugging inhibitor for ocean water-based drilling fluids
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the stringent environmental regulations that have been gradually proposed, the additives of WBDFs with low toxicity and degradability have become crucial. Clays and nano-micron fractures are the main causes of wellbore instability in ocean shale formations. In this paper, the plugging inhibitor was designed based on the skeletal structure of molecule, functional groups and molecular weight. Then the silane coupling agent was used to modify silica nanoparticles. And further the ZY-1 as a harmless plugging inhibitor was created by graft copolymerization of transition product and AA-AAK. These evaluation results demonstrated that ZY-1 not only was nontoxic and biodegradable, but also displayed a decent thermal stability (150 degrees C) and plugging inhibitive performance. What's more, this paper proposed the underlying inhibition and plugging mechanisms based on the structure and function of ZY-1.

TI  - Estimation of canopy water content for wheat through combining radiative transfer model and machine learning
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy water content (CWC) is an important indicator of crop growth. Currently, the hybrid approach, which combines the physical model and machine learning (ML) method, is commonly used for inversing CWC at the regional scale via optical imagery. Although this approach has good inversion accuracy, it suffers from ill-posed issues from the physical model due to the difference between actual and simulated scenes. Meanwhile, the ability of existing ML methods to resolve this difference remains unclear. To fill the above study gaps, we added different degrees of Gaussian noise into the simulated dataset to reduce the differences in spectral reflectance between that simulated by the PROSAIL-5B model and that measured from optimal imagery. Furthermore, this study also compared the performance of different ML approaches (neural network, NN; Gauss process regression, GPR; and kernel ridge regression, KRR) in the retrieval of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) CWC based on PROSAILsimulated datasets. Additionally, we also compared the inversion results for the CWC generated by the SNAP Toolbox with those estimated by the hybrid approach. The results showed that the aforementioned hybrid approaches performed well in the retrieval of wheat CWC when Gaussian noise with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 0.06 (& eta;: 0, 0.06) was added to the simulated dataset. The hybrid model based on GPR had the highest accuracy of estimation for the CWC (RMSE = 0.0096 g/cm2, RRMSE = 22.2%), when compared with NN or KRR (NN: RMSE = 0.0105 g/cm2, RRMSE = 26.9%; KRR: RMSE = 0.0099 g/cm2, RRMSE = 24.3%). It also outperformed the existing CWC-retrieval algorithms among the SNAP Toolbox (RMSE = 0.027 g/cm2, RRMSE=44.1%). Our results demonstrate that the hybrid approach in combination with GPR and the physical model can accurately retrieve the CWC of crops, thus confirming that the approach is suitable for estimating the CWC.

AB  - Axillary staging is an important prognostic factor in breast cancer, being sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) the gold standard staging method in early stages. However, in clinically node positive (cN+) patients who converted to clinically node-negative (cN0) after primary systemic therapy (PST) the axillary staging method during surgery remains controversial. There are at least three validated methods: SLNB, targeted axillary dissection (TAD) and marking axillary nodes with radioactive iodine seeds (MARI) procedure. Our house believe that the biopsied and clipped lymph node could predict response to systemic treatment.

TI  - Improving the matching degree between remotely sensed phenological dates and physiological growing stages of soybean by a dynamic offset-adjustment strategy.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Crop phenology provides crucial information for determining the appropriate timing of farm management practices and predicting crop yields. Satellite remote sensing has become a burgeoning tool for rapid phenological monitoring over wide spatial regions. However, there are significant timing gaps between the satellite-based phenological feature points and ground-observed physiological growing stages of the target. In this study, a dynamic offset-adjustment strategy that aims to improve the matching degree of the above two is proposed and tested with soybean across 16 states in the United States. A series of remotely sensed phenological transition dates that are characteristics of key growing stages of soybean were retrieved using MODIS time series data over the period 2000-2020 and the offset adjustments to the dates were identified by dynamically adjusting offset values till the minimum RMSE between the remote sensing-based and the ground-observed dates of physiological growing stages were obtained. The results indicated that the offset-adjustment strategy can significantly improve the alignments between remotely sensed phenological dates and field-based physiological growing stages of soybean in contrast to these without taking adjustment, with the average RMSE dropping by 58.58%, 51.59%, 31.15%, 25.33%, 24.67% in the downturn, peak of season (POS), upturn, stabilization and recession dates, respectively. Among tested remotely sensed characteristics, the end of season (EOS) dates show the greatest alignment with its corresponding physiological growing stage, i.e., the dropping leaves stage. Comparison of the performance of the upturn date and start of season (SOS) in monitoring the date of the emerged stage indicates that the later one exhibits a better consistency with the ground-observed emerged stage after taking the adjustment, with the average RMSE dropping by 56.52%. The proposed offset-adjustment strategy offers an approach for adjusting remotely sensed characteristics so to make them more consistent with the ground-observed crop physiological growing stages.

TI  - Variations of suspended particulate matter concentrations of the Mackenzie River plume (Beaufort Sea, Arctic Ocean) over the last two decades.
T2  - Marine pollution bulletin
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This work addresses the last 20 years' evolution of the suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations in the Beaufort Sea (Canadian Arctic Ocean) directly influenced by the Mackenzie River discharge. The SPM variations in the coastal zone are highlighted and related to the freshwater and solid discharges of the river measured in situ at the Arctic Red River station (150 km upstream of the river delta). The correlation between the variations of the river discharge and SPM concentration within the surface layer of the coastal waters is obvious. Rather unexpectedly, both have been slightly but significantly decreasing from 2003 to 2018-2019 and started to increase very recently (2019-2022). This change of regime could be explained by changing winter precipitation and groundwater distribution, progressively accumulating sediments within the thawing permafrost layer and its recent release into the groundwater together with thermokarst lakes' rapid drainage.

TI  - Feasibility of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early-Stage Epithelial Ovarian Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
T2  - Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been widely adopted in the management of early-stage gynaecological cancers such as endometrial, vulvar and cervical cancer. Comprehensive surgical staging is crucial for patients with early-stage ovarian cancer and currently, that includes bilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymph node assessment. SLNB allows the identification, excision and pathological assessment of the first draining lymph nodes, thus negating the need for a full lymphadenectomy. We systematically searched the MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases (from inception to 3 November 2022) in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Our search identified 153 articles from which 11 were eligible for inclusion. Patients with clinical stage I-II ovarian cancer undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy were included. Statistical analysis was performed in RStudio using the meta package, where meta-analysis was performed for the detection. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies C (QUADAS-C) tool. Overall, 11 observational studies met the predetermined criteria and these included 194 women. The meta-analysis showed that the detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes in early-stage ovarian cancer was 94% (95% CI of 86% to 1.00%). Significant heterogeneity was noted among the studies with Q = 47.6, p < 0.0001, I2 = 79% and tau2 = 0.02. Sentinel lymph nodes in early-stage ovarian cancer have a high detection rate and can potentially have applicability in clinical practice. However, considering the small number of participants in the studies, the heterogeneity among them and the low quality of evidence, the results should be interpreted with caution. Larger trials are needed before a change in clinical practice is recommended.

TI  - Land cover and crop types mapping using different spatial resolution imagery in a Mediterranean irrigated area.
T2  - Environmental monitoring and assessment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Crop type identification is critical for agricultural sustainability policy development and environmental assessments. Therefore, it is important to obtain their spatial distribution via different approaches. Medium-, high- and very high-resolution optical satellite sensors are efficient tools for acquiring this information, particularly for challenging studies such as those conducted in heterogeneous agricultural fields. This research examined the ability of four multitemporal datasets (Sentinel-1-SAR (S1), Sentinel-2-MSI (S2), RapidEye (RE), and PlanetScope (PS)) to identify land cover and crop types (LCCT) in a Mediterranean irrigated area. To map LCCT distribution, a supervised pixel-based classification is adopted using Support Vector Machine with a radial basis function kernel (SVMRB) and Random Forest (RF). Thus, LCCT maps were generated into three levels, including six (Level I), ten (Level II), and fourteen (Level III) classes. Overall, the findings revealed high overall accuracies of >92%, >83%, and>81% for Level I, Level II, and Level III, respectively, except for Sentinel-1. It was found that accuracy improves considerably when the number of classes decreases, especially when cropland or non-cropland classes are grouped into one. Furthermore, there was a similarity in performance between S2 alone and S1S2. PlanetScope LCCT classifications outperform other sensors. In addition, the present study demonstrated that SVM achieved better performances against RF and can thereby effectively extract LCCT information from high-resolution imagery as PlanetScope.

TI  - A Fluorescent and Magnetic Hybrid Tracer for Improved Sentinel Lymphadenectomy in Prostate Cancer Patients.
T2  - Biomedicines
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In prostate cancer, sentinel lymph node dissection (sLND) offers a personalized procedure with staging ability which is at least equivalent to extended LND while inducing lower morbidity. A bimodal fluorescent-radioactive approach was introduced to improve sentinel LN (SLN) detection. We present the first in-human case series on exploring the use of a fluorescent-magnetic hybrid tracer in a radiation-free sLND procedure. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and indocyanine green were administered simultaneously in five prostate cancer patients scheduled for extended LND, sLND and radical prostatectomy. In situ and ex vivo fluorescence and magnetic signals were documented for each LN sample detected via a laparoscopic fluorescence imaging and magnetometer system. Fluorescence and magnetic activity could be detected in all patients. Overall, 19 lymph node spots could be detected in situ, 14 of which were fluorescently active and 18 of which were magnetically active. In two patients, no fluorescent LNs could be detected in situ. The separation of the LN samples resulted in a total number of 30 SLNs resected. Ex vivo measurements confirmed fluorescence in all but two magnetically active SLNs. One LN detected in situ with both modalities was subsequently shown to contain a metastasis. This study provides the first promising results of a bimodal, radiation-free sLND, combining the advantages of both the magnetic and fluorescence approaches.

TI  - Associations between air pollution, residential greenness, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in three prospective cohorts of U.S. adults.
T2  - Environmental research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: While studies suggest impacts of individual environmental exposures on type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk, mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a biomarker of glycemia and diagnostic criterion for prediabetes and T2D. We explored associations between multiple environmental exposures and HbA1c in non-diabetic adults.METHODS: HbA1c was assessed once in 12,315 women and men in three U.S.-based prospective cohorts: the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). Residential greenness within 270m and 1,230m (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) was obtained from Landsat. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were estimated from nationwide spatiotemporal models. Three-month and one-year averages prior to blood draw were assigned to participants' addresses. We assessed associations between single exposure, multi-exposure, and component scores from Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and HbA1c. Fully-adjusted models built on basic models of age and year at blood draw, BMI, alcohol use, and neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) to include diet quality, race, family history, smoking status, postmenopausal hormone use, population density, and season. We assessed interactions between environmental exposures, and effect modification by population density, nSES, and sex.RESULTS: Based on HbA1c, 19% of participants had prediabetes. In single exposure fully-adjusted models, an IQR (0.14) higher 1-year 1,230m NDVI was associated with a 0.27% (95% CI: 0.05%, 0.49%) lower HbA1c. In basic component score models, a SD increase in Component 1 (high loadings for 1-year NDVI) was associated with a 0.19% (95% CI: 0.04%, 0.34%) lower HbA1c. CI's crossed the null in multi-exposure and fully-adjusted component score models. There was little evidence of associations between air pollution and HbA1c, and no evidence of effect modification.CONCLUSIONS: Among non-diabetic adults, environmental exposures were not consistently associated with HbA1c. More work is needed to elucidate biological pathways between the environment and prediabetes.

TI  - Spatiotemporal-based automated inundation mapping of Ramsar wetlands using Google Earth Engine.
T2  - Scientific reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Wetlands are one of the most critical components of an ecosystem, supporting many ecological niches and a rich diversity of flora and fauna. The ecological significance of these sites makes it imperative to study the changes in their inundation extent and propose necessary measures for their conservation. This study analyzes all 64 Ramsar sites in China based on their inundation patterns using Landsat imagery from 1991 to 2020. Annual composites were generated using the short-wave infrared thresholding technique from June to September to create inundation maps. The analysis was carried out on each Ramsar site individually to account for its typical behavior due to regional geographical and climatic conditions. The results of the inundation analysis for each site were subjected to the Mann-Kendall test to determine their trends. The analysis showed that 8 sites exhibited a significantly decreasing trend, while 14 sites displayed a significantly increasing trend. The accuracy of the analysis ranged from a minimum of 72.0% for Hubei Wang Lake to a maximum of 98.0% for Zhangye Heihe Wetland National Nature Reserve. The average overall accuracy of the sites was found to be 90.0%. The findings emphasize the necessity for conservation strategies and policies for Ramsar sites.

TI  - Assessing vulnerability of densely populated areas to air pollution using Sentinel-5P imageries: a case study of the Nile Delta, Egypt.
T2  - Scientific reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Air pollution represents one of the major environmental stressors with serious implications on human health and ecosystem health. Recently remote sensing imageries; as an alternative cost and time-effective method compared with regular monitoring techniques, were used for provision of appropriate data concerning air quality over large areas. In this context, Sentinel-5P satellite provides high-resolution images of atmospheric pollutants including nitrogen dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM). The current work aims to delineate vulnerability of densely populated areas in Northern-Egypt to air pollution through retrieving CO and PM2.5 from Sentinel-5P images and validate the retrieved data through simultaneous In-Situ measurements. For this purpose, our approach comprised four-step methodology; data acquisition on study area, data manipulation, validation of retrieved air quality data and mapping the vulnerability to air pollution. Based on the data retrieved from the imagery, a composite vulnerability index for each CO and PM2.5 value was developed delineating the most vulnerable areas to air pollution in the Northern Nile Delta region. Such results revealed that Sentinel-5P imagery can serve as a valuable tool for monitoring air quality and assessing vulnerability of densely populated areas to air pollution. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the applied Sentinel-5P based model can be applied effectively for other air pollutants and can be extrapolated to other areas with similar and/or different environmental settings.

TI  - A century of canopy kelp persistence and recovery in the Gulf of Alaska.
T2  - Annals of botany
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coastal Alaska contains vast kelp habitat that supports diverse marine and human communities. Over the past century, the North Pacific Ocean has undergone oceanographic and ecological regime shifts which have the potential to strongly influence the structure and function of kelp ecosystems. However, the remoteness and complexity of the glacially carved region precludes regular monitoring efforts that would be necessary to detect such changes.METHODS: To begin to fill this critical knowledge gap, we drew upon historical and modern surveys to analyze change in spatial coverage and species composition of canopy kelp between two time points (1913 and the early 2000s to 2010s). We also incorporated decadal surveys on sea otter range expansion following complete extirpation and reintroduction to assess the influence of sea otter recovery on the spatial extent of canopy kelp.KEY RESULTS: We found increases in the spatial extent of canopy kelp throughout the Gulf of Alaska where there was coverage from both surveys. Kelp in Southcentral Alaska showed extensive recovery after the catastrophic Novarupta volcano. Kelp in Southeast Alaska showed persistence and spatial increase that closely matched range increases of sea otters. Observations of thermally tolerant kelp species increased more than observations of cold adapted species between the two surveys.CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to trends observed at lower latitudes, the kelp forests that ring the Gulf of Alaska have been remarkably stable and even increased in the past century, despite oceanographic and ecosystem changes. To improve monitoring, we propose identifying sentinel kelp beds for regular monitoring to more readily detect changes to these iconic and foundational canopy kelp species.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against hospitalizations in Paraguay, May 2021-April 2022: A test-negative design.
T2  - Vaccine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates vary by population characteristics and circulating variants. North America and Europe have generated many COVID-19 VE estimates but relied heavily on mRNA vaccines. Fewer estimates are available for non-mRNA vaccines and from Latin America. We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of several COVID-19 vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2-associated severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in Paraguay from May 2021 to April 2022.METHODS: Using sentinel surveillance data from four hospitals in Paraguay, we conducted a test-negative case-control study to estimate COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against SARI by vaccine type/brand and period of SARS-CoV-2 variant predominance (Gamma, Delta, Omicron). We used multivariable logistic regression adjusting for month of symptom onset, age group, and presence of ≥1 comorbidity to estimate the odds of COVID-19 vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 test-positive SARI case-patients compared to SARS-CoV-2 test-negative SARI control-patients.RESULTS: Of 4,229 SARI patients, 2,381 (56%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive case-patients and 1,848 (44%) were SARS-CoV-2-negative control-patients. A greater proportion of case-patients (73%; 95% CI: 71-75) than of control-patients (40%; 95% CI: 38-42) were unvaccinated. During the Gamma variant-predominant period, VE estimates for partial vaccination with mRNA vaccines and Oxford/AstraZeneca Vaxzevria were 90.4% (95% CI: 66.4-97.6) and 52.2% (95% CI: 25.0-69.0), respectively. During the Delta variant-predominant period, VE estimates for complete vaccination with mRNA vaccines, Oxford/AstraZeneca Vaxzevria, or Gamaleya Sputnik V were 90.4% (95% CI: 74.3-97.3), 83.2% (95% CI: 67.8-91.9), and 82.9% (95% CI: 53.0-95.2), respectively. The effectiveness of all vaccines declined substantially during the Omicron variant-predominant period.CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to our understanding of COVID-19 VE in Latin America and to global understanding of vaccines that have not been widely used in North America and Europe. VE estimates from Paraguay can parameterize models to estimate the impact of the national COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Paraguay and similar settings.

TI  - Using Sentinel images for analyzing water and land separability in an agricultural river basin.
T2  - Environmental monitoring and assessment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The presence or absence of water can result in floods or droughts, potentially impacting agricultural productivity to a great extent. With advancements in remote sensing technology, the reliability of identifying water bodies has significantly improved, particularly in terms of distinguishing between water and land. This study introduced remote sensing methods to improve the accuracy of differentiating water within the Dawenhe River basin. Various water body scenarios were examined, and the performance of these methods was evaluated to determine the proper approach for water-land separation. In applying water body indices to Sentinel-2 images, it was found that the normalized difference water index (NDWI) outperformed the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) in identifying water bodies. Consequently, histograms of frequency distribution for Sentinel-1 were generated, revealing that water and land were more distinguishable in VV polarization than in VH polarization. Using histogram thresholding on VV polarized images in Dongping Lake resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 97.58%, surpassing that of Otsu's method at 97.36%. To address the persisting misclassifications, this study identified three leading causes and proposed corresponding solutions. These solutions included (1) employing the morphological dilation algorithm to expand the water area, mitigating pixel mixing issues at the water-land boundary that caused the water bodies to appear smaller; (2) utilizing incidence angles and digital elevation model (DEM) to locate and remove shadows; and (3) slightly lowering the thresholds and manually correcting misclassifications. As a result, the average accuracy of the four areas increased from 95.56 to 96.94%.

TI  - Assessing spatiotemporal changes in landcover using geospatial and remote sensing techniques in the Southern fringes of Chennai.
T2  - Environmental monitoring and assessment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Peri-urban areas are transitional zones on the outer boundaries of cities. These regions have immense growth potential, and it is necessary to observe the land use landcover changes to understand the dynamics of these transformations. The area selected for this study is towards the Southern fringe of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, and is analyzed using multi-spectral satellite imagery from Landsat 5 and 8. The primary objective of the study is to assess the change in landcover classes, namely water, land, and vegetation, over a 30-year study period between 1991 and 2021. The peri-urban regions majorly are arable land. Hence, NDVI is considered a suitable index to monitor the landcover changes. The spatiotemporal analysis indicates an increase of 19.43% in land /barren areas towards the Northern parts near the study area and along the transit and industrial corridors. No significant changes are observed in the areas of vegetation that could be attributed to efforts taken to conserve reserve forests and increase green zones in newer developments. A steep depletion of 46.86% of water bodies observed in the region also corresponds to water scarcity problems. Accuracy was assessed using ground-truthing methods, computing the confusion matrix and Kappa coefficient. NDVI is used efficiently in the landcover classification but does not indicate the difference between built-up areas and barren land. Change detection map prepared using ARCGIS indicates the areas that have been converted to other landcover over a period of 30 years. The study reveals an urgent need to bring in policy decisions to conserve waterbodies and green spaces in the initial stages of urban planning for sustainable developments in the fringe areas.

TI  - Luminal A Versus B After Choosing Wisely: Does Lymph Node Surgery Affect Oncologic Outcomes?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background. In 2016, the Choosing Wisely campaign recommended against routine sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in women >= 70 years old diagnosed with early-stage hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer. No distinction is made between luminal A and luminal B phenotypes, despite luminal B being considered more aggressive. This study evaluates the effect of SLNB on oncologic outcomes in HER2- luminal B versus luminal A breast cancer.Patients and Methods. We performed an IRB-approved, single institution, retrospective cohort study from 2010 to 2020 of women aged >= 70 years with clinically node negative, HR+ breast cancer undergoing definitive surgical treatment. Luminal status was defined by gene expression panel testing, Ki67%, and/or pathologic grading. Primary endpoints included locoregional recurrence (LRR), disease free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS).Results. SLNB did not correlate with significant differences in LRR in luminal A (p = 0.92) or luminal B (p = 0.96) disease. SLNB correlated with improved DFS (p < 0.01) and OS (p < 0.001) in luminal A disease, but not in luminal B disease (DFS p = 0.73; OS p = 0.36). On multivariate analysis, age (HR = 1.17; p < 0.01) and tumor size (HR = 1.03; p < 0.05) were associated with DFS, while SLNB was not (p = 0.71). Luminal status (HR = 0.52, p < 0.05), age (HR = 1.15, p < 0.01), and comorbidities (HR = 1.35, p < 0.05) were associated with OS, but not SLNB (p = 0.71).Conclusions. Our results suggest that SLNB may be safely omitted in patients aged >= 70 years with luminal B disease given similar LRR in luminal A disease. Our findings suggest that DFS and OS are driven by tumor biology, patient age, and comorbidities rather than receipt of SLNB.

TI  - Interplay of Extracellular Vesicles and TLR4 Signaling in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Pathophysiology and Therapeutics.
T2  - Pharmaceutics
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stands as a significant contributor to global cancer-related mortality. Chronic inflammation, often arising from diverse sources such as viral hepatitis, alcohol misuse, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), profoundly influences HCC development. Within this context, the interplay of extracellular vesicles (EVs) gains prominence. EVs, encompassing exosomes and microvesicles, mediate cell-to-cell communication and cargo transfer, impacting various biological processes, including inflammation and cancer progression. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a key sentinel of the innate immune system, recognizes both pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), thereby triggering diverse signaling cascades and pro-inflammatory cytokine release. The intricate involvement of the TLR4 signaling pathway in chronic liver disease and HCC pathogenesis is discussed in this study. Moreover, we delve into the therapeutic potential of modulating the TLR4 pathway using EVs as novel therapeutic agents for HCC. This review underscores the multifaceted role of EVs in the context of HCC and proposes innovative avenues for targeted interventions against this formidable disease.

T2  - Life (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) have become a significant public health concern in the United States over the past few decades. The increasing incidence and geographical spread of these diseases have prompted the implementation of robust surveillance systems to monitor their prevalence, distribution, and impact on human health. This comprehensive review describes key disease features with the geographical distribution of all known tick-borne pathogens in the United States, along with examining disease surveillance efforts, focusing on strategies, challenges, and advancements. Surveillance methods include passive and active surveillance, laboratory-based surveillance, sentinel surveillance, and a One Health approach. Key surveillance systems, such as the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), TickNET, and the Tick-Borne Disease Laboratory Network (TBDLN), are discussed. Data collection and reporting challenges, such as underreporting and misdiagnosis, are highlighted. The review addresses challenges, including lack of standardization, surveillance in non-human hosts, and data integration. Innovations encompass molecular techniques, syndromic surveillance, and tick surveillance programs. Implications for public health cover prevention strategies, early detection, treatment, and public education. Future directions emphasize enhanced surveillance networks, integrated vector management, research priorities, and policy implications. This review enhances understanding of TBD surveillance, aiding in informed decision-making for effective disease prevention and control. By understanding the current surveillance landscape, public health officials, researchers, and policymakers can make informed decisions to mitigate the burden of (TBDs).

TI  - Regional Thermal Radiation Characteristics of FY Satellite Remote Sensing Based on Big Data Analysis.
T2  - Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - It is of great significance to study the thermal radiation anomalies of earthquake swarms in the same area in terms of selecting abnormal characteristic determination parameters, optimizing and determining the processing model, and understanding the abnormal machine. In this paper, we investigated short-term and long-term thermal radiation anomalies induced by earthquake swarms in Iran and Pakistan between 2007 and 2016. The anomalies were extracted from infrared remote sensing black body temperature data from the China Geostationary Meteorological Satellites (FY-2C/2E/2F/2G) using the multiscale time-frequency relative power spectrum (MS T-FRPS) method. By analyzing and summarizing the thermal radiation anomalies of series earthquake groups with consistency law through a stable and reliable MS T-FRPS method, we first obtained the relationship between anomalies and ShakeMaps from USGS and proposed the anomaly regional indicator (ARI) to determine seismic anomalies and the magnitude decision factor (MDF) to determine seismic magnitude. In addition, we explored the following discussions: earthquake impact on regional thermal radiation background and the relationship between thermal anomalies and earthquake magnitude and the like. Future research directions using the MS T-FRPS method to characterize regional thermal radiation anomalies induced by strong earthquakes could help improve the accuracy of earthquake magnitude determination.

TI  - Development of a Rare Earth Nanoprobe Enables In Vivo Real-Time Detection of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis of Breast Cancer Using NIR-IIb Imaging.
T2  - Cancer research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy plays a critical role in axillary staging of breast cancer. However, traditional SLN mapping does not accurately discern the presence or absence of metastatic disease. Detection of SLN metastasis largely hinges on examination of frozen sections or paraffin-embedded tissues post-SLN biopsy. To improve detection of SLN metastasis, we developed a second near-infrared (NIR-II) in vivo fluorescence imaging system, pairing erbium-based rare-earth nanoparticles (ErNP) with bright down-conversion fluorescence at 1,556 nm. To visualize SLNs bearing breast cancer, ErNPs were modified by balixafortide (ErNPs@POL6326), a peptide antagonist of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. The ErNPs@POL6326 probes readily drained into SLNs when delivered subcutaneously, entering metastatic breast tumor cells specifically via CXCR4-mediated endocytosis. NIR fluorescence signals increased significantly in tumor-positive versus tumor-negative SLNs, enabling accurate determination of SLN breast cancer metastasis. In a syngeneic mouse mammary tumor model and a human breast cancer xenograft model, sensitivity for SLN metastasis detection was 92.86% and 93.33%, respectively, and specificity was 96.15% and 96.08%, respectively. Of note, the probes accurately detected both macrometastases and micrometastases in SLNs. These results overall underscore the potential of ErNPs@POL6326 for real-time visualization of SLNs and in vivo screening for SLN metastasis.SIGNIFICANCE: NIR-IIb imaging of a rare-earth nanoprobe that is specifically taken up by breast cancer cells can accurately detect breast cancer macrometastases and micrometastases in sentinel lymph nodes.

TI  - Investigating the link between regional oxygen metabolism and cognitive speed in multiple sclerosis: Implications for fatigue.
T2  - Multiple sclerosis and related disorders
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most multiple sclerosis (MS) patients experience fatigue and cognitive decline but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Previous work has shown whole brain resting cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) is associated with the extent of these symptoms. However, it is not known if the association between global CMRO2 and MS-related cognitive speed and fatigue can be localized to specific brain regions. Based upon previous research suggesting prefrontal involvement in MS-related changes in cognitive speed and fatigue, we hypothesized that oxygen metabolic changes within prefrontal cortex (PFC) might form the pathophysiologic basis of cognitive performance and fatigue in MS patients.OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether PFC DeltaCMRO2 is associated with cognitive speed and fatigue in MS.METHODS: MS and healthy control (HC) participants were scanned using a dual--echo fMRI sequence and underwent a hypercapnia calibration experiment that permitted estimation of DeltaCMRO2 while performing a scanner version of symbol-digit modalities task, a measure of information processing speed and utilized in the clinic as a reliable sentinel biomarker for global cognitive impairment in MS. Participants then completed the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) to measure fatigue.RESULTS: MS patients exhibited significant reductions in cognitive performance relative to HCs (p<0.04). Prefrontal DeltaCMRO2 explained significant variability (DeltaR2=0.11) in cognitive speed, over and above disease and demographic variables, for the MS group only. Prefrontal DeltaCMRO2 was not associated with fatigue across groups. DeltaCMRO2 in visual and motor areas were not associated with cognitive performance or fatigue for either group.CONCLUSION: Prefrontal oxygen metabolism may be a sensitive measure of MS-related cognitive decline.

AB  - On the island of Guahan (Guam) native and endemic species are an integral part of the CHamoru language, rituals, and practices. They are interconnected with their culture and honored together with the ocean, the land, and their ancestors. Presently, this spiritual connection is being jeopardized as military expansion threatens the sacred lands of Tailalo' and Litekyan. Phylogenetic and ethnographic research, connected to the principles of environmental justice, has brought attention to the social movement to protect the last hayun lagu tree (Serianthes nelsonii) at Tailalo'. This opinion piece is a rallying cry to safeguard the last hayun lagu and to confront the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act and the U.S. Endangered Species Act, as its regulations do not mirror the island's social and cultural system and fail to incorporate Indigenous and scientific perspectives to protect Indigenous biocultural heritage.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and satellite-based remote sensing can be used to predict soybean (Glycine max) yield
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Because the manual counting of soybean (Glycine max) plants, pods, and seeds/pods is unsuitable for soybean yield predictions, alternative methods are desired. Therefore, the objective was to determine if satellite remote sensing-based artificial intelligence (AI) models could be used to predict soybean yield. In the study, multiple remote sensing-based AI models were developed for soybean growth stage ranging from VE/VC (plant emergence) to R6/R7 (full seed to beginning maturity). The ability of the deep neural network (DNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and AdaBoost to predict soybean yield, based on blue, green, red, and near-infrared reflectance data collected by the PlanetScope satellite at six growth stages, was determined. Remote sensing and soybean yield monitor data from three different fields in 2 years (2019 and 2021) were aggregated into 24,282 grid cells that had the dimensions of 10 m by 10 m. A comparison across models showed that the DNN outperformed the other models. Moreover, as crops matured from VE/VC to R4/R5, the R-2 value of the models increased from 0.26 to over 0.70. These findings indicate that remote sensing data collected at different growth stages can be combined for soybean yield predictions. Moreover, additional work needs to be conducted to assess the model's ability to predict soybean yield with vegetation indices (VIs) data for fields not used to train the model.

TI  - Detection and mapping of water and chlorophyll-a spread using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for water quality assessment of inland water bodies.
T2  - Environmental monitoring and assessment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Water quality monitoring of reservoirs is currently a significant challenge in the tropical regions of the world due to limited monitoring stations and hydrological data. Remote sensing techniques have proven to be a powerful tool for continuous real-time monitoring and assessment of tropical reservoirs water quality. Although many studies have detected chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations as a proxy to represent nutrient contamination, using Sentinel 2 for eutrophic or hypereutrophic inland water bodies, mainly reservoirs, minimal efforts have been made for oligotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs. The present study aimed to develop a modeling framework to map and estimate spatio-temporal variability of Chl-a levels and associated water spread using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI). Moreover, the impact of land use/land cover type of the contributing watershed in the oligo-mesotrophic reservoir, Bhadra (tropical reservoir), for 2018 and 2019 using Sentinel 2 satellite data was analyzed. The results show that the water spread area was higher in the post-monsoon months and lower in the summer months. This was further validated by the correlation with reservoir storage, which showed a strong relationship (R2 = 0.97, 2018; R2 = 0.93, 2019). The estimated Chl-a spread was higher in the winter season, because the reservoir catchment was dominated by deciduous forest, producing a large amount of leaf litter in tropical regions, which leads to an increase in the level of Chl-a. It was found that Chl-a spread in the reservoir, specifically at the inlet sources and near agricultural land practices (western parts of the Bhadra reservoir). Based on the findings of this study, the MCI spectral index derived from Sentinel 2 data can be used to accurately map the spread of Chl-a in diverse water bodies, thereby offering a robust scientific basis for effective reservoir management.

TI  - Mapping the number of mangrove trees in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.
T2  - Marine pollution bulletin
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Mangroves are vital components of coastal ecosystems. Due to the complex canopy morphology and dense distribution of mangroves, it is challenging to accurately estimate the density based on satellite data. In this study, a density regression-based mangrove mapping network is proposed. The network can capture the multi-scale characteristics of mangroves through the combination of an attention mechanism and a parallel segmentation path, and its performance is better than existing methods. We then apply it to mapping the Greater Bay Area (GBA) the number of mangrove trees. The results show about 2.55 million mangrove trees in the GBA, with an average density of 782 trees per hectare. The tree number of mangroves on the beach is significantly higher than those distributed along the riverbank. This study is the first to achieve mangrove tree count mapping, opening up new prospects for applying satellite-based mangrove monitoring.

TI  - Quality of life and functional outcomes in tongue cancer patients: a long-term, prospective, comparative study.
T2  - Medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The tongue has an indispensable role in communication, swallowing and breathing. Tongue cancer treatment involves direct resection of the tumor and surrounding tissue, which can limit many essential functions of the tongue. There are few patient-reported quality of life studies involving tongue cancer exclusively. There is also a lack of data on the outcomes of quality of life regarding different reconstructive methods, adjuvant non-surgical therapies and other predicting factors. Our objective is to assess the quality of life, functional status, and predicting factors in patients with tongue cancer up to one year after surgical resection.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients with tongue cancer were prospectively identified between October of 2017 and January 2021. Patients were examined before and one, three, six and twelve months after surgical resection with the validated University of Washington Quality of Life questionnaire (UW-QOL). Data collection included patient age, sex, TNM staging, size of resection, neck dissection, tracheostomy, reconstructive method and adjuvant therapies. Outcome scores were compared using the Friedman test. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the predictors of quality of life and functional status.RESULTS: The use of UWQOL scores as dependent variables revealed the following predicting factors: age, tobacco use, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, reconstruction method and neck dissection.CONCLUSIONS: The most relevant findings in our study are that flap reconstruction becomes increasingly necessary when a glossectomy resection is over 45 mm, in order to maintain tongue function. We established that the reconstructive flap type does not influence quality of life in the long term. Also, we have found that cervical sentinel node biopsy provides better quality of life over neck dissection in the first 3 months after surgery.

TI  - Multi-temporal SAR Interferometry (MTInSAR)-based study of surface subsidence and its impact on Krishna Godavari (KG) basin in India: a support vector approach.
T2  - Environmental monitoring and assessment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The surface subsidence in the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin in India has increased with the discovery of crude oil and natural gas reserves since 1983. With private players coming up to bag the exploration and refining contracts, there must be timely monitoring of the surface subsidence of the region so that remedial measures for the resettlement of the populations can be taken promptly. Regular monitoring is necessary since the region is fertile and any seawater ingress results in the loss of valuable cultivable land. Multi-temporal SAR Interferometry (MTInSAR) technique has been applied successfully all over the world for the study and regular monitoring of land surface subsidence scenarios. This study utilizes data from Sentinel-1 C-band SAR sensor for MTInSAR-based surface subsidence and RADAR Vegetation Index (RVI)-based vegetation loss for the same season estimation between 2017 and 2022 for the KG basin region. It is inferred from the study that the region has shown surface subsidence of 80mm/year between April 2020 and June 2022. This study uses support vector regressor (SVR) to predict the loss in forest cover in terms of RVI using MTInSAR-based surface subsidence, VH, and VV backscatter as parameters. It is observed that the SVR gave R2-statistics of 0.89 and 0.873 in the training and testing phases with a mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.08 and 0.02, respectively. It is also observed that the region showed a loss of 3.21 km2 of cultivable land between 2020 and 2022.

TI  - Interval Sentinel Lymph Nodes With the Use of Routine Lymphoscintigraphy in Extremity Melanoma.
T2  - The Journal of surgical research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lymphoscintigraphy (LS) helps identify drainage to interval (epitrochlear or popliteal) lymph node basins for extremity melanomas. This study evaluated how often routine LS evaluation identified an interval sentinel lymph node (SLN) and how often that node was found to have metastasis.METHODS: A single institution, retrospective study identified patients with an extremity melanoma who underwent routine LS and SLN biopsy over a 25-y period. Comparisons of factors associated with the identification of interval node drainage and tumor status were made.RESULTS: In 634 patients reviewed, 5.7% of patients drained to an interval SLN. Of those biopsied, 29.2% were positive for micrometastases. Among patients with biopsies of both the traditional and interval nodal basins, nearly 20% had positive interval nodes with negative SLNs in the traditional basin. Sex, age, thickness, ulceration, and the presence of mitotic figures were not predictive of identifying an interval node on LS, nor for having disease in an interval node. Anatomic location of the primary melanoma was the only identifiable risk factor, as no interval nodes were identified in melanomas of the thigh or upper arm (P ≤ 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Distal extremity melanomas have a moderate risk of mapping to an interval SLN. Routine LS should be considered in these patients, especially as these may be the only tumor-positive nodes. However, primary extremity melanomas proximal to the epitrochlear or popliteal nodal basins do not map to interval nodes, and improved savings and workflow could be realized by selectively omitting routine LS in such patients.

TI  - Multi-factor artificial intelligence model assists axillary lymph node surgery in breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: multicenter retrospective cohort study.
T2  - International journal of surgery (London, England)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high false negative rate associated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) often leads to unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. We aimed to develop a multi-factor artificial intelligence (AI) model to aid in axillary lymph node surgery.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1038 patients were enrolled, comprising 234 patients in the primary cohort, 723 patients in three external validation cohorts, and 81 patients in the prospective cohort. For predicting axillary lymph node response to NAC, robust longitudinal radiomics features were extracted from pre-NAC and post-NAC magnetic resonance images. The U test, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and the spearman analysis were used to select the most significant features. A machine learning stacking model was constructed to detect ALN metastasis after NAC. By integrating the significant predictors, we developed a multi-factor AI-assisted surgery pipeline and compared its performance and false negative rate (FNR) with that of SLNB alone.RESULTS: The machine learning stacking model achieved excellent performance in detecting ALN metastasis, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.958 in the primary cohort, 0.881 in the external validation cohorts, and 0.882 in the prospective cohort. Furthermore, the introduction of AI-assisted surgery reduced the FNRs from 14.88% (18/121) to 4.13% (5/121) in the primary cohort, from 16.55% (49/296) to 4.05% (12/296) in the external validation cohorts, and from 13.64% (3/22) to 4.55% (1/22) in the prospective cohort. Notably, when more than two SLNs were removed, the FNRs further decreased to 2.78% (2/72) in the primary cohort, 2.38% (4/168) in the external validation cohorts, and 0% (0/15) in the prospective cohort.CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the potential of AI-assisted surgery as a valuable tool for evaluating ALN response to NAC, leading to a reduction in unnecessary ALND procedures.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - While soil salinization is a major threat to the food security and sustainability of humanity, information on salinization in developing countries is limited. In this study, Landsat data were used to predict the salinization process from 1986 to 2021 in the Kur-Araz lowland of Azerbaijan, and water movement and salinity transport models were developed to calculate the effects of climate change and water management. The model results showed that increases in rainfall and drainage have led to dramatic improvements in soil salinity and agricultural productivity and that these changes were caused by the synergistic effect of climate change and water management. The future predictions indicate that rainfall will decrease due to the decrease in evaporation in the neighboring Caspian Sea, leading to further re-salinization. Soil re-salinization would be a severe threat to the sustainability of the agricultural industry and food security of Azerbaijan and neighboring countries. More scientific attention and efforts should be devoted to developing countries in preparation for the impact of climate change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the trends in norovirus cases to determine whether chief complaint-based emergency department (ED) visits data could reflect trends of norovirus in Korea.METHODS: The ED visits from the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) database and the weekly reported number of noroviruses from the sentinel surveillance system were collected between August 2017 and December 2020. The correlation between weekly norovirus cases and weekly ED visits considering the chief complaint and discharge diagnosis code was estimated using a three-week moving average.RESULTS: In total, 6,399,774 patients with chief complaints of digestive system disease visited ED. A higher correlation between reported norovirus cases and ED visit with chief complaint of vomiting and discharge diagnosis code of gastroenteritis and colitis of unspecified origin or other and unspecified gastroenteritis and colitis of infectious origin was observed (R=0.88, p<.0001). The correlation was highest for the 0-4-years age group (R=0.89, p<.0001). However, no correlation was observed between the reported norovirus cases and the number of emergency department visits with norovirus identified as a discharge diagnosis code.CONCLUSIONS: ED visit data considering a combination of chief complaints and discharged diagnosis code would be available for early detection of infectious disease trends.

TI  - Mikhail Bakhtin and Lev Shestov on Dostoevsky: the unfinalized dialogue
T2  - STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Bakhtin's view of the history of the novel, through the lens of Dostoevsky's writing in his famous study on Dostoevsky's poetics (1963), has had a significant impact on the way we read Dostoevsky today. On the other hand, Shestov's original explorations of the human soul, which were drawn on his reading of Dostoevsky and made a lasting impression on his contemporaries, are still relatively unknown to the English-speaking reader. Having traced the history of the regenerations of Dostoevsky's convictions in his earlier works, in his mature writings Shestov proposed that at a time of deep crisis the human mind may acquire a new dimension, which lies beyond the limits of the comprehensible and the explicable. Building on his analysis of Dostoevsky's life and work, a transformative shift in Shestov's own worldview, led to significant alterations in his reading of Dostoevsky in the final years of his life.In this essay, as I draw the two thinkers into a dialogue, I try to look beyond the obvious differences in the two philosophers' views (though I acknowledge them) and, with respect to both thinkers' outstanding contributions to twentieth-century European culture, I attempt to discover a number of key developing points in their views derived from their shared love of Dostoevsky's art. Contrasting Shestov's interpretation of Dostoevsky to that of Bakhtin's, I argue that despite their different methods, standpoints, and philosophical views, and despite the seemingly antagonizing nature of their observations, Bakhtin and Shestov arrived at a number of conclusions, which contributed to our present understanding of Dostoevsky's worldview.

TI  - Clinical relevance of sentinel lymph node biopsy in early ovarian cancer.
T2  - Obstetrics & gynecology science
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The first-line treatment for early ovarian cancer typically involves primary debulking surgery aimed at maximal cytoreduction, alongside adjuvant chemotherapy if clinically indicated. Nodal assessment involving pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection is typically performed during the primary debulking surgery. However, the survival benefit of lymphadenectomy in patients with early ovarian cancer has not been well established, and the procedure is associated with longer operation time and higher perioperative complications. With the emergence of minimally invasive surgery as a potential alternative to laparotomy for early ovarian cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy has been evaluated in this setting. In this review, we summarized the current literature regarding sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with early ovarian cancer, focusing on the clinical relevance of this method, including its detection rate and diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, we discuss the current status of clinical trials investigating sentinel lymph node biopsy in early ovarian cancer cases.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Desmoplastic melanoma (DM), a type of spindle cell melanoma separated into pure desmoplastic melanoma (PDM) and mixed desmoplastic melanoma (MDM) subtypes, can be a diagnostic challenge and easily confused for dermal scar, especially PDM. We report a 65-year-old white man who received a left thumb amputation after an initial biopsy for melanoma, an unclassified type with epithelioid morphology. The amputation and sentinel lymph node specimens were significant for residual melanoma with epithelioid morphology, dermal scar, and a slightly expanded "scar-like" capsular area in one of seven lymph nodes, which was diffusely positive for SOX10 on reflex sentinel lymph node immunohistochemical protocol. On re-review of the amputation "scar" like area, a subsequent SOX10 stain confirmed the diagnosis of MDM in this area with epithelioid and spindle cell morphology, significantly upgrading the tumor stage. We share this case to highlight: (i) MDM, although exceptionally uncommon, can result in a pure spindle cell lymph node metastasis, (ii) to encourage increased utilization of SOX10 to assess sentinel lymph node biopsies, especially in the context of melanomas with a spindle cell component, and (iii) share an example of inattentional blindness which was fortunately identified by reflex sentinel lymph node immunohistochemical protocols.

T2  - Chronobiology international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is related to various diseases, such as cancer, obesity, and coronary heart disease. However, its impact on blood pressure in adolescents is not well understood. To investigate this, we conducted a cross-sectional study with a nationwide sample of college students in China, who were freshmen from four disperse universities during Sep. and Oct. 2018. Mean levels of ALAN at participants' residential addresses during 2013-2018 were estimated using time-varying satellite data. The association of the 6-y average of ALAN with blood pressure was estimated by using generalized linear mixed models. A total of 17046 participants (18.2±0.7y of age, 46.79% female) from 2,412 counties and cities were included in the final analysis. After a full adjustment for potential confounders, ALAN was positively associated with systolic blood pressure (beta=0.20, p=0.032) and pulse pressure (beta=0.28, p = 0.001), but there was no association between ALAN and diastolic blood pressure (beta=-0.08, p=0.213). In the sensitivity analysis, the results consistent with the main analysis were observed. The blood pressure of males and those with a BMI≤24kg/m2 were more susceptible to ALAN exposure. Our findings highlight the importance of ALAN management for blood pressure control, particularly among male and normal-weight individuals.

TI  - Snow Cover Response to Climatological Factors at the Beas River Basin of W. Himalayas from MODIS and ERA5 Datasets.
T2  - Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Glaciers and snow are critical components of the hydrological cycle in the Himalayan region, and they play a vital role in river runoff. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the glaciers and snow cover on a spatiotemporal basis to better understand the changes in their dynamics and their impact on river runoff. A significant amount of data is necessary to comprehend the dynamics of snow. Yet, the absence of weather stations in inaccessible locations and high elevation present multiple challenges for researchers through field surveys. However, the advancements made in remote sensing have become an effective tool for studying snow. In this article, the snow cover area (SCA) was analysed over the Beas River basin, Western Himalayas for the period 2003 to 2018. Moreover, its sensitivity towards temperature and precipitation was also analysed. To perform the analysis, two datasets, i.e., MODIS-based MOYDGL06 products for SCA estimation and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Atmospheric Reanalysis of the Global Climate (ERA5) for climate data were utilized. Results showed an average SCA of ~56% of its total area, with the highest annual SCA recorded in 2014 at ~61.84%. Conversely, the lowest annual SCA occurred in 2016, reaching ~49.2%. Notably, fluctuations in SCA are highly influenced by temperature, as evidenced by the strong connection between annual and seasonal SCA and temperature. The present study findings can have significant applications in fields such as water resource management, climate studies, and disaster management.

TI  - HP-LSP: A reference of land surface phenology from fused Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 with PhenoCam data.
T2  - Scientific data
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) products are currently of large uncertainties due to cloud contaminations and other impacts in temporal satellite observations and they have been poorly validated because of the lack of spatially comparable ground measurements. This study provided a reference dataset of gap-free time series and phenological dates by fusing the Harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) observations with near-surface PhenoCam time series for 78 regions of 10*10km2 across ecosystems in North America during 2019 and 2020. The HLS-PhenoCam LSP (HP-LSP) reference dataset at 30m pixels is composed of: (1) 3-day synthetic gap-free EVI2 (two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index) time series that are physically meaningful to monitor the vegetation development across heterogeneous levels, train models (e.g., machine learning) for land surface mapping, and extract phenometrics from various methods; and (2) four key phenological dates (accuracy ≤5 days) that are spatially continuous and scalable, which are applicable to validate various satellite-based phenology products (e.g., global MODIS/VIIRS LSP), develop phenological models, and analyze climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Axillary Treatment and Chronic Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema: Implications for Prospective Surveillance and Intervention From a Randomized Controlled Trial.
T2  - JCO oncology practice
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: The PREVENT randomized trial assessed progression to chronic breast cancer-related lymphedema (cBCRL) after intervention triggered by bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) or tape measurement (TM). This secondary analysis identifies cBCRL risk factors on the basis of axillary treatment.METHODS: Between June 2014 and September 2018, 881 patients received sentinel node biopsy (SNB; n = 651), SNB + regional node irradiation (RNI; n = 58), axillary lymph node dissection (ALND; n = 85), or ALND + RNI (n = 87). The primary outcome was the 3-year cBCRL rate requiring complex decongestive physiotherapy (CDP).RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 32.8 months (IQR, 21-34.3), 69 of 881 patients (7.8%) developed cBCRL. For TM, 43 of 438 (9.8%) developed cBCRL versus 26 of 443 (5.9%) for BIS (P = .028). The 3-year actuarial risk of cBCRL was 4.4% (95% CI, 2.7 to 6.1), 4.2% (95% CI, 0 to 9.8), 25.8% (95% CI, 15.8 to 35.8), and 26% (95% CI, 15.3 to 36.7). Rural residence increased the risk in all groups. For SNB, neither RNI (SNB, 4.1% v SNB + RNI, 3.4%) nor taxane (4.4%) increased cBCRL, but risk was higher for patients with a BMI of ≥30 (6.3%). For SNB + RNI, taxane use (5.7%) or supraclavicular fossa (SCF) radiation (5.0%) increased cBCRL. For ALND patients, BMI ≥25 or chemotherapy increased cBCRL. For ALND + RNI, most patients received SCF radiation and taxanes, so no additional risk factors emerged.CONCLUSION: The extent of axillary treatment is a significant risk factor for cBCRL. Increasing BMI, rurality, SCF radiation, and taxane chemotherapy also increase risk. These results have implications for a proposed risk-based lymphedema screening, early intervention, and treatment program.

TI  - Identification and organ-specific patterns of expression of two metallothioneins in the sentinel species Gammarus fossarum.
T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part B, Biochemistry & molecular biology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Metal pollution is a major concern for aquatic environments. Widespread contamination by various trace metal ions has been described in freshwater streams as well as their subsequent bioaccumulation, potentially leading to toxicity and trophic transfer. Metallothioneins constitute an evolutionary conserved family of low molecular weight, cysteine-rich, metal-chelating proteins, whose known physiological functions are the maintenance of the homeostasis of essential metals, the detoxification of non-essential metals, and the protection against oxidative stress and free radicals. In this study, we identified two metallothionein-coding transcripts, mt1 and mt2, in the transcriptome of the amphipod Gammarus fossarum, a sentinel species widely used to assess the quality of watersheds. For the first time, we investigated the organ-specific patterns of expression of these two mt transcripts at the individual level in the gills and the caeca of this small crustacean. In silico analysis and experimental exposures to environmentally relevant concentrations of cadmium, zinc and silver showed that G. fossarum mt1 induction is stronger after Cd exposure compared to the other tested metals. G. fossarum mt1 was more significantly induced in the caeca than in the gills of exposed organisms for any metal exposure, while G. fossarum mt2 was, at least at the individual level, more inducible in the gills than in the caeca of G. fossarum exposed to Cd and Zn. Our results provide new genetic resources that will help to improve the understanding of metal homeostasis in this sentinel species.

TI  - Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of pathological axillary lymph nodes in cases of breast cancer
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY AND NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBreast cancer is the most frequent cancer affecting females. It represents leading cause of death from all cancers in females. Traditionally, axillary staging was surgically assessed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), which is associated with complications. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a minimally invasive surgical method for axillary staging in patients with primary breast cancer with lower morbidity and better quality of life. Clinical examination of the axilla is usually associated with a high false negative rate, so role of imaging is crucial to identify lymph nodes with or without suspicious features, to predict the pathological state of the lymph nodes and to direct the diagnostic and therapeutic process toward SLNB, ALND, or chemotherapy. Aim of this study was to assess axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients by magnetic resonance imaging and functional MRI preoperatively to determine its nature and eliminate invasive procedures as invasive dissection used in diagnosis.ResultsLymph node size cannot significantly predict malignant infiltration with p value 0.425, using cut-off value of 21.5 mm, with a sensitivity of 14.6% and specificity of 100%. Cortical thickness of lymph nodes can significantly predict malignant infiltration with p value 0.006, using cut-off value of 4.5 mm, with a sensitivity of 68.8%, specificity of 62.5%, and diagnostic accuracy of 64.1%. ADC can significantly predict lymph node infiltration with p value 0.011, using a cut-off value of 0.99, with sensitivity of 43.85, specificity of 100%, diagnostic accuracy of 57.8%, and AUC of 71.4%. There was a statistically significant correlation between pathological findings and DCE-MRI curve type III with p value 0.0001, showing a sensitivity of 37.5%, specificity of 100%, and diagnostic accuracy of 84.4% for detection of malignant lymph nodes.ConclusionsCortical thickness and effaced fatty hilum of lymph nodes can significantly predict malignant infiltration, while lymph node size cannot significantly predict malignant infiltration. Diffusion weighted images and ADC maps can be of significant value in predicting metastatic lymph nodes with approximate ADC cut-off value of 0.99. Kinetic MRI features of the axillary lymph nodes are not reliable enough to be used alone in the clinical management of breast cancer patients.

TI  - The 10-m cotton maps in Xinjiang, China during 2018-2021
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Cotton maps (10 m) of Xinjiang (XJ_COTTON10), which is the largest cotton production region of China, were produced from 2018 to 2021 through supervised classification. A two-step mapping strategy, i.e., cropland mapping followed by cotton extraction, was employed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cotton mapping for a large region of about 1.66 million km2 with high heterogeneity. Additionally, the time-series satellite data related to spectral, textural, structural, and phenological features were combined and used in a supervised random forest classifier. The cotton/non-cotton classification model achieved overall accuracies of about 95% and 90% on the test samples of the same and adjacent years, respectively. The proposed two-step cotton mapping strategy proved promising and effective in producing multi-year and consistent cotton maps. XJ_COTTON10 agreed well with the statistical areas of cotton at the county level (R2 = 0.84-0.94). This is the first cotton mapping for the entire Xinjiang at 10-meter resolution, which can provide a basis for high-precision cotton monitoring and policymaking in China.

TI  - Assessment of the impacts of land use/land cover change on water resources in the Diyala River, Iraq
T2  - OPEN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the analysis was carried out concerning previous changes in land use/land cover (LULC) for 2 years, 2000 and 2020, and their impact on water resources in the Diyala River Watershed in Iraq was assessed. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is a hydrological model used to perform the hydrological modeling process for LULC maps. The data for LULC were collected using the Landsat satellite with a resolution of 30 m, and it was classified using geographical information systems (ArcGIS). Using the confusion matrix, the accuracy of the maps for the years 2000 and 2020 was evaluated, the overall accuracy was more than 90%, and the kappa coefficient (ka) was more than 88%, which indicates the accuracy of the classification and is ideal for use in modeling work. SUFI-2 included with the SWATCUP program was used to perform the calibration and the results were validated for the outflow of the two gauging stations within the study area of Hemren station and Derbendikhan station as a monthly time step for a baseline map LULC 2000, in the period 1996-2020 with 4 years as warm up. Coefficient of determination (R (2)), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and percent bias (Pbias) were used, which were the most common indicators for evaluating the performance of the statistical model. The results indicated that the values of R (2) during the calibration and validation processes were (0.84-0.88) and (0.85-0.87), respectively; the NSE was (0.87-0.85), and the Pbias was (4.2-6.8)% and (5.8 to -4.1)%, respectively. Therefore, the calibration and verification results were good and satisfactory. In addition to the two LULC maps for 2000 and 2020, the parameters of the modified SWAT model were utilized to estimate the effects on the Diyala River Basin. The study found that LULC change affects basins and sub-basins differently. At the basin, hydrological parameters were largely unaffected by LULC changes. However, at the sub-basin level, the water yield and the surface runoff were changed between (-6.45 to 4.67)% and (-2.9 to 9.88)%, respectively.

TI  - Integrating remote sensing derived indices and machine learning algorithms for precise extraction of small surface water bodies in the lower<i> Thoubal</i> river watershed, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water resources have witnessed various challenges namely shortage of water availability, deterioration in water quality and reduction of water bodies due to climate change and anthropogenic activities. Thus, extracting surface water bodies accurately and examining trend in their areal extent assumes greater significance. This study makes a novel attempt to utilize remote sensing derived indices and machine learning algorithms to extract and examine spatio-temporal changes in surface water bodies in the lower Thoubal river watershed. Spectral water indices were derived using Landsat data for the years 1989, 1997, 2005, 2013 and 2020 and were fed into machine learning algorithms for precise extraction of surface water bodies. The random forest model exhibited superior performance in terms of surface water extraction. The Mann-Kendall test was then used to examine the trend of surface water bodies during 1989-2020. The analysis revealed a significant declining trend in water extent over the past three decades. Future simulations using a Markov-Chain model also projected a decreasing trend in water bodies for the years 2030 and 2040 in both wet and dry months. The morphological pattern of the surface water bodies was assessed using morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA). It has also shown decrease in area under water bodies. These changes in the dynamics of surface water bodies may be attributed to human encroachment on wetlands for settlement and farming purposes, damming of streamflow, garbage dumping and climate change. Thus, a comprehensive approach encompassing water conservation, demand management, supply augmentation, legislation and long-term planning is essential for fostering sustainable water resource management. The findings of the study may serve as a valuable record for decision-making process and policy responses. We argue that the methodology applied in the study may help in protecting and conserving neglected small surface water bodies in other geographical regions.

TI  - Aerosols heat up the Himalayan climate
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of aerosols, especially the absorbing aerosols, in the Himalayan region is important for climate. We closely examine ground-based high-quality observations of aerosol characteristics including radiative forcing from several locations in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), the Himalayan foothills and the Tibetan Plateau, relatively poorly studied regions with several sensitive ecosystems of global importance, as well as highly vulnerable large populations. This paper presents a state-of-the-art treatment of the warming that arises from these particles, using a combination of new measurements and modeling techniques. This is a first-time analysis of its kind, including ground-based observations, satellite data, and model simulations, which reveals that the aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (ARFE) in the atmosphere is clearly high over the IGP and the Himalayan foothills (80-135 Wm(-2) per unit aerosol optical depth (AOD)), with values being greater at higher elevations. AOD is >0.30 and single scattering albedo (SSA) is similar to 0.90 throughout the year over this region. The mean ARFE is 2-4 times higher here than over other polluted sites in South and East Asia, owing to higher AOD and aerosol absorption (i.e., lower SSA). Further, the observed annual mean aerosol induced atmospheric heating rates (0.5-0.8 Kelvin/day), which are significantly higher than previously reported values for the region, imply that the aerosols alone could account for >50 % of the total warming (aerosols + greenhouse gases) of the lower atmosphere and surface over this region. We demonstrate that the current state-of-the-art models used in climate assessments significantly underestimate aerosol-induced heating, efficiency and warming over the Hindu Kush - Himalaya - Tibetan Plateau (HKHTP) region, indicating a need for a more realistic representation of aerosol properties, especially of black carbon and other aerosols. The significant, regionally coherent aerosol induced warming that we observe in the high altitudes of the region, is a significant factor contributing to increasingair temperature, observed accelerated retreat of the glaciers, and changes in the hydrological cycle and precipitation patterns over this region. Thus, aerosols are heating up the Himalayan climate, and will remain a key factor driving climate change over the region.

TI  - Coupling of machine learning and remote sensing for soil salinity mapping in coastal area of Bangladesh.
T2  - Scientific reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Soil salinity is a pressing issue for sustainable food security in coastal regions. However, the coupling of machine learning and remote sensing was seldom employed for soil salinity mapping in the coastal areas of Bangladesh. The research aims to estimate the soil salinity level in a southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh. Using the Landsat OLI images, 13 soil salinity indicators were calculated, and 241 samples of soil salinity data were collected from a secondary source. This study applied three distinct machine learning models (namely, random forest, bagging with random forest, and artificial neural network) to estimate soil salinity. The best model was subsequently used to categorize soil salinity zones into five distinct groups. According to the findings, the artificial neural network model has the highest area under the curve (0.921), indicating that it has the most potential to predict and detect soil salinity zones. The high soil salinity zone covers an area of 977.94km2 or roughly 413.51% of the total study area. According to additional data, a moderate soil salinity zone (686.92km2) covers 30.56% of Satkhira, while a low soil salinity zone (582.73km2) covers 25.93% of the area. Since increased soil salinity adversely affects human health, agricultural production, etc., the study's findings will be an effective tool for policymakers in integrated coastal zone management in the southwestern coastal area of Bangladesh.

TI  - Why do transgender individuals experience discrimination in healthcare and thereby limited access to healthcare? An interview study exploring the perspective of German transgender individuals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTransgender individuals experience limited access to healthcare. This results not least from experiences of discrimination to which they are exposed in the health system. These contribute to transgender individuals having poorer health than cis individuals, i.e. individuals whose sex assigned at birth is in line with their gender identity. It is an ethical duty to take effective measures to minimize inequalities in medical care. At best, such measures should also be assessed as appropriate from the perspective of those affected in order to be accepted and thus effective. It is therefore important to know whether measures touch on the subjectively assumed reasons for experiences of discrimination. Hence, to be able to take appropriate measures, it is important to identify the reasons that transgender individuals see as causal for their experiences of discrimination in healthcare.MethodsWe conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 German transgender individuals and asked them about their own experiences of discrimination in healthcare and their assumptions on the reasons for discrimination. We analyzed the responses using the method of structured qualitative content analysis.Results13 transgender individuals reported experiences of discrimination in healthcare. These emanated from different professional groups and took place in trans-specific as well as general medical settings. We were able to identify a total of 12 reasons that transgender individuals see as causal for their experiences of discrimination: (1) internalized trans-hostility and "protection" of cis individuals, (2) lack of knowledge/uncertainties regarding transition, (3) "protection" of a binary worldview, (4) binary worldview in medicine, (5) structural deficits, (6) asymmetric interactions with specialists, (7) current political debate, (8) view of transgender individuals as a "burden for society", (9) objectification, (10) homophobia, (11) misogyny/androcentrism and (12) discrimination as reaction to discrimination.ConclusionsGerman transgender individuals have a very differentiated picture regarding their subjective reasons for experiencing discrimination in healthcare. Overall, disrespect regarding gender identity and a confrontation with foreignness seems to be seen as the decisive factor. Thus, it is not enough to focus only on measures that aim to remedy the information deficit on the part of medical providers. Measures must be taken that can create a granting and respectful attitude towards transgender individuals.

TI  - Blue carbon storage in a tropical coastal estuary: Insights for conservation priorities.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems have been determined as necessary sinks in the global carbon cycle and contribute towards climate change mitigations. In the recent past, there has been an increase of studies focused on blue carbon opportunities provided by seagrasses but large knowledge gaps and uncertainties remain, particularly in tropical seagrass meadows in the South Asian regions. Therefore, the current study aims to quantify the organic carbon stocks in the seagrass meadows on the tropical estuary in southern coast of Sri Lanka and highlights the need of conserving seagrasses specially in the context of effective management of lagoons to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. Landsat 9 (OLI/TIRS) images were used to develop seagrass distribution maps for 2022 and the data were verified with ground truthing. Vegetation and soil samples were taken from eight sampling locations representing the Rekawa Lagoon. Aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) were determined by multiplying the biomass with the carbon conversion factor whereas the loss-on-ignition (LOI) technique was applied to calculate the soil organic carbon. Results revealed that the soil core carbon content of the study site were ranged between 2.56±0.29 to 3.04±0.44Mg C/ha. The calculated total carbon content of the 0.0324km2 study area in Rekawa Lagoon was 10.21Mg C, giving 87.06% contribution from sediment organic carbon pool. This study provides insights for the conservation of these critical ecosystems and highlights the need of policy and action agendas for better management.

This paper tests whether this finding holds in the context of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Specifically, it examines the impact of a cadre transfer policy whereby the central government assigns (nonresident) officials to provincial leadership positions rather than them being elected locally. Using data covering the period 2005-2017, changes in the development of provinces led by local (embedded) leaders versus nonlocal leaders are compared. Provincial development is measured using the incidence of headcount poverty as well as "vegetation" and "build-up" indices constructed using satellite data. Using fixed-effects modeling, findings suggest that improved provincial development is associated with nonlocal leaders. This finding is in contrast to those of existing studies including those examining embeddedness in other authoritarian states.

TI  - Linkage between Airborne Particulate Matter and Viral Pandemic COVID-19 in Bucharest.
T2  - Microorganisms
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The long-distance spreading and transport of airborne particulate matter (PM) of biogenic or chemical compounds, which are thought to be possible carriers of SARS-CoV-2 virions, can have a negative impact on the incidence and severity of COVID-19 viral disease. Considering the total Aerosol Optical Depth at 550 nm (AOD) as an atmospheric aerosol loading variable, inhalable fine PM with a diameter ≤2.5 m (PM2.5) or coarse PM with a diameter ≤10 m (PM10) during 26 February 2020-31 March 2022, and COVID-19's five waves in Romania, the current study investigates the impact of outdoor PM on the COVID-19 pandemic in Bucharest city. Through descriptive statistics analysis applied to average daily time series in situ and satellite data of PM2.5, PM10, and climate parameters, this study found decreased trends of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations of 24.58% and 18.9%, respectively compared to the pre-pandemic period (2015-2019). Exposure to high levels of PM2.5 and PM10 particles was positively correlated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality. The derived average PM2.5/PM10 ratios during the entire pandemic period are relatively low (<0.44), indicating a dominance of coarse traffic-related particles' fraction. Significant reductions of the averaged AOD levels over Bucharest were recorded during the first and third waves of COVID-19 pandemic and their associated lockdowns (~28.2% and ~16.4%, respectively) compared to pre-pandemic period (2015-2019) average AOD levels. The findings of this research are important for decision-makers implementing COVID-19 safety controls and health measures during viral infections.

TI  - Cell-Free DNA Methylation Analysis as a Marker of Malignancy in Pleural Fluid.
T2  - Research square
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Background Diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is made by cytological examination of pleural fluid or histological examination of pleural tissue from biopsy. Unfortunately, detection of malignancy using cytology has an overall sensitivity of 50%, and is dependent upon tumor load, volume of fluid assessed, and cytopathologist experience. The diagnostic yield of pleural fluid cytology is also compromised by low abundance of tumor cells or when morphology is obscured by inflammation or reactive mesothelial cells. A reliable molecular marker that may complement fluid cytology malignant pleural effusion diagnosis is needed. The purpose of this study was to establish a molecular diagnostic approach based on pleural effusion cell-free DNA methylation analysis for the differential diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion and benign pleural effusion. Results This was a blind, prospective case-control biomarker study. We recruited 104 patients with pleural effusion for the study. We collected pleural fluid from patients with: MPE (n=48), PPE (n=28), and benign PE (n=28), and performed the Sentinel-MPE liquid biopsy assay. The methylation level of Sentinel-MPE was markedly higher in the MPE samples compared to BPE control samples (p<0.0001) and the same tendency was observed relative to PPE (p=0.004). We also noted that the methylation signal was significantly higher in PPE relative to BPE (p<0.001). We also assessed the diagnostic efficiency of the Sentinel-MPE test by performing receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC). For the ROC analysis we combined the malignant and paramalignant groups (n=76) and compared against the benign group (n=28). The detection sensitivity and specificity of the Sentinel-MPE test was high (AUC=0.912). The Sentinel-MPE appears to have better performance characteristics than cytology analysis. However, combining Sentinel-MPE with cytology analysis could be an even more effective approach for the diagnosis of MPE. Conclusions The Sentinel-MPE test can discriminate between BPE and MPE. The Sentinel-MPE liquid biopsy test can detect aberrant DNA in several different tumor types. The Sentinel-MPE test can be a complementary tool to cytology in the diagnosis of MPE.

TI  - "For the planet. For home": Generating planetary responsibility in the climate fiction of Los Angeles
T2  - LITERATURE COMPASS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This article argues that three prominent recent works of Los Angeles climate fiction-Maria Amparo Escandon's L.A. Weather (2021), Alexandra Kleeman's Something New Under the Sun (2021) and Paul Beatty's The Sellout (2016)-generate a sense of planetary responsibility. Despite their regional settings, these novels possess a planetary consciousness, illuminating the local-global connectivity of climate change and the Anthropocene. As one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitting cities in the world, L.A. drives climate injustice, with its gargantuan energy consumption having an adverse impact on populations both within and far beyond its own borders. This article explains how literature, and climate fiction particularly, can highlight this inequality at micro and macro scales, and encourage collective opposition to it. I argue that the novels of Escandon, Kleeman and Beatty conjure the impression of responsibility identified by Kristian Shaw and Sara Upstone in their overview of post-postmodern fiction, while also exhibiting the 'planetarity' discussed by Amy Elias and Christian Moraru: a term to describe the global worldview of contemporary culture. In applying these concepts to the novels examined here, I ultimately contend that Los Angeles climate fiction demystifies the spatial and political dimensions of the Anthropocene, generating planetary responsibility and addressing local and global injustice.

T2  - ARCHAEOMETRY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - There are Quaternary paleochannels in the left bank of the lower reaches of the Taedong River in the southeastern side of Pyongyang. We aimed to determine the possibility to find Paleolithic sites by locating terraces and paleochannels using digital elevation models (DEM) and Landsat ETM+. The study on paleochannels focused on survey of terrace of the 80-100 m high, associated with the Paleolithic site, performing topography (elevation, slope and aspect) analysis with DEM data and FCC (False Color Component), BR (Band Ratio), PCA (Principal Component Analysis), ISODATA, and SAM with Landsat ETM+ image. The results show that the analysis method using DEM and ETM+ is effective to find Paleolithic sites through surveys of terrace and paleochannel and analysis of facies.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeFollowing demand, we established a patient-controlled propofol-remifentanil sedation service for endoscopy overseen by an anesthesiologist. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention of this service and any complications, we prospectively audited the service. Our primary outcomes of interest were adequacy of sedation and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included any adverse events associated with the sedation.MethodsPatients were referred for failure of procedure under endoscopist-administered sedation, refusal of procedure without general anesthesia (GA), or planned complex procedure. We included all 670 procedures performed between 2017 and 2021. We used a mixture of 8.9 mg center dot mL-1 propofol and 5.4 mu g center dot mL-1 remifentanil with a 1-mL bolus and 20-sec lockout. We assessed the adequacy of sedation using the Modified Gloucester Scale and categorized adverse events according to the Tracking and Reporting Outcomes of Procedural Sedation.ResultsAll 670 procedures were accomplished with adequate sedation without the need for ventilation or GA, and all patients were satisfied with the sedation. The complication rate was low, with no sentinel airway or respiratory events. Nineteen out of 670 patients (2.8%) had an incidence of airway obstruction (requiring a simple airway maneuver). The body mass index (BMI) was documented in 18/19 of these patients and the average BMI in this group was 35 kg center dot m-2. Seven of the 670 patients (1%) had self-terminating apnea, 3/670 patients (0.4%) vomited, no patients aspirated, and 17/665 patients (2.6%) required a vasopressor to maintain blood pressure within 20% of preprocedure values.ConclusionThe results from our prospective service audit indicate that propofol-remifentanil patient-controlled sedation is a safe and reliable technique in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures.ObjectifPour repondre a la demande, nous avons mis en place un service de sedation au propofol-remifentanil controlee par le/la patient center dot e pour l'endoscopie supervise par l'anesthesiologiste.

TI  - Ni@zeolite-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> supported 4-methylpyridinium ionic liquid: design and application as a new multi-functional and magnetically catalytic nanosystem in three-component synthesis of 4-aryl oxazolones
T2  - RESEARCH ON CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this research, the ionic liquid 4-methylpyridinium chloride grafted on nanoporous Ni/zeolite-Y was fabricated in several steps. Firstly, the nanocomposite of nickel-zeolite-Y (Ni@ZY) was prepared from the exchange-metal reaction of nickel (II) chloride with zeolite-NaY. This nanomaterial was then reacted consecutively with trimethoxysilyl propyl chloride and 4-methylpyridine to obtain nanocomposite of Ni/[(MPy)Cl-+(-)]@ZY. Then, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were produced inside the functionalized zeolite pores with the use of ultrasonic waves to prepare a multi-functional and magnetically 4-methylpyridinium ionic liquid-nickel nanosystem (Ni/[(MPy)Cl-+(-)]@ZY-Fe3O4). Its structure was identified and confirmed by various analyses including: FT-IR, FE-SEM, TEM, EDX, XRD, TGA, VSM and N-2 adsorption-desorption (BET). To evaluate the catalytic performance, it has been successfully employed as a nanocatalyst, in facile Erlenmeyer synthesis of 4-arylidene-2-phenyl-5(4H) oxazolones (azlactones) through the multi-component reaction of benzoyl chloride, glycine, arylaldehydes and acetic anhydride under mild conditions. The presence of basic ionic liquid (4-methylpyridinium chloride), Lewis acid (Ni2+) on the solid surface of nanoporous (multifunctional) and the easy separation of the nanocatalyst from the reaction medium by an external magnet are the most distinguished advantages of this procedure. These points can be beneficial and effective in the catalytic processes. Some other advantages of the present process are high product yields, high-speed reaction rate, application of nanotechnology in the catalytic process, catalyst recyclability, low cost and non-toxicity.

TI  - Integration of SARS-CoV-2 testing and genomic sequencing into influenza sentinel surveillance in Uganda, January to December 2022
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The Uganda Virus Research Institute, National Influenza Center laboratory integrated SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing and genomic sequencing into the influenza surveillance program that was established in 2007. A total of 7,698 nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swab samples were collected and analyzed from ILI/SARI sentinel sites across the country from January to December 2022. All samples were tested for influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 252 (3.3%), 162 (2.1%), and 589 (7.7%) were positive for influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Out of 414 influenza-positive samples, 122 (29.5%) were AH1pdm09, 130 (31.4%) were AH3, and 162 (39.1%) were B-Victoria. All SARS-CoV-2 sequenced samples were of the Omicron variant, with subvariants of concern known to evade the immune system being detected, such as BQ.1 and XBB.2. Other SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected from other health centers in the community outside the surveillance sites were included into SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing with similar patterns with respect to variants. In all, the ILI/SARI surveillance system has shown to be an efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable program, providing a ready platform to monitor the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in communities at the national level while remaining vigilant for the persistent threat of influenza. The integration of SARS-CoV-2 detection and genomic surveillance into the influenza surveillance program will strengthen the laboratory response capacity, as well as facilitate the timely release of SARS-CoV-2 genomic information to be used to complement the multiple response strategies for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation.

TI  - Outcomes of Breast-Conserving Therapy in Patients With Inflammatory Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.
T2  - The Journal of surgical research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer. Currently, patients who respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) are treated with mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. This study aimed to synthesize real-world data to evaluate the feasibility of breast-conserving therapy (BCT), sentinel lymph node (SLN), and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for patients with IBC who respond to NAC.METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant articles. Clinical studies that compared mastectomy with BCT for IBC treatment were reviewed. The primary outcomes were local recurrence rate and 5-y survival rate in patients with IBC who responded to NAC. Furthermore, the SLN detection rate and false-negative rate (FNR) for SLNB were also evaluated.RESULTS: In the final analysis, 17 studies were included. The pooled estimates of the local recurrence rate for mastectomy and no surgical intervention were 18.6% and 15.9%, respectively (P=0.956). Five-y survival was similar for mastectomy, partial mastectomy, and no surgical intervention (45.8%, 57.1%, and 39.4%, respectively). The pooled estimates of the SLN detection rate and FNR for SLNB were 81.9% and 21.8%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with IBC who respond to NAC, the local recurrence and 5-y survival rates in those undergoing BCT are noninferior to the rates in those undergoing mastectomy; therefore, BCT could be a feasible option for surgical management. However, a poor SLN detection rate and a high FNR were found in patients undergoing SLNB. Further large-scale clinical studies are required to confirm our findings.

TI  - Ecosystem stability of temperate grasslands in response to variability of hydrological conditions
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The relationship between biodiversity and the stability of ecosystem functioning over time has been widely studied. The current global context has refloated this topic for biodiversity's role in buffering the effects of different disturbances. In general, the results of these studies show that ecosystem functioning is more stable over time in more diverse systems. However, these results are derived from empirical research on small-scale studies, where species and disturbances conditions are manipulated. In this work, we used climate and floristic information data obtained from surveys over an extended period on Flooding Pampa grasslands (Argentina) with a remotely sensed indicator of the stability of net primary productivity at a regional scale over a broad temporal range to evaluate the relationship between species diversity and the stability of ecosystem functioning under different water conditions. We found a close correlation between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index responses of natural grasslands and climate variability in the study area. Besides, grasslands with higher species richness and diversity showed greater stability in ecosystem functioning at different water conditions. The results obtained could be relevant in natural resource management for the close relationship between diversity-stability in a local and regional productive context characterized by a simplified landscape of space and time.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study aimed to determine the surface deformation resulting from the earthquake on February 6, 2023, on the Turkish-Syrian border using Sentinel-1 SAR images and DInSAR techniques. The analysis was limited to pixels with a coherence value above 0.6 to reduce misinterpretations from phase decorrelation. Furthermore, the study aimed to map horizontal and vertical displacements within GIS environment, contributing to a processing methodology that reduces time and effort in detecting surface displacement over large spatial coverage. The results of this study revealed clear surface displacement patterns in northwest Syria and southern Turkey following the earthquake. These patterns encompass both westward and eastward horizontal shifts, as well as upward and downward vertical movements. Notably, the findings indicated significant upward and westward motion near Iskenderun, alongside eastward motion and complex vertical displacements in the Gaziantep/A'zaz/Zayzafun areas. To assess the precision of these displacements, they were compared to data from GPS stations within the study area, demonstrating good accuracy with Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) of approximately +/- 3.2 cm for Line-of-Sight (LOS) displacements and +/- 3.7 cm for combined horizontal and vertical displacements. This research provides valuable insights into tectonic plate movements and carries implications for future seismic studies in the examined regions.

TI  - Quantifying the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and the armed conflict with Russia on Sentinel 5P TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub> changes in Ukraine
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study investigated variations in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in Ukraine during two significant periods: the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in 2020 and the armed conflict with Russia in 2022. Original and reprocessed Sentinel 5P data products were utilized for the analysis. A machine learning model was employed to generate a business-as-usual NO2 time series that accounted for meteorological variability. For the nine most populous cities in Ukraine, during the lockdown in 2020 we observed a moderation of increases in NO2 levels during the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown levels. Looking at the same months during the conflict period in 2022, we identified much more significant reductions in NO2 level in these cities, averaging 12.1% for original and 18.1% for reprocessed datasets. Besides our examination of major urban areas, we observed reductions in NO2 levels in areas surrounding coal power plants damaged or destroyed by the conflict. For the major urban areas in Ukraine, we conclude that changes in daily anthropogenic activities due to the conflict-related events had more substantial impacts on NO2 levels than did COVID-19 lockdown.

TI  - Use of clinical variables for preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objective: Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecological cancer, and most patients are identified during early disease stages. Noninvasive evaluation of lymph node metastasis likely will improve the quality of clinical treatment, for example, by omitting unnecessary lymphadenectomy.Methods: The study population comprised 611 patients with endometrial cancer who underwent lymphadenectomy at four types of institutions, comprising seven hospitals in total. We systematically assessed the association of 18 preoperative clinical variables with postoperative lymph node metastasis. We then constructed statistical models for preoperative lymph node metastasis prediction and assessed their performance with a previously proposed system, in which the score was determined by counting the number of high-risk variables among the four predefined ones.Results: Of the preoperative 18 variables evaluated, 10 were significantly associated with postoperative lymph node metastasis. A logistic regression model achieved an area under the curve of 0.85 in predicting lymph node metastasis; this value is significantly higher than that from the previous system (area under the curve, 0.74). When we set the false-negative rate to similar to 1%, the new predictive model increased the rate of true negatives to 21%, compared with 6.8% from the previous one. We also provide a spreadsheet-based tool for further evaluation of its ability to predict lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer.Conclusions Our new lymph node metastasis prediction method, which was based solely on preoperative clinical variables, performed significantly better than the previous method. Although additional evaluation is necessary for its clinical use, our noninvasive system may help improve the clinical treatment of endometrial cancer, complementing minimally invasive sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Adaptive multi-source data fusion vessel trajectory prediction model for intelligent maritime traffic
T2  - KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-source vessel automatic identification system (AIS) data gathered in the maritime Internet of Things (IoT) system has diverse data characteristics, such as sparse satellite data and terrestrial receiver's limited coverage. However, it is challenging for the maritime IoT system to provide efficient and accurate intelligent trajectory prediction services while applying multi-source AIS data. Therefore, improving the adaptability and accuracy of vessel trajectory prediction methodologies adapted to varied AIS datasets is essential to enhancing marine traffic safety and transportation efficiency. This study proposes an adaptive data fusion (ADF) model based on multi-source AIS data for predicting vessel trajectories in maritime traffic. The same marine mobile service identifier (MMSI) and timestamp fuse the multi-source AIS data. Deep learning methods are employed to perform feature learning and increase adaptability. This study also utilizes adjacency distance to enhance the correlation between dataset trajectory trajectories. Finally, we validate the benefits of the ADF model using actual terrestrial and satellite AIS data along the west coast of the United States (US). Regarding average RMSE and MAE, the ADF model reduces the prediction error by 46.51% and 52.7% when fusing multi-source historical trajectories compared to current studies. Moreover, multiple ablation experiments have proved our model's superiority.

TI  - Synergy and regulation of the South China Karst WH site integrity protection and the buffer zone agroforestry development
T2  - HERITAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Natural World Heritage site (NWH) has a dual role of protection and utilization. The buffer zone of the South China Karst (SCK) World Heritage (WH) site is scattered with village dwellings, which adds pressure to preserve the outstanding universal value (OUV) and integrity protection of the WH site. The development of agroforestry is an essential means to maintain rural livelihoods, protect the ecological environment, and realize the protection and development of the heritage site. Studying the synergy and regulation of the heritage site integrity protection and the buffer zone agroforestry development is essential. This study takes the Shibing and Libo-Huanjiang karst WH as the study areas and administrative villages as the evaluation unit. From 2020 to 2023, through data methods such as remote sensing data interpretation, information data survey and collection, comprehensive index analysis, coupling coordination degree model, and GIS spatial analysis, a systematic study was conducted on the basic frontier research, synergy relationship, and regulation of the heritage site integrity protection and the buffer zone agroforestry development. The results demonstrate that the Shibing and Libo-Huanjiang karst WH sites integrity protection and agroforestry development in the buffer zone have a high coupling degree and a good coupling coordination relationship. This reveals that the heritage site integrity protection and the buffer zone agroforestry development are an interconnected and mutually influential whole, which the synergistic relationship between them is developing in a positive direction; The buffer zone agroforestry development lags behind the heritage site integrity protection, based on which proposed the regulatory measures for the synergy development of the heritage site integrity protection and agroforestry development in the buffer zone. The findings in this study provide references for the synergies development of the WH karst site integrity protection and agroforestry development in the buffer zone.

TI  - The Construction and Migration of a Multi-source Integrated Drought Index Based on Different Machine Learning
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Traditional methods of drought monitoring have high precision on the meteorological station scale, which needs to arrange numerous stations. Although the single-factor drought remote sensing index contains one or two parameters based on a single indicator can realize real-time and dynamic monitoring, which cannot accurately reflect drought information. Combining meteorological station data with remote sensing data and using machine learning to establish drought monitoring models has high data accuracy and spatiotemporal advantages. In this study, standardized indices of precipitation (P), land surface temperature (LST), evapotranspiration (ET), potential evapotranspiration (PET), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil moisture (SM), sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and digital elevation model (DEM) are applied as independent variables, the one-month standardized precipitation index (SPI_1) as the dependent variable, a Multi-source Integrated Drought Index (MIDI) was constructed by Random Forest (RF), Back Propagation Neural Network (BP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). MIDI was employed to monitor drought conditions in the North China Plain. Moreover, MIDI was utilized for monitoring the typical drought event in southwest China to verify its migration ability. The results showed that the correlation coefficients between each standardized indices and SPI_1 were all higher than the standardized evapotranspiration index (SPEI_1) except for surface temperature and potential evapotranspiration. Therefore, SPI_1 was selected as the dependent variable to construct MIDI. MIDI established by RF had higher accuracy in monitoring drought (R-2 = 0.789, RMSE = 0.454, and MAE = 0.348) than BP and SVM. The correlation coefficient between MIDI and SPEI_1 was greater than 0.8 (P < 0.01) under various vegetation types, indicating that MIDI was suitable for drought monitoring in the North China Plain. The migration experiment shows that MIDI can also accurately monitor the beginning, course, and end of drought events during 2009-2010 in Southwest China. This study indicated that MIDI has good migration ability and high accuracy for drought monitoring.

TI  - <i>Aedes aegypti</i> abundance in urban neighborhoods of Maricopa County, Arizona, is linked to increasing socioeconomic status and tree cover
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Understanding coupled human-environment factors which promote Aedes aegypti abundance is critical to preventing the spread of Zika, chikungunya, yellow fever and dengue viruses. High temperatures and aridity theoretically make arid lands inhospitable for Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, yet their populations are well established in many desert cities.Methods We investigated associations between socioeconomic and built environment factors and Ae. aegypti abundance in Maricopa County, Arizona, home to Phoenix metropolitan area. Maricopa County Environmental Services conducts weekly mosquito surveillance with CO2-baited Encephalitis Vector Survey or BG-Sentinel traps at > 850 locations throughout the county. Counts of adult female Ae. aegypti from 2014 to 2017 were joined with US Census data, precipitation and temperature data, and 2015 land cover from high-resolution (1 m) aerial images from the National Agricultural Imagery Program.Results From 139,729 trap-nights, 107,116 Ae. aegypti females were captured. Counts were significantly positively associated with higher socioeconomic status. This association was partially explained by higher densities of non-native landscaping in wealthier neighborhoods; a 1% increase in the density of tree cover around the trap was associated with a similar to 7% higher count of Ae. aegypti (95% CI: 6-9%).Conclusions Many models predict that climate change will drive aridification in some heavily populated regions, including those where Ae. aegypti are widespread. City climate change adaptation plans often include green spaces and vegetation cover to increase resilience to extreme heat, but these may unintentionally create hospitable microclimates for Ae. aegypti. This possible outcome should be addressed to reduce the potential for outbreaks of Aedes-borne diseases in desert cities.

TI  - PEASANTS, BRIGANDS, AND THE CHRONOPOLITICS OF THE NEW LEVIATHAN IN THE MEZZOGIORNO
T2  - HISTORY AND THEORY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The image of a backward, archaic South whose barbarian population had remained at a low tier of civilization was a child of Italian unification. Not unlike the Orientalist East, the South that meridionalist discourse brought forth was a "chronotopos"-that is, a time-space that had supposedly remained in the past. The war against brigandage in the Mezzogiorno demonstrates the workings of the "politics of historicism." This article first sheds some light on the grande brigantaggio and on the descriptions of the South that it generated among both contemporaries and later historians, such as Eric Hobsbawm. With the help of Pierre Clastres's and James C. Scott's political anthropology, it then attempts to uncover the structure beneath the "denial of coevalness." It argues that the dichotomy between the "backward" and the "modern" was based on the political distinction between friend and enemy, which, in the age of historicism, was temporalized; that is, the temporal dichotomy of the savage and the civilized can be understood as the historicist variant of those "asymmetric counterconcepts" that have always served the state and its representatives to demarcate the corpus politicum from other political entities, to justify the state, and to praise the advantages of being governed. In conclusion, the article addresses the close interweaving of state and history, progress and civilization, in the historicist worldview and argues that it was this nexus of state and history that drove the mechanics of time-power.

M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Geostatistical models have been widely used in the exposure assessment of ambient air pollutants. However, few studies have focused on comparisons of modeling approaches and their prediction results. Here, we collected the NO2 and PM2.5 monitoring data from 55 sites in Shanghai from 2016 to 2019 and the geographic variables, such as road network, points of interest of emission locations, and satellite data were included. We used partial least squares regression (PLS), supervised linear regression (SLR), and random forest (RF) algorithms to develop spatial models and used ordinary kriging (OK) to develop a two-step model. We evaluated the models using a 5-fold cross validation method and selected the best model structure for each modeling approach between one-or two-step models that had been developed with or without OK. The results revealed that the best NO2 models were the RF-OK (Rmse2 was 0.70-0.82) and PLS-OK (Rmse2 was 0.78-0.84) models; the PLS model for PM2.5(Rmse2 was 0.62-0.71) outperformed the other PM2.5 models. We used the best models to predict annual exposures in Shanghai at a 1 km spatial scale and conducted the correlation analysis among the predictions of the best models. The results demonstrated that the NO2 predictions had higher correlation coefficients (r was 0.82-0.91) compared with those of the PM2.5 models (r was 0.66-0.96). Based on the exposure results predicted using the three models in 2019, we evaluated the cumulative population exposure concentrations for NO2 and PM2.5 in Shanghai.

TI  - Direct assimilation of AVHRR satellite radiance measurements in a reanalysis system
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is a broad-band, five-channel scanner sensing in the visible, near-infrared and thermal infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. AVHRR instruments onboard polar-orbiting satellites have data records spanning 30 years. The radiances from the infrared channels of AVHRR have been directly assimilated over the ice-free ocean in the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) since 2017 to constrain skin sea surface temperature (SST). The GEOS system already uses an advanced bulk SST and a skin SST model which incorporates diurnal warming and cool-skin temperature on the surface of the ocean. The positive contribution of this effort to the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) makes it desirable to extend the skin SST data assimilation procedure to reanalysis applications. The AVHRR data from platforms that were previously unexplored for NWP applications are assimilated at the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) at NASA, for an upcoming reanalysis project. This study uses results from reanalysis experiments to assess the impact of assimilating AVHRR radiances over open ocean on the atmospheric state variables, focusing on the analyzed skin temperatures that include the active skin SST model. It is demonstrated that including the skin temperature variations in atmospheric analysis is generally beneficial. The addition of radiance measurements from AVHRR provides further improvements to the overall reanalysis system performance. by helping to correct the diurnal heating and reducing errors in the background departure of hyperspectral radiance observations, which are an essential component of atmospheric reanalyses.

T2  - International journal of legal medicine
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - This year (2023) marks 140years since the first publication of a facial soft tissue thickness (FSTT) study. Since 1883, a total of 139 studies have been published, collectively tallying>220,000 tissue thickness measurements of>19,500 adults. In just the last 5-years, 33 FSTT studies have been conducted. Herein, we add these data (plus an additional 20 studies) to the 2018T-Table to provide an update of>81,000 new datapoints to the global tallied facial soft tissue depths table. In contrast to the original 2008T-Table, some notable changes are as follows: increased FSTTs by 3mm at infra second molar (ecm2-iM2'), 2.5mm at gonion (go-go'), 2mm at mid-ramus (mr-mr'), and 1.5mm at zygion (zy-zy'). Rolling grand means indicate that stable values have been attained for all nine median FSTT landmarks, while six out of nine bilateral landmarks continue to show ongoing fluctuations, indicating further data collection at these landmarks holds value. When used as point estimators for individuals with known values across 24 landmarks (i.e., C-Table data), the updated grand means produce slightly less estimation error than the 2018T-Table means (3.5mm versus 3.6mm, respectively). Future efforts to produce less noisy datasets (i.e., reduce measurement and sampling errors as much as possible between studies) would be useful.

TI  - Estimation of Wheat Crop Production using Multispectral Information Fusion.
T2  - Journal of the science of food and agriculture
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present work estimates the area and the corresponding produce of wheat crop in the study area, which comprises Etah region of Uttar Pradesh, India. For this purpose, multispectral images of multiple sensors, viz., Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and Landsat-9 during the preharvesting period, i.e., March for the years 2021 and 2022 are used. A multispectral information fusion approach has been proposed which involves image classification as well as vegetation index-based information extraction. For imposing the information fusion, appropriate image bands are identified with the help of separability analysis followed by land cover classification for wheat crop class extraction. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) are used for classification whereas Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) are used for index-based crop area extraction.RESULTS: The maximum accuracy of 98.34% is achieved for Sentinel-2 data using ANN whereas minimum accuracy of 80.21% is achieved for Landsat-9 using ML classifier. The estimated area for Sentinel-2 data for the year 2021 is 260540 hectares using ANN and 203240 hectares using ML which is near to the reference data, i.e., 238600 hectares. SVM also shows good performance and calculates least error in estimated crop area for the year 2022 on Sentinel-2 data. It calculates 8408490 tons of wheat for the same year.CONCLUSION: The proposed method utilizes a single image per year for extraction of information supported by the ground truth data which makes it a novel approach of information extraction for crop produce monitoring.

TI  - GDF: A Novel Image Fusion Approach for Compelling Depiction of Earthly Features
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most challenging aspects of satellite remote sensing is image fusion. Image fusion increases the visual interpretation of the image and has many applications such as monitoring water bodies, land cover, urbanisation, agriculture, national defence, and so forth. Remote sensing applications require images with a high spatial and spectral resolution for accurately processing and distinguishing the land cover classes with fine texture and shape details. Due to technical limitations, most satellites cannot take high-resolution multi-spectral images but can get high-resolution panchromatic images and low-resolution multi-spectral satellite images separately. This article proposes a novel fusion method, geospatial data fusion (GDF), to obtain high-resolution multi-spectral images. GDF, along with three well-known fusion methods viz., Brovey Transform (BT), wavelet transform (WT), and Fourier transform (FT), have been comparatively implemented to fuse the Cartosat-2 and Sentinel-2 imageries of the Sangam area of Prayagraj, India. The fusion has been done to extract the earth's surface features from the fused imagery. In this research, the fused image is utilised for river water mapping. Results confirm that the GDF outperforms other existing fusion methods and successfully maps the river water in the study area.

TI  - Ultrasound-based radiomics combined with immune status to predict sentinel lymph node metastasis in primary breast cancer.
T2  - Scientific reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In the past few years, the axillary lymph node dissection technique has been steadily replaced by sentinel lymph node biopsy for treating and diagnosing breast cancer, thereby minimizing the complications and sequelae of the patients. Nevertheless, sentinel lymph node biopsy still presents limitations, such as high operation requirements, prolonged surgical duration, and adverse reactions to tracer agents. This study developed a novel non-invasive method to predict sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer by analyzing the ultrasound imaging characteristics of the primary tumor, combined with the analysis of peripheral blood T-cell subsets that reflect the immune status of the body. The radiomic features analyzed in this study were extracted from preoperative ultrasound images of 199 solitary breast cancer patients, who were undergoing surgery and were pathologically diagnosed at the Yancheng First People's Hospital. All cases were randomly categorized in a 4:1 ratio to the training (n=159) and validation (n=40) cohorts. The extracted radiomics features were subjected to dimensional reduction with the help of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator technique, resulting in the inclusion of 19 radiomics features. Four classifiers, including naive Bayesian, logistic regression, classification decision tree, and support vector machine, were utilized to model the radiomics features, conventional ultrasound features, and peripheral blood T cell subsets in the training dataset, and validated using the validation dataset. The best-performing model was chosen for constructing the combined model. The radiomics model constructed using the logistic regression showed the best performance, with the training and validation cohorts showing areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.77 and 0.68, respectively. The conventional ultrasound and peripheral blood T cell models constructed using the classification decision tree showed the best performance, wherein the training cohort presented AUCs of 0.71 and 0.81, respectively, while the validation cohort presented AUCs of 0.68 and 0.69, respectively. The combined model constructed by logistic regression showed AUCs of 0.91 and 0.79 in the training and validation datasets, respectively. The resulting combined model can be considered a simple, non-invasive method with strong reproducibility and clinical significance. Thus, it can be utilized to predict sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. Furthermore, the combined model can be effectively used to guide clinical decisions related to the selection of surgical procedures in breast surgery.

TI  - Radioactive nanosized colloids and indocyanine green identify the same sentinel lymph nodes in oral squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeNear-infrared fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) combined with radioactive markers has the potential to improve sentinel lymph-node (SLN) mapping in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study aimed to evaluate the ability of 99mTc and ICG in identifying the sentinel lymph nodes in patients with early stage OSCC.MethodsData were collected prospectively, and a retrospective analysis of 15 patients with early stage OSCC and a cN0 neck was performed. All patients received peritumoral injection of 99mTc the day before surgery and ICG was administered intraoperatively. Intentionally, the application of the two different tracers were done by two different physicians with varying degrees of experience. The number of identified lymph nodes positive for 99mTc and ICG, the overlap or possible discrepancies of both methods, and the time until fluorescence signals of ICG were detected were noted.ResultsIn all patients, a 100% agreement in sentinel lymph-node identification was achieved, regardless of both the exact location of the peritumoral injection and the experience of the injecting surgeon. Time until ICG accumulation in the sentinel lymph node was consistently found to be between 1 and 3 min.ConclusionICG constitutes a viable and useful addition to 99mTc for intraoperative sentinel lymph-node detection in this study.

TI  - Biennial analysis of probable permafrost distribution for Kullu district, North-west Himalaya using Landsat 8 satellite data
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Climate change and increased anthropogenic activity affect permafrost distribution, threatening ecosystem stability, water resources, and greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we present updated probable permafrost maps at 30 m resolution for Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh derived from the predicted mean annual air temperature (MAAT) (2013 to 2020) based on Landsat 8 land surface temperature (LST). We also analysed the mean annual snow cover extent of the study area for this time period. Our probable permafrost distribution map shows the areas falling under permafrost regions in snow-covered areas; permafrost regions in non-snow-covered areas; non permafrost regions along with glacierised regions. The temporal variation of permafrost over 7 years from 2013 to 2020 shows that permafrost distribution follows a cyclic variation ranging between 4.42% and 7.51% of the total area of the district. The permafrost maps were validated with the presence of rock glaciers as seen on high resolution satellite images and the ground photographs. The maps display the expected spatial pattern of near-surface air temperatures that match with the known permafrost boundary. The findings of this study provide more precise information on permafrost distribution and essential data for future permafrost research in Kullu district.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - The remote sensing and GIS tools provide reliable information for assessing the available water. In this study, the basin is divided into 12 elevation zones and temperature and precipitation are extrapolated within these zones. The MODIS (Terra and Aqua) cloud-free images have been used for mapping snow cover area (SCA) and it was found that the SCA will vary from 12 to 72% during the simulation period. The model simulation period is divided into calibration (2003-2015) and validation (2016-2019). The three hydrological and statistical indices have been used to judge the model efficiency. It was found that the efficiency parameters are much beyond the acceptable range for both periods. In this study, the snowmelt's contribution increases till zone 8; after this, the snowmelt contribution decreases, and the snow accumulation increases. The simulation of daily streamflow and generated hydroelectric power (HEP) are compared with the measured values, and both tracked the observed pattern very precisely. The findings of the present study will be implemented on the other ungauged basins and could help us to identify the potential sites for HEP with the help of RS and GIS tools.

TI  - Desertification vulnerability assessment through geospatial techniques in Bahawalpur division of Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the desertification vulnerability and the future trends of desertification expansion in the Bahawalpur division of Punjab, Pakistan. This aim is achieved by analyzing Landsat data between the years 1990 and 2019. The biophysical index and socio-economic index were used to identify the Desertification Vulnerability Index (DVI) and its changes which have taken place over the study period between the years 1990 and 2019. The findings indicated that there was a decrease in the rate of desertification vulnerability from 1990 to 2019. In addition, the central and southern part of the Bahawalpur division is classified as a highly vulnerable zone in comparison to the other part of the region. The overall results show that the barren land and the desert area have been showing a decreasing trend, accompanied by substantial growth in vegetation from 1990 to 2019. The findings of the DVI analysis indicate that the Highly Vulnerable Area has decreased spatially from 61.12 in 1990 to 55.3% in 2019, while the Moderately Vulnerable Area and the Least Vulnerable Area have grown from 25.59% and 17.2% in 1990 to 28.56 and 19.53% in 2019, respectively. The decreasing trend demonstrates the effectiveness of efforts to combat desertification and the government could develop the best strategies for rehabilitation works and control the land degradation process in the most vulnerable areas in the Bahawalpur division of Punjab, Pakistan.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Santos da Silva, V, Nakamura, FY, Gantois, P, Nogueira Gouveia, JN, Pena, J, Beato, M, and Abade, E. Effects of upper-body and lower-body conditioning activities on postactivation performance enhancement during sprinting and jumping tasks in female soccer players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2023-This study aimed to investigate the postactivation performance enhancement (PAPE) effects of "specific" (half-back squat) and "nonspecific" (bench press) conditioning activities on sprinting and jumping performances in female soccer players. Fourteen players (mean ± SD: age = 22.3 ± 4.0 years; body mass = 60.2 ± 7.8 kg; height = 164.1 ± 4.2 cm) competing at national level (first League) participated in this within-subject crossover study. The players performed a warm-up protocol including 3 sets of 3 repetitions of half-back-squat or bench press exercises at 90% 1RM or a warm-up protocol without lifting weights (i.e., control condition). Forty-meter shuttle sprints (20 + 20 m with change of direction [COD-180°]), countermovement jump (CMJ), and horizontal jump (HJ) performances were recorded 6 minutes after the conditioning activities protocols or the control condition. Nonsignificant large positive effects were found for the HJ after the half-back-squat (ES = 1.68; p > 0.05) and bench press (ES = 1.68; p > 0.05) protocols. Although nonsignificant, HJ changes (Delta = 0.07 m) were greater than the smallest worthwhile change (0.02 m) and standard error of measurement (0.03 m) after both conditioning activities. Moreover, no significant changes were found for sprint and CMJ performance after neither half-back-squat nor bench press protocols (p > 0.05). In conclusion, both specific and nonspecific conditioning activities using heavy loads (i.e., 90% 1RM) may be suitable to enhance individual HJ. Finally, both conditioning activities are potentially ineffective for increasing sprint and CMJ performance in the context of this study.

TI  - Field releases of the exotic parasitoid Trissolcus japonicus (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) and survey of native parasitoids attacking Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in Michigan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY

M3  - Early Access
AB  - An adventive population of the exotic parasitoid wasp, Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae), discovered in Michigan in 2018, is a promising biological control agent of the invasive Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Following its discovery, field releases of Tr. japonicus were conducted over 2 yr in southern Michigan, to test how release size or release frequency impacts establishment. Sentinel eggs of H. halys and of the native Podisus maculiventris (Say) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) were used alongside yellow sticky cards to monitor parasitoids. In 2019 and 2020, 7,200 Tr. japonicus were released at 16 sites. Monitoring between 2019 and 2021 yielded only 49 individuals. The captures suggest reproductive activity and overwintering success in the field but do not allow for evaluation of best release methods. Parasitism by native parasitoids was below 7%, which is similar to other states and unlikely to provide sufficient control of H. halys. The placement of sentinel eggs or sticky traps either in the lower or middle canopy of trees did not influence parasitoid capture rates. Frozen and fresh H. halys sentinel eggs were attacked at the same rate, but more native parasitoids emerged from frozen eggs. We did not find signs of nontarget effects on P. maculiventris thus parasitism rates overall were very low. These results could indicate dispersal of Tr. japonicus from the release sites or slow population growth. The latter may be due to the relatively low densities of H. halys in Michigan or may stem from the small founding size of our laboratory colony.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN COUNCIL OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Societies are always gathered around a particular object or an idea that serves as its totem and its driving principle. This conscious arrangement of society, especially around an ideal, has been termed in history as utopias, which consciously moulds an individual's behaviour inhabiting it for the desired future goal. However, in the hyper-humanistic period, called by James Scott as High-modernism, we can see a drastic truncation in the scope and range of those desired future forms, limited only to economic and material wellbeing. The aim of this paper therefore is to look into an example of the utopian experiment that substantially differs from a high-modernist worldview. The paper will analyse one such futuristic spiritual experiment at Auroville and try to trace its similarities as well as its difference from the hyper-humanistic ideals of modernity.

TI  - Mapping grasslands&apos; preservation potential: A case study from the northern Carpathians
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The grasslands which are an important part of an ecosystem are endangered due to abandonment of traditional forms of land use. Preservation of biodiversity of semi-natural grassland communities is of great importance, therefore it is important to identify threats and prepare a sustainable plan for their protection The goal of this study was to develop an approach to predict threatened grasslands hotspots, basing on multi-factor machine learning analyses. The Gorce Mountains in the Polish Carpathians were chosen as a study area, as it is region partially protected by National Park, surrounded by villages with different socio-economic conditions (agriculture or touristic oriented). The grasslands were identified and classified on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. As lack of regular mowing of grasslands was found as main factor promoting forest succession. Therefore, in order to find endangered grasslands areas, support vector machines' algorithm was used to classify them in mowed and unmowed categories. Then the preservation potential of grasslands was modeled with the random forest method, based on the grasslands' mowing classification, digital terrain model, land-use and population statistical data, and the historical forest extent. We found the grasslands above 750 m above sea level to be the most endangered. Also, the tourism activity and ongoing changes in employment structure from agriculture to services has had a negative influence on the grasslands preservation potential. On the other hand, the Gorce National Park's active grassland conservation by mowing and grazing was shown as a positive element in keeping with the high biodiversity of the area.

TI  - A new approach to quantify chlorophyll-a over inland water targets based on multi-source remote sensing data.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is a reliable indicator of phytoplankton biomass and eutrophication, especially in inland waters. Remote sensing provides a means for large-scale Chl-a estimation by linking the spectral water-leaving signal from the water surface with in situ measured Chl-a concentrations. Single-sensor images cannot meet the practical needs for long-term monitoring of Chl-a concentrations due to cloud cover and satellite operational lifetimes. However, quantifying long-term inland water Chl-a concentrations using multi-source remote sensing data remains a problem, as improper input of satellite reflectance products will affect the accuracy of Chl-a over inland waters, as well as existing models cannot meet the need for multi-source remote sensing data to retrieve high precision Chl-a. To explore these problems towards a solution, four reflectance data derived from Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI), MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) were evaluated against in situ measurements of Erhai Lake. Reflectance data from these sensors were assessed to determine their consistency. Results indicate that R_rhos products (i.e., surface reflectance, a semi-atmospheric correction reflectance) that controlled for the atmospheric diffuse transmittance were highly correlated with the measured reflectance values. The in situ reflectance also confirmed the higher fidelity of satellite reflectance in the green-red band. Subsequently, a new extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model applied to multi-source remote sensing data is proposed to estimate long-term inland water Chl-a concentrations. Comparative experiments showed the XGB model with R_rhos products outperformed other solutions, providing accurate estimates for daily, monthly, and long-term trends in Erhai Lake. The XGB model was finally processed 3954 R_rhos reflectance data derived from OLCI, ENVISAT Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), MSI, and OLI sensors, mapping Chl-a concentrations in Erhai Lake over a 20-year period. This study could serve as a reference for the long-term Chl-a monitoring using multi-source remote sensing data to support inland lake management and future water quality evaluation.

TI  - Effect of forest understorey stand density on woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) habitat selection
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) use older forests that provide abundant terrestrial lichen forage and refuge from predators. However, forest structural characteristics vary widely, differing in forage availability but also, perhaps, in the ability of caribou to move freely to access forage or to escape predation. We conducted a multivariate analysis of habitat in two geographically and biophysically distinct regions to identify the independent effects of various attributes, including forest understorey stand density, defined as standing and downed biomass, on caribou habitat selection. We developed Bayesian network models to predict the probability of habitat selection based on a set of remotely sensed habitat inputs. Caribou in the Bistcho range (northwestern Alberta) selected non-forest/sparsely forested areas, while caribou in the Trout Lake region (northwestern Ontario) selected primarily forested habitats, nevertheless consistent with selection for reduced predation risk in both cases. Caribou also selected forest stands with lower understorey stand density in both regions, consistent with selection for stands that would allow greater ease of movement. The high-resolution satellite data resolved habitat characteristics more consistently and in greater detail than standard forest cover datasets that are most often used for these analyses, and led us to conclude that habitat management may require different treatments in different parts of the species' range to address what are nevertheless common pathways to decline.

TI  - Concordant care in sentinel lymph node omission following Choosing Wisely recommendations at a comprehensive cancer center.
T2  - American journal of surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2016, the SSO and ABIM released a Choosing Wisely guideline stating SLNB can be safely omitted in women ≥70 with HR​+​HER-invasive breast cancer. No study evaluating concordance of care with this guideline has been performed within a comprehensive cancer center.METHODS: From 2005 to 2020, there were 382 patients with cT1-2N0 invasive carcinoma ER+/PR+ and HER2-identified as having undergone SLNB. These patients were then separated into two groups; those in the pre-guideline concordance cohort (2005-2015) and those in the post-guideline concordance (2016-2020) cohort. Axillary management concordance was trended over time.RESULTS: 382 patients from 2005 to 2020 with HR​+​HER- IBC were identified. No difference was seen in SLNB pre-versus post-guidelines (p​=​0.35). Increased concordance was noted as age increased (p​=​0.0068) and adjuvant radiation therapy exclusion (p​<​0.0001) post-guideline release. Concordance improved over the years post-guideline release (R2​=​0.45).CONCLUSIONS: Surgical guideline adoption occurs over time but may also be affected by outside decisions and factors. Further study into patterns of guideline adoption may facilitate improving adherence to guidelines.

TI  - Wastewater Surveillance in Europe for Non-Polio Enteroviruses and Beyond.
T2  - Microorganisms
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Wastewater surveillance (WWS) was developed in the early 1960s for the detection of poliovirus (PV) circulation in the population. It has been used to monitor several pathogens, including non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs), which are increasingly recognised as causes of morbidity in children. However, when applying WWS to a new pathogen, it is important to consider the purpose of such a study as well as the suitability of the chosen methodology. With this purpose, the European Non-Polio Enterovirus Network (ENPEN) organised an expert webinar to discuss its history, methods, and applications; its evolution from a culture-based method to molecular detection; and future implementation of next generation sequencing (NGS). The first simulation experiments with PV calculated that a 400 mL sewage sample is sufficient for the detection of viral particles if 1:10,000 people excrete poliovirus in a population of 700,000 people. If the method is applied correctly, several NPEV types are detected. Despite culture-based methods remaining the gold standard for WWS, direct methods followed by molecular-based and sequence-based assays have been developed, not only for enterovirus but for several pathogens. Along with case-based sentinel and/or syndromic surveillance, WWS for NPEV and other pathogens represents an inexpensive, flexible, anonymised, reliable, population-based tool for monitoring outbreaks and the (re)emergence of these virus types/strains within the general population.

AB  - Background: The management of axillary lymph nodes in early-stage breast cancer patients has changed considerably, with the primary focus shifting from the examination of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) to toward the detection of all macro-metastases. However, current methods, such as touch imprint cytology (TIC) and frozen sections, are inadequate for clinical needs. To address this issue, we proposed a novel miniaturised epifluorescence widefield microscope (MEW-M) to assess SLN status intraoperatively for improved diagnostic efficiency.Methods: A prospective, side-by-side comparison of intraoperative SLN evaluation between MEW-M and TIC was performed.Results: A total of 73 patients with 319 SLNs consecutive enrolled in this study. MEW-M showed significantly superior image quality compared to TIC (median score 3.1 vs 2.1, p < 0.0001) and had a shorter time to issue results (10.3 vs 19.4 min, p < 0.0001). Likelihood ratio analysis illustrated that the positive likelihood ratio value of MEW-M compared with TIC was infinitely great vs 52.37 (95% CI, 21.96-124.90) in model 1 (classifying results into negative/positive), infinitely great vs 52.37 (95% CI, 21.96-124.90) in model 2 (classifying results into macro-metastasis/others, and TIC results followed the same classification as model 1), respectively. Similarly, the negative likelihood ratio values of MEW-M compared with TIC were 0.055 (95% CI, 0.018-0.160) and 0.074 (95% CI, 0.029-0.190) in model 1; and 0.019 (95% CI, 0.003-0.130) vs 0.020 (95% CI, 0.003-0.140) in model 2, respectively.Conclusions: MEW-M is a promising technique that can be utilised to provide a rapid and accurate intraoperative assessment of SLN in a clinical setting to help improve decision-making in axillary surgery.

TI  - Spitz tumor with RAF1 fusion: A report of 3 cases.
T2  - Annals of diagnostic pathology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Spitz tumors are melanocytic neoplasms morphologically characterized by spindled and/or epithelioid cells and specific stromal and epidermal changes associated with mutually exclusive fusion kinases involving ALK, ROS1, NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, MET and RET, BRAF and MAP3K8 genes or, less commonly, HRAS mutation. RAF1 fusions have been recently detected in cutaneous melanocytic neoplasms, including conventional melanoma, congenital nevus and BAP-1 inactivated tumors. We report herewith three Spitz neoplasms with a RAF1 fusion, including a previously reported CTDSPL::RAF1 fusion and two novel PPAP2B::RAF1 and ATP2B4::RAF1 fusions. Two cases were classified as Spitz nevus, while the remaining neoplasm was classified as Spitz melanoma at the time of the diagnosis, given 9p21 homozygous deletion and positive sentinel lymph node biopsy. We suggest that RAF1 fused melanocytic neoplasms can represent a novel subgroup of Spitz tumors, with a RAF1 fusion representing an oncogenic driver.

TI  - Determination of independent risk factors for early healthcare-associated infections acquired after acute stroke admission: A multi-centre registry-based cohort study.
T2  - Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) in patients admitted with acute conditions pose a serious risk to patients and a major challenge to healthcare services. However, there is a lack of consistency in reporting aetiological risk factors, particularly in acute stroke patients. Here, we determined independent risk factors of two common HCAIs (urinary tract infection and pneumonia) acquired within 7-days of admission after an acute stroke.METHODS: Data were prospectively collected (2014-2016) from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme for 3,309 patients (mean age=76.2yr, SD=13.5) admitted to four UK hyperacute stroke units. Associations between variables were assessed by forward stepwise multivariable logistic regression (odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals).RESULTS: The rate of urinary tract infection and/or pneumonia occurring within 7-days of admission was 15.0%. The risk of urinary tract infection and/or pneumonia was increased amongst women: OR=1.35 (1.08-1.68); patients from ethnic minority backgrounds: OR=1.77 (1.01-3.10); patients aged 70-79 years: OR=2.08 (1.42-3.06), and ≥80 years: OR=3.20 (2.26-4.55); history of hypertension: OR=1.59 (1.27-1.98); history of atrial fibrillation: OR=1.67 (1.32-2.12); pre-stroke disability: OR=2.08 (1.44-3.00); intracranial haemorrhage: OR=1.41 (1.07-1.86); severe stroke: OR=3.21 (2.32-4.45); swallow screening within 4-72h: OR=1.42 (1.08-1.86); swallow screening beyond 72h: OR=1.70 (1.08-2.70). History of congestive heart failure, diabetes and previous stroke did not significantly associate with HCAIs.CONCLUSIONS: A profile of independent risk factors for two common HCAIs in acute stroke was identified. These findings provide valuable information for timely intervention to reduce HCAIs, and the ability to minimise subsequent adverse outcomes.

TI  - Global observational coverage of onshore oil and gas methane sources with TROPOMI.
T2  - Scientific reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Satellite observations have been used to measure methane (CH4) emissions from the oil and gas (O&G) industry, particularly by revealing previously undocumented, very large emission events and basin-level emission estimates. However, most satellite systems use passive remote sensing to retrieve CH4 mixing ratios, which is sensitive to sunlight, earth surface properties, and atmospheric conditions. Accordingly, the reliability of satellites for routine CH4 emissions monitoring varies across the globe. To better understand the potentials and limitations of routine monitoring of CH4 emissions with satellites, we investigated the global observational coverage of the TROPOMI instrument onboard the Sentinel-5P satellite-the only satellite system currently with daily global coverage. A 0.1°* 0.1° gridded global map that indicates the average number of days with valid observations from TROPOMI for 2019-2021 was generated by following the measurement retrieval quality-assurance threshold (≥0.5). We found TROPOMI had promising observational coverage over dryland regions (maximum: 58.6%) but limited coverage over tropical regions and high latitudes (minimum: 0%). Cloud cover and solar zenith angle were the primary factors affecting observational coverage at high latitudes, while aerosol optical thickness was the primary factor over dryland regions. To further assess the country-level reliability of satellites for detecting and quantifying CH4 emissions from the onshore O&G sector, we extracted the average annual TROPOMI observational coverage (TOC) over onshore O&G infrastructure for 160 countries. Seven of the top-10 O&G-producing countries had an average annual TOC<10% (<36days per year), which indicates the limited ability to routinely identify large emissions events, track their duration, and quantify emissions rates using inverse modelling. We further assessed the potential performance of the latter by combining TOC and the uncertainties from the global O&G inventory. Results indicate that the accuracy of emissions quantifications of onshore O&G sources using TROPOMI data and inverse modeling will be higher in countries located in dryland and mid-latitude regions and lower in tropical and high-latitude regions. Therefore, current passive-sensing satellites have low potential for frequent monitoring of large methane emissions from O&G sectors in countries located in tropical and high latitudes (e.g., Canada, Russia, Brazil, Norway, and Venezuela). Alternative methods should be considered for routine emissions monitoring in these regions.

TI  - Suitability of the stress severity index combined with remote-sensing data as a tool to evaluate drought resistance traits in potato
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Potato is a drought susceptible crop and even short drought spells reduce tuber yields notably. In an earlier study we developed a stress severity index (SSI) based on the development stage of a genotype at the onset of drought and the soil water deficit based on soil water tension. Here, we test the suitability of the SSI combined with remotely sensed data as a screening tool to select drought-tolerant potato genotypes. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) were obtained from reflectance measurements and thermography. Temperature data from the thermography allow using the difference between leaf and air temperature (Delta T) to estimate the transpirational cooling of the leaves. Via cluster analysis including SSI, tuber yield reduction under drought, NDVI, PRI and thermography, three groups were distinguished: 1. SSI < 1000 with fast decreasing NDVI, PRI and Delta T, 2. SSI 1000-2000 with almost constant NDVI and Delta T and 3. SSI > 2000 described by small changes of NDVI, PRI and temperature deficit. For SSI < 1000, Delta T, PRI and NDVI showed to be good indicators of genotypic performance under drought. Potential strategies for drought resistance in potato detectable through remote sensing are discussed.

TI  - Evaluation of learning curve with Indocyanine Green (IcG) versus blue dye for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer.
T2  - American journal of surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Indocyanine green (IcG) is an alternative to isosulfan blue (IB) for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in breast cancer (BC). IcG carries improved cost and safety, but oncologic data upon implementation in practice is limited. We evaluated the learning curve defined as oncologic yield and operative (OR) time for IcG in SLN mapping in BC.METHODS: Retrospective review of patients >18 years with cTis-2 cN0 BC undergoing surgery first with SLN biopsy using IB or IcG. Analysis compared IB versus IcG across three time cohorts.RESULTS: Of 278 patients, 77 received IB and 201 received IcG. OR time was longer for IcG (p​=​0.022). There was no difference in oncologic yield between groups (p​=​0.35, p​=​0.61).CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons may be able to safely transition from IB to IcG for patients with early-stage breast cancer undergoing surgery first. Individuals should track their own data to confirm safety of the technique.

AB  - PurposeSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has yet to be accepted as the standard staging procedure in node positive (cN1) breast cancer patients who had clinical complete response in the axilla (cN0) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), due to the presumed high false negative rate associated with SLNB in such scenario. This study aimed to determine whether there is a significant difference in the axillary recurrence rate (ARR) and long-term survival in this group of patients, receiving SLNB alone versus axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).MethodsA retrospective cohort of cN1 patients who were rendered cN0 by NAC from January 2014 to December 2018 were identified from the Asan Medical Center database. Patients' characteristics and outcomes were collected and analyzed.Results902 cN1 patients treated with NAC and turned cN0 were identified. 477 (52.9%) patients achieved complete pathological response in the axilla (ypN0). At a median follow up of 65 months, ARR was 3.2% in the SLNB only group and 1.8% in the ALND group (p = 0.398). DFS and OS were significantly worse in patients with ALND as compared to patients with SLNB only (p = 0.011 and 0.047, respectively). We noted more patients in the ALND group had T3-4 tumor. In the subgroup analysis, we showed that in the T1-2 subgroup (n = 377), there was no statistically significant difference in DFS and OS (p = 0.242 and 0.671, respectively) between SLNB only and ALND group.ConclusionOur findings suggest that cN1 patients who were converted to ypN0 following NAC may be safely treated with SLNB only.

TI  - Assessing coastal bathymetry and climate change impacts on coastal ecosystems using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.
T2  - Environmental research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems are facing heightened risks due to human-induced climate change, including rising water levels and intensified storm events. Accurate bathymetry data is crucial for assessing the impacts of these threats. Traditional data collection methods can be cost-prohibitive. This study investigates the feasibility of using freely accessible Landsat and Sentinel satellite imagery to estimate bathymetry and its correlation with hydrographic chart soundings in Port Klang, Malaysia. Through analysis of the blue and green spectral bands from the Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 datasets, a bathymetry map of Port Klang's seabed is generated. The precision of this derived bathymetry is evaluated using statistical metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination. The results reveal a strong statistical connection (R2=0.9411) and correlation (R2=0.7958) between bathymetry data derived from hydrographic chart soundings and satellite imagery. This research not only advances our understanding of employing Landsat imagery for bathymetry assessment but also underscores the significance of such assessments in the context of climate change's impact on coastal ecosystems. The primary goal of this research is to contribute to the comprehension of Landsat imagery's utility in bathymetry evaluation, with the potential to enhance safety protocols in seaport terminals and provide valuable insights for decision-making concerning the management of coastal ecosystems amidst climate-related challenges. The findings of this research have practical implications for a wide range of stakeholders involved in coastal management, environmental protection, climate adaptation and disaster preparedness.

TI  - Warming indirectly simplifies food webs through effects on apex predators
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Warming alters ecosystems through direct physiological effects on organisms and indirect effects via biotic interactions, but their relative impacts in the wild are unknown due to the difficulty in warming natural environments. Here we bridge this gap by embedding manipulative field experiments within a natural stream temperature gradient to test whether warming and apex fish predators have interactive effects on freshwater ecosystems. Fish exerted cascading effects on algal production and microbial decomposition via both green and brown pathways in the food web, but only under warming. Neither temperature nor the presence of fish altered food web structure alone, but connectance and mean trophic level declined as consumer species were lost when both drivers acted together. A mechanistic model indicates that this temperature-induced trophic cascade is determined primarily by altered interactions, which cautions against extrapolating the impacts of warming from reductionist approaches that do not consider the wider food web.Using a bioenergetic model and manipulative field experiment along a natural stream temperature gradient, the authors identify a temperature-induced trophic cascade where the presence of fish increases algal biomass and reduces decomposition, but only under warming.

TI  - Development and validation of a case definition for problematic menopause in primary care electronic medical records
T2  - BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMenopause is a normal transition in a woman's life. For some women, it is a stage without significant difficulties; for others, menopause symptoms can severely affect their quality of life. This study developed and validated a case definition for problematic menopause using Canadian primary care electronic medical records, which is an essential step in examining the condition and improving quality of care.MethodsWe used data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network including billing and diagnostic codes, diagnostic free-text, problem list entries, medications, and referrals. These data formed the basis of an expert-reviewed reference standard data set and contained the features that were used to train a machine learning model based on classification and regression trees. An ad hoc feature importance measure coupled with recursive feature elimination and clustering were applied to reduce our initial 86,000 element feature set to a few tens of the most relevant features in the data, while class balancing was accomplished with random under- and over-sampling. The final case definition was generated from the tree-based machine learning model output combined with a feature importance algorithm. Two independent samples were used: one for training / testing the machine learning algorithm and the other for case definition validation.ResultsWe randomly selected 2,776 women aged 45-60 for this analysis and created a case definition, consisting of two occurrences within 24 months of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 627 (or any sub-codes) OR one occurrence of Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification code G03CA (or any sub-codes) within the patient chart, that was highly effective at detecting problematic menopause cases. This definition produced a sensitivity of 81.5% (95% CI: 76.3-85.9%), specificity of 93.5% (91.9-94.8%), positive predictive value of 73.8% (68.3-78.6%), and negative predictive value of 95.7% (94.4-96.8%).ConclusionOur case definition for problematic menopause demonstrated high validity metrics and so is expected to be useful for epidemiological study and surveillance. This case definition will enable future studies exploring the management of menopause in primary care settings.

T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeOmitting sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer treatment results in patients with unknown positive nodal status and potential risk for systemic undertreatment. This study aimed to investigate whether gene expression profiles (GEPs) can lower this risk in cT1-2N0 ER+ HER2- breast cancer patients treated with BCT.MethodsPatients were included if diagnosed between 2011 and 2017 with cT1-2N0 ER+ HER2- breast cancer, treated with BCT and SLNB, and in whom GEP was applied. Adjuvant chemotherapy recommendations based on clinical risk status (Dutch breast cancer guideline of 2020 versus PREDICT v2.1) with and without knowledge on SLNB outcome were compared to GEP outcome. We examined missing adjuvant chemotherapy indications, and the number of GEPs needed to identify one patient at risk for systemic undertreatment.ResultsOf 3585 patients, 2863 (79.9%) had pN0 and 722 (20.1%) pN + disease. Chemotherapy was recommended in 1354 (37.8% guideline-2020) and 1888 patients (52.7% PREDICT). Eliminating SLNB outcome (n = 722) resulted in omission of chemotherapy recommendation in 475 (35.1% guideline-2020) and 412 patients (21.8% PREDICT). GEP revealed genomic high risk in 126 (26.5% guideline-2020) and 82 patients (19.9% PREDICT) in case of omitted chemotherapy recommendation in the absence of SLNB. Extrapolated to the whole group, this concerns 3.5% and 2.3%, respectively, resulting in the need for 28-44 GEPs to identify one patient at risk for systemic undertreatment.ConclusionIf no SLNB is performed, clinical risk status according to the guideline of 2020 and PREDICT predicts a very low risk for systemic undertreatment. The number of GEPs needed to identify one patient at risk for undertreatment does not justify its standard use.

TI  - De-escalation of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Ductal Carcinoma In Situ
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Current guidelines recommend that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) be performed in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) undergoing mastectomy, in patients for whom the location of excision may compromise future SLNB, or if there is a high suspicion or risk of upstaging to invasive cancer on final pathology. Whether axillary surgery should be performed in patients with DCIS remains controversial. Our study aimed to examine the factors associated with the upgrade of DCIS to invasive cancer on final pathology and sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases to evaluate whether axillary surgery may be safely omitted in DCIS. Methods Patients with a diagnosis of DCIS on core biopsy who underwent surgery with axillary staging between 2016 and 2022 were identified from our pathology database and retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent surgical management of DCIS without axillary staging and those treated for local recurrence were excluded. Results Out of 65 patients, 35.3% of patients were upstaged to the invasive disease on final pathology. 9.23% of cases had a positive SLNB. Predictive factors associated with upstaging to invasive cancer included palpable mass on clinical examination (P = 0.013), presence of a mass on preoperative imaging (P = 0.040), and estrogen receptor status (P = 0.036). Conclusion Our results support ongoing opportunities for the de-escalation of axillary surgery in patients with DCIS. In a subset of patients undergoing surgery for DCIS, SLNB may be omitted as the risk of upstaging to invasive cancer is low. Patients with a mass on clinical examination or imaging and negative estrogen receptor (ER) lesions have a higher risk of upstaging to invasive cancer, where a sentinel lymph node biopsy should be performed.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We report on importance of conducting comprehensive studies of atmospheric aerosol particles, which cannot be done if information from various complementary sensors is unavailable. We present an example for such application and recommend on the types of sensors that should be used in view of the ACTRIS and RI-URBANS new strategies for monitoring at supersites. Although active and passive remote sensing data was not available in continuous mode, we show that synergic use of them with in-situ observations allows for comprehensive study of temporal and height-resolved distribution of aerosol in the lower troposphere and it can be successfully combined to assess biomass burning impact on air quality and optical properties. The analysed period was divided into three episodes based on the measured black carbon (BC) concentration and the prevailing wind direction. The dominant 72-h backward trajectories were ending in western Europe, mid-Atlantic and western Russia, respectively, The in-situ measured mass concentrations of BCtotal and BC apportioned to biomass burning as well as particulate matter (PM) concentrations in accumulation mode were twice higher during the first and last episodes compared to the second episode, representing long-range transport from different source regions. The obtained complementary surface, column-integrated, and layer-derived size distributions and other parameters demonstrate the added value of multisensor analyses.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Since late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has taken a scourge form worldwide, and to prevent the spread of this virus, a partial or complete lockdown was started. In India, the lockdown has been implemented in four phases starting from 25th March 2020. These circumstances restricted the operations of human movement, vehicles and industries, which began to improve the air quality. The aim of the present work is to enquire about air quality during the lockdown period at the national level in India and specifically in four metropolitan cities-Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. The air quality data of critical air pollutants- PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO of pre-COVID-19 (May & June 2019; and January 2020) and COVID-19 periods (May & June 2020; and January 2021) have been analyzed based on Sentinel 5P satellite image and Indian Central Pollution Control Board data. After a thorough study, it is found that the air quality is improved during the lockdown phase but again it degrades rapidly after the lockdown. Results show that among the four selected metropolitan cities, air pollution in Kolkata is the least whereas Delhi is the most polluted city in India. But the concentration of SO2 is reduced to 20 mu g/m3 in the lockdown period from 45 mu g/m(3) in pre-lockdown periods. Similarly, NO2 was reduced from 52 mu g/m(3) to 20 mu g/m(3); CO from 32 mu g/m(3) to 29 mu g/m(3) and aerosol concentration from 168 mu g/m(3) to 125 mu g/m(3) between pre-lockdown to lockdown periods. For other places and cities in India such air pollution reduction has been noticed. It is to be accomplished that the findings of this study could also be helpful for the policymakers and stakeholders to require some effective future initiatives to manage air quality through the partial lockdown process.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Climate change, urbanization, and many anthropogenic activities have intensified the floods in today's world. However, poor attention was given to mitigation strategies for floods in the developing world due to funding and technical limitations. Developing flood inundation maps from historical flood records would be an important task in mitigating any future flood damages. Therefore, this study presents the predictive capability of the Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model, a 2D coupled hydrology-inundation model, and to build flood inundation maps utilizing available ground observation and satellite remote sensing data for Kalu River, Sri Lanka. Despite the lack of studies in predicting flood levels, Kalu River is an annually flooded river basin in Sri Lanka. The comparative results between ground-based rainfall (GBR) measurement and satellite rainfall products (SRPs) from the IMERG satellite have shown that SRPs underestimate peak discharges compared to GBR data. The accuracy and the reliability of the model were assessed using ground-measured discharges with a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.89) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE = 0.86). Therefore, the developed RRI model can successfully be used to simulate the inundation of flood events in the KRB. The findings can directly be applied to the stakeholders.

T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study aims to improve the retrieval and mapping of turbidity in optically shallow waters using satellite data by detecting then masking bottom-contaminated pixels. The methodology is developed based on multi-spectral Sentinel-2 MSI and hyper-spectral PRISMA high spatial resolution satellite data recorded over the lagoon and bay of Bizerte (Tunisia) and match-ups with field optical measurements. A mask is created to distinguish shallow water (bottom-contaminated) pixels from deep waters or turbid water pixels, using the water-leaving reflectance signal in the near-infrared spectral region (rhow_704 nm) with an empirically derived threshold value of 0.02. Match-ups between field and satellite data clearly identify rhow_560 (green spectral band of Sentinel-2 MSI) as the best proxy for water turbidity in the study area, using a robust empirical regional relationship. The satellite-derived turbidity values show a good agreement with in-situ measurements, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.88 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.122 NTU. These results highlight the reliability and accuracy of the turbidity algorithm, but also the efficiency of the shallow water (bottom contamination) mask, even though conditions with highly turbid waters in the bay or lagoon were not captured on available satellite images. They provide valuable quantitative insights for assessing water quality and improving understanding of the impact of human activities on marine ecosystems.

TI  - High urinary oxidative DNA damage in wild chimpanzees ranging in proximity of agricultural fields in Sebitoli area, Uganda.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Agriculture expansion is a major cause of habitat loss and exposure to phytochemical pollution for non-human primates. In addition to endocrine disruption, exposure to pesticides may have other sublethal physiological consequences for animals, such as generation of oxidative damage to macromolecules. In this study, we analyzed the pesticides contained in the river water across the home range of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Sebitoli area located on the Northern part of Kibale National Park (Uganda). We tested whether levels of three urinary markers of oxidative damage vary among individuals in relation to their ranging patterns, as a proxy for pesticide exposure intensity. To better characterize the foraging habitat use, the trophic level, and the energetic status of study individuals, we also quantified urinary levels of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures and of C-peptide. Among the 511 pesticides screened, 18 compounds including herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides were found in the water sampled in the Western part of the home range of chimpanzees. In this area, chimpanzees used to feed on maize crops. By contrast, in the Eastern part where crop feeding was never observed, we found only seven pesticides. According to their ranging patterns and thus crop feeding frequency, the 139 urine samples collected from 43 Sebitoli chimpanzees were categorized as belonging to low, medium, and high exposure level. Chimpanzees from the high exposure zone had higher oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG) than chimpanzees from both the low and medium exposure groups, who had similar levels of oxidative DNA damage. In addition, individuals with higher C-peptide tended to have significantly higher oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxides. The three exposure groups had similar levels of urinary 8-isoprostanes and of urinary lipid peroxides. These results were robust for any potential confounding effect of other variables because neither age category nor sex or isotope levels were significantly associated with markers of oxidative damage. Our study points to genotoxic effects as one potential sublethal consequence of ranging in proximity of agricultural fields owing to exposure to pesticides or other unidentified sources of stress. Given our phylogenetic proximity, this information is relevant for the conservation of this species which is endangered and also sentinel for human health.

TI  - Austerity-driven policification: Neoliberalisation, schools and the police in Britain
T2  - SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This article argues that as a consequence of austerity, police in England and Wales have taken over important roles in welfare and social policy institutions. This renders those institutions more coercive, punitive and exclusionary, and normalises a police worldview in those institutions. This process of what I call austerity-driven policification can be observed specifically well in the increasing numbers of police officers integrated into schools most affected by austerity. Such 'transinstitutional policing' in Britain is triggered by contradictory post-global financial crisis austerity measures, but reliant upon a long, racialised history of authoritarian neoliberalisation. Cuts to public spending in the 2010s reduced state institutions' capacities to provide for vulnerable people, who were further criminalised and whose rights to support and solidarity were further delegitimised by a radicalisation of the framing of welfare recipients as undeserving, social housing estates as drug-infested gang territories, and schools in deprived areas, and Black pupils in particular, as dangerous. Police, while subjected to austerity measures also, functioned as an institution of last resort, supplementing and replacing incapacitated state institutions, while also being presented as an appropriate institution to address problems increasingly understood to be of a criminal rather than educational nature. This article suggests that austerity-driven policification is an intensification of longer-term trends toward a larger role for police in the neoliberal era. It shows the racial and authoritarian nature of neoliberalisation, and its messy realisation.

T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Even after adopting various measures, recent years have witnessed a surge in environment-related issues such as pollution and climate change. These issues have been considered anthropogenic, and it is a well-received notion that changing human behaviour is crucial for sustainable development. Promoting pro-environmental behaviour (PEB) requires understanding of associations among relevant factors; the present study aimed to explore the same among a few less-explored constructs, which, along with other factors, may significantly explain pro-environmental behaviour. The study examined the direct relationship of PEB with ecological intelligence (EI) and self-transcendent values. Also, it explored the mediating effects of implementation-intentions and the moderating effect of the "new ecological paradigm" (NEP) on PEB. The data were obtained from 400 adult participants using a set of standardized questionnaires. The results showed significant direct and indirect associations among EI, self-transcendent values, implementation-intentions, the NEP and PEB. Implementation-intentions significantly mediated the relationship of EI and values with PEB, and the mediation was moderated by the NEP. Individuals low on EI but endorsing the NEP showed implementation-intentions similar to those with high EI. Knowledge of the interplay among these factors can be utilized to design interventions for promoting PEB.

T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Shoreline detection and estimation of changes is a well-established concept in the field of coastal zone management. Recent technological advancements in the form of machine learning (ML) have transformed shoreline detection methodologies. However, due to the constantly changing nature of coasts, identification of the boundary between land and ocean has become an intricate process. In this particular investigation, long-term changes in shoreline along the lower segment of the Indian Sundarbans Delta (ISD) are estimated by employing Landsat sensor's optical imageries spanning 28 years from 1995 to 2023. A fully automated approach involving support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm with a 99.5% accuracy and zero-crossing edge detection algorithm for shoreline extraction from optical imagery has been proposed. The implementation stage of shoreline extraction utilizes Google Earth Engine's cloud platform. In contrast, subsequent analysis to calculate shoreline changes conforms to the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS v.5), an extension of ArcGIS Desktop's functionality. This research article examines the long-term shoreline changes in the Indian Sundarban Delta. The study uses three statistical measures: end point rate (EPR), linear regression rate (LRR), and net shoreline movement (NSM). EPR analysis shows significant erosion on Kanak Island and Bhangaduni Island up to 88.21 m. LRR statistics reveal negative trends on the eastern side. NSM analysis highlights maximum accretion in the northwestern part of the delta. This study offers valuable insights into dynamic coastal processes in the area.

TI  - Examining and predicting the influence of climatic and terrestrial factors on the seasonal distribution of ozone column depth over Tehran province using satellite observations
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - When combined with conducive atmospheric conditions, air pollution caused by fossil fuel consumption associated with transportation, industry and electricity production for households, create and sustain continuous pollution over the megalopolis of Tehran, Iran. In conjunction with daily meteorological forecasts, remote sensing can be used to identify and predict days with hazardous levels of air pollution, providing an opportunity for air quality alert systems to be triggered and warnings circulated to reduce health risks to citizens of Tehran province. Combining remotely sensed ozone column density (OCD) data from the Sentinel-5 TROPOMI sensor with NASA Giovanni data concerning meteorological parameters (temperature (T), wind speed (WS) and specific humidity (SH)), geographical parameters and population data, this study considers the drivers and effects of ozone pollution on the urban climate and vegetation condition (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) of 16 counties in Tehran province, Iran during 12 months (i.e., January 2021 to December 2021). Future monthly forecasts of the OCD, climatic and terrestrial factors in 2022 are also presented. Google Earth Engine and the NASA Giovanni platforms were employed for the processing and analysis of data using an interpolation technique. Additionally, a Box-Jenkins ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing (ETS) models were compared and tailored to generate monthly forecasts of OCD, T, WS, SH and NDVI. The highest and lowest OCD was obtained in June and December 2021, with a concentration of 0.14277 mol/m2 and 0.12383 mol/m2, respectively. However, the annual average OCD was higher in the cities of Shahriar and Pakdasht in March, with values of 0.13237 mol/m2 and 0.13244 mol/m2, respectively. The lowest OCD recorded was 0.13105 mol/m2, in Shemiranat city, in the north of Tehran. The results indicate a positive correlation between OCD and NDVI, and a negative correlation between OCD, SH, WS and T. A strong seasonal trend in OCD was identified for all cities, but across the entire province, altitude and population size were the most significant explanatory variables for spatial variations in OCD. This research demonstrates that an effective OCD monitoring and forecasting model may be generated from remote sensing and meteorological variables. The implementation and utilization of these models are of paramount importance as they offer vital information to authorities for continuous air quality monitoring and strategic planning, particularly for days with hazardous air pollution. By effectively implementing the OCD model, it has the potential to directly contribute to improved health outcomes in major cities across Iran.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - AimsHeart failure (HF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are largely managed in primary care, but their intersection in terms of disease burden, healthcare utilization, and treatment is ill-defined.Methods and resultsWe examined a retrospective cohort including all patients with HF or COPD in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network from 2010 to 2018. The population size in 2018 with HF, COPD, and HF with COPD was 15 778, 27 927, and 4768 patients, respectively. While disease incidence declined, age-sex-standardized prevalence per 100 population increased for HF alone from 2.33 to 3.63, COPD alone from 3.44 to 5.96, and COPD with HF from 12.70 to 15.67. Annual visit rates were high and stable around 8 for COPD alone but declined significantly over time for HF alone (9.3-8.1, P = 0.04) or for patients with both conditions (14.3-11.9, P = 0.006). For HF alone, cardiovascular visits were common (29.4%), while respiratory visits were infrequent (3.5%), with the majority of visits being non-cardiorespiratory. For COPD alone, respiratory and cardiovascular visits were common (16.4% and 11.3%) and the majority were again non-cardiorespiratory. For concurrent disease, 39.0% of visits were cardiorespiratory. The commonest non-cardiorespiratory visit reasons were non-specific symptoms or signs, endocrine, musculoskeletal, and mental health. In patients with HF with and without COPD, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor use was similar, while mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist use was marginally higher with concurrent COPD. Beta-blocker use was initially lower with concurrent COPD compared with HF alone (69.3% vs. 74.0%), but this progressively declined by 2018 (74.5% vs. 73.5%).ConclusionsThe prevalence of HF and COPD continues to rise. Although patients with either or both conditions are high utilizers of primary care, the majority of visits relate to non-cardiorespiratory comorbidities. Medical therapy for HF was similar and the initially lower beta-blocker utilization disappeared over time.

AB  - During the Great Recession, a group of identitarian nativist associations emerged in Spain, which, over time, gave shape to a new social movement: the Cultural Associations of National Aid (Asociaciones Culturales de Ayuda Nacional). Based on a digital ethnography and critical discursive analysis, this paper aims to examine their worldview and 'repertoire of contention', focusing on the latest events that have shaken the world and, more particularly, Spanish society. This research highlights two contributions to the nationalism and far-right social movements study: 'national priority' as a radicalization of the 'national preference', and 'national aid' as a new discriminatory non-state aid, which we will refer to as 'ultranationalist charity'.

TI  - Ghosts in the urban sacrifice zone: (De)colonial relationality in Global North imaginaries
T2  - TEXTUAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The abandonment of urban areas in anticipation of climate change constitutes a kind of ghosting: a veil is drawn that divides spaces of being (that are valued and preserved) from spaces of non-being (that are deemed expendable and 'dead'). These spaces of non-being can be understood as the 'sacrifice zones' of a capitalist worldview that orders the world through simplified dualistic categories. Opposed to this sacrificial logic, David Farrier has proposed a relational way of thinking that haunts the dualisms of capitalist modernity via spectres of human-nonhuman entanglement. Building on existing work from decolonial and Black studies, this paper extends understandings of such entanglements by exposing how they are tied up with racial and colonial logics. It does so by focusing on two Anthropocene imaginaries that 'open up' the city as a place haunted by complex relationality. First, my reading of Jan van Aken's 'Proximale Falanx' (2019) shows how its portrayal of a submerged Amsterdam can be read as an Anthropocene imaginary of relationality but is also haunted by colonial paradigms. Second, my reading of Teju Cole's Open City (2011) expands this narrow understanding of the climate crisis by articulating decolonial ways of being in New York City.

TI  - Adherence to ESGO guidelines and impact on survival in obese patients with endometrial cancer: a multicentric retrospective study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objectives Obesity is known to be both a major risk factor for endometrial cancer and associated with surgical complexity. Therefore, the management of patients with obesity is a challenge for surgeons and oncologists. The aim of this study is to assess the adherence to European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) guidelines in morbidly obese patients (body mass index (BMI) >40 kg/m(2)). The secondary objectives were the impact on overall survival and recurrence-free survival.Methods All the patients who were treated for an endometrial cancer in the 11 cancer institutes of the FRANCOGYN group were included and classified into three weight groups: morbid (BMI >40 kg/m(2)), obese (BMI 30-40), and normal or overweight (BMI <30). Adherence to guidelines was evaluated for surgical management, lymph node staging, and adjuvant therapies.Results In total, 2375 patients were included: 1330 in the normal or overweight group, 763 in the obese group, and 282 in the morbid group. The surgical management of the morbid group was in accordance with the guidelines in only 30% of cases, compared with 44% for the obese group and 48% for the normal or overweight group (p<0.001); this was largely because of a lack of lymph node staging. Morbid group patients were more likely to receive the recommended adjuvant therapy (61%) than the obese group (52%) or the normal or overweight group (46%) (p<0.001). Weight had no impact on overall survival (p=0.6) and morbid group patients had better recurrence-free survival (p=0.04).Conclusion Adherence to international guidelines for surgical management is significantly lower in morbid group patients, especially for lymph node staging. However, morbidly obese patients had more often the adequate adjuvant therapies. Morbid group patients had a better recurrence-free survival likely because of better prognosis tumors.

TI  - Estimating Gross and Net Primary Productivities Using Earth Observation Products: a Review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Considerable research has been conducted on the estimation of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Net Primary Productivity (NPP) from different viewpoints. Each vision has proposed special applied materials and methodologies and has provided specific insight into the results and overall conclusions. As NPP generally declines once crops start to begin competing intensively for water resources, the identification of precise NPP estimation approaches can be of importance in water and agricultural studies. Due to the lack of a comprehensive overview of the subject that investigates GPP and NPP studies from both environmental and agricultural perspectives, we reviewed the existing approaches in estimating these two parameters with a special focus on estimating NPP for agricultural studies. Categorization of the diverse proposed models and approaches, with special attention to the role of newly introduced materials, such as chlorophyll proxies, is provided on GPP and NPP estimations. After introducing the different categories, from the environmental perspective, we addressed the most recent improvements in GPP estimations in the biosphere by applying a chlorophyll-based fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR) into the light use efficiency (LUE) model. Then, by considering the agricultural perspectives, the application of both chlorophyll-based fPAR and a new chlorophyll-based predictor was discussed to estimate NPP and yield. It is expected that the outlined vision on estimating NPP in agricultural studies helps to identify the current boundary of knowledge in these types of studies.

TI  - Ecological protection on the West Coast of Taiwan Strait under economic zone construction: A case study of land use in Yueqing
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The economic and ecological implications of infrastructural development in the west coast of Taiwan Strait are critically important for both financial stakeholders and policymakers. This study explores the intricate balance between economic development and ecological sustainability in Yueqing, located on the Western Taiwan Strait. Leveraging remote sensing data for fiscal years 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, the analysis reveals stable land use patterns. The data shows that between 2005 and 2020, the predominant land use categories in Yueqing were forestry and agricultural assets, making up 53.30%, 52.81%, 52.85%, and 52.42% of the total study area, respectively. Both asset classes demonstrated an upward trend, contrasting with the diminishing trends observed in grasslands, aquatic zones, and areas allocated for construction. To address the challenges posed by population pressure and limited land resources, the Yueqing government has implemented policies like the "Implementation Measures for Yueqing's Farmland Protection and Compensation" in 2016 and the "Land Greening Action Plan" in 2020. These policies have effectively managed land transitions and contributed to sustainable development.

TI  - Dissolved oxygen concentration inversion based on Himawari-8 data and deep learning: a case study of lake Taihu
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentration is an essential water quality parameter widely used in water environments and pollution assessments, which indirectly reflects the pollution level and the occurrence of blue-green algae. With the advancement of satellite technology, the use of remote sensing techniques to estimate DO concentration has become a crucial means of water quality monitoring. In this study, we propose a novel model for DO concentration estimation in water bodies, termed Dissolved Oxygen Multimodal Deep Neural Network (DO-MDNN), which utilizes synchronous satellite remote sensing data for real-time DO concentration inversion. Using Lake Taihu as a case study, we validate the DO-MDNN model using Himawari-8 (H8) satellite imagery as input data and actual DO concentration in Lake Taihu as output data. The research results demonstrate that the DO-MDNN model exhibits high accuracy and stability in DO concentration inversion. For Lake Taihu, the performance metrics including adj_R2, RMSE, Pbias, and SMAPE are 0.77, 0.66 mg/L, -0.44%, and 5.36%, respectively. Compared to the average performance of other machine learning models, the adj_R2 shows an improvement of 6.40%, RMSE is reduced by 8.27%, and SMAPE is decreased by 12.1%. These findings highlight the operational feasibility of real-time DO concentration inversion using synchronous satellite data, providing a more efficient, economical, and accurate approach for real-time DO monitoring. This method holds significant practical value in enhancing the efficiency and precision of water environment monitoring.

TI  - Extracellular glutamate and GABA transients at the transition from interictal spiking to seizures.
T2  - Brain : a journal of neurology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Focal epilepsy is associated with intermittent brief population discharges (interictal spikes), which resemble sentinel spikes that often occur at the onset of seizures. Why interictal spikes self-terminate whilst seizures persist and propagate is incompletely understood. We used fluorescent glutamate and GABA sensors in an awake rodent model of neocortical seizures to resolve the spatiotemporal evolution of both neurotransmitters in the extracellular space. Interictal spikes were accompanied by brief glutamate transients which were maximal at the initiation site and rapidly propagated centrifugally. GABA transients lasted longer than glutamate transients and were maximal 1.5 mm from the focus where they propagated centripetally. Prior to seizure initiation GABA transients were attenuated, whilst glutamate transients increased, consistent with a progressive failure of local inhibitory restraint. As seizures increased in frequency, there was a gradual increase in the spatial extent of spike-associated glutamate transients associated with interictal spikes. Neurotransmitter imaging thus reveals a progressive collapse of an annulus of feed-forward GABA release, allowing seizures to escape from local inhibitory restraint.

TI  - Land use and cover change in Dar es Salaam metropolitan city: satellite data and CA-Markov chain analysis
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land use and land cover change is driven by a complex interaction involving multiple environmental, climatic, and social factors. This study employs time-series satellite imagery from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (1995 and 2009) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (2022) to examine LULC changes in Tanzania's Dar es Salaam Metropolitan City. Image pre-processing was performed using the Google Earth engine code editor, followed by LULC classification using Random Forest machine learning in R software. Herein, seven LULC classes were defined: Built-up areas; agriculture; forest; bushland; water; grassland; and bare soil. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients for the years 1995 were 81.40% and 0.77, for 2009 were 88.42% and 0.86, and for 2022 were 81.51% and 0.77, respectively.. Results showed that between 1995 and 2022, the built-up and agricultural land areas increased by 14.87% and 4.47%, respectively. In contrast, there was a significant decrease in bushland, grassland, forest, and bare land areas (14.57%, 1.75%, 2.9%, and 35%), respectively. The study identifies factors influencing these changes and employs a Cellular-Automata-Markov-Chain (CA-Markov-Chain) model to evaluate and predict LULC changes. Distance from the city centre, population density, and precipitation are major drivers for LULC change. The CA-Markov Chain analysis predicts that the built-up area and agricultural area will grow from 319km2 (19.30%) to 530 km2 (32.06%) and 471 km2 (28.49%) to 720 km2 (43.56%) between 2022 and 2050 respectively, based on the trends observed from 1995 to 2022. Therefore, policymakers should prioritise sustainable urban planning in Dar es Salaam, considering drivers of land-use change and predicted growth in built-up and agricultural areas.

TI  - Water quality indication of spectral probability distribution (SPD): correlation between SPD and Forel-Ule index in closed, connected water bodies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral probability distributions (SPD) of water bodies in satellite images have demonstrated the potential for indicating the geographical and environmental features of their watersheds. This implies that SPDs also have the potential for indicating water quality features, but so far there have been no further studies on their correlations. In this study, 690 SPDs of global closed connected water bodies, mainly including lakes and reservoirs, were extracted from Landsat-8 images. These SPDs were classified into seven types, and the entropy of each SPD diagram was calculated. The correlation between the SPD diagram's entropy and Forel-Ule index (FUI) is relatively good with R-2 = 0.5651 - indicating that water bodies with better water quality are usually found to have smaller entropy in their SPD diagrams. This study demonstrates that SPD is a good indicator for not only the aquatic environment but also water quality monitoring.

TI  - A novel approach for ecosystem respiration simulation in drylands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystem respiration (Reco) in drylands (arid and semi-arid areas) contributes to the largest uncertainty of the global carbon cycle. Here, using the Reco data from 24 sites (98 site-years) in drylands from Fluxnet and corresponding MODIS remote sensing products, we develop a novel semi-empirical, yet physiologically-based remote sensing model: the ILEP_Reco model (a Reco model derived from ILEP, the acronym for "integrated LE and EVI proxy"). This model can simulate Reco observations across most biomes in drylands with a small margin of error (R2 = 0.56, RMSE = 1.12 gCm-2d-1, EF = 0.46, MBE = -0.06 gCm-2d-1) and performs significantly better than the previous model: Ensemble_all. The seasonal variation of Reco in drylands can be well simulated by the ILEP_Reco model. When we relate ILEP to the Q10 model, the corresponding ILEP_Q10 values in all 98 site-years distribute quite convergently, which greatly facilitates fixing the ILEP_Q10 value as a constant in different site-years. The spatial variation of Reco in drylands is then defined as reference respiration at the annual mean ILEP, which can be easily and powerfully simulated by the ILEP_Reco model. These results help us understand the spatial-temporal variations of Reco in drylands and thus will shed light on the carbon budget on a regional scale, or even a global one.

TI  - Analysis of spatial and temporal variation of vegetation NPP in Daning River Basin and its driving forces
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Daning River Basin is a typical representative of the 'mountain forest' in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area of the Yangtze River. In recent years, with the completion of the Three Gorges Project, the local vegetation has degraded, soil erosion has become severe, and there is an urgent need to assess the environmental quality. Data were fused using the MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (250 m) and Landsat NDVI (30 m) through an Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) to obtain ESTARFM NDVI (30 m). This data was then entered into the Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model, along with meteorological and land use data, to calculate vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) and trends in the Daning River Basin. The detection of drivers with a high impact on vegetation NPP was done using a Geodetector. The results show that: (1) In terms of spatial and temporal changes, the annual average NPP of the watershed during the 13 years from 2008 to 2020 generally showed an upward trend, with the average yearly vegetation NPP being 512.33gC center dot m-2 center dot a-1, exhibiting a low southwest to surrounding increasing trend along the river. (2) The spatial and temporal variation of vegetation NPP is influenced by several factors synergistically, with elevation, temperature, and distance from settlements being the dominant factors. The interaction of these two factors can enhance the explanatory power of vegetation NPP. Through the estimation of vegetation NPP and the analysis of influencing factors in the Daning River Basin, this study can provide a reference for the ecological restoration and management of vegetation NPP in small watersheds under similar environments.

TI  - Targeted community wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and Mpox virus during a festival mass-gathering event.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Wastewater surveillance has emerged recently as a powerful approach to understanding infectious disease dynamics in densely populated zones. Wastewater surveillance, while promising as a public health tool, is often hampered by slow turn-around times, complex analytical protocols, and resource-intensive techniques. In this study, we evaluated an affinity capture method and microfluidic digital PCR as a rapid approach to quantify severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) virus, and fecal indicator, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) in wastewater during a mass-gathering event. Wastewater samples (n=131) were collected from residential and commercial manholes, pump stations, and a city's wastewater treatment plant. The use of Nanotrap Microbiome Particles and microfluidic digital PCR produced comparable results to other established methodologies, with reduced process complexity and analytical times, providing same day results for public health preparedness and response. Using indigenous SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV in wastewater, the average viral recovery efficiency was estimated at 10.1%. Both SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 genes were consistently detected throughout the sampling period, with increased RNA concentrations mainly in wastewater samples collected from commercial area after festival mass gatherings. The mpox virus was sporadically detected in wastewater samples during the surveillance period, without distinct temporal trends. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in the city's wastewater mirrored the city's COVID-19 cases, confirming the predictive properties of wastewater surveillance. Wastewater surveillance continues to be beneficial for tracking diseases that display gastrointestinal symptoms, including SARS-CoV-2, and can be a powerful tool for sentinel surveillance. However, careful site selection and a thorough understanding of community dynamics are necessary when performing targeted surveillance during temporary mass-gathering events as potential confirmation bias may occur.

TI  - Quantum theory only makes sense in Lazare Carnot's participatory engineering thermodynamics, a development of Leibniz's dynamics
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Feynman insisted 'no one understands quantum theory'. Yet, experimentalists tell us quantum theory is the most successful theory in history. Quantum theory cannot be understood as a classical mechanical theory since it arose through the 'interpolation' of two highly successful but complementary classical mechanics: Newtonian particle mechanics and Maxwellian wave mechanics. The two-slit experiment illustrates that what is experienced depends on choice of experimental set-up. Quantum theory is properly understood within the more general framework of engineering thermodynamics. In Part One, I point to four essential characteristics of quantum theory that cannot be understood in any framework defined by the classical mechanical presuppositions of symmetry and conservation. These four characteristics are the participatory, the complementary, the indeterminate and the new non-commutative geometry. In Part Two, articulating engineering thermodynamics, I note there are two histories and two formulations of thermodynamics: Carnot's engineering thermodynamics and the 'rational mechanical' tradition of Clausius-Boltzmann. These four essential characteristics of quantum theory are also characteristics of engineering thermodynamics. In Part Three, I trace the precursors of Lazare Carnot's engineering thermodynamics to earlier insights of Huygens, d'Alembert, Leibniz and the Bernoullis. Leibniz brought these forth in his meta-paradigm shift from Statics to Dynamics.This article is part of the theme issue 'Thermodynamics 2.0: Bridging the natural and social sciences (Part 2)'.

TI  - A novel total phosphorus concentration retrieval method based on two-line classification in lakes and reservoirs across China.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Phosphorus is widely recognized as a nutrient that restricts growth and is the primary contributor to eutrophication in 80% of water bodies. Consequently, the Chinese government has consistently prioritized monitoring and controlling total phosphorus (TP) levels. The remote estimation of TP in lakes and reservoirs at a national scale is a challenging task due to TP being a non-optically active parameter. Currently, there is a lack of developed TP inversion models specifically designed for lakes and reservoirs in China. For solving this problem, a novel two-line classification method drawn on scatter plots based on the natural logarithm of TP (Ln(TP)) and B33/B9 was proposed and used to classify 1211 measured samples obtained from field cruises in 105 lakes and reservoirs across China from 2012 to2022 into three categories, Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3. Results demonstrate that the proposed classification method has the ability to enhance the correlation between Ln(TP) and 43 basic potential single band and band combinations. Specifically, the correlation range improved from (-0.31,0.15) to (-0.77,0.24) in Class 1, (-0.81, 0.36) in Class 2, and (-0.74, 0.52) in Class 3. Additionally, the classification method also improved the correlation range between Ln(TP) and 820 band ratios, from (-0.32, 0.32) to (-0.83, 0.82) in Class 1, (-0.86, 0.86) in Class 2, and (-0.86, 0.86) in Class 3. These datasets were subsequently utilized as input for eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models. Finally, well performing XGBoost models in Class 1 (R2=0.76, RMSE=0.3, MAPE=12%), Class 2 (R2=0.84, RMSE=0.49, MAPE=38%), and Class 3 (R2=0.74, RMSE=0.46, MAPE=14%) were used to map TP of 563 large lakes and reservoirs (≥20km2) across China using MODIS images from 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. This study presents a novel approach for estimating non-optically active parameters through remote sensing on a national scale.

TI  - F2BFE: development of feature-based building footprint extraction by remote sensing data and GEE
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of building footprints (BF) is necessary for understanding urbanization growth. It is a difficult task to extract residential sites, mainly BF, because of the complexity of their makeup and spectral variety. Additionally, conventional methods for building mapping typically rely on abundant training data and expertise from human operates. This study presents a new unsupervised Feature-Based Building Footprint Extraction (F2BFE) strategy using Sentinel-1 & 2 satellite images and the SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The newly developed radar index (NRI) from Sentinel-1 images was utilized to extract the Primary Building Footprints (PBF) through histogram analysis and thresholding techniques, based on the mean of annual Sentinel-1 VV and VH Backscatter channels in the Ascending orbit. In this research, the integration of the Otsu and Unimodal thresholding technique was developed as an optimal thresholding method for feature extraction. Furthermore, Sentinel-2 images were applied to extract spectral indices related to vegetation (NDVI, GNDVI, RDVI indices), water (NDWI index), and residential/built-up (NDBI, BuEI). The qualitative and quantitative validation results indicate that the NRI-based BF map achieved higher Overall Accuracy (OA) values of 98.14%, 90%, and 91% in Region of Interest-1 (ROI-1), ROI-2, and ROI-3, respectively. Additionally, the Kappa Coefficients (KC) for these regions were 0.96, 0.97, and 0.85, respectively. The NRI index provides an excellent OA result when vegetation, water, and slope features are carefully eliminated. Finally, it can be inferred that the simultaneous use of the sentinel-1 & 2 and slope data in feature space leads to increased BF accuracy.

TI  - Assessing how irrigation practices and soil moisture affect crop growth through monitoring Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data.
T2  - Environmental monitoring and assessment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This study authorizes processes and approaches using optical and microwave data to determine the availability of water in the study area at any given moment. This will aid in identifying the optimal time and location for irrigation to enhance crop growth. For this purpose, a set of spectral vegetation parameters (from Sentinel-2), soil moisture (from Sentinel-1), evapotranspiration, and surface temperature (from Landsat-8) were used, along with field data on water content and irrigation timing. The results showed that both NDVI and NDMI are highly sensitive to moisture, making them the best indices for determining the timing and location of irrigation. This research contributes to sustainable agricultural development. It has implications for farmers, policymakers, and researchers in optimizing irrigation schedules, developing policies for sustainable agriculture, and enhancing crop productivity while conserving water resources. This approach can be particularly useful in regions facing water scarcity, where the efficient use of water resources is crucial for sustainable agricultural development.

TI  - On the extraction of the reservoirs' waterline using polarimetric X-band SAR measurements: the case study of the San Giuliano reservoir, Italy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the World Bank data catalogue, 6 , 862 records of reservoirs and their associated dams are present summing up a capacity of 6 , 197 km3 of water. They play a crucial role in providing potable and irrigation water and, therefore, it is of paramount interest to effectively monitor such critical infrastructures. An effective approach is based on satellite remote sensing and, in particular, on the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). In this paper, we critically investigate the use of polarimetric SAR measurements for reservoirs' waterline estimation. Measurements of the novel COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation (CSG) X-band quad-polarimetric SAR related to the San Giuliano reservoir, in the South of Italy, are used to carry out an electromagnetic analysis of the different polarimetric scattering returns. Experimental results show that the cross-polarized channel, as well as the inter-channel phase, are noisy and, therefore, uninformative when used to design coherent polarimetric waterline extraction methods. From an electromagnetic viewpoint, this is due to the peculiarities of the reservoirs that call for low surface roughness and negligible wave pattern that, at once, result in a joint combination of un-tilted Bragg scattering and specular reflection. This implies that a low co-polarized backscatter and a cross-polarized signal largely below the system noise floor are to be expected. As a consequence, waterline extraction approaches that do not exploit the inter-channel phase, the so-called incoherent approaches, are shown to outperform the coherent ones.

TI  - Questionnaire study of application about sentinel lymph node biopsy surgery in locally advanced breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNodal staging from sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has become the standard procedure for early-stage breast cancer patients. SLN biopsy implementation after chemotherapy has previously been evaluated. This questionnaire study aimed to investigate the current trend of SLN biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for locally advanced breast cancer.Methods and materialsWe conducted a web-based survey among breast surgeons who are members of the Korean Breast Cancer Society. The survey comprised 14 questions about axillary surgery after NAC.ResultsOf 135 respondents, 48.1% used a combined method of dye and radioactive isotope (RI). In the absence of SLN metastasis, 67.7% would perform only SLN biopsy, while 3% would perform ALN dissection. In case of SLN metastasis, the proportions of surgeons who would proceed with ALN dissection were 60.2% and 67.2% for less than two and more than three positive SLNs, respectively.ConclusionThe present study confirmed the increasing tendency to adopt SLN biopsy for axillary staging in patients who achieved complete response with initial nodal metastasis. It could be expected that the mapping methods for patients receiving NAC have become diverse, including RI, vital dye, and indocyanine green fluorescence. The implementation of SLN biopsy after NAC will grow in the coming years due to an increasing demand of minimally invasive surgery.

TI  - Forecast volume of potential landslides in alpine-canyon terrain using time-series InSAR technology: a case study in the Bailong River basin, China
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The magnitude (spatial location, area, and volume) of landslides is a crucial parameter for estimating the quantitative risk and preventing landslide hazards. This study proposes a novel approach to forecast the volume of potential landslides in alpine-canyon terrain by combining the empirical relationship linking landslide volume (V) to characteristics and synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technology in the northeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. First, a historical landslide inventory with detailed characteristics was established by reviewing literature and field investigation. Then, the relationship between volume and characteristics of landslides was analyzed based on the least-squares linear regression of the logarithmic transformation. Finally, the relationships of the colluvial landslides (V = 0.170xL0.982xW1.589xH0.471)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$({\text{V}}\text{ = 0.170}\times{\text{L}}<^>{0.982}\times{\text{W}}<^>{1.589}\times{\text{H}}<^>{0.471})$$\end{document} and loess landslides (V = 0.170xL0.796xW2.151xH0.048)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$({\text{V}}\text{ = 0.170}\times{\text{L}}<^>{0.796}\times{\text{W}}<^>{2.151}\times{\text{H}}<^>{{0}\text{.048}})$$\end{document} were obtained after verifying several landslides. The ground deformation rate was generated, and 217 potential landslides were detected using 47 descending Sentinel-1A images acquired from January 11, 2020, to July 16, 2021, and 40 ascending Sentinel-1A images acquired from January 11, 2020, to April 23, 2021.

TI  - Automated remote sensing tools to counter illicit maritime activity: vessel detection, bathymetry and topography from WorldView imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Illicit maritime activity, such as piracy and smuggling, is a global issue that often occurs in areas where interdiction authorities are sparse, ground-based monitoring technologies like radar lack range and coverage, and dark vessels abound. Our objective was to assess vessel congregation patterns, identify likely beaching areas based on terrain maps, and use them to narrow the search for potential smuggling transfer and overland routes in a specific region along the Puntland coast of Somalia. To accomplish this goal, we developed automated protocols applied to WorldView satellite imagery for (1) vessel detection and size classification, (2) shallow-water bathymetric characterization, and (3) coastal topography mapping. Utilizing a single sensor for vessel detection and topographic and bathymetric extraction at high spatial resolution and at a high re-visit rate provides a simplification to near-shore characterization for monitoring purposes. The extracted topography and bathymetry are then presented as a single, comprehensive perspective of a coastal region. The vessel-detection algorithm identified all vessels larger than approximately 15 metres in length (35 of 35), but misidentified six artefacts (i.e. false positives), resulting in an overall accuracy of 85%. The combined vessel and terrain maps facilitated the identification of a potential beaching and overland transportation route location.

TI  - Multi-scale fusion for few-shot remote sensing image classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Few-shot image classification is currently valuable research in the field of remote sensing image applications. The difficulty in obtaining training data for a large number of labelled remote sensing images leads to difficulties in applying traditional deep learning-based remote sensing image classification methods. Existing few-shot remote sensing image classification methods usually use a large number of base datasets to train network models in the pre-training phase and perform few-shot classification tasks after model fine-tuning on new datasets in the meta-testing phase. However, an insufficient number of remote sensing images lead to inaccurate features being extracted by the model, and the large amount of new class data for fine-tuning is also not easily accessible. In addition, using a pre-trained model to extract features from the new dataset will create a"negative transfer" problem. In this paper, we aim to address the above challenges in two ways. First, we use a subset of ImageNet, a readily available few-shot natural image dataset, for model pre-training, and eliminate the fine-tuning operation to simulate a real-world application scenario where remote sensing data is extremely scarce. Second, due to the significant differences in scale and style between the ImageNet dataset and the remote sensing dataset, which lead to a serious negative transfer problem in the model, we design a multi-scale feature fusion module to comprehensively decide the labels of query samples considering all scales to compensate for the scale differences and alleviate the"negative transfer" problem. We conducted experiments on four benchmark remote sensing datasets and achieved satisfactory performance.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Energy consumption has been a significant issue. CO2 emissions have increased due to increased energy consumption. On the other hand, hard steels have been an essential subject of investigation due to their low energy consumption and good surface quality. Therefore, this experimental study investigates the effects of cutting parameters on cutting forces, power consumption (PC), energy consumption (EC), sound intensity (SI), and surface roughness (Ra) in machining AISI S1 (60 HRC) cold work tool steel. Feed rate (f) on cutting force with 53.23%, power consumption with 94.11% depth of cut (ap), energy efficiency with 74.92% feed rate, over surface roughness value with 86.66%, depth of cut with 94.42% on sound intensity are effective parameters. Mathematical equations related to the cutting parameters were obtained. In addition, mathematical equations were created between cutting force and power consumption, cutting force and sound intensity, and power consumption and sound intensity. Finally, optimum cutting conditions were determined with multiple optimisation methods, which turned out to be 210 m/min cutting speed (v), 0.08 mm cutting depth, and 0.0505 mm/rev feed rate. Accordingly, it was calculated that sound intensity would be reduced by 4.25%, surface roughness value would be decreased by 36.36%, power consumption by 21.74%, Fz by 26.77%, by Fy 52.46% and Fx by 24.44%.

TI  - Improving Neural Network classification of native forest in New Zealand with phenological features
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in Vegetation Indices (VIs) over time can describe vegetation phenology; however, it is not known which phenological features contribute most to land cover classification. Feature selection could potentially solve this problem. In this study, phenological feature importance and selection were evaluated by using two-year Sentinel-2 (S-2) data and single-date PlanetScope (PS) to classify a 50 km2 native podocarp forest in New Zealand. The study area was classified into nine classes. Single-date PS and S-2 data were fused to a base image with the same spatial resolution as PS and 8 bands containing spectral data from S-2; this image was used to produce 30 Vegetation Indices (VIs). Phenological features - amplitude (AMP) and phase (PH) were extracted from these VIs using time-series S-2 only, and harmonic analysis in Google Earth Engine. For accurately classifying forests and identifying the most important features, three classification scenarios (fused bands & VIs, fused bands & phenological features, fused bands & VIs & phenological features) were developed using a Neural Network. Variable Selection Using Random Forest (VSURF) was applied on these scenarios to evaluate the impact of feature selection. Results indicate that VSURF could reduce the time needed for the classification while maintaining a comparable level of accuracy. Phenological features improved accuracy from 90% to 94%, driven mostly by Red-Edge Triangulated Vegetation Index-AMP&PH, Normalised Near-Infrared-PH, Greenness Index-PH, Water Body Index-PH, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index-PH, Normalised Green-PH, Red-Edge Normalised Difference Vegetation Index-PH, Leaf Chlorophyll Content-AMP, and Simple Near-Infrared and Blue Ratio-PH. These features reflect changes in the structure, biochemical, and physiological characteristics of the canopy. A lack of ground-based measurements precluded an evaluation of the accuracy of these phenological aspects and an explanation of their distinctive contribution to the model. Overall, the findings show that specific phenological features can improve the classification of New Zealand's indigenous podocarp forests.

TI  - MPFFNet: LULC classification model for high-resolution remote sensing images with multi-path feature fusion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification has become increasingly important in various fields, including ecological and environmental protection, urban planning, and geological disaster monitoring. With the development of high-resolution remote sensing satellite technology, there is a growing focus on achieving precise LULC classification. However, the accuracy of fine-grained LULC classification is challenged by the high intra-class diversity and low inter-class separability inherent in high-resolution remote sensing images. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel multi-path feature fusion semantic segmentation model, called MPFFNet, which combines the segmentation results of convolutional neural networks with traditional filtering processes to achieve finer LULC classification. MPFFNet consists of three modules: the Improved Encoder Module (IEM) extracts contextual and spatial detail information through the backbone network, DASPP, and MFEAM; the Improved Decoder Module (IDM) utilizes the Cascade Feature Fusion (CFF) module to effectively merge shallow and deep information; and the Feature Fusion Module (FAM) enables dual-path feature fusion using a convolutional neural network and Gabor Filter. Experimental results on the large-scale classification set and the fine land-cover classification set of the Gaofen Image Dataset (GID) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving mIoU scores of 81.02% and 77.83%, respectively. These scores outperform U-Net by 7.95% and 3.28%, respectively. Therefore, we believe that our model can deliver superior results in the task of LULC classification.

TI  - Application of indocyanine green in the management of oral cancer: a literature review
T2  - ONCOLOGIE
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Indocyanine green is a cyanine dye that displays fluorescent properties in the near-infrared region. Indocyanine green has good water solubility and can bind to plasma proteins in the body. After binding, it can display green fluorescence when irradiated by near-infrared fluorescence. Owing to its good imaging ability and low side effects, indocyanine green is widely used in the diagnosis and treatment of various tumors. Indocyanine green-assisted sentinel lymph node biopsy helps determine clean tumor boundaries, helps surgeons remove primary tumors completely, assists in microvascular anastomosis in head and neck repair and reconstruction, reduces operation time, evaluates blood perfusion to monitor flap status. In addition, indocyanine green has great potential in photodynamic therapy to specifically kill tumor cells. However, despite the benefits, studies regarding the application of indocyanine green in oral cancer are limited. Therefore, we conducted a literature review to explore the application of indocyanine green in oral cancer to benefit clinicians involved in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has become more common problem and more severe that widespread over the world in recent decades, increasing their negative effects on the environment. The most vulnerable communities can be warned and prepared for the negative effects of droughts. This study aims to assess and predict the drought vulnerability using Landsat satellite images from 2014 to 2022 over El- Dammam City. Using remote sensing, drought phenomenon was simulated and predicted through Perpendicular drought index (PDI) and Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI). In the present study, some indices were selected to sasses vegetation as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), water as Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and salinity as salinity index (SI) and Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI) with the aid of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Partial Least Square (PLS). Results showed that NDDI and PDI were negatively correlated with NDVI and NDWI; respectively where NDDI and PDI were positively correlated with NDSI and SI; respectively. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), PC-1, PC-2 and PC-3 are contributed about 98% of all data. Finally, PLS and SVM are two good multivariate analysis for prediction of drought with R2 0.95 and 0.98 respectively. The predicted model showed the severity of drought far away from the sea along the barren area in the southern part. Finally, it should be noted that NDVI, NDSI, SI, and NDWI were better indicators for tracking and assessing changes in drought. The results can be utilized to quickly evaluate data produced from remote sensing and water-related indices and make wise decisions. This study contributes to our understanding of droughts and sheds information on how ML technology could be used to monitor droughts.

T2  - Revista espanola de patologia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Anatomia Patologica y de la Sociedad Espanola de Citologia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Since sentinel lymph node examination became routine, findings of benign ectopic breast tissue in lymph nodes have increased. We report images of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in four lymph nodes in a 76-year-old woman with bilateral breast carcinoma. The right lumpectomy showed intermixed invasive lobular and ductal carcinoma, plus DCIS. 19 nodes were isolated in the axillary lymphadenectomy, 4 of which displayed solid and cribriform DCIS. Myosin and p63 immunohistochemical techniques were positive, suggesting an erroneous diagnosis of "metastatic DCIS". A further three cases of DCIS in lymph nodes have been previously reported, all with a distinct layer of myoepithelial cells with actin, myosin or p63. Biologically, these images of DCIS in lymph nodes are not credible and three major hypotheses have been proposed to explain these findings: Iatrogenic Mechanical Transport, Revertant DCIS, and primary DCIS of lymph nodes. We consider the first one the most plausible explanation. Our case is unique as several, rare findings are simultaneously observed. More new cases, together with additional immunohistochemical techniques and molecular testing on previous cases, are needed to find a definitive explanation of this histologic finding.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph node frozen section analysis in patients with early-stage cervical cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative SLN frozen section analysis compared with ultrastaging in patients with early-stage cervical cancer.Methods. A systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA checklist. MEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception until February 2023. The inclusion criteria were patients with early-stage cervical cancer (2018 FIGO stage I-II), consisting of the histological subtype squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma (>= 90% of the patients in each study), who underwent SLN detection (with any tracer) and intraoperative frozen section followed by SLN ultrastaging. Randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective observational studies were considered. The detection rates and measures of diagnostic accuracy were pooled using a random effects univariate model. A preplanned subgroup meta-analysis was conducted, with isolated tumor cells excluded as positive lymph nodes. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023397147).Results. The search identified 190 articles, with 153 studies considered potentially eligible after removing duplicates. Fourteen studies met the selection criteria, including a total of 1720 patients. Seven studies were retrospective, and the other seven were prospective. Frozen section analysis detected 159 of 292 (54.5%) patients with lymph node metastases. In 281 patients the type of volume metastasis was reported: 1 of 41 (2.4%) patients had isolated tumor cells, 21 of 78 (26.9%) patients had micrometastases, and 133 of 162 (82.1%) patients had macrometastases. The pooled sensitivity of intraoperative SLN frozen section analysis was 65% (95% CI, 51-77%) for macrometastases, micrometastases, and isolated tumor cells. When we excluded patients with isolated tumor cells, the pooled sensitivity increased to 72% (95% CI, 60-82%). Conclusion. SLN frozen section detects 65% of lymph node metastases compared with SLN ultrastaging and may prevent unnecessary radical surgery in some patients with early-stage cervical cancer.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Assessment of wetland landscape changes based on landscape metrics and trophic state index (case study: Anzali International Wetland)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands play an important role in conserving biodiversity, the hydrosphere's equilibrium, and the maintenance of daily livelihood; therefore, the trophic process hastens the succession procedure in them, resulting in structural changes in the landscape. The study aimed to monitor and investigate the impact of the trophic procedure on landscape structural changes in Anzali Wetland, specifically domains related to vegetation canopy and water bodies, over 24 years. The TSI (trophic state index) of the Anzali Wetland, a vital habitat in the south of the Caspian Sea, was estimated by using the Carlson TSI for 1994, 2002, 2014, and 2018. Based on satellite data for these years, the structural landscape changes were also measured using metrics such as the number of patches (NumP), class area (CA), mean patch size (MPS), and mean shape index (MSI) of the measured patch using in Patch Analyst. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was then used to calculate the correlation between the two variables of trophic index modifications and landscape metrics. Results showed that the TSI of the wetland touched 59.51 in 1994 and then reached 65.10 in 2018. Its water body area, which was 5283.90 ha in 1994, decreased to 4183.92 ha in 2018, indicating the greatest decrease in the area from 2002 to 2018. In addition, the maximum area of vegetation canopy in 2018 was 11696.31 ha. The trophic exhibited a positive correlation of 0.8 with the area of the vegetation canopy and a positive correlation of 0.4 with the NumP of the vegetation canopy. It also had an inverse correlation of -0.4 with the area and NumP of the water body. Based on the study findings, changes in the trophic level of Anzali Wetland can be regarded as a direct factor influencing the vegetation canopy and water body.

TI  - Use of remote sensing techniques to assess water storage variations and flood-related inflows for the Hawizeh wetland
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data are becoming readily available. This has made the use of remote sensing to monitor and quantify spatiotemporal changes in surface waters feasible and efficient. In this paper, remote sensing techniques based on spectral indices were used to assess the changes in submerged areas and water storage in the Hawizeh marsh (south of Iraq) during the 2019 flood. Two water indices, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), were used for this purpose. Water indices have been frequently utilized to detect water bodies because of their particular spectral properties in the visible and infrared spectrum. Non-measured flood-related flows into the marsh have also been estimated by applying the water balance approach. The accuracy assessment of the water areas extracted by the remote sensing indices showed an acceptable degree of reliability, which reflected positively on the water inflow calculations. As the Hawizeh is a transboundary marsh shared by Iraq and Iran, remote sensing techniques allowed for the estimation of difficult-to-measure inflows from the Iranian side. The results of the water balance revealed that the inflows from the Iranian side to the marsh during the 5 months of the flood made up approximately 41.2% of the total water volume entering the marsh. The study demonstrated the feasibility of using uncomplicated water extraction methods that depend on remote sensing data to monitor hydrological changes in the Hawizeh wetland that lack sufficient data.

TI  - Multi-source data analysis to assess the past and present kinematics of the Pisciotta Deep-Seated Gravitational Slope Deformation (southern Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although Deep-Seated Gravitational Slope Deformations are well-known in the literature, their evolution and kinematics are still poorly understood. Their behavior is often complex and characterized by small movements associated with steady-state creep, alternating with periods of stasis, or accelerating downslope movements that, in some cases, could result in sudden and catastrophic failure events. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is often required. In this work, we shed light on the complex geometry and kinematics of the Pisciotta DSGSD, a deep-seated roto-translational sliding involving structurally complex turbiditic rock mass and interacting with man-made infrastructures. To reveal the geometrical features and the spatial and temporal behavior of the analyzed phenomenon, a multidisciplinary investigation was performed. Typical DSGSD landforms were mapped employing in-situ surveys, aided by stereoscopic analysis of historical aerial images and high-resolution dronebased mapping. Structural data and ancillary ground-based surveys revealed the presence of a highly weathered and folded turbiditic sequence, with competent sandstone and calcarenite units alternated by tectonically disrupted, weak argillite and mudrock layers. Remote sensing measurements from optical imagery and Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite data assessed the DSGSD's past and current kinematics, allowing to distinguish a prefailure period with accelerating displacement rates, a failure period with maximum displacement rates, and a current post-failure period with decelerating displacement rates. Analytical modeling established the deep reach (up to 85 m) of the studied DSGSD as it allowed the estimation of its bottom surface and volume, as verified by available boreholes and inclinometric measurements. Furthermore, numerical modeling outcomes highlighted how the progressive weakening and alteration of the DSGSD material, in conjunction with changes in groundwater dynamics, serve as the primary mechanisms driving the observed kinematics. The models also revealed the intricate interaction between the DSGSD and the neighboring infrastructures.

TI  - Monitoring and classification of karst rocky desertification with Landsat 8 OLI images using spectral indices, multi-endmember spectral mixture analysis and support vector machine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Karst Rocky Desertification (KRD) is the reduction of vegetative productivity of this land with the release of bedrock as a result of the full or partial transportation of the fertile soil through natural processes and human activities in karst landscapes. The purpose of this study is to reveal the effectiveness of Remote Sensing methods in monitoring, mapping and evaluating KRD. Landsat 8 OLI images were used to carry out these procedures. In monitoring this process, Karst Bare Rock Index (KBRI), Normalized Difference Rock Index (NDRI), Carbonate Rock Index 2 (CRI2), Normalized Difference Build-Up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Dimidiate Pixel Model (DPM), Multi Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used from the spectral indices. In order to determine KRD with spectral indexes, a strong linear relationship was tested between some indices such as DPM (R2=0,79), KBRI (R2=0,66), and NDBI (R2=0,64) and field measurements. In order to evaluate the results obtained, KRD was divided into 4 basic classes such as none, mild, moderate, and severe. According to these classification levels, it was determined that the SVM method had the highest accuracy (Kappa=0.88). According to the classification results, which have the highest accuracy in the study area, the rate of areas undergoing severe karst desertification is 40%, moderate desertification process is 17%, mild desertification is 14% and non-desertification is 29%. In the study, it was concluded that the KRD strengthens as one goes from south to north and from west to east in the research area. This study points out KRD is one of the effective ecosystem problems in the Mediterranean region, Turkiye.

T2  - Environmental monitoring and assessment
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The first case of COVID-19 in Iran was reported on February 25, 2020, leading in the implementation of a government-mandated lockdown as the virus gradually spread to different cities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air quality in Ahvaz city by utilizing Sentinel 5 images and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Specifically, the concentrations of air pollutants, including CO, NO2, SO2, and HCHO, during the COVID-19 pandemic from May 10 to June 01, 2021, were examined. Also, they were compared to the same period in 2019. Additionally, the influence of meteorological parameters, such as wind speed and precipitation, on pollutant concentrations during the pandemic and in the pre-pandemic year of 2019 were investigated. The results revealed a significant decrease in the concentrations of NO2 (13.7%), CO (6.1%), SO2 (28%), and HCHO (9.5%) in Ahvaz during the study period in 2021 compared to the same period in 2019. Statistical analyses indicated no significant changes in wind speed and precipitation between the COVID-19 pandemic and the pre-pandemic period in 2019. Therefore, the impact of these parameters on the observed changes in pollutant concentrations can be disregarded. It is clear that the COVID-19 epidemic and the subsequent lockdown measures, including traffic restrictions and business closures, played a crucial role in significantly reducing air pollutant concentrations in Ahvaz.

TI  - Quantifying the landscape changes within and outside the Dachigam National Park, Kashmir Himalaya, India using observations and models
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas are the cornerstone of biodiversity and serve as a haven for biodiversity conservation. However, due to immense anthropic pressures and ongoing changes in climate, the protected reserves are under immense threat. Human interference through land system changes is a major precusor of fragmentation of landscapes resulting in the decline of Himalayan biodiversity. In this context, this research assessed land use land cover changes (LULCCs) and fragmentation within and outside the Dachigam National Park (DNP) using remote sensing data, GIS-based models and ground truth over the past 55 years (1965-2020). Landscape Fragmentation Tool (LFT) helped to compute edge effect, patchiness, perforation and core areas. The Land Change Modeller (LCM) of IDRISI TerrSet was used for simulating the future LULC for the years 2030, 2050, 2700 and 2100. The analysis of LULCCs showed that built-up and aquatic vegetation expanded by 326% and 174%, respectively in the vicinity of the DNP. The area under agriculture, scrub and pasture decreased primarily due to intensified land use activities. Within the DNP, the area under forest cover declined by 7%. A substantial decrease was observed in the core zone both within (39%) and outside (30%) the DNP indicative of fragmentation of natural habitats. LCM analysis projected 10% increase in the built-up extents besides forests, shrublands and pastures. This knowledge generated in this study shall form an important baseline for understanding and characterising the human-wildlife relationship, initiating long-term ecological research (LTER) on naturally vegetated and aquatic ecosystems (primarily Dal Lake) of the region.

TI  - Dynamics of a fish-killing dinoflagellate<i> Karenia</i><i> mikimotoi</i> red-tide captured by composite data sources
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Bloom dynamics of K. mikimotoi during summer 2015 in the Yatsushiro Sea, Japan, which caused fish mortality was studied using field survey data and satellite data. The bloom initially formed in the western area, subsequently appeared in the southern area, and finally expanded to the central area. The field-survey detected the horizontal displacement of the bloom which was also assessed by satellite data. Acoustic backscattering intensity of the current meter captured the modulation of the diurnal vertical migration of K. mikimotoi. After the modulation, K. mikimotoi distributed at a shallower depth in the nighttime than the period prior to the modulation. Factors affecting the modulation are suggested to be the continuous low nutrient conditions. Synchronization between the shallowed distribution during the nighttime and the wind driven surface northeastward current enabled a sudden horizontal transport toward the central area. Satellite and acoustic backscattering data are beneficial subsidiary tools for detecting blooms.

TI  - Advancing peatland vegetation mapping by spaceborne imaging spectroscopy
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands contribute to a wide range of ecosystem services. They play an important role as carbon sinks in their natural state, but when they are drained, they cause carbon emissions. Rewetting drained peatlands is required to reduce carbon emissions and create new carbon sinks. However, drained peatlands are commonly used as grassland or croplands; therefore, alternative agriculture schemes are required following rewetting. Paludiculture, i.e., agriculture on wet and rewetted peatlands, is an option in these areas after rewetting to produce biomass sustainably. Monitoring of peatland management is challenging, yet needed to ensure a successful rewetting and plantation of, e.g., Phragmites australis and Typha spp., two plants which are commonly used in paludiculture. Remote sensing is an excellent tool for monitoring the vegetation composition of vast rewetted peatland regions. However, because many peatland species have similar spectral characteristics, such monitoring is ideally based on high-spatial, high-temporal hyperspectral images. Data that complies with all these requirements does not exist on a regular basis. Therefore, we assessed the potential for mapping peatland vegetation communities in the Peene and Trebel river basins of the federal state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, using multi-date hyperspectral (PRISMA) data. We used regression-based unmixing to map fractions of different peatland vegetation classes. Results were analyzed with regard to the contribution of multi-date observations and, in comparison, to multispectral datasets (Landsat-8/Sentinel-2). Our results showed that different classes are best mapped at different observation dates. The multi-date hyperspectral datasets produced less Mean Absolute Error (MAE =16.4%) than the single-date hyperspectral images (& UDelta;MAE + 1%), with high accuracies for all classes of interest. Compared to the results obtained with multispectral data from similar acquisition dates and annual spectral-temporal metrics (STM), the results from hyperspectral data were always clearly superior (& UDelta;MAE + 4%). Besides the superior performance during comparisons, our results also indicate that information that can be derived from the hyperspectral data with the regression-based unmixing goes clearly beyond that of discrete classification. With more hyperspectral sensors coming up and an expected higher availability of multidata hyperspectral imagery, these data can be expected to play a bigger role in the future monitoring of peatlands.

TI  - Combining chemical, bioanalytical and predictive tools to assess persistence, seasonality, and sporadic releases of organic micropollutants within the urban water cycle.
T2  - Water research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Using a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method with large volume direct injection and quantitation via isotope dilution, we evaluated the presence of 55 organic micropollutants in wastewater effluents, and locations within the Bow River and Elbow River watersheds in and around the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. In addition to establishing baseline micropollutant data for water utility operations, our study aimed to enhance our understanding of micropollutant behavior in the urban water cycle, assess the contributions of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to downstream receiving waters, explain the potential causes of total estrogenicity measured using the yeast-estrogen screen assay (YES), and prioritize a subset of substances for continuous monitoring. With data spanning 48 months and 95 river km, our results indicate the extensive persistence of metformin (antidiabetic), seasonality of N,N‑diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET, insect repellant), O-desmethylvenlafaxine (antidepressant metabolite), and sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic) in source waters, and sporadic detections of a well-known perfluoroalkyl substance (PFOA). The seasonality of pharmaceuticals at the sentinel downstream monitoring site appeared to coincide with river dilution while that of DEET was likely attributable to peak usage during the warmer months. Steroidal estrogens were rarely detected in wastewater effluents although total estrogenicity via YES was evident, suggesting the presence of less potent but more abundant non-steroidal estrogens (e.g., flame retardants, bisphenols, and phthalates). A conservative mass balance analysis suggests that the largest WWTP (serving a population of >1 million) consistently contributed the highest load of micropollutants, with the exception of metformin, which appeared to be influenced by a smaller WWTP (serving 115,000) that operates a different activated sludge process. We consider metformin, sucralose, diclofenac, and venlafaxine as more effective conservative tracers of wastewater pollution due to their notably higher concentrations and persistence in the Bow River compared to carbamazepine and caffeine, respectively. Finally, hierarchical clustering revealed a close association between E. coli and caffeine, supporting the use of caffeine as an indicator of short-term, untreated anthropogenic inputs. Overall, this study yields valuable insights on the presence, behavior, and sources of organic micropollutants in the urban water cycle and identifies indicators of anthropogenic impacts that are useful for prioritizing future monitoring campaigns in Calgary and elsewhere.

AB  - The satellite data, include Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), Landsat-8 (OLI), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), were processed and interpreted for creating an integrated geospatial map of the geomorphic indices (GI) of Wadi Hagul Basin (WHB). The present study is considered new, useful, and valuable in northwest of Gulf of Suez region to evaluate active tectonics using SRTM resulting drainage network and GI. Where fairly slight studies on active tectonics recognized on GI were prepared in the investigated area. The GI includes; Ratio of valley floor width to valley height (V-f), Transverse topographic symmetry factor (T), Stream length-gradient index (S-L), Drainage basin shape (B-s), hypsometric integral (H-i), geomorphological landform and watershed analysis. Also, GI were integrated and combined with the seismic and structural lineaments intensities maps to create an integrated single index map. The morphotectonic geo-spatial distribution hazards map reveals that the high risky area is 82.75% of the total area, the moderate-risk area is 16.51%, and the low risky morph-tectonic area is 0.81%. Based on this map, it is necessary for planners and decision makers to extremely study attractive applicable action concerning the recommended mitigation measurements from this study to avoid any serious future problems in WHB and its surroundings areas.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Change Modulates Hydrological Flows and Water Supply to Gaborone Dam Catchment, Botswana
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the mechanism through which changes in land use and land cover (LULC) modulate hydrological flows is vital for water resource planning and management. To examine the impact of LULC change on the hydrology of the Gaborone Dam catchment within the upper Limpopo basin, where Notwane river is the major river within the catchment, three LULC maps for the years 1997, 2008, and 2017 were established based on a mosaic of Landsat 5 for 1997 and 2008 and Landsat 8 for 2017. The 10 m-resolution Version 200 ESA World Land Cover Map for 2021 is used as a ground truth to train the random forest (RF) classifier to identify land cover classes from Landsat 8 imageries of 2021 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API. The overall accuracy/kappa coefficient of the RF classifier is 0.99/0.99 for the training and 0.73/0.68 for the validation data sets, which indicate excellent and substantial agreements with the ground truth, respectively. With this confidence in the LULC classification, the impact of LULC change on the hydrological flow within the catchment was estimated by employing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and indicator of hydrological alteration (IHA). The SWAT model calibration and validation were first performed, and the ability of the model to capture the observed stream flow was found to be good. The LULC maps from Landsat images during the 1997-2017 period show a decrease in forests and shrubland in contrast to an increase in pasture land. The expansion of pasture and cropland and the reduction in forests and shrubland led to a decline in the amount of evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. Furthermore, the LULC change also caused a reduction in low flow during dry periods and an increase in high flow during the rainy season. The findings clearly demonstrate that LULC changes can affect the water table by altering soil water recharge capacity. The study highlighted the importance of LULC for catchment water resource management through land use planning to regulate the water level in the Gaborone Dam against the impact of climate change and growing water demands by the city of Gaborone due to population growth.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Persian Gulf is surrounded by the most active dust source regions of the world. Every year, millions of tons of dust are deposited in this area causing significant adverse effects. This research aimed to fill the gap in the field of dust impact quantification regarding different and important regions in the Persian Gulf. We evaluated aerosol optical thickness (AOT) as dust, chlorophyll a (Chl a) as phytoplankton biomass, sea surface temperature (SST), and particulate organic carbon (POC) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to quantify and analyze the impacts of dust. According to dust frequency maps over 21 years, 4 critical regions were selected including the Northern, Central, and Southern regions of the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz. Slightly lower Chl a values were noted in the southern region and Strait of Hormuz compared to the Northern and Central regions. The Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's slope estimator, which can determine trend parameters, were used to analyze 4 selected regions using 8 days, monthly, and yearly averaged data. The results of the MK test showed a significant positive trend for SST and a significant negative trend for POC. AOT and Chl a trends varied based on their locations. The cross-correlation test with a time lag showed maximum correlations between Chl a and dust (AOT) with a delay of 6-7 months. Also, to quantify the impacts of dust on phytoplankton biomass, R2 and analysis of variance (ANOVA) regression were used for data with a 6-7-month time lag. The results showed that the contribution of dust in the amount of Chl a variation was about 10 %-20 %. This study showed that the simultaneous use of remote sensing and statistical methods could provide necessary and timely warnings (regarding management) to prevent algal blooms and aquatic loss in this important and strategic area.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel Lymph Node Drainage Patterns in Early-Stage Oral Cavity Cancer.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Surgery is the mainstay for squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (OSCC), which includes an elective neck dissection. To limit morbidity of neck dissection, sentinel lymph biopsy (SLNB) has been introduced to identify patients at risk for nodal metastasis. While the data has thoroughly examined the relationship between SLNB in patients with unilateral lymph node drainage, little information exists on the rate of bilateral lymph node drainage patterns in lateralized OSCC. This study sought to examine the incidence of bilateral lymph node drainage patterns using sentinel node mapping in early stage OSCC.MATERIALS/METHODS: This retrospective review of the electronic medical records at Rush University Medical Center focused on patients who underwent a SLNB based on CPT codes 38724, 38900, 38542, and 38510. From this cohort, we limited our analysis to patients with primary clinical T1 or T2 OSCC. Primary outcome was the rate of bilateral nodal drainage on sentinel node mapping based on the SPECT-CT.RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were diagnosed with clinical T1/T2N0 OSCC and underwent a SLNB with SPECT-CT. (1) From the cohort of 54, 15 patients (27.78%) had bilateral sentinel lymph node drainage on SPECT-CT, while 39 patients (72.22%) had unilateral sentinel lymph node drainage. (2) Eleven patients (73.3%) from the bilateral drainage cohort completed appropriate SLN mapping with bilateral nodal assessments. (3) Four patients who had SPECT-CT evidence of bilateral drainage completed unilateral nodal assessment alone. (4) Of the patients with bilateral nodal assessment, 1 (9.1%) patient had a positive sentinel node on the ipsilateral side, 2 (18.2%) were found to have a positive sentinel node in the contralateral neck. (5) Overall, 3 patients (20%) had local-regional recurrence in the bilateral sentinel lymph drainage cohort.CONCLUSION: Management of early-stage OSCC has evolved to include SLN mapping and biopsy. Our results found that contralateral drainage occurs in 18% of our patients with 2 patients having positive sentinel node in the contralateral neck. Therefore, the rate of contralateral drainage is not clinically insignificant and this result furthers the importance of lymphatic mapping in the early-stage OSCC treatment algorithm.

TI  - Parametric Test of the Sentinel 1A Persistent Scatterer- and Small Baseline Subset-Interferogram Synthetic Aperture Radar Processing Using the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers for Practical Landslide Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The landslide monitoring method that uses the Sentinel 1A Interferogram Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) through the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) method is a complimentary but complex procedure without exact guidelines. Hence, this paper delivered a parametric test by examining the optimal settings of the Sentinel 1A Persistent Scatterer (PS)- and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS)-InSAR using the StaMPS compared to the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in landslide cases. This study first revealed parameters with the suggested values, such as amplitude dispersion used to describe amplitude stability, ranging from 0.47 to 0.48 for PS and equal to or more than 0.6 for SBAS in WuWanZai, Ali Mt. The study further examined the suggested values for other factors, including the following: unwrap grid size to re-estimate the size of the grid; unwrap gold n win as the Goldstein filtering window to reduce the noise; and unwrap time win as the smoothing window (in days) for estimating phase noise distributions between neighboring pixels. Furthermore, the study substantiated the recommended settings in the Woda and Shadong landslide cases with the GNSS, inferring that the SBAS has adequate feasibility in practical landslide monitoring.

TI  - Evaluation of Daily Patient Position Accuracy and Calculation of Setup Errors with Skin Markers and Surface-Guided Radiotherapy (SGRT) in Breast Cancer.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): This study aims to compare the inter-fractional patient positioning errors between the use of skin markers and SGRT in patients receiving breast radiotherapy. It also includes calculating the inter- and intra-fractional PTV margins required for free breathing (FB) and deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) techniques due to setup uncertainties.MATERIALS/METHODS: The treatment data of a total of 2209 fractions from 80 patients who received whole breast or chest wall radiotherapy at an institution between March 2021 and December 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. In the first group of patients, the skin markers placed in the Computed Tomography (CT) scan with the FB technique were aligned and positioned with the room lasers in the Elekta Versa HD, and plan-specific shifts were made. The optical surface scanning procedure was applied to the second group of patients with the Sentinel system for FB or DIBH techniques in simulation. Patients were positioned for treatment by matching reference surface images with real-time images from the Catalyst HD surface imaging system. Positions of all patients were verified with kilovoltage or cone-beam CT imaging systems, and 3D shift vectors were recorded daily. To compare both setup methods, PTV margins including mean positioning shifts (MPS), the vector length of the shifts and setup errors were calculated from van Herk's formulas.RESULTS: The MPS of all patients using skin markers were 0.20±0.85 cm, 0.32±1.55 cm, and 0.18±0.44 cm in the vertical, longitudinal and lateral directions, respectively. Then, these values given above were found to be 0.12±0.15 cm, 0.06±0.17 cm, 0.07±0.23 cm for FB using Catalyst HD, and 0.34±0.30 cm, 0.29±0.26 cm, 0.23±0.30 cm for DIBH. In different setup techniques, no statistically significant difference was found between the 3D shift vectors in any direction with Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p>0.05). The mean standard deviation values in all directions were calculated as 1.22 cm and 0.61 cm, respectively, in patients using skin markers and SGRT.CONCLUSION: This study indicates a significant difference between the positioning shifts of patients positioned with skin markers and SGRT. The surface imaging system is an advantageous non-invasive method that increases setup accuracy and reproducibility in breast radiotherapy.

TI  - Quantifying climate variability and regional anthropogenic influence on vegetation dynamics in northwest India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the spatio-temporal dynamics and mechanisms underlying vegetation cover in Haryana State, India, and implications thereof, we obtained MODIS EVI imagery together with CHIRPS rainfall and MODIS LST at annual, seasonal and monthly scales for the period spanning 2000 to 2022. Additionally, MODIS Potential Evapotranspiration (PET), Ground Water Storage (GWS), Soil Moisture (SM) and nighttime light datasets were compiled to explore their spatial relationships with vegetation and other selected environmental parameters. Non-parametric statistics were applied to estimate the magnitude of trends, along with correlation and residual trend analysis to quantify the relative influence of Climate Change (CC) and Human Activities (HA) on vegetation dynamics using Google Earth Engine algorithms. The study reveals regional contrasts in trends that are evidently related to elevation. An annual increasing trend in rainfall (21.3 mm/decade, p < 0.05), together with augmented vegetation cover and slightly cooler (-0.07 <degrees>C/decade) LST is revealed in the high-elevation areas. Meanwhile, LST in the plain regions exhibit a warming trend (0.02 degrees C/decade) and decreased in vegetation and rainfall, accompanied by substantial reductions in GWS and SM related to increased PET. Linear regression demonstrates a strongly significant relationship between rainfall and EVI (R2 = 0.92), although a negative relationship is apparent between LST and vegetation (R2 = -0.83). Additionally, increased LST in the lowelevation parts of the study area impacted PET (R2 = 0.87), which triggered EVI loss (R2 = 0.93). Moreover, increased HA resulted in losses of 25.5 mm GSW and 1.5 mm SM annually. The relative contributions of CC and HA are shown to vary with elevation. At higher elevations, CC and HA contribute respectively 85% and 15% to the increase in EVI. However, at lower elevations, reduced EVI is largely (79%) due to human activities. This needs to be considered in managing the future of vulnerable socio-ecological systems in the state of Haryana.

TI  - Seasonal correlation of aerosols with soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and vegetation over Pakistan using remote sensing.
T2  - Heliyon
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Aerosols have a severe impact on the Earth's climate, human health, and ecosystem. To understand the impacts of aerosols on climate, human health, and the ecosystem we must need to understand the variability of aerosols and their optical properties. Therefore, we used Aqua-MODIS retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) (550nm) and Angstrom exponent (AE) (440/870) data to analyze the Spatio-temporal seasonal variability of aerosols and their relationship with different meteorological parameters over Pakistan from 2002 to 2021. High (>0.5) AOD values were observed during the summer season and low (<0.8) in the spring season. AE values were observed to be high (>1) in the northern regions of Pakistan indicating the dominance of fine mode particles during the winter season. Moreover, AOD showed a positive correlation with Relative Humidity (RH), Evapotranspiration, Wind speed (WS), and Temperature. On the other hand, it showed a negative correlation with Soil moisture (SM), Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and precipitation over Pakistan. Therefore, considering the outcomes of this study will help policymakers to understand the spatiotemporal variability of aerosols and their seasonal correlation with different meteorological parameters.

TI  - Remote Surveillance of Differential Deformation for Kazakhstan Offshore Kashagan Oilfield Using Microwave Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to assess differential vertical and horizontal deformations for the offshore Kashagan oilfield located in the Northern Caspian Sea. Sentinel-1 (SNT1) and COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images (9 January 2018-6 April 2022) were processed using persistent scatterer interferometric SAR (PS-InSAR) technique with further 2D decomposition of line-of-sight (LOS) measurements to differential vertical and horizontal deformations. Differential vertical deformation velocity was observed to be between -4 mm/y and 4 mm/y, whereas horizontal was between -4 mm/y and 5 mm/y during 2018-2022. However, it was possible to observe the spatial deformation patterns with the subsidence hotspots reaching differential cumulative vertical displacement of -20 mm from both satellite missions. PS-InSAR differential vertical deformation measurements derived from SNT1 and CSK satellite images showed identical spatial patterns with moderate agreement, whereas poor agreement was observed for differential horizontal deformations. The differential vertical deformation hotspots were observed for the oilfield areas installed on piles with obviously higher vulnerability to dynamic movements. Through this study, based on the interferometric measurements, marine geotechnical expert feedback, and no reported deformation-related incidents since 2013, it was possible to conclude that the Kashagan oilfield had not been impacted by significant differential vertical and horizontal deformations on the oilfield. However, since long-term GPS measurements were not accessible from the oilfield to be used as the reference for PS-InSAR measurements, we were not able to judge the long-term displacements of the entire oilfield or possible oscillations, even though it is built on the artificial island. Considering the broad range of PS-InSAR measurements using time-series radar images, the interferometric measurements could play a significant role in the prioritization of insitu risk assessment activities, operational cost reduction, strengthening of safety factors, and planning of further targeted insitu measurements.

TI  - Early Results of the French Multicenter, Randomized SHARE Trial Comparing Whole Breast Irradiation vs. Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation in Postmenopausal Women with Early-Stage Breast Cancer.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): The aim is to report toxicity and cosmetic outcomes at 3 and up to 9 years of follow-up of post-menopausal patients randomized to receive either standard whole breast irradiation (WBI), including hypofractionated options, versus accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI).MATERIALS/METHODS: From December 2010 to July 2015, 1006 patients were enrolled in 34 French centers. Among the whole population, 28 patients who did not meet the final selection criteria or withdrew consent were excluded leading to a modified intention to treat analysis dataset of 978 patients (WBI: n = 488; APBI: n = 490). Median age (65y) and tumor stage pT1 (99%) rates were similar in both arms. Patients had conservative surgery with clip placement in the tumor bed. Clear margins (> 2mm) were observed in 99% of the patients. In both arms, 96-97% of the patients had negative sentinel lymph node biopsy. The median time interval between surgery and radiotherapy was 57d in WBI vs 62d in APBI. WBI schedules consisted of 50 Gy in 25 fr+16 Gy (n = 212) or 40 Gy in 15 fr (n = 156) or 42.5 Gy in 16 fr (n = 120). APBI arm consisted of 38.5 Gy or 40 Gy in 10 fr, 2 fr/day. Overall, 94 patients from the APBI arm finally received standard WBI. For statistical considerations, SHARE trial, sponsored by UNICANCER (NCT01247233) is a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comparing APBI versus WBI in terms of local control as primary objective. Secondary endpoints were severe toxicity (NCI-CTCAE v4 grade ≥ 2), and cosmetic results. For both outcomes, we estimated the cumulative incidences (CI) using Kalbfleish and Prentice method, considering disease relapse, secondary cancer or death as competing events. Treatment effect (APBI vs WBI) was estimated by cause-specific Hazard Ratios (cs-HR) from Cox models.RESULTS: Median follow-up was 5.8y (range, 0.13-9.5). The number of deaths was 27, and the number of local relapses was 8. Among the 978 patients, 582 and 396 had finally WBI and APBI, respectively. The rates of post-operative hematoma, edema and infection were low: 8-9%, 2%, 3-2%, respectively. When considering any type of severe toxicity, we observed a significant reduction rate in APBI compared to WBI: cs-HR = 0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.61-0.88); p = 0.001, and 3-year CI of severe toxicity at 45% in WBI vs 36% in APBI arm. The difference was also in favor of APBI when considering breast skin toxicity alone: cs-HR = 0.55 (0.44-0.70), p<0.001 and 3-year CI at 36% in WBI vs 21% in APBI arm. Conversely, for breast other toxicities, WBI was found less toxic than APBI with a 3-year CI of 8% vs 15%, respectively. When considering cosmetic results, we observed no significant difference between the two arms in both evaluations by physicians and patients.CONCLUSION: Historically SHARE is the first APBI trial that included hypofractionated schedules in the standard arm. We report increased risk of severe toxicity and skin breast toxicity in standard arm as compared with APBI arm without any difference in terms of cosmetic results. Longer follow-up is needed.

TI  - Explaining risks and benefits of loco-regional treatments to patients
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Treatment for early-stage breast cancer is complex, requiring multidisciplinary care with a multitude of treatment options available for each patient. Coupled with the rising importance of shared decision-making, patient physician conversations are progressively more complicated. These conversations require frank disclosure of risks and benefits of the different treatment modalities in a way that is individualized for each patient and simple to understand. In most patients, breast conserving therapy with radiation should be presented as the gold standard local treatment given similar long-term and improved quality of life outcomes. De-escalation is currently at the forefront of research in loco-regional treatments, and further investigations are required to best determine the optimal patient populations for reduced sentinel lymph node sampling, omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy altogether and omission of radiation treatment. For future trials, better endpoints need to be established considering patient-centered outcomes as well as recurrence.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - The growing interest in religion and spirituality in the mental health field has not resulted in the latter being relieved of the binary (dualistic) worldview by which it remains hamstrung. The phenomenon of synchronicity began to receive attention in the 1950s, thanks to the work of C.G. Jung and Wolfgang Pauli. The issue of the therapeutic significance of synchronicity has received widespread scholarly attention but its implications for the mental health field are not limited to the therapeutic realm. That is, synchronicity intimates a non-dualistic cosmology that could affect a transformation of the mental health field toward wholeness.

TI  - An improved sea surface salinity retrieval algorithm for the Chinese Bohai Sea based on hyperspectral reconstruction and its applicability analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinity is regarded as a critical factor in marine systems. It is essential to monitor the long-term changes in sea surface salinity (SSS), as well as its short-term changes. Along these lines, in this work, to monitor the hourly, daily, and monthly changes in SSS in the Chinese Bohai Sea from GOCI (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) images, the feasibility of adopting a MERIS-based SSS retrieval algorithm was systematically explored to develop a GOCI-based SSS retrieval algorithm. To avoid the influence of the atmospheric correction error on Rrs(& lambda;) of the similar bands of MERIS (490 nm, 560 nm, and 665 nm) and those of GOCI (490 nm, 555 nm, and 660 nm), a simple linear regression model was applied based on the & rho;rs(& lambda;) matchup of the similar bands by using a hyperspectral reconstruction method with the measured & rho;(& lambda;). Despite the aerosol-based scattering errors, a more reasonable result (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.79 psu) over a long time scale was gained by the improved SSS retrieval algorithm, which was validated by the measured data (R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.72 psu). On top of that, the temporal and spatial distribution of SSS, as well as its diurnal, daily, and monthly changes, were then obtained in the Chinese Bohai Sea from April 2011 to March 2012. The impact of runoff on SSS was also analysed based on instant and lag correlations.

TI  - A hybrid machine learning-based multi-DEM ensemble model of river cross-section extraction: Implications on streamflow routing
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate representation of river channel and floodplain geometries is of prime concern for streamflow routing and flood inundation modelling under inadequate surveyed river cross-section data-condition, in many rivers across the globe. Due to global coverage and easy accessibility, the public domain medium resolution (1-arc second) DEMs such as SRTM, ASTER, and ALOS-AW3D30, with a linear vertical bias-correction approach, are widely used for hydrodynamic modelling of upland river networks. In this context, this study, for the first time, developed a hybrid machine learning-based Multi-DEM Ensemble (MDE) approach to simulate bias-corrected cross-sections using open source DEMs-extracted river cross-sections. Additionally, the hydraulic suitability of the simulated cross-sections and associated uncertainties were analysed. For this, the routing of streamflow and water level was performed using MIKE11-HD for a low-gradient flood-prone deltaic river basin of Eastern India (similar to 9000 km(2)) consisting of 19 river distributary systems. A comprehensive evaluation of the developed hybrid machine learning-based MDE models revealed an excellent performance of the Random Forest-Particle Swarm Optimisation-MDE (RF-PSO-MDE) model (NSE: 0.89-0.95; RMSE: 1.75-2.23 m) and Deep Neural Network-Particle Swarm Optimisation-MDE (DNN-PSO-MDE) model (NSE: 0.89-0.93; RMSE: 2.09-2.27 m) followed by the Support Vector Machine-Particle Swarm Optimisation-MDE (SVM-PSO-MDE) model (NSE: 0.87-0.92 and RMSE: 2.22-2.50 m). The MIKE11-HD simulations using RF-PSO-MDE and DNN-PSO-MDE model-simulated cross-sections were in close agreement with the observed streamflow and water level hydrographs, together with excellent matching of the flood peak, time to flood peak, and streamflow regimes. Predictive uncertainties analysis by the quantile regression technique confirmed an acceptable range of the Mean Prediction Interval and Percentage Interval Coverage Probability for the MIKE11-HD-RFMDE and MIKE11-HD-DNNMDE model variants including the MIKE11-HD-S model. Conclusively, the developed MDE models have potential for generating river cross-sections under sparse bathymetric conditions for the accurate simulation of streamflow and water level estimates using public domain digital elevation models.

TI  - Seasonality and directionality effects on radar backscatter are key to identify mountain forest types with Sentinel-1 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Systematic Sentinel-1 acquisitions provide an unprecedented stream of SAR data which allows to describe forest temporal dynamics in detail, a powerful tool for phenological studies and forest type classification. Several studies have explored the temporal variation of backscatter intensity in this context, but none considered that scattering directionality of canopies may vary. Said directionality is related to target-sensor geometry (incidence angle), forest height, and optical depth, associated with leaf dynamics. This study explicitly models backscatter dependance on incidence angle by fitting a regression model for each Sentinel-1 image and forest type. Residuals are accumulated across the time series and used to classify pixels into the most likely forest type using the smallest accumulated residual. This modelling and classification strategy has been applied over a North-South transect across the Carpathian Mountains, including forests with different physiognomies, from deciduous broadleaf forest, to mixed broadleaf-needleleaf and pure perennial needleleaf forests. These forests were classified with increasing detail, assessing the results against in-situ forest stand data and satellite-based land cover classification products (Copernicus Forest type layer). The accuracy of our classification was K > 0.8, OA > 90% when separating broadleaf from needleleaf forest types. The accuracy decreased (K > 0.6, OA > 79%) when also separating mixed forest types. Our results suggest that incorporating directional effects into classification models can improve SAR-based forest classification of temperate forest over mountainous terrain. Furthermore, models fitted between backscatter and incidence angle provide an estimate of n, a parameter related to optical depth that has been shown to vary with leaf dynamics. n could be used to improve image normalization in studies aiming at the estimation of biomass, or to aid the estimation of fast-changing parameters such as leaf area index or leaf moisture content.

TI  - A truly responsive listener is a self-verifying listener.
T2  - Current opinion in psychology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - We propose that accounts of responsiveness and responsive listening are tailored for people with positive self-views (high self-esteem, positive self-concepts). Researchers define responsiveness, in part, as valuing and appreciating a partners' attributes, accomplishments, and worldview. This emphasis on being positively validated overlooks the dangers of feeling overvalued, which are especially salient to those with low self-esteem and negative self-views. Self-verification motives lead people to feel closest to partners who see them as they see themselves. Responsiveness and positive validation may increase closeness among those with positive self-views, but these processes may backfire for those with negative self-views. We describe the challenges such individuals face in eliciting self-verification from partners and suggest ways of improving responsiveness to those with negative self-views.

TI  - Robustness assessment of hyperspectral image CNNs using metamorphic testing
T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has proven its utility in many critical domains, such as medicine, military, and ecology. Recently, we have been witnessing a surge in the adoption of deep learning (DL) techniques by the remote sensing community. DL-based classifiers, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been reported to achieve impressive predictive performances reaching 99% of accuracy when applied to hyperspectral images (HSIs), a high-dimensional type of remote sensing data. However, these deep learners are known to be highly sensitive to even slight perturbations of their high-dimensional raw inputs. In real-world contexts, concerns can be raised about how robust they really are against corner-case scenarios. When HSI classifiers are applied in safety-critical applications, ensuring an adequate level of robustness is crucial to prevent unexpected system behaviors. Yet, there are few studies dealing with their robustness, nor are RGB-testing methods able to cover the HSI-specific challenges. This led us to propose a systematic testing method to assess the robustness of the CNNs trained to classify HSIs. First, we elaborate domain-specific metamorphic transformations that simulate naturally-occurring distortions of remote sensing HSIs. Then, we leverage metaheuristic search algorithms to optimize the fitness of synthetically-distorted inputs to stress the weaknesses of the on-testing CNN, while remaining in compliance with domain expert requirements, in order to preserve the semantic of the generated inputs. Relying on our metamorphic testing method, we assess the robustness of established and novel CNNs for HSI classification, and demonstrate their failure, on average, in 25% of the produced test cases. Furthermore, we fine-tuned the tested CNNs on training data augmented with these failure-revealing metamorphic transformations. Results show that the fined-tuning successfully fixed at least 90% of the CNN weaknesses, with less than 1% of degradation in the original predictive performance, outperforming the common iterative gradient-based adversarial attack, namely, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD).

TI  - Investigating High-Resolution Spatial Wave Patterns on the Canadian Beaufort Shelf Using Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery at Herschel Island, Qikiqtaruk, Yukon, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic is experiencing the greatest increase in air temperature on Earth. This significant climatic change is leading to a significant positive trend of increasing wave heights and greater coastal erosion. This in turn effects local economies and ecosystems. Increasing wave energy is one of the main drivers of this alarming trend. However, the data on spatial and temporal patterns of wave heights in the Arctic are either coarse, interpolated or limited to point measurements. The aim of this study is to overcome this shortcoming by using remote sensing data. In this study, the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite TerraSAR-X (TS-X) and TanDEM-X (TD-X) imagery are used to obtain sea state information with a high spatial resolution in Arctic nearshore waters in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. From the entire archive of the TS-X/TD-X StripMap mode with coverage around 30 km x 50 km acquired between 2009 and 2020 around Herschel Island, Qikiqtaruk (HIQ), all the ice-free scenes were processed. The resulting dataset of 175 collocated scenes was used to map the significant wave height (Hs) and to link spatial and temporal patterns to local coastal processes. Sea state parameters are estimated in raster format with a 600 m step using the empirical algorithm CWAVE_EX. The statistics of the Hs were aggregated according to spatial variability, seasonality and wind conditions. The results show that the spatial wave climate is clearly related to the dominant wind regime and seasonality. For instance, the aggregation of all the scenes recorded in July between 2009 and 2020 results in an average of 0.82 m Hs, while in October the average Hs is almost 0.40 m higher. The analysis by wind direction shows that fetch length and wind speed are likely the most important variables influencing the spatial variability. A larger fetch under NW conditions results in a mean wave height of 0.92 m, while waves generated under ESE conditions are lower at 0.81 m on average.

TI  - Investigating mangrove canopy phenology in coastal areas of China using time series Sentinel-1/2 images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests with high vegetation productivity play crucial roles in the coastal blue carbon ecosystem. Accurate monitoring of mangrove canopy phenology is essential to improve the survival rate of restoration plantings and maintain the health and sustainability of mangrove ecosystems. Remote sensing technology has been commonly used for monitoring vegetation phenology, while there remain knowledge gaps in exploring the remotely-sensed phenology of mangrove forests in coastal China. In this study, we investigated the phenological characteristics of two typical mangrove sites in coastal China using remote sensing indices based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series during 2016-2020, compared the performances of mangrove phenology detection across different remote sensing indices and spatial scales, and explored the influences of environmental factors based on meteorological data. The results demonstrated that enhanced vegetation index (EVI), red-edge band index (NDRE2), phenology index (NDPI), and radar vegetation index (RVI) were efficient in characterizing mangrove phenological trajectories. Sentinel-2 data can precisely describe the phenological characteristics of mangroves and has the highest correlation with ground-observed phenology data (r = -0.581), when compared to Landsat-8 and MODIS data. The meteorological factors of precipitation, humidity, and wind speed mainly led to the differences in mangrove phenology across the two study sites. This finding can improve our understanding of the phenological characteristics of mangrove forests in coastal China, which facilitates local governments to develop appropriate mangrove restoration and management policies.

TI  - Dosimetry Comparison of Incidental Irradiation to the Low Axilla in Whole Breast Irradiation Using IMRT and IMPT Therapy.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): It has been hypothesized that incidental dose to low axilla contributes to regional control in patients receiving whole breast irradiation (WBI), especially in patients with limited metastatic sentinel nodes who were spared from subsequent axillary dissection. We aimed to compare axillary dose between intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and intensity-modulated proton radiotherapy (IMPT).MATERIALS/METHODS: Dosimetric comparisons between IMRT and IMPT were conducted in 15 patients treated with WBI without planned regional node irradiation (RNI). The prescribed dose was 40.05 Gy (RBE)/15 Fx. Axillary lymph nodes levels I, II (ALN I, ALN II) and rotter's lymph nodes (RN) were contoured and evaluated.RESULTS: The dose to the axilla was generally low for IMPT, with mean dose to ALN I, ALN II, and RN of 896.31, 194.64, and 2111.58 cGy (RBE), respectively. The mean V90% and V50% of ALN I was higher for IMRT (11.5 cm3, 22.9% of structure volume, p < 0.0001; 36.1 cm3, 66.6%, p < 0.0001) compared to IMPT (1.1 cm3, 2.0%; 8.1cm3, 15.9%). Similar finding was found in other low axilla. Mean dose to total ALN caudal to axillary vein was 936.6 cGy (RBE) in IMPT compared to 2407.3 cGy in IMRT (p < 0.0001). Within all substructures of axilla, mean dose to RN was the highest, but it remains lower in IMPT than in IMRT [2111.58 cGy (RBE) versus 3510.88 cGy, p < 0.0001].CONCLUSION: WBI treated with IMPT leads to a significant reduction of axilla dose compared to IMRT. In clinical scenarios like Z0011 or likewise requiring incidental irradiation to the low axilla without additional RNI, contouring should be modified based on individual risk.

TI  - Local buckling of high strength steel welded cruciform-section columns under axial compression
T2  - STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, the experiment of welded cruciform-section columns fabricated from high strength steel (HSS) with the yield strength of 550 MPa subjected to axial compression is performed, and the local buckling behavior including failure modes, local buckling load, and the ultimate load is investigated. Two different failure modes, such as the local buckling of plates and the torsion of column, are found, and the width-to-thickness ratio (WTR) of the flange significantly affects the local buckling load and the stress ratio of & sigma;cr/fy. The ultimate stress of the cruciform-section column decreases as the WTR of plates increases. A finite element method for predicting the mechanical behavior of HSS welded cruciform-section columns is developed using ANSYS. New limit for the WTR of plates in HSS welded cruciform-section columns is suggested. AISC 360-16 is conservative for estimating for the ultimate load of HSS welded cruciform-section columns. A new model modified from AISC 360-16 is proposed, and it makes good agreement with experimental and numerical results. Reliability analysis for AISC 360-16 and the proposed model is carried out in accordance with EN 1990.

TI  - Experimental and numerical study of residual stresses in 550 MPa high strength steel welded angle sections
T2  - STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Residual stresses caused by non-uniform cooling after welding significantly affects the mechanical properties of welding members. In this work, the sectioning method is used to investigate the residual stresses in four weldedangle section with the yield strength of 550 MPa (fy). The maximum residual tensile stresses locating at the welding zone are close to the yield strength, and the maximum residual compressive stresses distributed on the middle of plates are around 0.40 fy. The residual stresses distributed in welded-angle section are then observed using finite element method (FEM), which is validated by experimental results, and the influences of several parameters on the residual stresses are discussed. The maximum residual compressive stresses decreases with the increase of the width-to-thickness ratio, b/t, and the tensile residual stresses have no obvious relations with the ratio of b/t. The increase of the yield strength will lead to the increase of residual tensile stresses near the welding region, but its increase has insignificant on the ratio of the residual tensile stresses to the yield strength of steel grade. A distribution model for HSS (i.e., Q460, Q550, and Q690) welded angle section is presented, and it agrees well with data from the experiment and FEM.

TI  - QLSU (QGIS Linear Spectral Unmixing) Plugin: An open source linear spectral unmixing tool for hyperspectral & multispectral remote sensing imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental monitoring studies including land surface processes require precise and up-to-date land use and land cover (LULC) information and therefore remote sensing data/techniques are widely used and preferred in land cover mapping due to its synoptic view and high temporal resolution capabilities. In general, derivation of LULC information from remote sensing imagery is accomplished by utilizing pixel based image classification algorithms. But unlike traditional image classification, linear spectral unmixing technique offers sub-pixel level land cover information. In this paper QLSU(QGIS Linear Spectral Unmixing), an open source, easy-to-use graphical interface tool implemented as plugin in QGIS is introduced. The QLSU plugin is developed in Python allowing researchers who do not have any experience in programming to easily perform linear spectral unmixing on remote sensing imagery. A case study is conducted both on real and synthetic images in order to demonstrate the use of the plugin and evaluate its results.

TI  - Improving yield prediction based on spatio-temporal deep learning approaches for winter wheat: A case study in Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately and timely predicting yield and identifying its drivers are crucial for adjusting agricultural interventions, thereby responding to climate change and ensuring food security. Winter wheat phenology exhibited pronounced temporal and spatial variations at the county level in Jiangsu province. This study constructed a robust long short-term memory (LSTM) model that incorporates multiple data sources, including meteorological parameters, soil attributes, terrain characteristics, remote sensing data, and heterogeneous wheat phenology, aiming at forecasting the county-level wheat yield from year 2005 to 2020, with an emphasis on different precipitation year-types. The results demonstrated that the LSTM model could explain 71% of yield variations because of its ability to deal with time cumulative effects and high-dimensional data. Its performance outperformed that of machine learning algorithms, even in a normal year (RMSE = 0.26 t/ha) and an extreme year (RMSE = 0.29-0.33 t/ha). Time-series data (meteorological factors and vegetation indices), soil attributes, as well as topographic data that capture spatial and temporal heterogeneity, can achieve accurate wheat prediction approximately three months before harvest. Feature importance analysis showed meteorological factors, especially precipitation, are the most important drivers for yield prediction. This study developed a promising and scalable framework for spatio-temporal yield prediction by integrating available multi-source data to respond to climatic variations and provided insights for policymakers and farmers to adjust agricultural interventions.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Characteristics and Landscape Connectivity of Heat Islands in Xiamen in the Face of Rapid Urbanization
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the acceleration of urbanization, urban heat waves have become a major problem affecting the lives of citizens. In this context, the accurate identification of the key patches and nodes of urban heat islands is important for improving the urban environment. This study examined the Landsat image data from Xiamen city in 2001, 2011, and 2021 to analyze the construction of the urban heat island (UHI) network. A morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and landscape connectivity model were utilized to identify the central thermal landscape patches and key nodes of UHI and their spatial and temporal evolution characteristics in the urban development process. The ultimate goal of this research is to provide valuable insights that can contribute to the enhancement of the urban environment. The results showed that (1) there was a significant increase in the heat island area (HIA) of Xiamen from 2001 to 2021, and the heat island patches show a concentrated trend. The temperature contrast between the urban area and the surrounding countryside was more distinct, indicating the urban construction land has a tendency to gather and spread. (2) The core area of the heat island accounted for the largest proportion of the thermal landscape area during the study period, and its proportion increased significantly. And the rate of increase was first rapid and then slow. The areas of the edge, branch, islet, bridge, loop, and perforation classes all showed different degrees of a decreasing trend. This indicates an increasing degree of aggregation between heat island patches. (3) The top 20 thermal landscape patches with high landscape connectivity importance values were identified. Among them, the importance value and area of the first four patches are relatively large, and belong to the three importance classes of extremely important, important, and generally important heat island core patches, which deserve focused attention and optimization. (4) Cooling measures can be prioritized for core areas of heat islands with high importance values. Connections between hot and cold islands can be interrupted or connected to mitigate the heat island effect throughout the region. The results of this study have important practical guidance for urban planning and sustainable development.

TI  - Outcomes of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Patients With Node-positive Breast Cancer Treated With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.
T2  - Anticancer research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Clinical trials have shown that the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is feasible for patients with cN1 breast carcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). This study aimed to evaluate the technical outcomes of SLNB by assessing the volume of residual nodal disease.PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with cT1-3 cN1 breast cancer undergoing NAC from January 2018 to December 2021 were retrospectively identified from our institutional database. We assessed the outcomes of preoperative clinical examination, ultrasonography, and other imaging to predict the axillary nodal status after NAC for patients converted to cN0 and undergoing SLNB; both adequate mapping and false-negative rate (FNR) at intraoperative evaluation of SLN were assessed.RESULTS: Overall 160 patients were included in the study; 98 were converted to cN0 and underwent SLNB. No difference was found in the adequate mapping rate nor in the mean number of SLNs retrieved compared to the residual LN burden. The intraoperative SLN FNR was 38.2%, with smaller nodal volume being associated with lower FNR (p<0.01). The positive predictive values of physical examination and imaging-based nodal assessment post-NAC were 87.1% and 68.2%, respectively.CONCLUSION: In a significant percentage of patients with cN1 disease converted to cN0 after NAC, it was possible to recover three or more SLNs. The residual volume of LN disease did not impact the SLN mapping rate. However, we found a high FNR for intraoperative SLN evaluation, particularly for patients with small residual nodal disease. It seems that only a small proportion of patients eligible for SLNB after NAC can be spared ALND.

TI  - The use of cathepsin L1 (FhCL1) serological ELISA in sentinel screening for liver fluke on sheep farms
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY- REGIONAL STUDIES AND REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fasciola hepatica is a parasitic helminth (worm) that poses a significant economic threat to the ruminant livestock industry worldwide. The disease, fasciolosis, can result in a range of clinical signs including anaemia, weight loss and death, with the most severe symptoms attributed to early acute infection when the parasite is migrating through the liver. Early diagnosis and intervention are essential for the control and management of the disease to prevent productivity losses. The traditional gold standard method of diagnosis uses faecal egg counts (FEC) that is limited to detecting patent infections from 10 to 12 weeks post infection (WPI). In contrast, serological assays can detect pre-patent infections as we have shown that enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using the F. hepatica cysteine peptidase cathepsin L1 (FhCL1) can detect liver fluke infections from 3 to 4 WPI. Here, we used FEC and ELISA to monitor liver fluke infections in sentinel lambs from three commercial farms in Ireland from September 2021 to March 2022. All three farms showed a significant increase in FhCL1 antibody levels and FEC over this time, with a substantial rise in positive infection detection between late November and January. However, ELISA screening detected infection at least two months prior to FEC (September). This suggests that the regular screening of sentinel lambs for F. hepatica seroconversion in a "test and treat" approach could mitigate the negative damaging impact of early fasciolosis on flock health, welfare and productivity and inform management strategies. In addition, we show that whole blood samples taken on Whatman (R) protein saver cards could replace conventional serum blood tubes for blood collection. Cards can be stored at room temperature for long periods of time and samples revisited at any time for re-analysis. The adoption of these cards on farm together with the FhCL1 ELISA would provide a simpler, cost-effective, and eco-friendly method for testing sentinel lambs for liver fluke disease.

TI  - A Rare Complication Following Breast Conserving Surgery: Pyoderma Gangrenosum.
T2  - European journal of breast health
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) after breast-conserving surgery is rare, and its diagnosis is often delayed because of the similarity to wound infection and the broad differential diagnosis for PG, making it a diagnosis of exclusion. A 60-year-old woman who underwent breast conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy for invasive breast carcinoma presented with increasing erythema, fever and serosanguinous discharge in the lower outer quadrant of the right breast at the site of tumour excision on postoperative day (POD) 9. Fever persisted despite antibiotics and the patient was noted to have leucocytosis (0.9 x 109/L), neutrophilia (37.8 x 109/L) and elevated C-reactive protein levels (136 mug/mL) on POD 16. Microbiology and blood culture results were negative but the breast ulcer continued to expand at a rate of 1-2 cm a day. The patient underwent surgical debridement on POD 21 to rule out necrotising soft tissue infection. Persistent ulcer progression, despite debridement and antibiotics, led to clinical suspicion of PG and the patient was started on prednisolone and cyclosporin. A rapid response was seen with treatment and an optimum healing process was noted over the subsequent three-month follow-up period. Early suspicion, careful macroscopic evaluation of disease progression and appropriate use of immunosuppressive therapy are important for the management of PG. Prompt initiation of immunosuppressive therapy may avoid unnecessary treatment and aggravation of the surgical wound.

TI  - AGTML: A novel approach to land cover classification by integrating automatic generation of training samples and machine learning algorithms on Google Earth Engine
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely, accurate, and automatic acquisition of land cover (LC) information is a prerequisite for detecting LC dynamics and performing ecological analyses. Cloud computing platforms, such as the Google Earth Engine, have substantially improved the efficiency and scale of LC classification. However, the lack of sufficient and representative training samples hinders automatic and accurate LC classification. In this study, we propose a new approach that integrates the automatic generation of training samples and machine learning algorithms (AGTML) for LC classification in Heilongjiang Province, China. After optimal focal radii were determined for different LC types using Landsat 8 based on focal statistics and unique phenology. Then target training samples were automatically generated based on the improved distance measure SED (a composite of Spectral angle distance (SAD) and Euclidean distance (ED)). Furthermore, LC classification was performed using four feature combinations and three machine learning algorithms. According to independent validation data, the automatically generated training samples demonstrated good representativeness and stability among all three classifiers, with an overall accuracy (OA) of classification higher than 86%, and showed high consistency in the landscape pattern of classification. RF yielded the highest classification accuracy (92.99% OA). AGTML outperformed GLCFCS30 in identifying large fragmentation and small patch regions in the landscape types. The AGTML approach was subsequently applied to the Guanzhong Plain using different satellite imagery. Results were consistent and accurate (>96.50% OA), demonstrating that the AGTML approach can be applied to various regions and sensors, and has immense potential for automated LC classification across regional and global scales.

TI  - A review of applications of remote sensing for drought studies in the Andes region
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Study region: As climate change intensifies, drought events are becoming more frequent and intense in the Andes region. Remote sensing offers new opportunities to characterize and monitor drought and its impacts for the benefit of disaster risk reduction, water governance, and climate change adaptation. However, it remains to be seen the extent to which remotely-sensed data has been integrated into the Andes regional drought literature.Study focus: Through a semi-systematic literature review, this study evaluates the existing literature in the Andes on the topic, assesses how, where, and the extent to which remote sensing is being deployed in drought studies in the region, and points to key gaps in our regional understanding of this topic of high societal and environmental concern.New hydrological insight for the region: Remote sensing applications in drought studies remain limited in the Andes but have grown substantially since 2020. The reviewed studies concentrate on Chile and offer new insight into the impact of drought on vegetation, water bodies, the cryosphere, and wildfire incidence. Human activity, through agricultural decision-making and other socioeconomic dimensions, plays a role in propagating or deepening drought in the region. This literature offers new insight into the interplay between different drought types and the role of remote sensing in social-environmental research, although further research across geographies and drought types in the Andes region is urgently needed.

TI  - Early detection of tomato bacterial spot disease in transplant tomato seedlings utilising remote sensing and artificial intelligence
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Florida is the largest fresh tomato producer in the USA. Due to the subtropical climate, especially the hot and humid weather, the devastating tomato bacterial spot disease (TBS), caused by the bacteria Xanthomonas perforans, has been a threat to tomato crops for decades. Prevention through early disease detection is a crucial management strategy to minimise losses. Diagnostics for this disease that are commonly used are a visual diagnosis of disease symptoms or laboratory assays. These procedures are time-consuming, require specialised personnel, and are inefficient in detecting the disease in its early stages. Hyperspectral imaging provides a non-invasive tool for early disease detection in various crops. In this study, five optimised machine learning algorithms (MLAs), such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA), Weighted K-Nearest Neighbours (W-KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Ensemble Boosting Tree (EBT), were utilised for early detection of TBS in transplant houses. Two normalisation procedures, a standardisation method, and unit vectorisation, were applied to preprocess the data in a dynamic range expansion process. The input variables to the models included time-lined events of disease progression and reduced datasets. To create the reduced datasets, a novel data reduction methodology was developed, which was able to identify 12 key (significant) wavelengths (from the 300 initial scans of the hyperspectral camera) that carry the highest weighted spectral components for accurately detecting TBS-affected plants. The PLSDA model presented the highest F1 score (90%) on early detection of TBS. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IAgrE.

TI  - Towards Operational Fiducial Reference Measurement (FRM) Data for the Calibration and Validation of the Sentinel-3 Surface Topography Mission over Inland Waters, Sea Ice, and Land Ice
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Sentinel-3 Surface Topography Mission (STM) Land Altimetry provides valuable surface elevation information over inland waters, sea ice, and land ice, thanks to its synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeter and its orbit that covers high-latitude polar regions. To ensure that these measurements are reliable and to maximise the return on investment, adequate validation of the geophysical retrieval methods, processing algorithms, and corrections must be performed using independent observations. The EU-ESA project St3TART (started July 2021) aims to generalise the concept of Fiducial Reference Measurements (FRMs) for the Copernicus Sentinel-3 STM. This work has gathered existing data, made new observations during field campaigns, and ensured that these observations meet the criteria of FRM standards so that they can be used to validate Sentinel-3 STM Land Altimetry products operationally. A roadmap for the operational provision of the FRM, including the definition, consolidation, and identification of the most relevant and cost-effective methods and protocols to be maintained, supported, or implemented, has been developed. The roadmap includes guidelines for SI traceability, definitions of FRM measurement procedures, processing methods, and uncertainty budget estimations.

TI  - Spatio-temporal change analysis and prediction of land use and land cover changes using CA-ANN model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal representation of land use and land cover (LULC) changes helps to understand the interactions between natural habitats and other areas and to plan for sustainability. Research on the models used to determine the spatio-temporal change of LULC and simulation of possible future scenarios provides a perspective for future planning and development strategies. Landsat 5 TM for 1990, Landsat 7 ETM + for 2006, and Landsat 8 OLI for 2022 satellite imageries were used to estimate spatial and temporal variations of transition potentials and future LULC simulation. Independent variables (DEM, slope, and distances to roads and buildings) and the cellular automata-artificial neural network (CA-ANN) model integrated in the MOLUSCE plugin of QGIS were used. The CA-ANN model was used to predict the LULC maps for 2038 and 2054, and the results suggest that artificial surfaces will continue to increase. The Duzce City center's artificial surfaces grew by 100% between 1990 and 2022, from 16.04 to 33.10 km2, and are projected to be 41.13 km2 and 50.32 km2 in 2038 and 2054, respectively. Artificial surfaces, which covered 20% of the study area in 1990, are estimated to cover 64.07% in 2054. If this trend continues, most of the 1st-class agricultural lands may be lost. The study's results can assist local governments in their land management strategies and aid them in planning for the future. The results suggest that policies are necessary to control the expansion of artificial surfaces, ensuring a balanced distribution of land use.

TI  - Efficacy of vaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy for endometrial cancer: a prospective multicenter cohort study.
T2  - International journal of surgery (London, England)
M3  - Multicenter Study
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is performed increasingly often despite the lack of high-quality evidence confirming its safety, especially for malignant diseases. The aim of this prospective study is to verify that vaginal NOTES (vNOTES) can be performed safely and effectively in early endometrial cancer staging surgery.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in two tertiary hospitals in southern China from January 2021 to May 2022. A total of 120 patients with stage I endometrial cancer were included. vNOTES or multiport laparoscopic staging surgery was selected according to each patient's wishes. The primary outcome was the sentinel lymph node detection rate, analyzed by a noninferiority test. The secondary outcomes were perioperative outcomes.RESULTS: Among the 120 patients enrolled, 57 underwent vNOTES, and 63 underwent multiport laparoscopy. The patient-specific detection rates of sentinel lymph nodes were 94.73 and 96.82% in the vNOTES and laparoscopy groups, respectively. Additionally, the bilateral detection rates were 82.46 and 84.13%, and the side-specific detection rates were 88.60 and 90.48% in these two groups, respectively. All three detection rates in the vNOTES group were noninferior to those of laparoscopy group at a noninferiority cutoff of -15%. The median operation times of the vNOTES and laparoscopy groups were 132.35 and 138.73min ( P =0.362), and the median estimated blood loss were 75 and 50ml ( P =0.096), respectively. No intraoperative complications occurred in either group. The pain scores on the Numerical Rating Scale at both 12h and 24h after operation were significantly lower in the vNOTES group ( P <0.001) and the median postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the vNOTES group ( P =0.001).CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the potential applicability of vNOTES in gynecological malignancy surgery by demonstrating its safety and effectiveness in endometrial cancer staging. However, its long-term survival outcomes require further exploration.

TI  - The Strategical Role of General Practitioner in the Prevention of Suicide: Preliminary Data From a Descriptive Study in the Province of Trento.
T2  - Psychiatria Danubina
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Suicide is a serious public health problem, as confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO). It turns out to be, at least in part, preventable, but it is a complex problem, requiring complex solutions. Studies show us that about 44.5 percent of suicidal individuals would have expressed to someone, prior to the act, their intention to take their own life. Data in scientific literature specifically estimate that 44% of those who died by suicide had seen their general practitioner in the 30 days prior to the act. From this perspective, the general practitioner plays a potentially strategic role, as he or she can act as a "sentinel" in the early recognition of individuals in suicidal crisis and intervene directly, including by referring them to dedicated services. He can also disseminate correct information to the population and promote a culture of sensitivity and acceptance of vulnerabilities, facilitating the expression of possible distress and the potential request for help. In a community suicide prevention strategy, such as that of the Invitation to Life project, it was considered appropriate to investigate the knowledge and training needs of general practitioners in the Province of Trento in the present day, in order to specifically reorient training interventions to be developed in the future.

TI  - Real-time Fluorescent ICG and 99m-Tc Nanocolloid Tracer Navigation in Bilateral Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping of Vulvar Cancer.
T2  - Journal of minimally invasive gynecology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been validated by 2 prospective trials, GROINS VI and GOG 173 [1,2]. According to the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology guideline in patients with unifocal tumors with a diameter of <4 cm, in the absence of suspected inguinal lymph nodes, SLN biopsy is recommended. The use of a radioactive tracer is mandatory [2]. Using indocyanine green (ICG) increases the detection of the vulvar sentinel node from 89.7% to 100% [3]. This video aimed to share our experience about the feasibility, safety, and usefulness of the surgical identification of SLN in vulvar cancer using real-time fluorescent ICG with 99m-technetium (Tc) nanocolloid.DESIGN: A stepwise demonstration of the technique with narrated video footage.SETTING: Tertiary level hospital "IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori," Milano, Italy.INTERVENTIONS: A 50-year-old woman was diagnosed as having vulvar cancer on biopsy of 1.5 cm size vulvar lesion under the clitoris area and referred to our operative unit. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography showed no extravulvar disease. The patient was scheduled for radical vulvectomy and bilateral inguinal SLN biopsy. (Video still 1) In this video, the surgical procedure involved double location of SLN, first with the 99m-Tc detector followed by ICG identification. We used an ICG dilution of 2.5 mg/mL in sterile water and injected 4 mL around the tumor 5 to 10 minutes before visualization. First a handheld gamma probe used to identify the location of the SLNs with 99m-Tc. The fluorescence imaging was performed by the quest imaging system (FLUOPTICS, Middenmeer, The Netherlands) that combines autofluorescence and fluorescence perfusion imaging (Video Still 2). Second, we performed the SLN biopsy using a dark mode procedure to identify the IGC tracer (Video Still 3). The fluorescence imaging enables the detection of these markers through some millimeters of tissue, and ICG has the advantage that is visible through the skin [4].CONCLUSION: This video shows a successful combined 99m-Tc and ICG fluorescence image-guided bilateral SLN biopsy in a vulvar cancer patient using a near-infrared optical imaging system (FLUOPTICS). ICG for SLN mapping seems to be safe in women with vulvar cancer with a satisfactory detection rate. This may help in retaining surgical radicality while minimizing operative complications.

TI  - Assessment of environmental degradation of lakes of Nainital district: an ecohydrological perspective
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities have degraded lakes in Uttarakhand, endangering their vital role in urban sustainability, which includes providing essential services like water supply, flood mitigation, agriculture support, and biodiversity conservation in the Himalayan region. This study focused on Nainital district lakes, utilizing remote sensing and GIS techniques to assess their condition. Time series Landsat 8 satellite imageries acquire by USGS earth explorer from 2017 and 2022 were captured, pre-processed, and subjected to spectral-based classification algorithms in ArcGIS software to calculate Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Normalised Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) indices to assess changes in vegetation, water bodies, and build-up area in and around the lakes respectively. The results indicate a decrease in built-up areas for Nainital district lakes from 2017 to 2022: Naini Lake (1.42%), Bhimtal Lake (1.83%), Naukuchiatal Lake (1.45%), Sattal Lake (2.18%), Khurpatal Lake (2.25%), and Sariyatal Lake (1.3%). Additionally, Bhimtal, Naukuchiatal, and Khurpatal lakes exhibited reductions in shrub and grass vegetation by approximately 12%, 16%, and 0% over the five-year period. Notably, Sattal and Khurapatal lakes demonstrated significant decreases in built-up areas, likely attributed to restoration efforts or landslides. Findings emphasize the need for conservation, sustainable land-use practices, and effective management to protect lake ecosystems.Built-up areas decreased: Uttarakhand lakes saw reduced built-up areas from 2017 to 2022.Vegetation changes: Shrubs and grass declined in Bhimtal, Naukuchiatal, and Khurpatal lakes.Restoration efforts: Sattal and Khurapatal lakes showed significant improvement due to restoration.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in recurrent or secondary oral squamous cell carcinoma after previous neck dissection
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the potential of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with recurrent or a secondary oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) without clinical signs of lymph node metastases (cN0), who were previously treated with a surgical approach. Patients and Methods: Retrospective analysis of all patients with cN0 recurrent or secondary OSCC, who were treated using SLNB after previous neck dissection. Endpoints were sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection rate, negative predictive value (NPV) and sensitivity. Results: A total of 17 patients with a mean age of 68.6 years were included. SLN were detected in 15 of 17 cases (detection rate: 88.2%). In seven patients (41.2%), a bilateral or contralateral lymph drainage of a unilateral carcinoma was found. Two patients (11.8%) demonstrated a positive SLN upon pathohistological analysis, which led to an upstaging. In one case, a non-SLN was positive, which is considered a false-negative result. The mean follow-up for all patients with histologically negative SLN including the patients without a detected SLN was 11.8 months (range: 0-31 months). Of these, one patient developed (isolated) neck recurrence after 12 months resulting in an overall NPV of 86.7% and a sensitivity of 50.0% for the SLNB as a neck staging procedure. Conclusion: SLNB can improve the staging of patients with recurrent or secondary OSCC, who present with a history of a previous neck dissection. Further studies are required to demonstrate the oncological benefit of SLNB in this patient cohort.

TI  - Segmentation and Connectivity Reconstruction of Urban Rivers from Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Imagery by the WaterSCNet Deep Learning Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quick and automatic detection of the distribution and connectivity of urban rivers and their changes from satellite imagery is of great importance for urban flood control, river management, and ecological conservation. By improving the E-UNet model, this study proposed a cascaded river segmentation and connectivity reconstruction deep learning network model (WaterSCNet) to segment urban rivers from Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery and simultaneously reconstruct their connectivity obscured by road and bridge crossings from the segmentation results. The experimental results indicated that the WaterSCNet model could achieve better river segmentation and connectivity reconstruction results compared to the E-UNet, U-Net, SegNet, and HRNet models. Compared with the classic U-Net model, the MCC, F1, Kappa, and Recall evaluation metrics of the river segmentation results of the WaterSCNet model were improved by 3.24%, 3.10%, 3.36%, and 3.93%, respectively, and the evaluation metrics of the connectivity reconstruction results were improved by 4.25%, 4.11%, 4.37%, and 4.83%, respectively. The variance of the evaluation metrics of the five independent experiments indicated that the WaterSCNet model also had the best robustness compared to the other four models.

TI  - The Diagnostic Value of the Sentinel Node Procedure to Detect Occult Lymph Node Metastases in PSMA PET/CT Node-Negative Prostate Cancer Patients.
T2  - Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Our objective was to assess the diagnostic value of the sentinel node (SN) procedure for lymph node staging in primary intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients with node-negative results on prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT (miN0). Methods: From 2016 to 2022, 154 patients with primary, miN0 PCa were retrospectively included. All patients had a Briganti nomogram-assessed nodal risk of more than 5% and underwent a robot-assisted SN procedure for nodal staging. The prevalence of nodal metastases at histopathology and the occurrence of surgical complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification were evaluated. Results: The SN procedure yielded 84 (14%) tumor-positive lymph nodes with a median metastasis size of 3mm (interquartile range, 1-4mm). In total, 55 patients (36%) were reclassified as pN1. A complication of Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher occured in 1 patient (0.6%). Conclusion: The SN procedure classified 36% of patients with miN0 prostate cancer with an elevated risk of nodal metastases as pN1.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Resolution Needs for Volcano Topographic Change Data Sets Based on Past Eruptions (1980-2019)
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Up-to-date topography data sets are essential for forecasting volcanic hazards and monitoring deformation. Digital elevation models are used to quantify eruption rates, used in flow modeling programs, and are necessary to accurately process interferometric synthetic aperture radar data for surface deformation. We can track topographic change at volcanoes through fieldwork, airborne instruments, and satellite data, with the last providing the greatest potential for global coverage. Despite this global coverage, we do not know the characteristics of topographic change at volcanoes over a given time interval. We define the specific acquisition needs for topography data using topographic change detected from recent eruptions. We review existing literature and compile a data set of eruptive products (121 lava flows, 99 domes and 163 pyroclastic density currents (PDCs)) from eruptions between 1980 and 2019. We find that different sensing capabilities are required for different use cases. A vertical accuracy of 1 m would detect 92% of all eruptive products including 100% of lava domes and lava flows, but only 78% of PDCs. A horizontal resolution of 13 x 13 m pixels is the minimum necessary to detect 90% of all eruptive products. Explosive eruptions (with PDC products) typically lasted less than 1 day and would need a temporal resolution of 1 day while a longer repeat interval is acceptable at effusive eruptions (lava domes and flows), which could last weeks to years. We find a lack of consistent data acquisition, with 45% of the 383 eruptive products reported not having published spatial dimensions.

TI  - Water uptake rates over olive orchards using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The water uptake rate is a key parameter for improving irrigation efficiency and represents an indicator of tree health and yield. Here, we investigate the potential of C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by Sentinel-1 to estimate and map the water uptake rate across a very high-density olive orchard (5.3 km2 of olive plots) in the hot and arid desert climate of Saudi Arabia. The SAR predictor variables for water uptake rate estimation were the difference between the SAR backscattering of a given image acquired during the year (ti) and the average SAR backscattering in the second-half of January (t0), which corresponds to the point when the uptake rate was closest to zero. Random forest regression and multi-linear regression models were used to explore the relationship between the SAR predictor variables and in situ water uptake rate, inferred from twelve sap flow meters that were installed across six plots and collected over two years (2020 and 2021). The trained random forest regression model provided an improved estimate of water uptake rate with correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.87 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.13 L.h-1 compared with the multi-linear regression model (R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 0.18 L.h-1). Using the random forest regression, the water uptake rate was mapped at the plot level for three years (2019, 2020, and 2021) at a temporal resolution of 6 days. Consistent with expectations, the results show that the average uptake rate over the mapped area co-varied with vapor pressure deficit (R2 = 0.82). The analysis provides a first exploration of exploiting SAR data to infer the water uptake rate across commercial scale orchards, offering important insights that can be useful for improved water management and irrigation control.

TI  - The High-Low Arctic boundary: How is it determined and where is it located?
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Geobotanical subdivision of landcover is a baseline for many studies. The High-Low Arctic boundary is considered to be of fundamental natural importance. The wide application of different delimitation schemes in various ecological studies and climatic scenarios raises the following questions: (i) What are the common criteria to define the High and Low Arctic? (ii) Could human impact significantly change the distribution of the delimitation criteria? (iii) Is the widely accepted temperature criterion still relevant given ongoing climate change? and (iv) Could we locate the High-Low Arctic boundary by mapping these criteria derived from modern open remote sensing and climatic data? Researchers rely on common criteria for geobotanical delimitation of the Arctic. Unified circumpolar criteria are based on the structure of vegetation cover and climate, while regional specifics are reflected in the floral composition. However, the published delimitation schemes vary greatly. The disagreement in the location of geobotanical boundaries across the studies manifests in poorly comparable results. While maintaining the common principles of geobotanical subdivision, we derived the boundary between the High and Low Arctic using the most up-to-date field data and modern techniques: species distribution modeling, radar, thermal and optical satellite imagery processing, and climatic data analysis. The position of the High-Low Arctic boundary in Western Siberia was clarified and mapped. The new boundary is located 50-100 km further north compared to all the previously presented ones. Long-term anthropogenic press contributes to a change in the vegetation structure but does not noticeably affect key species ranges. A previously specified climatic criterion for the High-Low Arctic boundary accepted in scientific literature has not coincided with the boundary in Western Siberia for over 70 years. The High-Low Arctic boundary is distinctly reflected in biodiversity distribution. The presented approach is appropriate for accurate mapping of the High-Low Arctic boundary in the circumpolar extent.This study focuses on geobotanical subdivision of the Arctic and provides insight into the structure of vegetation cover, biodiversity and functional traits distribution, and their spatial relations. It is shown that the High-Low Arctic boundary is distinctly reflected in biodiversity distribution and that the widely accepted climatic criterion used in delimitation schemes is not reliable for a huge part of the Arctic biome.image

TI  - Sentinel-2 imagery analyses for archaeological site detection: an application to Late Bronze Age settlements in Serbian Banat, southern Carpathian Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has become a valuable tool in archaeology, allowing the monitoring of existing and discovery of new sites, and to study their surroundings. In an attempt to identify unknown Late Bronze Age (LBA) archaeological sites in the Serbian Banat region (souther n Carpathian Basin), remote sensing techniques for site detection were applied using Sentinel-2 data. A multi-temporal analysis was performed , and the spectral signatures of soil marks from five known LBA settlements were analysed to determine the best conditions for the identification of archaeological features. Several principal component analyses (PCA), band combinations and vegetation indices were calculated . The vegetation indices results from soil marks at known sites demonstrated the impact of settlement characteristics (compositions, subsurface anomalies) on vegetation growth. Applying this further to identify new sites from the satellite data, one hundred and two possible archaeological locations, ranging from only a few hectares to 100 ha, were identified in Banat and Backa, to the east and west of the Tisza River. Of the sixty-one possible sites identified in Banat, a sample was visited and their chronology confirmed, proving once again the enormous capabilities of Sentinel-2 data analyses for site detection.

TI  - PSDefoPAT-Persistent Scatterer Deformation Pattern Analysis Tool
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent Scatterer Deformation Pattern Analysis Tool, for short PSDefoPAT, was designed to assign each measuring point of an advanced DInSAR data set a best-fitting time series model based on its displacement time series. In this paper, we will outline the operating principles of the tool. The periodic and trend components of a time series model are separately determined based on hypothesis tests. The periodic component is fitted as a sine function, and for the trend component, linear, quadratic, and piecewise linear regression models are considered. Additionally, the tool assesses the goodness-of-fit for each model in the form of the adjusted coefficient of determination Radj2 value. The tool works fully automatically and thus facilitates the analysis of large data sets, which are becoming more available to the public due to services such as the European Ground Motion Service. Additionally, we demonstrate the capabilities of PSDefoPAT using four case studies characterized by different deformation mechanisms, various extents of active deformation area, and varying density of measuring points. In all cases, we successfully reveal information on the temporal behavior of the deformation not apparent in the typically presented mean deformation velocity maps.

TI  - Streamflow Composition and Water "Imbalance" in the Northern Himalayas
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yarlung Zangbo River (YZR) is the largest river in the northern Himalayas, providing crucial water resources for downstream. A full understanding of the streamflow dynamics and regional water budget is critical to secure water security of the Himalayan water tower. Here we establish a comprehensive hydrological model to simulate the precipitation-runoff-evapotranspiration-groundwater-streamflow complex in the YZR basin. We decipher contributions of different water sources (e.g., precipitation, meltwater, groundwater) to YZR's streamflow and estimate that groundwater sustains similar to 36% of annual streamflow in the YZR, while precipitation and melt surface runoff contribute 40% and 24%, respectively. Combining modeling, observation and reanalysis data, our results reveal a water "imbalance" that similar to 31% of annual precipitation and meltwater (similar to 333 mm yr(-1) or similar to 85 km(3) yr(-1)) is unaccounted for in the YZR basin. We propose that the "excess water" discharges to deep fractured bedrock aquifers, which is promoted by widespread permeable active structures (e.g., faults, fractures). This hypothesis is supported by groundwater storage (GWS) estimates where inclusion of the deep groundwater bridges the discrepancy between baseflow-derived (shallow) GWS and those derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite data. The deep groundwater most likely flows across basins, bypasses streams, and finally discharges to downstream aquifers in the Indo-Gangetic Plain as mountain block recharge. This study not only provides a comprehensive analysis of the streamflow composition in the YZR, but also contributes to shaping a more complete picture of the functionality of the Himalayan water tower, highlighting the importance of groundwater in regional water transfers.

TI  - GOCI-II geostationary satellite hourly aerosol optical depth obtained by data-driven methods: Validation and comparison
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager II (GOCI-II) deployed on board GEO-KOMPSAT 2B (GK2B) satellite can observe the earth with high frequency, which is of great significance to the dynamic monitoring of regional aerosol optical depth (AOD). However, the lack of short-wave infrared bands makes the classical methods based on radiative transfer analysis difficult to achieve retrieval of aerosols. The data-driven methods based on learning from massive samples can achieve high-accuracy retrieval of aerosols on the local, regional and global scale. However, the samples required for the data-driven method are difficult to obtain due to the short operation time of the GK2B satellite and insufficient ground-based measurements. Aiming to solve such a problem, the Simplified and Robust Surface Reflectance Estimation and Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SEMARA) were aggregated to be applied in the study. The SEMARA method using ground-based observation can retrieve local AOD with high reliability and accuracy, which can be used to construct high-quality and high-quantity samples for training with higher efficiency compared with traditional sample construct methods. Four datadriven methods: Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were chosen to retrieve the AOD over South Korea in 2021 and 2022 based on GOCI-II. The results were validated and compared using ground-based measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AENRONET) sites and show that the FCNN method has high accuracy and stability, followed by, the RF and XGBoost methods, while the SVM results significantly overestimate the spatial distribution of the AOD.

TI  - Optimization of Reservoir Level Scheduling Based on InSAR-LSTM Deformation Prediction Model for Rockfill Dams
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Xiaolangdi reservoir has a storage capacity of more than 10 billion cubic meters, and the dam has significant seasonal deformation. Predicting the deformation of the dam during different periods is important for the safe operation of the dam. In this study, a long short-term memory (LSTM) model based on interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) deformation data is introduced to predict dam deformation. First, a time series deformation model of the Xiaolangdi Dam for 2017-2023 was established using Sentinel-1A data with small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR), and a cumulative deformation accuracy of 95% was compared with the on-site measurement data at the typical point P. The correlation between reservoir level and dam deformation was found to be 0.81. Then, a model of reservoir level and dam deformation predicted by neural LSTM was established. The overall deformation error of the dam was predicted to be within 10 percent. Finally, we used the optimized reservoir level to simulate the deformation at the measured point P of the dam, which was reduced by about 36% compared to the real deformation. The results showed that the combination of InSAR and LSTM could predict dam failure and prevent potential failure risks by adjusting the reservoir levels.

TI  - The effect of pixel heterogeneity on surface heat and water vapor flux estimated by the remote sensing-based model coupled with deep learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantification of sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes are desperately crucial for agricultural irrigation strategy, drought monitoring, water resource management, and climate change. Regional-scale H and LE were derived generally from satellite remote sensing data using relevant modeling methods. However, one of the challenges of modeling methods is to deal with sub-pixel heterogeneity, because the model usually assumes homogeneous conditions within a pixel. In this study, a hybrid model, which coupled deep neural network (DNN) and the remote sensing-based two-source energy balance (TSEB) model, was developed to estimate H and LE at multiple spatial resolutions to further quantify the influence of pixel size on the modeled fluxes. First, the DNN-based land surface temperature (LST) estimation model was developed and validated. LST at multiple spatial resolutions (i.e., 1, 5, 10, 30, 100, and 1000 m) were generated by the DNN method using multi-source satellite data including the GaoFen-2 (GF-2, a Chinese high-resolution optical remote-sensing satellite), Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 images, respectively. Then, the hybrid DNN-TSEB model was used to estimate H and LE at multi-pixel sizes. Finally, modeled H and LE at 1 similar to 1000 m were validated by eddy covariance (EC) and optical-microwave scintillometer (OMS) flux observation. Results revealed that the DNN-based LST model was a potential approach to generate LST at multiple pixel sizes. The hybrid DNN-TSEB model can produce more accurate H and LE when different land cover types were discriminated over heterogeneous farmland (e.g., the average bias for H and LE at a spatial resolution of 1 m were -9 and -6 W/m(- 2), respectively). Besides, the deviation of modeled fluxes from the observations increased as the spatial resolution became coarser, particularly the pixel size was greater than 30 m (average bias for H and LE were -34 and 30 W m(- 2), respectively). However, the magnitude of bias of fluxes estimates remained unchanged when the pixel sizes of satellite data were between 100 and 1000 m. The more important finding was that the hybrid model was a promising approach, which can obtain accurate estimates of H and LE at a high spatial resolution. In addition, the performance of the model based on GF-2 data was better than that based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data. The results suggest that pixel heterogeneity should be considered when estimating H and LE over heterogeneous landscapes with various surface types.

TI  - A metasurface-based direct-reading linear polarization analyzer
T2  - PHYSICA SCRIPTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarization state is one of the fundamental properties of electromagnetic (EM) wave, which has been widely investigated in fields of information encryption, remote sensing and multifunctional devices etc The existing methods for polarization detection are generally based on the measurement of Stokes parameters or the amplitude and phase difference between orthogonal components or polarization-dependent imaging. However, they generally requires post-possessing process to identify the polarization state or suffer from the shortcomings of limited detection states, which results in less intuitiveness and limited practical values of those methods. Here, we proposed a metasurface-based and direct-reading linear polarization analyzer, which could reveal the polarization angle of linearly incident plane wave in imaging way by utilizing geometric phase effect. Different linear polarization angles lead to the different positions of the brightest spot, and the polarization state of incident wave could be directly read out by comparing the position of the brightest spot and the index of reference spots above. Besides, this method could be generalized to simplify the process of detecting arbitrary polarization states, with which only the intensity ratio between orthogonal circularly polarized components needs to be measured. Moreover, a digital linear polarization analyzer is designed based on the similar method, which helps to reveal the linear polarization angle digitally and is much more straightforward for linear polarization detection. The proposed direct-reading linear polarization analyzer has the potential of being applied in fields of smart sensing and the development of human-computer interaction system etc.

TI  - Spectroscopic detection of wheat yellow mosaic virus infection based on invariant shape spectral processing and machine learning
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat yellow mosaic disease (WYMD) is a low-temperature soil-borne disease that causes serious yield and economic losses. Reflectance spectroscopy has great potential for detecting crop diseases, but it has not been applied for detection of WYMD. Herein, we collected 2 years of wheat physiological and reflectance spectroscopy data at green-up and jointing stages, and conducted disease detection studies. We evaluated standard normal variate (SNV), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and spectral separation of soil and vegetation (3SV) as preprocessing methods for invariant spectral shapes, and 96 spectral indices. The spectral index wavelength (SIW), threshold method, and variance inflation factor (TVIF) were used as feature selection methods combined with machine learning to construct a systematic disease detection scheme. The results showed that the visible region centred at 750 nm was the most sensitive wavelength. Additionally, 900---1000 nm was the sensitive wavelength in the middle and latter stages, during disease aggravation and fertility development. The pre-processing method was best with 3SV, which was highly consistent with the characteristic regions of the original spectra, followed by SNV and MSC. spectral indices OR-BG1 I, SNV-RPMI, MSC-RPMI and 3SV-CTRI 1 could be applied to detect WYMD, and the best index was 3SV-CTRI 1, with OA and Kappa values of 75.88% and 0.516, respectively. The effectiveness of the SIW feature selection method and coupling with machine learning was superior to TVIF. The best results among different machine learning models were obtained with SVM, followed by RF and KNN. The optimal 3SV-SIW-SVM disease detection mode achieved OA and Kappa values of 94.71% and 0.893, respectively, for field data validation, and 68.06% and 0.381, respectively, for simulated satellite data validation. The findings will facilitate migration of ground-based research to satellite platforms, and provide new ideas for quantitative identification of crop diseases.

TI  - Changes in river ice cover in the context of climate change and dam impacts: a review
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - This article presents a review of previous studies on the impacts of climate change and the operation of dam reservoirs on the characteristics of river ice cover. Based on a review of the existing literature, the spatial and temporal variability of trends in individual river ice cover conditions and their relationship to both climate change and the operation of dam reservoirs is explored. From this analysis, climate change is identified as the main determinant of the river ice cover disturbances observed since the start of the twentieth century. The study found that in the twentieth century, climate change contributed to a decrease in the duration of ice cover on rivers. The shortening of ice cover duration occurs primarily through earlier breakup rather than later formation. The trends in ice cover freeze-up and breakup are less spatially variable across Eurasia than in North America. The analysis indicates that dam reservoirs can exert a significant control on the spatiotemporal distribution of ice cover occurrence on rivers, even on a global scale. The first quantitative estimate of the number of dam reservoirs in river ice cover areas was also presented based on climatological and reservoir location data. The obtained results highlight the need to research river ice cover changes based on remote sensing data; such studies will make it possible to recognize the temporal-spatial distribution of trends in river ice cover parameters and the strength and extent of the influence of dam reservoirs.

TI  - The inverse texture effect of soil on vegetation in temperate grasslands of China: Benchmarking soil texture effect
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The inverse texture effect of soil on vegetation has been reported in a few arid regions, but no information is available on the vast Chinese temperate grassland. In addition, no consistent criteria and approaches have been used to classify soil texture groups, determine the precipitation threshold (P?) below which the inverse texture effect occurs, and quantify the effect size (Z), which has limited the generalization of the rules of the soil texture effect in different ecosystems. We analyzed the soil texture effect on vegetation using the remotely sensed vegetation data (MODIS/NDVI) and the Chinese soil profile texture data at 6851 sites in temperate grasslands of China. We found, first, a strong inverse texture effect, i.e., a higher NDVI on coarse- (>50 % sand) than finetextured soil in low precipitation areas, and P? was variable with annual precipitation and averaged 260 mm in the region. Second, we proposed a novel method to use the loam soil as a benchmark against which to quantify the effect of various textured soils, and determine P? as the point on precipitation gradient where the soil texture effect shift from positive to negative or vice versa. As such, P? decreased with soil coarseness, and increased with precipitation; and the texture effect decreased from positive to negative for sandy soils, whereas it increased from negative to positive for silt or clay soils, on the gradient of precipitation increase. Our results provide new insights into the relations of vegetation pattern and dynamics with precipitation and soil texture, and a method for quantifying and comparing soil texture effect across ecosystem types.

TI  - FARM: A fully automated rice mapping framework combining Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multi-temporal imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice farming exemplifies intensive agriculture, demanding significant inputs to achieve optimal yields. Thus, accurate and precise mapping of rice cultivation is vital for effective agricultural management and food security. However, such studies have been limited by the challenges of obtaining optical cloud-free data and dealing with radar data's speckle noise. Identifying crops using a single data source poses many difficulties. Additionally, acquiring sufficient representative training samples that accurately reflect diverse phenological patterns is challenging for large-scale monitoring and rice cultivation classification. To address these challenges, this study proposed a fully automated rice-mapping framework (FARM) that combines the strengths of time-series synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical satellite imagery for large-scale rice mapping without manual sample collection. First, an object-based, fully automatic training sample generation strategy is introduced. The phenology constraint rule, based on time-series SAR satellite images and specific rice-flooding features, is used to extract rice sample objects. Second, the extracted rice sample objects, adhering to phenological rules, serve as training samples for paddy rice extraction by integrating multiple random forest (RF) classifiers, referred to as the multiRF method, where each RF is individually built using images acquired during each phenological phase of the growing season. Furthermore, the study explored the availability of the method in early-season rice identification by transferring the training samples acquired by the FARM to a new year. The proposed FARM approach was then validated under different cropping conditions at three study sites in China and two sites in other countries. The results showed that the FARM framework proved to be more effective than other methods at all five study sites, achieving average overall accuracies (OA) ranging from 89.67%-97.00%. In addition, when transferring the training samples from 2021 to other years (2020/2022), the OAs of site A, site B and site C were high during the heading period, with accuracies of 97.57%, 84.28% and 89.27%, respectively. These results demonstrated that, first, the FARM framework exhibits high efficiency and accuracy in different study areas without the need for extensive fieldwork to collect training samples. Second, the method has good performance in the early-season rice mapping of the new year and can be used to perform timely and accurate rice identification and monitoring tasks. The method shows great potential in obtaining large-area automatic rice mapping results in a timely and accurate manner. The latest release of FARM can be viewed at https://feature-selected.users.earthengine.app/ view/farm, and the code is available on GitHub at the link https://github.com/gactyxc/FARM.git.

TI  - Melt pond detection on landfast sea ice using dual co-polarized Ku-band backscatter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The onset of melt ponds on landfast first-year and multiyear sea ice is detected using dual co-polarized Ku-band spaceborne scatterometer data. Twenty-nine locations in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago are used to develop and test the methodology. The daily ScatSat-1 sigma-nought backscatter composite product with a spatial resolution of 2.216 km is used. Vertical (VV) and horizontal (HH) polarizations of these data are used to derive the co-polarized ratio (VV/HH). An increase in VV/HH is associated with an increase in melt pond fraction on the sea ice. This occurs because there is a larger increase in resonant Bragg scattering for VV than for HH when melt pond surfaces exhibit wind-generated capillary waves. VV backscatter magnitude is evaluated in time series using a peak-finding methodology to initiate detection of melt ponds with VV/HH. The peak-finding is based on geophysical controls on backscatter from snow-covered sea ice during the melt season. Daily time-series data from ScatSat-1 are used in conjunction with ERA-5 reanalysis data (2-m air temperature and wind) and a semiempirical snowmelt model. Air temperature data are used to identify snow melt onset and to force the snowmelt model. Wind data are used to evaluate if the wind speed is sufficient for capillary wave formation. The NSCAT4DS geophysical model function is used to model Ku-band backscatter from water, which is then used in a sea ice mixture model to simulate the VV/HH magnitude for a range of pond fractions and wind speeds. The potential for detecting pond onset is evaluated in relation to the noise inherent in the ScatSat-1 VV/HH sea ice measurements, which is found to be approximately 0.16 dB. When the melt pond fraction is sufficiently large to cause VV/HH to exceed the noise, pond onset is detected. Cloud-free Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery is used for validation; specifically, the near-infrared albedo. We find an overall mean bias of -0.5 days, and an absolute deviation of 1.4 days, when comparing our method to a near-infrared method for detecting pond onset. The mean biases (absolute deviations) for first-year and multiyear sea ice are -0.3 (1.5) and -0.8 (1.2) days, respectively. Results show that the temporal resolution, spatial resolution, and efficacy of this method can provide robust sea ice melt pond onset timing for landfast sea ice regions of the Arctic.

TI  - 3D geological modelling of the Bologna urban area (Italy)
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban geological modelling plays a crucial role in facilitating the sustainable utilization of the urban subsurface and the development of effective strategies for geohazard mitigation. Traditionally, geological models of urban areas rely on lithological correlations of boreholes and well data. However, in complex depositional settings such as alluvial environments, where the standard concepts of superposition and lateral continuity of strata are often violated, lithostratigraphic correlation can be challenging even over short distances, leading to considerable uncertainty in the final geological model. Therefore, in such cases, lithofacies analysis can provide a more robust categorisation of subsurface geological units as lithofacies mainly reflect the depositional process, while their associations provide a reliable picture of sedimentary bodies and their geometries. In this work, we used the lithofacies correlation approach to develop a 3D geological model of the urban area of Bologna (Italy) where a complex, thick alluvial succession makes lithological correlations very difficult. To minimize subjectivity, we reinterpreted 940 existing borehole logs in terms of depositional facies and combined stratigraphic data with geophysical HSVR (Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio) measurements and surface analysis (morphology and river network) based on a DTM (Digital Terrain Model). This led to the detailed reconstruction of the subsurface depositional architecture, forming the basis for the 3D geological model. The model revealed the presence of three distinct depositional domains with different stratigraphic architectures. From west to east: Domain A (Reno River) corresponds to the gravel-dominated fill of a river valley abruptly passing to Domain B (Bologna urban area) that represents a morphological and stratigraphical divide, topographically elevated with respect to the surrounding areas and characterised by fine-grained deposits with frequent paleosols. Lastly, Domain C (Savena River) exhibits the typical alluvial fan pattern, marked by a gentle convex-up surface morphology with gravellysandy deposits with a low degree of lateral amalgamation. The geological model effectively explains the distribution of ground subsidence in Bologna since the 1960s, which is attributable to significant groundwater pumping. This is evident from the comparison of the model with both the ground displacement contours resulting from the 1983-1987 topographic levelling campaign and the subsidence rate map derived from the 2006-2011 Radarsat interferometric survey. Subsidence shows strong variations at the domains' boundaries, especially at the limit between Domain A (Reno River) where high values prevail, and Domain B (Bologna city centre) characterised by the lowest values.

TI  - A Phase II Randomized Clinical Trial to Assess Toxicity and Quality of Life of Breast Cancer Patients with Hypofractionated vs. Conventional Fractionation Radiotherapy with Regional Nodal Irradiation.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): To compare acute toxicity between conventional fractionated radiation therapy (CFRT) and hypofractionated radiation therapy (HFRT) for patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy with breast or chest wall and regional nodal irradiation (RNI). The secondary endpoints were acute and subacute toxicity, cosmesis, quality of life, and lymphedema features.MATERIALS/METHODS: Unblinded randomized trial with a total of 86 patients treated with CFRT (n = 33; 50 Gy/25 fractions ± sequential boost [10 Gy/5 fractions]) versus HFRT (n = 53; 40 Gy/15 fractions ± concomitant boost [8 Gy/15 fractions]). Women included for enrollment were 18 years or older and diagnosed with breast carcinoma, staging T1-4, with at least one positive lymph node (American Joint Committee on Cancer - AJCC 8th). The surgery performed was mastectomy or breast-conservative surgery with the investigation of sentinel lymph node or axillary dissection. Toxic effects and cosmesis evaluation used the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (CTCAE) and the Harvard/NSABP/RTOG scale. Patients-reported QoL was determined using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the breast cancer-specific supplementary questionnaire (QLQ-BR23). The comparative analysis of categorical variables between the control and experimental groups used the Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test, while numerical variables basing on the Mann-Whitney U test. The intergroup comparison of the EORTC QLQ-C30 used the Generalized Equations Estimating method. All analyses used 2-sided alpha = 0.05 with R software version 4.1.2. Lymphedema determination compared volume differences between the affected and contralateral arms using the Casley-Smith volume formula.RESULTS: Grade 2 and grade 3 skin rash dermatitis were lower with HFRT than with CF-RT (28% vs. 52%, 0% vs. 6%; p = 0.022, respectively). HFRT vs. CFRT had lower rate of grade 2 hyperpigmentation (23% vs. 55%; p = 0.005). Overall rates of any physician-assessed grade ≥ 2 and grade ≥ 3 acute toxicities were no different between HFRT vs. CFRT arms. There was no statistical difference between the CFRT and the HFRT regarding cosmesis, lymphedema rate (13% vs. 12% HFRT vs. CFRT; p = 1.000, respectively), and functional and symptom scales during irradiation and after six months of treatment.CONCLUSION: HF-RT showed lower rates of acute toxicity, with no changes in quality-of-life outcomes.

TI  - The Use of Deep Learning Methods for Object Height Estimation in High Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Processing single high-resolution satellite images may provide a lot of important information about the urban landscape or other applications related to the inventory of high-altitude objects. Unfortunately, the direct extraction of specific features from single satellite scenes can be difficult. However, the appropriate use of advanced processing methods based on deep learning algorithms allows us to obtain valuable information from these images. The height of buildings, for example, may be determined based on the extraction of shadows from an image and taking into account other metadata, e.g., the sun elevation angle and satellite azimuth angle. Classic methods of processing satellite imagery based on thresholding or simple segmentation are not sufficient because, in most cases, satellite scenes are not spectrally heterogenous. Therefore, the use of classical shadow detection methods is difficult. The authors of this article explore the possibility of using high-resolution optical satellite data to develop a universal algorithm for a fully automated estimation of object heights within the land cover by calculating the length of the shadow of each founded object. Finally, a set of algorithms allowing for a fully automatic detection of objects and shadows from satellite and aerial imagery and an iterative analysis of the relationships between them to calculate the heights of typical objects (such as buildings) and atypical objects (such as wind turbines) is proposed. The city of Warsaw (Poland) was used as the test area. LiDAR data were adopted as the reference measurement. As a result of final analyses based on measurements from several hundred thousand objects, the global accuracy obtained was +/- 4.66 m.

TI  - Using satellite imagery to investigate Blue-Green Infrastructure establishment time for urban cooling
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of urbanization can alter the local climate to the point that it threatens citizens' well-being by creating heat-related hazards. The construction of Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) can improve the regulation of surface energy exchange processes and address this problem. However, the time needed for a BGI to deliver a stable cooling performance, referred to here as the Cooling Establishment Time (CET), is poorly understood and quantified in the literature and dependent on environmental, design and maintenance factors. Here, we analyze the feasibility of using satellite data to derive the CET for different BGIs across the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Results showed that remote sensing can quantify the land surface temperature impact of BGIs and assist in estimating their CET. BGI with trees or climbing plants required a longer CET (seven to ten years) before any notable shift in surface temperatures were visible, while grasses or artificial irrigated systems led to shorter CETs (one to three years). These results allow us to better account for BGI cooling establishment when planning for areas that need urgent action under warming climates. This work supports evidence-based urban greenery planning and design towards cooling our increasingly warming cities in a timely manner.

TI  - Efficacy of Single-Fraction Postoperative Radiotherapy in Resected, Early-Stage Merkel Cell Carcinoma with High-Risk Features.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive skin cancer with a high recurrence risk. Postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) improves the local recurrence rate (LRR) in early-stage MCC with risk factors per NCCN guidelines: primary tumor size > 1cm, head/neck (HN) location, immunosuppression, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and positive/narrow surgical margins. Conventionally fractionated PORT (C-PORT, 50 Gy in 25 fractions) is often recommended for localized MCC with these risk factors; however, some institutions elect observation. Prior studies suggest LRR of 20% for stage I/II MCC with high-risk features managed with surgery alone. C-PORT significantly decreases LRR but may cause significant morbidity and financial toxicity. We have previously reported that single fraction (SF)-PORT with 8 Gy achieves high rates of in-field control both in the metastatic and adjuvant settings with minimal morbidity. Here, we present updated long-term outcomes of SF-PORT, offered as an alternative to C-PORT with the hypothesis that it improves LRR relative to observation while minimizing toxicity, for resected stage I/II MCC.MATERIALS/METHODS: A retrospective, single-institution analysis was completed for stage I/II MCC patients receiving SF-PORT following surgical management. The primary objective was estimating the LRR, defined as recurrence within 2 cm of the primary tumor. Patients with resected, stage I/II MCC with at least one high-risk feature were offered C-PORT as standard of care or SF-PORT as an alternative.RESULTS: Forty-six patients (median age: 74.5; range 50-96 years) received SF-PORT to the primary tumor site at a median 44 days after wide local excision (85%), shave/excisional biopsy (13%), or Mohs (2%). Fifty-four percent of patients had 1 high-risk feature, 35% had 2, and 11% had 3 or more. HN (74%) was the most common primary site, 26% of tumors were > 1cm, 26% were LVI+, and 15% of patients were immunosuppressed (pathological margin status was often not available). There were no local recurrences (LRR = 0%) at a median follow-up time of 2.3 years. In-field locoregional control was 96% (44/46 patients) with 2 in-field, regional recurrences observed in draining nodal basins of HN primary lesions. There were 2 out-of-field regional nodal recurrences (1 patient with IMS; neither received elective nodal SFRT). Of 9 patients who received elective nodal SF-PORT, 8 did not have a successful sentinel lymph node biopsy. No MCC-specific deaths were observed. The most common side effect was in-field, grade 1 erythema (13%); no side effects > grade 1 (CTCAE v5) were noted.CONCLUSION: SF-PORT is associated with a very low LRR which has proven durable with long-term follow-up. The LRR for SF-PORT appears lower than historical controls treated with surgery alone for patients with resected, stage I/II MCC with high-risk features.

TI  - At what scale should we assess the health of pelagic habitats? Trade-offs between small-scale manageable pressures and the need for regional upscaling
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Major planktonic lifeforms such as diatoms, dinoflagellates, meroplankton and holoplankton have recently shown significant and alarming changes in abundance -mainly downwards trends -around the northwest European shelf. This has major implications for food web connections and for ecosystem services including seafood provision and carbon storage. We have quantified these changes in abundance for 2006-2019/20 using a Plankton Index (PI) and show that the scale of spatial aggregation is critical to the ability of the PI to detect change, understand causal mechanisms, and provide advice to policymakers.We derived PI statistics in the Celtic and North Seas from data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey offshore and England's Environment Agency inshore using three sets of spatial units: (i) Ecohydrodynamic (EHD) units based on hydro-biogeochemical modelling, (ii) 'COMP4 & PRIME; areas based on cluster analysis of satellite data for chlorophyll a and primary productivity, and (iii) English coastal and estuarine Water Framework Directive (WFD) waterbodies. For the largest scale areas, the EHD units (median size 87,000 km2), we find greater change in plankton communities than previously reported, suggesting that these shifts have continued and possibly intensified in recent years. The smaller-scale COMP4 areas (median size 6,700 km2) appear to encompass more spatially coherent changes in plankton community structure than EHD units; at this scale PI values indicate community shifts of greater magnitude. These COMP4 areas provide a reasonable compromise scale for linking offshore plankton communities to large-scale drivers of change such as climate warming. For inshore plankton communities, larger changes are detected at the smaller WFD waterbody scale (median size 11 km2). This scale allows direct links to coastal management measures and is more suitable for linking to land-sourced pressures.Recent integration of the UK's OSPAR and WFD plankton monitoring data management enables the exploration of changes across spatial scales to develop a holistic understanding of ecosystem health. Regional-sea scale derivation of the PI for coastal waters provides a clear indication that changes are occurring, at least in phytoplankton communities, while localised PI statistics offer an additional layer of information which can be an important tool for linking to localised drivers of change including coastal anthropogenic pressures. Broadscale inshore zooplankton monitoring is needed to evaluate the coastal plankton community holistically; zooplankton communities offshore are also changing but these changes cannot currently be linked to coastal processes. Layering information across spatial scales provides a breadth of system-level understanding beyond what any one typology can provide.

TI  - Leveraging High-Resolution Long-Wave Infrared Hyperspectral Laboratory Imaging Data for Mineral Identification Using Machine Learning Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Laboratory-based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an optical non-destructive technology used to extract mineralogical information from bedrock drill cores. In the present study, drill core scanning in the long-wave infrared (LWIR; 8000-12,000 nm) wavelength region was used to map the dominant minerals in HSI pixels. Machine learning classification algorithms, including random forest (RF) and support vector machine, have previously been applied to the mineral characterization of drill core hyperspectral data. The objectives of this study are to expand semi-automated mineral mapping by investigating the mapping accuracy, generalization potential, and classification ability of cutting-edge methods, such as various ensemble machine learning algorithms and deep learning semantic segmentation. In the present study, the mapping of quartz, talc, chlorite, and mixtures thereof in HSI data was performed using the ENVINet5 algorithm, which is based on the U-net deep learning network and four decision tree ensemble algorithms, including RF, gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT), light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM), AdaBoost, and bagging. Prior to training the classification models, endmember selection was employed using the Sequential Maximum Angle Convex Cone endmember extraction method to prepare the samples used in the model training and evaluation of the classification results. The results show that the GBDT and LightGBM classifiers outperformed the other classification models with overall accuracies of 89.43% and 89.22%, respectively. The results of the other classifiers showed overall accuracies of 87.32%, 87.33%, 82.74%, and 78.32% for RF, bagging, ENVINet5, and AdaBoost, respectively. Therefore, the findings of this study confirm that the ensemble machine learning algorithms are efficient tools to analyze drill core HSI data and map dominant minerals. Moreover, the implementation of deep learning methods for mineral mapping from HSI drill core data should be further explored and adjusted.

TI  - Cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles drive pre-metastatic niche formation of lymph node via IFNGR1/JAK1/STAT1-activated-PD-L1 expression on FRCs in head and neck cancer
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of FRCs regulated by cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (CEVs) played in pre-metastatic niche (PMN) formation of lymph node (LN). Materials and methods: The FRCs in sixty fresh cervical LNs from 20 patients were evaluated by flow cytometric analysis. Cells in LN with or without metastasis were analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). CEVs were isolated from the culture supernatant of primarily cultured cancer cells and cocultured with FRCs. Mass Spectrometry was used to identify LN metastasis related protein in CEVs. The activation of IFNGR1/JAK1/ STAT1-activated-PD-L1 pathway in FRCs was detected by western blotting. FRCs were co-cultured with CD8+ T lymphocytes to confirm the cytotoxicity assay of FRCs. Results: The proportion of fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) was significantly higher in micro-metastatic LN in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients (HNSCC, p < 0.05) and scRNA-seq analysis further showed a high focus of extracellular vesicles-related pathway on FRCs in LN with metastasis (p < 0.05). Interferon gamma receptor 1 (IFNGR1) in CEVs can be engulfed by FRCs and promote PD-L1 expression on FRCs via JAK1-STAT1 pathway, resulting in an increased CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Conclusion: IFNGR1, originated from cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles, promote PD-L1 expression on FRCs and subsequent CD8+ T cell exhaustion via JAK1-STAT1 activation, which facilitate pre-metastatic niche formation and tumor metastasis in sentinel lymph node in HNSCC.

TI  - Long-term urban land use data in Maputo, Mozambique: A comprehensive dataset covering five decades (1964-2001).
T2  - Data in brief
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Rapid urban change and expansion pose significant challenges in the Global South, and Maputo, Mozambique, is no exception to this phenomenon. Among the multifaceted dimensions of urban transformations, land use stands out as a key factor in urban planning. The implications on environmental aspects, availability of land for public services, and overall quality of life make understanding these issues crucial. This paper aims to address the afore mentioned challenges through a two-fold approach. Firstly, it provides open and free access to urban land use maps of Maputo city spanning five decades in a Geographic Information System (GIS) format, enabling the comprehensive study of the city's transformation over time. Secondly, it presents a detailed and comparable classification and nomenclature of urban land use, ensuring consistency and comparability in research and planning endeavors. The land use maps were created using image interpretation techniques, incorporating remote sensing data such as aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite images, as well as fieldwork and ancillary data. By combining these diverse sources, a comprehensive and accurate representation of Maputo's urban land use shapes was achieved. This study contributes to the understanding of urban dynamics and their impacts on various aspects of city life in Maputo. The open access data and detailed classification presented here serve as valuable resources for researchers, planners, and policymakers, facilitating informed decision-making, sustainable development, and effective urban management in Maputo and beyond.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) has been substantially changed under the intense oasification in the urban agglomerations on the northern slopes of mid-Tianshan Mountain (UANSTM) and climate change. However, the temporal variations of NPP under the oasification remain unclear, and the relative contribution of oasification and climate change on annual NPP variation is still under debate. By using remote sensing data, reanalysis data, modified Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model, and a machine learning method, we explored the spatial-temporal variation of NPP in the UANSTM region and quantified the contribution of oasification and climate change to NPP variation from 2001 to 2020. Our study indicated that: (1) the NPP presents an overall increasing trend in the most of region and the region presented decreasing trend mainly due to the cropland conversion to the urban area; (2) the oasification-dominated NPP area concentrated in the built-up land and cropland; (3) during 2001-2020, the NPP increased by about 5.4 Tg center dot C, and the contribution of climatic and oasification to NPP increase were quantified (73.1% and 26.9%, respectively); (4) water-related factors was the main driver of NPP variation in the UANSTM region.

TI  - The Retrieval of Forest and Grass Fractional Vegetation Coverage in Mountain Regions Based on Spatio-Temporal Transfer Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation cover of forests and grasslands in mountain regions plays a crucial role in regulating climate at both regional and global scales. Thus, it is necessary to develop accurate methods for estimating and monitoring fractional vegetation cover (FVC) in mountain areas. However, the complex topographic and climate factors pose significant challenges to accurately estimating the FVC of mountain forests and grassland. Existing remote sensing products, FVC retrieval methods, and FVC samples may fail to meet the required accuracy standards. In this study, we propose a method based on spatio-temporal transfer learning for the retrieval of FVC in mountain forests and grasslands, using the mountain region of Huzhu County, Qinghai Province, as the study area. The method combines simulated FVC samples, Sentinel-2 images, and mountain topographic factor data to pre-train LSTM and 1DCNN models and subsequently transfer the models to HJ-2A/B remote sensing images. The results of the study indicated the following: (1) The FVC samples generated by the proposed method (R-2 = 0.7536, RMSE = 0.0596) are more accurate than those generated by the dichotomy method (R-2 = 0.4997, RMSE = 0.1060) based on validation with ground truth data. (2) The LSTM model performed better than the 1DCNN model: the average R-2 of the two models was 0.9275 and 0.8955; the average RMSE was 0.0653 and 0.0735. (3) Topographic features have a significant impact on FVC retrieval results, particularly in relatively high-altitude mountain regions (DEM > 3000 m) or non-growing seasons (May and October). Therefore, the proposed method has better potential in FVC fine spatio-temporal retrieval of high-resolution mountainous remote sensing images.

TI  - Deep Learning and Machine Learning Models for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping with Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Karakoram Highway (KKH) is an international route connecting South Asia with Central Asia and China that holds socio-economic and strategic significance. However, KKH has extreme geological conditions that make it prone and vulnerable to natural disasters, primarily landslides, posing a threat to its routine activities. In this context, the study provides an updated inventory of landslides in the area with precisely measured slope deformation (Vslope), utilizing the SBAS-InSAR (small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar) and PS-InSAR (persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar) technology. By processing Sentinel-1 data from June 2021 to June 2023, utilizing the InSAR technique, a total of 571 landslides were identified and classified based on government reports and field investigations. A total of 24 new prospective landslides were identified, and some existing landslides were redefined. This updated landslide inventory was then utilized to create a landslide susceptibility model, which investigated the link between landslide occurrences and the causal variables. Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models, including convolutional neural networks (CNN 2D), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), are employed. The inventory was split into 70% for training and 30% for testing the models, and fifteen landslide causative factors were used for the susceptibility mapping. To compare the accuracy of the models, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used. The CNN 2D technique demonstrated superior performance in creating the landslide susceptibility map (LSM) for KKH. The enhanced LSM provides a prospective modeling approach for hazard prevention and serves as a conceptual reference for routine management of the KKH for risk assessment and mitigation.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of changes occurring in land use and its impact on land surface temperature.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This study shows how remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) can extract land surface temperature (LST) from the Landsat 5, 7, and 8 datasets. In this research, LST over Kharun's lower catchment, located in Chhattisgarh, India, has been estimated. LST data from 2000, 2006, 2011, 2016, and 2021 were analyzed to see how the LULC pattern changed and how that changed LST. In 2000, the average temperature of the study region was 27.73 °C, whereas in 2021, it reached 33.47 °C. When the average temperature values for each class were determined, it was discovered that forest and adjacent waterbodies had the lowest values, with about 24.15 °C in 2000 and 27.65 °C in 2021, whereas urban regions had more variation in values, ranging from 30.15 °C in 2000 to 38.95 °C in 2021. There could be an increase in LST over time because cities are replacing the green cover. For example, there was a notable increase of 5.74 °C in the mean LST over the research area. The findings revealed that places with extensive urban sprawl had LST between 26 and 45°, which was greater than other natural land cover types, such as vegetation and waterbodies, which was between 24 and 35°. These findings support the suggested method's effectiveness for retrieving LST from the Landsat 5, 7, and 8 thermal bands when combined with integrated GIS approaches. So, the goal of this study is to look at Land Use Change (LUC) and changes in LST using Landsat data and figure out how they are related to LST, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the Normalized Built-up Index (NDBI), which are used as major components.

TI  - Using Sentinel-2-Based Metrics to Characterize the Spatial Heterogeneity of FLEX Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence on Sub-Pixel Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current and upcoming Sun-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) satellite products (e.g., GOME, TROPOMI, OCO, FLEX) have medium-to-coarse spatial resolutions (i.e., 0.3-80 km) and integrate radiances from different sources into a single ground surface unit (i.e., pixel). However, intrapixel heterogeneity, i.e., different soil and vegetation fractional cover and/or different chlorophyll content or vegetation structure in a fluorescence pixel, increases the challenge in retrieving and quantifying SIF. High spatial resolution Sentinel-2 (S2) data (20 m) can be used to better characterize the intrapixel heterogeneity of SIF and potentially extend the application of satellite-derived SIF to heterogeneous areas. In the context of the COST Action Optical synergies for spatiotemporal SENsing of Scalable ECOphysiological traits (SENSECO), in which this study was conducted, we proposed direct (i.e., spatial heterogeneity coefficient, standard deviation, normalized entropy, ensemble decision trees) and patch mosaic (i.e., local Moran's I) approaches to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of SIF collected at 760 and 687 nm (SIF760 and SIF687, respectively) and to correlate it with the spatial heterogeneity of selected S2 derivatives. We used HyPlant airborne imagery acquired over an agricultural area in Braccagni (Italy) to emulate S2-like top-of-the-canopy reflectance and SIF imagery at different spatial resolutions (i.e., 300, 20, and 5 m). The ensemble decision trees method characterized FLEX intrapixel heterogeneity best (R-2 > 0.9 for all predictors with respect to SIF760 and SIF687). Nevertheless, the standard deviation and spatial heterogeneity coefficient using k-means clustering scene classification also provided acceptable results. In particular, the near-infrared reflectance of terrestrial vegetation (NIRv) index accounted for most of the spatial heterogeneity of SIF760 in all applied methods (R-2 = 0.76 with the standard deviation method; R-2 = 0.63 with the spatial heterogeneity coefficient method using a scene classification map with 15 classes). The models developed for SIF687 did not perform as well as those for SIF760, possibly due to the uncertainties in fluorescence retrieval at 687 nm and the low signal-to-noise ratio in the red spectral region. Our study shows the potential of the proposed methods to be implemented as part of the FLEX ground segment processing chain to quantify the intrapixel heterogeneity of a FLEX pixel and/or as a quality flag to determine the reliability of the retrieved fluorescence.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation and Stability of Rice Planting Using Landsat-MODIS Fusion Images from 1990 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dongting Lake Plain is a historic foundation for China's commodity grain production. We used Landsat images to interpret the rice planting pattern from 1990 to 2020 based on the vegetation index curve and crop time window differences. The research aims included the spatiotemporal change in the rice planting area and the multiple cropping index, the transformation properties between single-crop and double-crop, and influence factors of rice cultivation. The findings indicated that the rice planting area has increased by 23.64% over the past 30 years. However, the multiple cropping index decreased by 17.39%. The area of single-crop rice increased by 2.6 times, while the area of double-crop rice decreased by 23.19%, which indicated that the planting intensity of rice has decreased. The area where rice has been steadily planted for 30 years is approximately 5600 km2, accounting for 87% of all rice planting land in this study area. The transformation from double-crop rice to single-crop rice was the most obvious characteristic of internal changes. The marginal benefits of current agricultural policies have decreased. This research may provide a theoretical basis for the refined management of rice and improve agricultural policies. More clouds in the remote sensing image limited the time resolution. Future research may further explore the comprehensive influencing factors.

TI  - Shoulder Muscle Dosimetry and Post-Treatment Rehabilitation Utilization for Early-Stage Breast Cancer Patients.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Rehabilitation services for recovery of impaired physical function following breast cancer treatments are largely underutilized. We previously found that breast cancer survivors treated with radiation who received higher radiation doses to the pectoralis major are more likely to self-report shoulder pain and disability. This study aims to address whether radiation dose delivered to the pectoralis major (Pmaj) and pectoralis minor (Pmin) are correlated with referrals for rehabilitation services post-treatment.MATERIALS/METHODS: A retrospective 1:1 matched case-control study was conducted for breast cancer patients who were and were not referred for breast or shoulder rehabilitation services between 2014-2019 at a single academic institution. Patients were included if they had a lumpectomy and adjuvant radiation without regional nodal irradiation. Cohorts were matched based on age, axillary surgery (none vs. sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)), and use of radiation boost. We used non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests to determine whether Pmaj or Pmin doses (mean, V50Gy, V45Gy, V40Gy, V35Gy, V30Gy, V20Gy) were different between the two groups. Muscle doses were converted to EQD2 assuming an alpha/beta ratio of 2.5.RESULTS: In our study of 30 patients of a median age 57 years (IQR 12.75), 20 (66.67%) patients underwent SLNB in addition to lumpectomy. Median tumor size was 1.1cm (range 0.16 - 7.30cm). Stage was 0 for 11 patients (36.67%), I for 14 patients (46.67%), and II for 5 patients (16.67%). 3D conformal radiation was delivered to the whole breast with a moderately hypofractionated (n = 17) or conventionally fractionated regimen (n = 13). The most common rehabilitation diagnoses were lymphedema (n = 8), scar management (n = 7) and shoulder pain (n = 5). Mean dose to both the Pmaj (20.8Gy vs. 18.6Gy; p = 0.02) and Pmin (30.6Gy vs. 24.6Gy; p = 0.01) were significantly higher in patients who received post-treatment rehabilitation compared to those without. The V40Gy, V35Gy, V30Gy and V20Gy (all p<0.02) for the Pmin and V35Gy, V30Gy and V20Gy for the Pmaj (all p<0.04) were also significantly higher in those who underwent rehabilitation.CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with early-stage breast cancer, increased mean doses to the pectoralis muscles were correlated with increased use of rehabilitation services after radiation. Physicians might consider using these dosimetric data to complement clinical symptoms in the decision-making process for referrals for rehabilitation services. This may help facilitate earlier referral to rehabilitation interventions, which is important since early intervention is correlated with improved shoulder morbidity.

TI  - Optical interpretation of oil emulsions in the ocean-Part III: A three-dimensional unmixing model to quantify oil concentration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of oil distribution and characteristics (e.g., oil type, oil thickness, concentration, volume, etc.) is valuable for oil spill response and post-spill assessment. Optical remote sensing has the advantage of collecting information in multiple spectral bands, thus being able to classify and quantify different oil emulsions. However, most spectral characteristics of oil emulsions have been obtained from laboratory measurements, and it is unclear how to apply these lab-based findings to airborne or satellite observations of highly heterogeneous oil patches. This study proposes a three-dimensional (3D) unmixing model to explain AVIRIS image spectra of oil-containing pixels with both horizontal and vertical mixing effects. Based on the 3D unmixing model, an oil concentration lookup table (LUT) and LUT-based oil concentration mapping method are developed to quantify oil concentrations from AVIRIS observations, with the results validated through the use of a spectral similarity index. Using spatial and spectral resampling simulations, we also propose an approach to extend the LUT to different optical sensors (e.g., Landsat) in order to map oil concentrations, yet such an approach requires further research to validate and improve.

TI  - Non-Ignorable Differences in NIRv-Based Estimations of Gross Primary Productivity Considering Land Cover Change and Discrepancies in Multisource Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) plays an important role in accurately projecting the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate change. Satellite-driven near-infrared reflectance (NIRv) can be used to estimate GPP based on their nearly linear relationship. Notably, previous studies have reported that the relationship between NIRv and GPP seems to be biome-specific (or land cover) at the ecosystem scale due to both biotic and abiotic effects. Hence, the NIRv-based estimation of GPP may be influenced by land cover changes (LCC) and the discrepancies in multisource products (DMP). However, these issues have not been well understood until now. Therefore, this study took the Yellow River basin (YRB) as the study area. This area has experienced remarkable land cover changes in recent decades. We used Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) land cover products (termed MCD12C1 and ESACCI, respectively) during 2001-2018 to explore the impact of land cover on NIRv-estimated GPP. Paired comparisons between the static and dynamic schemes of land cover using the two products were carried out to investigate the influences of LCC and DMP on GPP estimation by NIRv. Our results showed that the dominant land cover types in the YRB were grassland, followed by cropland and forest. Meanwhile, the main transfer was characterized by the conversion from other land cover types (e.g., barren) to grassland in the northwest of the YRB and from grassland and shrubland to cropland in the southeast of the YRB during the study period. Moreover, the temporal and spatial pattern of GPP was highly consistent with that of NIRv, and the average increase in GPP was 2.14 gCm-2yr-1 across the YRB. Nevertheless, it is shown that both LCC and DMP had significant influences on the estimation of GPP by NIRv. That is, the areas with obvious differences in NIRv-based GPP closely correspond to the areas where land cover types dramatically changed. The achievements of this study indicate that considering the land cover change and discrepancies in multisource products would help to improve the accuracy of NIRv-based estimated GPP.

AB  - With an identical design and build, the Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI2) aboard Landsat-9 (L9) complements OLI observations by reducing the global revisit rate of Landsat to 8 days. This study takes advantage of near-coincident OLI2 and OLI observations obtained on 11-17 November 2021 to assess the relative quality of the standard United States Geological Survey (USGS) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (rho(t)) and atmospherically corrected reflectance (aquatic reflectance; rho(AR)(w)) products over bodies of water. The TOA assessment was carried out for all the visible bands, including the panchromatic band, as well as the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands, whereas rho(AR)(w) products were analyzed in the 443, 482, 561, and 655 nm bands. The overlapping areas of OLI-OLI2 rho(w) product pairs were further analyzed for the rigor in corrections for the viewing geometry implemented in selected atmospheric correction (AC) processors, including SeaDAS, ACOLITE, and POLYMER, with products denoted as rho(AR)(w), rho(ac)(w), and rho(pol)(w) , respectively. Overall, we found the OLI2-OLI rho(t) products to be consistent within 0.4% in the visible-near-infrared (VNIR) bands except in the green band (561 nm), where OLI2 records similar to 0.8% larger values than OLI. The two SWIR bands (1610 and 2200 nm) were also found to agree within similar to 2.2% and 2.1%, respectively, with OLI2 being lower in magnitude. The median differences in the standard rho(w) (rho(AR)(w)) were estimated to be similar to 2.4%, 1.5%, 2.3%, and 2.5% in the 443, 482, 561, and 655 nm bands, respectively, which are well within the accepted differences in cross-mission data merging schemes. Further, we show that OLI2's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 7-30% higher than that of OLI in all the bands, likely due to its 14-bit digitization rate, as compared to OLI's 12-bit digitization rate. Our self-consistency assessment of the AC processors for handling the differences in the view zenith angles (Delta VZA) and relative azimuth angles (Delta RAA) of OLI2 and OLI observations suggests that, overall, the processors account for the Sun-sensor geometry differently at different spectral bands. These differences (inconsistencies) amount to average median absolute percentage differences (MAPD) in rho(w) from 0.3 to 5.3% (e.g.,Delta rho(AR)(w) (443 nm, Delta VZA, Delta RAA) = rho(AR,OLI)(w) (443, +6.3,10) - rho(AR,OLI2)(w) (443, +3.9,-13) < 0.5%).More specifically, we found that SeaDAS provides the most optimal corrections for the angular variability as a function of VZA, rho(ac)(w) are most consistent for different ranges of RAAs, and POLYMER performs best in the 443 nm band. We surmise that future (and other existing) AC methods should be tested with Landsat-8/-9 underfly imagery to quantify their performance for tackling the variability in imaging geometry and minimize associated uncertainties. With several missions planned for launch by the end of this decade, it is further emphasized that post-launch tandem maneuvers are essential to creating harmonized multimission data products and, therefore, similar operations should be considered and extended to ensure a broad range of environmental conditions are captured for comprehensive cross-mission analyses.

TI  - Study of the Interseismic Deformation and Locking Depth along the Xidatan-Dongdatan Segment of the East Kunlun Fault Zone, Northeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Based on Sentinel-1 Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The East Kunlun fault zone (EKFZ), located northeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, has experienced several strong earthquakes of magnitude seven or above since 1900. It is one of the most active fault systems and is characterized by left-lateral strike-slip. However, the Xidatan-Dongdatan segment (XDS) of the East Kunlun fault zone (EKFZ) has had no earthquakes for many years, and the Kunlun Mountains MS 8.1 earthquake has a stress loading effect on this segment, so it is widely regarded as a high-risk earthquake gap. To this end, we collected the Sentinel-1 data of the XDS of the EKFZ from July 2014 to July 2019 and obtained the high-precision interseismic deformation field by the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique to obtain the slip rate and locking depth of the XDS of the EKFZ, and the seismic potential of the segment was analyzed. The results are as follows: (1) The LOS deformation field of the XDS of the EKFZ was obtained using Sentinel-1 data of ascending and descending orbits, which indicated that the XDS of the EKFZ is dominated by horizontal motion. Combined with the interference results, it is shown that the strike-slip rate dominates the deformation information of the XDS of the EKFZ. The deep strike-slip rate of the fault is about 6 mm/yr, the deep dip-slip rate is about 2 mm/yr, and the slip-deficit rate on the fault surface is about 6 mm/yr; (2) Combined with the spiral dislocation theory model, the slip rate of the XDS to Xiugou Basin of the EKFZ has a gradually increasing trend, with an average slip rate of 9.6 +/- 2.3 mm/yr and a locking depth of 29 +/- 5 m; (3) The stress accumulation is about 483 +/- 92 years in the XDS of the EKFZ, indicating that the cumulative elastic strain energy of the XDS can produce an MW 7.29 +/- 0.1 earthquake in the future.

TI  - Map-based soil crusting susceptibility assessment using pedotransfer Rules, CORINE and NDVI: A preliminary study in Greece
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Map-based assessment of land degradation processes supports national monitoring and protection of the soil resources, in line with the Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) initiatives. Soil crusting susceptibility, a complex expression of land degradation, with fundamental impact on soil functions, has not yet been estimated in Greek territory. To address this knowledge gap, current research uses well-known pedotransfer rules (PRLeB), partially adjusted to suit the local soil database format. The PRLeB, already applied at European scale, examine the soil crusting problem as a function of fundamental soil char-acteristics. From the first analysis a paradox emerged. Moderately and highly crusting prone soils were encountered in forested areas. This paradox indicated the need for a second formalization of the soil crusting problem (ePRLeB). The CORINE Land Cover (CLC) 2018 and a seasonal vegetation cover index (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI) were used to divide the study area into categories and to capture the tem-poral variability of the problem, accordingly. Three land use categories emerged. The water bodies and the artificial areas were characterized as Non-evaluated areas (NE). Areas with considerable vegetation coverage (NDVI greater than 0.5) were characterized as Non-prone to crusting (NC), and the rest of the areas were characterized as Potentially prone to crusting (PC). The PRLeB approach was applied only to the PC areas. In both formalizations, the physicochemical and textural aspects of soil crusting adopted the same PRLeB. With the first formalization, 15% and 39% of the soils in Greece were characterized as very low and low susceptible to soil crusting respectively. With the second formalization 58 - 63% of the soils were characterized by no and 5 - 7% by very low crusting susceptibility. Current work explored two fundamentally different facets of the soil crusting problem. The first formalization, which can be expressed as the soil susceptibility to crusting, considers crusting as an inherent soil process. The second formalization, expressed as soil crusting susceptibility encounters crusting as a complex phenomenon involving natural but not anthropogenic factors. The study indicated that vegetation and seasonality are important factors in the map-based assessment of the observable soil crusting phenomenon. Also, it was highlighted that the unambiguous problem specification is a critical aspect for complex problem assess-ment and communication, particularly within an interdisciplinary context.

TI  - Digital Mapping of Soil Organic Matter in Northern Iraq: Machine Learning Approach
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is an essential component of soil fertility that plays a vital role in the preservation of healthy ecosystems. This study aimed to produce an SOM-level map of the Batifa region in northern Iraq. Random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models were used to predict the SOM spatial distribution. A total of 96 soil samples were collected from the surface layer (0-30 cm) of both cropland and soil areas in Batifa. In addition, remote sensing data were obtained from Landsat 8, including bands 1-7, 10, and 11. Supplementary variables such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), brightness index (BI), and digital elevation model (DEM) were employed as tools to predict SOM levels across the region. To evaluate the accuracy of the RF and XGBoost models in predicting SOM levels, statistical metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and determination coefficient (R2), were used, with 80% of the data used for prediction and 20% for validation. The findings of this study revealed that the XGBoost model exhibited higher accuracy (MAE = 0.41, RMSE = 0.62, and R2 = 0.92) in predicting SOM than the RF model (MAE = 0.65, RMSE = 0.96, R2 = 0.79). Band 10, DEM, SAVI, and NDVI were identified as the most important predictors for both the models. The methodology employed in this study, which utilizes machine learning models, has the potential to map SOM in similar settings. Furthermore, the results offer significant insights for the stakeholders involved in soil management, thereby facilitating the enhancement of agricultural techniques.

TI  - Climate change and coastal population dynamics in Togo (West Africa)
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is a worldwide phenomenon. Some of the consequences are ocean warming, melting glaciers, sea levels rising and coastal erosion. One of the means for a sustainable management of coastal areas is to have information on the trend of climatic parameters at the local scale as well as the spatial distribution and dynamics of coastal people. This study is a contribution to the assessment of the extent of climatic parameters and dynamics of coastal peoples in Togo. Climatic data like, precipitation, temperature, wind speed, sunshine, tidal gauge and satellite images (Landsat and Sentinel-2 images) for the period from 1988 to 2020 were used. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope test were used for climate trend analysis while settlement area mapping was done using Object-Based Image Analysis method. The results revealed a significant trend in temperature and sea level rise. The temperature analysis showed an increase of trend of 0. 038 & DEG;C/year while the tidal gauge data analysis showed an increase of trend of 13.75 mm/year. The annual trend of other climatic parameters was not significant but record monthly variability which were significant. The settlement areas has changed from 2. 06% to 11. 85% between 1988 and 2020. Near the sea, the settlement pattern is compacted with high density of people. In the inland this pattern is dispersed. In 1980, the population of the maritime region was estimated at 1,042,385 people while in 2022 it was 3,534,991 people. The study concludes that the coastal areas of Togo are hot spots of high population density and facing to the rise in temperature and sea level rise.

TI  - A Model of Seismic Rupture Surface of the Chignik Earthquake (Alaska, USA) July 29, 2021 Based on Satellite Radar Interferometry and GNSS
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new model of seismic rupture surface for the Chignik M-w 8.2 earthquake which occurred off the Alaska Peninsula on July 29, 2021. The model is based on data on surface displacements obtained by satellite radar interferometry from Sentinel-1A and 1B images and on horizontal GPS displacements in the area of this earthquake. We used satellite radar images for the period between July 17 and August 10, 2021, as well as GPS data for the period between July 18 and August 8, 2021. All of these displacements include both coseismic movements and some postseismic displacements. The rupture surface model was developed using F. Pollitz' solution to the problem concerning the displacement field at the surface of a spherical radially stratified planet due to a rectangular rupture inside the planet. The inversion was regularized by requiring that the direction of displacement at each element of the rupture plane be close to a specified direction as given by seismological data. The seismic rupture surface in this model is fitted by a plane extending for 225 km along strike and 126 km along dip, and which is subdivided into 48 identical elements. According to the model derived here, the type of displacement is a nearly pure thrust, with the displacement in general involving all of the rupture zone. The maximum slip was 5.7 m, with the mean slip as averaged over the entire rupture plane being 2.2 m. Assuming the shear modulus to be 32 GPa, we found the seismic moment based on the parameters of the plane we have derived and on the displacements on it as 1.95 x 10(21) Nm (M-w = 8.13), which is near the USGS and GCMT estimates based on seismological data.

TI  - Sea ice surface type classification of ICESat-2 ATL07 data by using data-driven machine learning model: Ross Sea, Antarctic as an example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ICESat-2 (IS2) ATL07 sea ice height product provides precise and accurate measurements of sea ice height for the polar regions. Although the original ATL07 product classifies the sea ice surface into snow-covered ice and open water (dark leads and specular leads), it has two critical issues: (1) it does not distinguish thin ice (gray ice) from thick/snow-covered ice or open water and (2) it involves uncertainties in the dark lead determination. To address these issues and obtain more accurate lead fraction and freeboard estimation, in this study, we assess a data-driven machine learning approach for sea ice surface type classification from the ATL07 product. A total of 17 IS2 tracks covering the Ross Sea in February, March, September, October, and November 2019 are used in this study. For training and testing the neural network (NN) models, we label the ATL07 data into three surface types: thick/snow-covered sea ice, thin/gray sea ice, and open water based on the coincident Sentinel-2 optical images. We use six variables from the ATL07 data: background rate, photon rate, relative surface height, width of height distribution, number of laser pulses, and difference in mean and median height, with the first three variables found to be the most significant in determining surface types. Our spatiotemporal test shows that the NN models can be applied to the ATL07 dataset with similar to 99% accuracy in the Ross Sea, and the beam test shows that the difference in the accuracy for three beams is negligible. While the current ATL07 product captures only similar to 5% of thin ice and similar to 81% of open water correctly, our NN models capture similar to 90% of both open water and thin ice leads successfully. When we qualitatively assess the surface classification of the NN models by using the coincident optical and radar images, our NN models do not show significant misclassification issues both in the daytime and nighttime and both in the winter and summer seasons. Compared to the IS2 ATL10 sea ice freeboard product, the ability of our NN model to separate thin ice and open water from snow-covered/thick ice is significant in freeboard estimation, especially for winter and highly packed sea ice areas. Open water and thin ice classes also improve mapping lead fraction and floe size distribution.

TI  - Automated detection and tracking of medium-large icebergs from Sentinel-1 imagery using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring Antarctic icebergs helps us understand the interaction between ocean, atmosphere, and sea ice in the Southern Ocean. Although gigantic icebergs have been the objects of many remote sensing studies, medium icebergs in the Southern Ocean have been rarely monitored or traced. In this study, we develop an iceberg detection and tracking tool particularly for medium and large icebergs (0.4-10 km2), by using Python programming language and Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery, based on Google Earth Engine (GEE). To detect icebergs, we employ the simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC) and region adjacency graph (RAG) merging for object-based image segmentation and train/test the support vector machine (SVM) model with 6432 labeled segments of iceberg or non-icebergs from 40 images of S1 (2019-2021). Radar backscatter features and morphological features of those segments are used as the inputs of the SVM model. After icebergs are detected in two image scenes of different dates, we track the displacements of detected icebergs by comparing their 1-D shape signals. Our model shows -99% of accuracy in detecting icebergs and - 93-98% of accuracy in tracking icebergs depending on the day difference between image scenes. When using our tool for the monitoring of icebergs in the Amundsen Sea, we find that the iceberg fraction varies from 2% to 8% in 2021 and most of icebergs move westward with a speed of <0.2 km/day.

M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Inner Mongolia grassland is rich in natural vegetation and mineral resources. Based on Landsat5/7/8 NDVI data, we used pixel binary model to invert vegetation coverage of Inner Mongolia grassland area, investigated the stability, spatial distribution, and future evolution trend of vegetation coverage by using Sen+MK and Hurst index, and analyzed the driving factors of the spatial differentiation of vegetation coverage by the optimal parameters-based geographical detector. The results showed that vegetation coverage of Inner Mongolia grassland showed an increasing trend from 2006 to 2020, and the overall spatial pattern was high in the east and low in the west, mainly with great fluctuation. The regions with slight or obvious improvement characteristics (64.8%) were much more than those with slight or severe degradation characteristics (23.2%). Compared with that in the past 15 years, the proportion of degraded vegetation in the future is expected to increase to 36.6%. The central part of Xilin Gol League and Wulanqab in the central grassland area, the western part of Hulunbuir and Erdos in the eastern grassland area, and Wuhai in the western grassland area were at the risk of degradation, which should be paid more attention. Precipitation was the dominant factor of spatial differentiation in Inner Mongolia grassland, while soil type, land use, and air temperature had the most significant synergistic effect.

TI  - Hillslope elements and soil-landscape analysis in Himalayas for characterizing soil quality parameters using digital terrain model and remote-sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hillslope elements and land cover types are primarily determining the spatial variability of soils in the hilly and mountainous landscape. Among the soil forming factors, topography strongly influences pedogenic process and governs the variability of soils in hilly and mountainous landscape. This study mainly focusses on characterizing soil quality parameters distribution based on the hillslope elements and soil-landscape units in the watershed. Digital terrain model (DTM)-derived topographic position index was used to delineate various hillslope elements. Land use/land cover map was generated using random forest machine learning technique. Hillslope elements, land use/land cover types and aspects were integrated in GIS environment to generate soil-landscape unit map of the watershed. Soil samples were collected based on various soil-landscape units to characterize soil quality parameters such as total carbon (TC) soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), aggregate stability (SAS) in the watershed. SOM ranged from 1.6% to 10.05% and higher estimated in shoulder (forest) followed by valley (agriculture) and toe slope (forest). TC and TN contents ranged from 0.93% to 5.84% and 0.11% to 0.38%, respectively. The C:N ratio ranged from 7.96% to 18.31% and high value was found in shoulder (forest) followed by valley (agriculture) and toe slope (forest). SAS under different hillslope elements in the area ranged from 0.0.552 to 0.615 indicating large spatial variation of soil quality parameters. The study indicates that in hilly and mountainous landscape, topography and land cover types have major role in determining soil quality. DTM-based soil-landscape units' delineation can be helpful to study soil quality variability and can be used to generate soil map for the hilly and mountainous watershed. The significance of this study lies in its potential to make substantial contributions to land use planning, sustainable land management and environmental conservation planning in the challenging and ecologically fragile and sensitive Himalayan region.

T2  - WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the future, communication technologies are expected to achieve data rates exceeding 100 Gbps by utilizing higher spectrum, like terahertz wavebands, which have broader bandwidth than 5G. In order to accomplish this goal, the research and development efforts for 6G will concentrate on the utilization of terahertz waves, which have frequencies having range of 100-200 GHz. Nonetheless, application of these bands faces challenges due to their vulnerability to external environmental factors, such as cloud cover, fog, dust, and rain. This research proposes a Machine Learning Models to estimate the Rain induced attenuation at the D and G bands to address these challenges. AMSER-2 Satellite data was used to train the model. Different optimization strategies are used to improve the training model. The obtained results were compared to various related state of art.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for the Treatment of Chemo Brain
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This pilot feasibility study aimed to evaluate the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), and we report here on the first patient. Background: Deleterious cognitive changes due to chemotherapy or CRCI are commonly referred to as "chemo brain". With the increasing survival of cancer patients, this poorly understood and inadequately treated condition will likewise have an increasing toll on individuals and society. Since there is no approved treatment for chemo brain, we have initiated a therapeutic trial using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique approved in many countries for the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric conditions like migraine and depression. Case presentation: A 58-year-old woman, diagnosed 7 years prior with left breast cancer, underwent partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. She then received four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy. Afterwards, she was on tamoxifen for 4 years and then switched to aromatase inhibitors. The patient's CRCI started during chemotherapy and severely impaired her quality of life for an additional two years. In the third year after chemotherapy, the CRCI partially cleared to stabilize to the level at the time of presentation for this trial. The patient continues to have memory difficulties and decreased concentration, which makes multi-tasking very difficult to impossible. She is reliant on memory aids at work and at home. The participant underwent 10 consecutive sessions of TMS during weekdays for 2 weeks. Stimulation was directed to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. After TMS, the participant significantly improved in memory function on neuropsychological testing. While she reported no subjective differences in concentration or memory, she did report an improvement in her sleep. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain before and after TMS showed increased resting-state functional connectivity between the stimulation site and several brain regions. Remarkably, after 6 years of chemo brain and remaining in the same position at work due to her inability to concentrate and multi-task, she applied for and received a promotion 5-6 months after her TMS treatments. Conclusions: This first patient in the phase 1 clinical trial testing of TMS for the treatment of "chemo brain" provided important lessons for feasibility and insights into mechanisms of potential benefit.

TI  - NICE 2022 guidelines on the management of melanoma: Update and implications
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: In July 2022, NICE updated the guidelines on the management of melanoma by lowering the number of follow-up appointments and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) but increasing the number of scans. This study aims to evaluate the implications of executing the new guidelines in terms of cost-effectiveness and personnel. Methods: All patients newly diagnosed with melanoma in 2019 at a regional skin cancer specialist center were reviewed. Data were analyzed for their journey on an idealized pathway modeled over a 5-year follow-up period when adhering to both the previous and new guidelines. Differences in the management of melanoma were elucidated by comparing these changes. The cost was quantified on a perpatient basis and the financial implication on each department was considered. Results: One hundred and ten patients were diagnosed with melanoma in 2019, stages I-III. The changes ease the burden on plastic surgery and dermatology; however, increased pressure is faced by radiologists and histopathologists. An overall cost benefit of & POUND;141.85 perpatient was calculated, resulting in a decrease of 1.22 hospital visits on average and an increase in the time spent there (19.55 min). The additional expenses of implementing the new guidelines due to the added BRAF tests, CT, and ultrasound scans are outweighed by savings from the reduction in follow-up appointments and SLNB. Conclusion: The focus has shifted to less invasive procedures for lower melanoma stages and fewer follow-up appointments, at the expense of more genetic testing and imaging. This paper serves as a useful baseline for other centers to plan their service provision and resource allocation to adhere to the updated guidelines.Crown Copyright & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

TI  - Insights on the Organ-Dependent, Molecular Sexual Dimorphism in the Zebra Mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, Revealed by Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Metabolomics.
T2  - Metabolites
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is extensively used as a sentinel species for biosurveys of environmental contaminants in freshwater ecosystems and for ecotoxicological studies. However, its metabolome remains poorly understood, particularly in light of the potential molecular sexual dimorphism between its different tissues. From an ecotoxicological point of view, inter-sex and inter-organ differences in the metabolome suggest variability in responsiveness, which can influence the analysis and interpretation of data, particularly in the case where males and females would be analyzed indifferently. This study aimed to assess the extent to which the molecular fingerprints of functionally diverse tissues like the digestive glands, gonads, gills, and mantle of D. polymorpha can reveal tissue-specific molecular sexual dimorphism. We employed a non-targeted metabolomic approach using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry and revealed a significant sexual molecular dimorphism in the gonads, and to a lesser extent in the digestive glands, of D. polymorpha. Our results highlight the critical need to consider inter-sex differences in the metabolome of D. polymorpha to avoid confounding factors, particularly when investigating environmental effects on molecular regulation in the gonads, and to a lesser extent in the digestive glands.

TI  - A Place-Based Conceptual Model (PBCM) of Neotricula aperta/Schistosoma mekongi habitat before and after dam construction in the Lower Mekong River
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1971, scientists from Mahidol University in Thailand and the Smithsonian Institution in the USA formed a research team to study a new species of Schistosoma in the Mekong River in Thailand and Laos. The studies, completed during 1971-1973, prior to the construction of any dams or restrictions to the natural flow regime of the Mekong River, provide a unique description of the natural ecological state of the river that can serve as a baseline for current research. The natural transmission of Schistosoma japonicum, Mekong Strain, was first reported on Khong Island, Laos in 1973 using sentinel mice. The first detailed description of the habitat ecology of the snail vector Neotricula aperta was done on-site in 1971 simultaneously with that research and is unique in providing the only description of the river shoreline habitat before any dams were built and any alteration of the natural flow regime was in place. Aggregating current information in a Place-Based Conceptual Model (PBCM) as an organizing template, along with current habitat models that combine ecological data with e-flows, can be developed and used as a tool to predict suitable habitats for snails. The natural flow regime of the Mekong River prior to any impoundments is described with current updates on the potential impacts of climate change and dams with flow-related snail habitat characteristics, including sediment drift and water quality. The application of the PBCM to describe and compare descriptive information on current and potential future N. aperta/S. mekongi habitat is discussed.

TI  - Environmental sampling for typhoidal Salmonellas in household and surface waters in Nepal identifies potential transmission pathways.
T2  - PLoS neglected tropical diseases
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi, fecal-oral transmitted bacterium, have temporally and geographically heterogeneous pathways of transmission. Previous work in Kathmandu, Nepal implicated stone waterspouts as a dominant transmission pathway after 77% of samples tested positive for Salmonella Typhi and 70% for Salmonella Paratyphi. Due to a falling water table, these spouts no longer provide drinking water, but typhoid fever persists, and the question of the disease's dominant pathway of transmission remains unanswered.METHODS: We used environmental surveillance to detect Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A DNA from potential sources of transmission. We collected 370, 1L drinking water samples from a population-based random sample of households in the Kathmandu and Kavre Districts of Nepal between February and October 2019. Between November 2019 and July 2021, we collected 380, 50mL river water samples from 19 sentinel sites on a monthly interval along the rivers leading through the Kathmandu and Kavre Districts. We processed drinking water samples using a single qPCR and processed river water samples using differential centrifugation and qPCR at 0 and after 16 hours of liquid culture enrichment. A 3-cycle threshold (Ct) decrease of Salmonella Typhi or Salmonella Paratyphi, pre- and post-enrichment, was used as evidence of growth. We also performed structured observations of human-environment interactions to understand pathways of potential exposure.RESULTS: Among 370 drinking water samples, Salmonella Typhi was detected in 7 samples (1.8%) and Salmonella Paratyphi A was detected in 4 (1.0%) samples. Among 380 river water samples, Salmonella Typhi was detected in 171 (45%) and Salmonella Paratyphi A was detected in 152 (42%) samples. Samples located upstream of the Kathmandu city center were positive for Salmonella Typhi 12% of the time while samples from locations in and downstream were positive 58% and 67% of the time respectively. Individuals were observed bathing, washing clothes, and washing vegetables in the rivers.IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that drinking water was not the dominant pathway of transmission of Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A in the Kathmandu Valley in 2019. The high degree of river water contamination and its use for washing vegetables raises the possibility that river systems represent an important source of typhoid exposure in Kathmandu.

TI  - Inappropriate nighttime light reduces living comfort
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Living comfort is an important aspect of human well-being and a critical index of sustainable environments. Many environmental factors are associated with living comfort. Nighttime light (NTL) is remote sensing data that is widely used to reflect development level and economic status, and it also represents the lighting intensity in living environments. However, the relationship between NTL and living comfort is poorly understood. Here, we employ linear regression and a random forest model to investigate the direct impact of NTL on living comfort. Our results show that increased NTL is negatively associated with living comfort, but this relationship may be obscured by other factors, such as infrastructure. According to the nonlinear relationship, when the NTL is approximately 10 nW/cm2 & BULL; sr, there is a peak in living comfort. Hence, ensuring a reasonable level of lighting is a key to promoting sustainable development. Our research offers crucial insights that can aid in developing sustainable development policies to enhance livability.

TI  - Optimizing spectral index to estimate the relative chlorophyll content of the forest under the damage of<i> Erannis</i><i> jacobsoni</i> Djak in Mongolia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Jas's Larch Inchworm (Erannis jacobsoni Djak) is a Lepidopteran insect pest that seriously threatens larch forest ecosystems in Mongolia. Damage caused by E. jacobsoni changes the chlorophyll content of forest trees, leading to significant changes in the color of the larch canopy. Chlorophyll content, an important parameter that reflects the physiological state of plants, is expressed as the relative chlorophyll content (RCC) evaluated using a chlorophyll meter. In this study, we estimate the relative chlorophyll content of forest trees damaged by E. jacobsoni by optimizing the spectral index. Four larch forest areas affected by outbreaks of this pest in Ikhtamir, Battsengel, and Tsenkher in the Mongolia Houhangai Province and Binder in the Khentii Province were selected as study areas. Based on the RCC and measured hyperspectral data of forest trees, hyperspectral features such as spectral index (SI) and continuous wavelet coefficients were analyzed. Partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine regression (SVMR), and stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) were used to estimate the RCC of the total damage process and different degrees of damage. The optimized spectral index (OSI) showed the highest potential for estimating the total damage process, exhibiting good estimation accuracy and model stability. For example, in the SVMR model, the R2A of OSI-39 SVMR was 0.077, 0.074, 0.014, and 0.115 higher than those of the traditional spectral index (TSI), bior1.5, coif1, and sym3, respectively, while the RMSE was 0.017, 0.021, 0.014, and 0.048 lower than those of TSI, bior1.5, coif1, and sym3, respectively. In the estimation of different degrees of damage, the estimation performance of OSI was significantly improved compared with that of TSI and had the same potential as that of coif1. TSI, OSI, and coif1 showed the best estimation potential in a moderate degree of damage, of which OSI-SVMR had the best effect (R2A = 0.710 44 and RMSE = 0. 137).The optimization and combination method of SI used in this study will help to facilitate future research. Our findings provide insights into the estimation of RCC at the regional scale and for the effective monitoring of forest pest severity.

TI  - Arctic Plant Responses to Summer Climates and Flooding Events: A Study of Carbon and Nitrogen-Related Larch Growth and Ecosystem Parameters in Northeastern Siberia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Built upon a 5-year field investigation and a 13-year satellite data set, this study examines the intricate interrelationships among ecophysiological parameters of Larix gmelinii trees and the prevailing ecosystem, climatic, and environmental factors present in the Indigirka lowlands of northeastern Siberia. It identified spatial-temporal patterns in July needle nitrogen (N) content as an indicator of N availability from 2009 to 2013. Needle N content (%) revealed distinct yearly values: 2012 (1.31 & PLUSMN; 0.24), 2013 (1.67 & PLUSMN; 0.39), 2009 (1.72 & PLUSMN; 0.15), 2011 (1.84 & PLUSMN; 0.34), and 2010 (2.08 & PLUSMN; 0.25). Positive correlations were found between ecosystem and larch parameters, as well as between September temperature or February/May precipitation and subsequent July ecosystem productivity. Soil moisture (SM) primarily influences N availability across sites, with higher SM levels reducing N availability. However, July air temperature (AT) is the primary driver of interannual N availability changes, with higher temperatures enhancing N availability. Larch photosynthesis is mainly influenced by solar radiation (SR), temperature, N availability, and SM. Annual fluctuations in SR positively impact larch photosynthesis, while high temperatures or wetting events impose limitations on photosynthesis, even if N availability has increased. Consequently, a moderate correlation exists between N availability and photosynthesis across various sites and years (r = 0.422, P = 0.133, n = 14). In summary, this research provides valuable insights into climatic and environmental impacts on larch trees and ecosystems, emphasizing the significance of SM, AT, and SR for predicting future growth patterns of larch.This study investigated nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) levels in July for larch trees growing in the Arctic lowlands of northeastern Siberia. We achieved this by conducting a 5-year field observation from 2009 to 2013, supplemented with a 13-year analysis of satellite data. This allowed us to investigate how climate and environmental factors influence these trees. Larch N levels varied depending on the location and year, and soil moisture (SM) and air temperature (AT) playing crucial roles. Wet conditions increase SM and then limit larch N levels, while warmer temperatures enhance N levels. Larch photosynthesis is influenced by sunlight, AT, N levels, and SM. More sunlight improves photosynthesis, but much warmer temperatures or very wet conditions can limit photosynthesis, even if there is enough N. Interestingly, larch photosynthesis and ecosystem productivity showed similar year-to-year patterns. Decadal analysis highlights how winter conditions are really important in shaping ecosystem productivity during future Julys. Aside from summer conditions, winter conditions may also exert some influence on larch photosynthesis. This study improves our understanding of N and C levels in summer larch trees, emphasizing the significance of climate and environment in their growth and productivity.For larch nitrogen availability in July, soil moisture (SM) controls spatial variations, while air temperature governs interannual fluctuationsFor larch photosynthesis in July, SM shapes spatial variations, while solar radiation and temperature impact interannual changesElevated September air temperatures or increased February/May precipitation will enhance ecosystem productivity in the upcoming July

TI  - Monitoring of Oil Spill Risk in Coastal Areas Based on Polarimetric SAR Satellite Images and Deep Learning Theory
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Healthy coasts have a high ecological service value. However, many coastal areas are faced with oil spill risks. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing technique has become an effective tool for monitoring the oil spill risk in coastal areas. In this study, taking Jiaozhou Bay in China as the study area, an innovative oil spill monitoring framework was established based on Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images and deep learning theory. Specifically, a DeepLabv3+-based semantic segmentation model was trained using 35 Sentinel-1 satellite images of oil films on the sea surface from maritime sectors in different regions all over the world, which not only considered the information from the PolSAR images but also meteorological conditions; then, the well-trained framework was deployed to identify the oil films in the Sentinel-1 images of Jiaozhou Bay from 2017 to 2019. The experimental results show that the detection accuracies of the proposed oil spill detection model were higher than 0.95. It was found that the oil films in Jiaozhou Bay were mainly concentrated in the vicinity of the waterways and coastal port terminals, that the occurrence frequency of oil spills in Jiaozhou Bay decreased from 2017 to 2019, and that more than 80 percent of the oil spill events occurred at night, mainly coming from the illegal discharge of waste oil from ships. These data indicate that, in the future, the PolSAR technique will play a more important role in oil spill monitoring for Jiaozhou Bay due to its capability to capture images at night.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare characteristics of patients with and without physical activity noted in primary care electronic medical records.METHODS: We used pan-Canadian family physician electronic medical record data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPSSSN) to compare patient and provider characteristics on one visit per patient selected at random. Since patients were nested by providers, univariate statistics were explored then a multilevel model was constructed.RESULTS: The dataset included 769,185 patients, of whom 14,828 (1.9%) had physical activity information documented. Male patients, aged 25-34.9, no comorbidities prior to the random visit date, moderate or elevated blood pressure risk categories prior to the random visit date, the least materially deprived quintile, and with median body mass index in the normal category prior to the random visit date had the most physical activity mentions. Of the 879 family physicians in the sample, just over half (56.1%) documented physical activity at least once across their patients. More female physicians and physicians who practised in academic sites documented physical activity. In a two-level logistic model to predict physical activity documented in the randomly selected visit: older than mean patient age, having fewer comorbidities, younger than mean family physician age, academic teaching sites, and electronic medical record systems were statistically significant covariates.CONCLUSIONS: This work adds to existing literature by describing the frequency and the patient and family physician characteristics of physical activity documentation in the Canadian primary care context. Overall, patient physical activity was rarely documented in electronic medical records.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - The research on the surface emissivity directionality is a hot and difficult issue in the international thermal infrared quantitative remote sensing area. The existing emissivity directional models for sandy area in thermal infrared bands have some disadvantages, such as too many prior parameters, low accuracy and poor applicability. Therefore, with the aid of long-time series (2018-2020) multi-angle observations from geostationary-orbit MSG/SEVIRI and polar-orbit AQUA/MODIS, after data pre-processing related to inter-sensor calibration, atmospheric correction, spatial and temporal matching, we retrieved the directional emissivity under different viewing zenith angles (VZAs) between 0 similar to 65 degrees over five pseudo-invariant calibration sites based on the thermal infrared radiation transfer equation, including Algeria3_1km, Algeria5_1km, Libya1_1km, Mauritania1_1km and Mauritania2_1km. Subsequently, a model for retrieving the kilometer-scale directional emissivity was established, and its uncertainty was evaluated. The result shows that the surface emissivity decreases with the increase in VZA, and the directional effect decreases with the increase in the MODIS band central wavelength; Algeria5_1km has the smallest directional effect, and Mauritania1_1km has the strongest effect, the uncertainty of the directional emissivity model in each region increases with VZA, and is better than 3%.

TI  - Burned area detection and mapping using time series Sentinel-2 multispectral images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of burned areas (BAs) is essential for post-disaster reconstruction, air quality assessment, and estimation of fire emissions. Remote sensing has become the most practical means to map global/regional BAs. Space-borne coarse-resolution (250-1000 m) BA products play an essential role in fire-related science and applications, but small BAs are typically poorly represented due to resolution limitations. Moderate-resolution (10-30 m) imagery provides a more detailed spatial extent of BAs, but the various disturbances (e.g., plant phenology, cloud shading, flooding, harvesting, grazing, pests, and diseases) make application on a global scale challenging. Here, we propose an automatic BA detection algorithm based on time series images acquired by the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and the Google Earth Engine. Specifically: (i) We determined an optimal set of spectral indices for MSI images based on global sampling to mitigate the background heterogeneity and BA spectral diversity. (ii) We jointly used three temporal scales, i.e., the single-temporal, dual-temporal, and short-time series MSI images, to identify potential BA regions (i.e., BA candidates). (iii) We integrated multisource active fire (AF) products derived from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Operational Land Imager (OLI), and MSI instead of singlesource products to refine BA candidates. (iv) We constructed an interannual time series to improve the BA candidates not confirmed by AF products. The proposed BA detection method was applied to different land cover and regional scales, including forests, grasslands, savannas, shrublands, and croplands at the regional (scene) and national levels (Portugal). Validation and inter-comparison with similar products demonstrated that the proposed method is reliable: the Dice coefficient of our detection results was improved by -7% and - 9%, respectively, compared to the moderate-resolution BA products (e.g., LBA_CU for the conterminous United States and FireCCISFD20 for sub-Saharan Africa in 2019). These results suggest that the proposed method can accurately and automatically map BAs, providing a foundation for fire monitoring programs and climate change research.

TI  - Retrieving Soil Moisture in the First-Level Tributary of the Yellow River-Wanchuan River Basin Based on CD Algorithm and Sentinel-1/2 Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lanzhou is the only provincial capital city in Northwest China where the main stream of the Yellow River and its tributaries flow through the city. Due to its geographical location and the influence of various factors, it is difficult to evaluate and simulate the climatic, hydrological, and ecological processes of the main stream of the Yellow River and its tributaries in the region. In this study, the Wanchuan River basin, currently undergoing ecological restoration, was selected as the study area. Seasonal backscatter differences generated using Sentinel-1/2 (S1/S2) data and the CD algorithm were used to reduce the effects of surface roughness; vegetation indices, soils, and field measurements were used to jointly characterize the vegetation contribution and soil contribution. Then, SM maps with a grid spacing of 10 m x 10 m were generated in the Wanchuan River basin, covering an area of 1767.78 km(2). To validate the results, optimal factors were selected, and a training set and validation set were constructed. The results indicated a high level of the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.78 and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.08 for the comparison of measured and inverted water contents, indicating that the algorithm retrieved the SM values of the study area well. Furthermore, Box line plots with ERA5-Land and GLDAS confirmed that the algorithm is in good agreement with current SM products and feasibility for soil water content inversion work in the Wanchuan River basin.

TI  - Evaluation and dynamic monitoring of ecological environment quality in mining area based on improved CRSEI index model.
T2  - Heliyon
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Large-scale open-pit mining in mining areas will cause serious damage to the ecological environment. Building a "green mine" is an essential part of implementing sustainable development. In order to explore the changing characteristics of the environmental quality of the open-pit mining area and provide a scientific basis for improving the ecological environment of the mining area. Taking Sijiying open-pit mining area as the research area, based on four Landsat images from 2000 to 2022, the four index components of greenness, humidity, dryness and heat were integrated, and an improved remote sensing ecological index CRSEI was constructed by principal component analysis to dynamically evaluate and monitor the ecological environment quality of the mining area. The results show that the average correlation between CRSEI and the index components is higher than the average correlation between the components, indicating that it has a favorable expression effect on the ecological quality of the mining area. The ecological environmental quality of the study area experienced a shift to the poor grade, and the poor ecological quality area was mainly distributed in industrial and mining land and construction land, with the mean CRSEI of 0.668, 0.474, 0.460 and 0.494, respectively. The results of dynamic monitoring showed that the proportion of ecological improvement area (41.43%) was greater than that of ecological deterioration area (33.29%) in the study area in the past 22 years, and additional restoration efforts should be made to achieve sustainable development of the ecological environment.

TI  - Improving digital mapping of soil organic matter in cropland by incorporating crop rotation
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite human activities are key influencing factors for cropland soil organic matter (SOM), detailed characterization of human activities has always been limited in the digital mapping of SOM due to the lack of proper representations of human's cropland use activities. Crop rotation is an essential human agricultural practice significantly affecting the spatial-temporal variations of SOM due to the periodically dynamic changes of crops. Thus, incorporating crop rotation in the digital soil mapping holds high potential for improving SOM prediction. Here, we applied time-series radar Sentinel-1 and optical Sentinel-2 to map crop rotation systems by a hierarchical rule-based method. Then we explored the effectiveness of incorporating such information in predicting SOM by implementing various combinations of predictive variables. We chose a typical multiple cropping region with various crop rotations in southern China. The model performance was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation. Results showed significant differences in SOM among the crop rotation systems, and the single rice rotated with vegetables has the highest SOM followed by the high-diversity vegetables and long-term orchard systems. Adding crop rotation enhanced the predictability of SOM with a decrease in RMSE by 7% and an increase in R2 by 24%. Furthermore, the crop rotation systems appeared more important in the predictive models than the soil, topographic, and climatic variables. Our results demonstrated the effectiveness of including crop rotation in predicting SOM over complex agricultural landscapes. Our study indicated that human activities should be characterized more detailedly in cropland soil mapping, and that crop rotation containing information on the seasonal dynamics of cropland may be an option for such characterization.

TI  - Analysis of spatial-temporal evolution trends and influential factors of desert-oasis thermal environment in typical arid zone: The case of Turpan-Hami region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a typical geographic landscape unit in the arid zone of northwest China, the distribution of the thermal environment in the substratum of the desert-oasis is of great significance to the monitoring of the ecological environment and the quality of human habitat in the region. The purpose of this research is to reveal the spa-tial-temporal evolution pattern of the thermal environment of the desert-oasis in the Turpan-Hami region from 2005 to 2020 and its trend changes, and to investigate the relationship between natural and human factors and the thermal environment and to conduct a long time series analysis. Firstly, the accuracy of MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data combined with site data was verified. Secondly, the mean-standard deviation method is used to identify desert heat island and oasis cold island zones. Again, the spatial-temporal distribution and change trends of thermal environment are explored by using standard deviation ellipse and spatial autocorre-lation combined with land use/land cover (LULC) types. Finally, based on the multi-source remote sensing data, the natural factors and human factors are selected to explore their correlation with the thermal environment using Pearson correlation analysis. The results show that (1) the desert heat island zones are distributed in the desert areas on the periphery of urban built-up areas in Gaochang District, Shanshan County and Yizhou District of Hami Region. The oasis cold island zones are concentrated in the urban built-up areas of Gaochang District and Yizhou District, mainly because the vegetation coverage of urban built-up areas is higher than that of the pe-ripheral desert areas. (2) The spatial development characteristics of the extremely high temperature (EHT) zone and the high temperature (HT)zone from 2005 to 2020 are "southeast-northeast-northwest" and "southeast-northwest" respectively, and the area of construction land 16a increased by 0.31%. This indicates that the spatial evolution of the thermal environment is closely related to the LULC and the degree of urbanization development. (3) From a four-period image with P < 0.001 and Z > 2.58, the thermal environment displays a high positive spatial correlation with Moran's I values of 0.45, 0.54, 0.47, and 0.45. (4) Temperature (Tem), downward longwave radiation (LWdown), and nighttime light intensity (NPP) all exhibited positive correlations with the LST and are significant in the desert region (p < 0.05); The albedo exhibited negative correlations with the LST and is significant in the grassland and woodland regions (p < 0.05).

AB  - ABSTRACT: Loturco, I, Grazioli, R, Veeck, F, Nakamura, FY, Inacio, M, Schons, P, Preissler, A, Pinto, RS, Pereira, LA, McGuigan, MR, and Cadore, EL. Effects of a short-term detraining period on the strength deficit and functional performance of highly trained soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 37(10): 2058-2063, 2023-The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a 4-week detraining period on the neuromuscular performance of highly trained soccer players. Pre and post detraining, 18 adult soccer players (age: 27 ± 4.9 years; height: 180.2 ± 7.1 cm; body mass [BM]: 78.9 ± 7.6 kg) performed vertical jumps, 20-m linear sprints, curve sprint and change of direction speed tests, and a progressive loading test in the half-squat exercise with loads corresponding to 50, 100, and 150% of the players' BM to assess the peak-force (PF), mean power (MP), and strength-deficit (SDef). Pre and post differences in the variables of interest were analyzed using paired t -tests and effect sizes (ES). No significant changes were detected for vertical jumping height and sprint times. Higher PF at 50 and 100% BM and lower SDef were shown when comparing pre- and postassessments (ES = 0.66, 0.68, 0.55; p = 0.018, 0.016, and 0.046, respectively). The MP at 50 and 100% BM increased significantly after the detraining phase (ES = 0.56, 0.82; p = 0.049 and 0.007, respectively). The results indicate that these athletes were able to maintain and achieve satisfactory levels of performance after a short period of training cessation. Interestingly, some strength- and power-derived parameters improved significantly after short-term detraining, which may have important implications for training programs aimed at maximizing speed and power performance. It is recommended that coaches test their players not only at the beginning but also at the end of the season, to better evaluate variations in performance and thus create more efficient and tailored training strategies.

TI  - Snow Cover Detection Using Multi-Temporal Remotely Sensed Images of Fengyun-4A in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Differentiating between snow and clouds presents a formidable challenge in the context of mapping snow cover over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The frequent presence of cloudy conditions severely complicates the discrimination of snow cover from satellite imagery. To accurately monitor the spatiotemporal evolution of snow cover, it is imperative to address these challenges and enhance the segmentation schemes employed for snow cover assessment. In this study, we devised a pixel-wise classification algorithm based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) called the 3-D Orientation Gradient algorithm (3-D OG), which captures the variations of the gradient direction of snow and clouds in spatiotemporal dimensions based on geostationary satellite "Fengyun-4A" (FY-4A) multi-spectral and multi-temporal optical imagery. This algorithm assumes that the speed and direction of clouds and snow are different in the process of movement leading to their discrepancy of gradient characteristics in time and space. Therefore, in this algorithm, the gradient of the images in the spatiotemporal dimensions is calculated first, and then the movement angle and trend are obtained based on that. Finally, the feature space is composed of the multi-spectral image, gradient image, and movement feature maps, which are used as the input of the SVM. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can identify snow and clouds more accurately during snowfall by utilizing the FY-4A's high temporal resolution image. Weather station data, which was collected during snowstorms in the QTP, were used for evaluating the accuracy of our algorithm. It is demonstrated that the overall accuracy of snow cover segmentation by using the 3-D OG algorithm is improved by at least 12% and 10% as compared to snow products of Fengyun-2 and MODIS, respectively. Overall, the proposed algorithm has overcome the axial swing errors existing in Geostationary satellites and is successfully applied to cloud and snow segmentation in QTP. Furthermore, our study underscores that the visible and near-infrared bands of Fengyun-4A can be used for near real-time snow cover monitoring with high performance using the 3-D OG algorithm.

TI  - Exploring the urban gradient in population health: insights from satellite-derived urbanicity classes across multiple countries and years in sub-Saharan Africa.
T2  - BMJ global health
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - The demographic, ecological and socioeconomic changes associated with urbanisation are linked to changes in disease incidence, health service provision and mortality. These effects are heterogeneous between and within urban areas, yet without a clear definition of what constitutes an 'urban' area, their measurement and comparison are constrained. The definitions used vary between countries and over time hindering analyses of the relationship between urbanisation and health outcomes, evaluation of policy actions and results in uncertainties in estimated differences. While a binary urban-rural designation fails to capture the complexities of the urban-rural continuum, satellite data augmented with models of population density and built-up areas offer an opportunity to develop an objective, comparable and continuous measure which captures urbanisation gradient at high spatial resolution. We examine the urban gradient within the context of population health. We compare the categorisation of urban and rural areas (defined by national statistical offices) used in household surveys in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to an urban-rural gradient derived from augmented satellite data within a geospatial framework. Using nine Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 2005 and 2019 in six SSA countries, we then assess the extent of misalignment between urbanicity based on DHS categorisation compared with a satellite-derived measure, while discussing the implications on the coverage of key maternal health indicators. The proposed indicator provides a useful supplement to country-specific urbanicity definitions and reveals new health dynamics along the rural-urban gradient. Satellite-derived urbanicity measures will need frequent updates to align with years when household surveys are conducted.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are considered one of the most complex and dynamic ecosystems facing various challenges due to anthropogenic disturbance and climate change. The excessive harvesting and land-use change in areas covered by mangrove ecosystems is critical threats to these forests. Therefore, the continuous and regular monitoring of these forests is essential. Fortunately, remote sensing data has made it possible to regularly and frequently monitor this forest type. This study has two goals. Firstly, it combines optical data of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 with Sentinel-1 radar data to improve land cover mapping accuracy. Secondly, it aims to evaluate the SVM machine learning algorithms and random forest to detection and differentiate forest cover from other land types in the Google Earth Engine system. The results show that the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm in the S2 + S1 dataset with a kappa coefficient of 0.94 performs significantly better than when used in the L8 + S1 combination dataset with a kappa coefficient of 0.88. Conversely, the kappa coefficients of 0.89 and 0.85 were estimated for the random forest algorithm in S2 + S1 and L8 + S1 datasets. This again indicates the superiority of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 datasets over Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 datasets. In general, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm yielded better results than the RF random forest algorithm in optical and radar datasets. The results showed that using the Google Earth engine system and machine learning algorithms accelerates the process of mapping mangrove forests and even change detection.

We would like to bring to the notice of the readers that our studies and findings are based on a robust methodology towards identification and interpretation of active fault traces. Based on detailed satellite data interpretations, field evidence, paleoseismic studies and GNSS Geodesy data we suggested that Khetpurali Taksal Fault (KTF) is a major fault system with prominent dextral strike-slip motion which marks the segment boundary between the Central and NW Himalaya. Further, an attempt was also made to understand the role of KTF in regional context. We disagree with the claims made by SR. The quires raised by SR are completely baseless and expose their lack of experience and understanding.

TI  - Rapid monitoring of tea plants under cold stress based on UAV multi-sensor data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of climate change, extreme weather events, represented by frost injury, are increasingly having a negative impact on the growth of tea plants. This has brought huge losses to the tea industry. Traditionally, the freezing injury of tea plants in the field was assessed by vision. This is labor-intensive and subjective. In this research, multimodal remote sensing data from different periods of natural overwintering tea plantations were collected by using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) equipped with multispectral (MS), thermal infrared (TIR) and RGB sensors. And the physiological data of tea leaves on the same day were obtained to construct a tea cold injury score (TCIS). Then, a convolutional neural networks-gate recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) model was improved for estimating TCIS. To better compare the performance of CNN-GRU, a single GRU model and three classical machine learning models were also used for comparison. The study found that: (1) The multimodal data fusion was superior to the unimodal data. The best prediction results were achieved for the combined bimodal MS + RGB data (Rp2 = 0.862, RMSEP = 0.138, RPD = 2.220); (2) The CNN-GRU hybrid model was superior to the other four baseline models. The best effect was achieved based on the multivariate input of MS + RGB (Rp2 = 0.862) or MS + RGB + TIR (Rp2 = 0.850); (3) The accuracy of the model after removing soil features was lower than that of the model without background removal. Therefore, the TCIS-CNN-GRU model combined with multi source remote sensing data can objectively and accurately evaluate the cold injury phenotype of tea plants, making the CNN-GRU model more scientific and promising.

T2  - Data in brief
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This dataset presents global soil organic carbon stocks in mangrove forests at 30 m resolution, predicted for 2020. We used spatiotemporal ensemble machine learning to produce predictions of soil organic carbon content and bulk density (BD) to 1 m soil depth, which were then aggregated to calculate soil organic carbon stocks. This was done by using training data points of both SOC (%) and BD in mangroves from a global dataset and from recently published studies, and globally consistent predictive covariate layers. A total of 10,331 soil samples were validated to have SOC (%) measurements and were used for predictive soil mapping. We used time-series remote sensing data specific to time periods when the training data were sampled, as well as long-term (static) layers to train an ensemble of machine learning model. Ensemble models were used to improve performance, robustness and unbiasedness as opposed to just using one learner. In addition, we performed spatial cross-validation by using spatial blocking of training data points to assess model performance. We predicted SOC stocks for the 2020 time period and applied them to a 2020 mangrove extent map, presenting both mean predictions and prediction intervals to represent the uncertainty around our predictions. Predictions are available for download under CC-BY license from 10.5281/zenodo.7729491 and also as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (global mosaics).

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamic Analysis and Simulation Prediction of Land Use and Landscape Patterns from the Perspective of Sustainable Development in Tourist Cities
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The unreasonable development of land use and use of landscape patterns are the primary causes of the unsustainable growth of tourism cities. Dawa District, a well-known tourist destination in China, was chosen as the research object in order to scientifically evaluate and simulate the dynamic changes in land use. Landsat remote sensing images of the Dawa District from 2011, 2016, and 2021 were processed, using the development of regional tourism in 2016 as the dividing point. Using Arcgis10.3, ENVI5.3, and Fragstats tools, GIS spatial analysis and landscape index analysis were used to explore the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of land use and landscape patterns. The CA-Markov model was used to simulate and predict the land use landscape pattern in 2026. The results show that the rapid expansion of built-up areas in 2011-2021 and the increasing marginal complexity and fragmentation of landscape patterns are the main evolution trends. In 2016, emphasis was placed on sustainable land resources, and the area of forested water gradually recovered. However, the patch density (PD) and number of patches (NP) indices reflecting fragmentation still showed a 1.5-2 fold increase. It is expected that in 2026, the dual pressure of urban development and ecological sustainable construction will enhance connectivity and aggregation, and the ecological environment will gradually recover. At the same time, the competition for various types of land will become increasingly prominent, and agricultural activities will be affected. In summary, optimization strategies are proposed from the perspectives of government, land, landscape, and industry, aiming to promote the sustainable development of land and landscape resources in tourist cities.

TI  - [Improvement and application on the estimation model of windbreak and sand fixation function based on remote sensing soil moisture factor].
T2  - Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Soil moisture factor is one of the important parameters in the study of wind and sand fixation functions of ecosystems. Traditional methods often use potential evaporation, rainfall, and irrigation observed by meteorological stations to estimate soil moisture, which has significant limitations in terms of spatial continuity and data availability. Based on the development of remote sensing technology in soil moisture detection, we selected four remote sen-sing indicators for soil moisture (MODIS evapotranspiration ratio method, SMAP soil moisture ratio method, visible shortwave infrared drought index method, and remote sensing humidity index method) to improve the estimation of soil moisture factor in the modified wind erosion equation model (RWEQ), and used the improved algorithm to analyze the spatiotemporal variations and driving factors of wind prevention and sand fixation services in the northwest region of Liaoning Province from 2001 to 2021. The results showed that the MODIS evapotranspiration ratio method had the highest correlation with traditional meteorological methods in calculating soil moisture. The formula obtained by fitting the two could be used to improve the calculation of soil moisture factor in the RWEQ model. From 2001 to 2021, the wind prevention and sand fixation capacity in the northwest region of Liaoning Province showed strong spatial distribution characteristics in the northern and eastern regions, while weak in the central and western regions. According to Mann-Kendall trend testing, 72.7% of the regions in northwest Liaoning Province were showing an upward trend in their ability to prevent wind and fix sand. The application of geographic detector models for driving factor analysis showed that the change in wind and sand fixation capacity was a process of multiple factors interacting with each other, greatly influenced by soil type, annual wind speed, and economic development level. Moreover, the interaction between various driving factors had a higher impact on wind and sand fixation than that of single factors. The results could improve the RWEQ model estimation and provide technical support for the long-term analysis of ecological function formation mechanisms and driving forces in the northwest region of Liaoning.
AB  - 在生态系统防风固沙功能研究中,土壤湿度因子是重要参量之一。传统方法多使用气象站点观测的潜在蒸发量、降雨量和灌溉量等估算土壤湿度,在空间连续性和数据可利用性方面均具有较大局限。基于遥感技术在土壤湿度探测方面的发展,本研究选择4种土壤湿度的遥感指标(MODIS蒸散比值法、SMAP土壤湿度比值法、可见光-短波红外干旱指数法、遥感湿度指数法)对修正风蚀方程模型(RWEQ)中的土壤湿度因子的计算过程做出改进,并利用改进后的算法分析辽西北地区20012021年防风固沙服务的时空变化及驱动因素。结果表明: MODIS蒸散比值法计算的土壤湿度与传统气象方法的相关性最高,二者经拟合后得到的公式可用于RWEQ模型中土壤湿度因子的计算改进。20012021年,辽西北地区防风固沙能力呈现北部及东部地区较强、中部及西部地区较弱的空间分布特征。经Mann-Kendall趋势检验,辽西北地区72.7%的区域防风固沙能力呈上升趋势。应用地理探测器模型进行驱动因素分析发现,防风固沙能力的变化是一个多因素相互作用的过程,受土壤类型、年均风速以及经济发展水平的影响较大,且各驱动因素之间的交互作用对防风固沙的影响高于单因素的影响。本研究结果可为RWEQ模型估算做出改进,同时为辽西北地区长时间的生态功能形成机制与驱动力分析提供技术支撑。.

TI  - Immuno-endocrine alterations and oxidative stress induced by commercial formulations of pesticides in the tegu lizard (Salvator merianae).
T2  - Environmental toxicology and pharmacology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Recent research has shown the risk of environmental contamination by pesticides in Argentina. Salvator merianae is considered as "sentinel species" for monitoring their effects. We intended to investigate growth, immunological and endocrine functions, and oxidative stress in S. merianae exposed to two commercial brands of the herbicide glyphosate: Roundup and Panzer Gold, as well as, to two insecticides: chlorpyrifos, and cypermethrin. Our results showed a higher increase in growth in animals exposed to Roundup and chlorpyrifos and a lower increase in those exposed to Panzer Gold. Higher total leukocyte and lymphocyte count values were observed in lizards exposed to Panzer Gold. The heterophils/lymphocytes ratio decreased in all treated animals. Regarding lobularity index, natural antibodies titers, and complement system activity values, lizards exposed to cypermethrin had higher values. Low corticosterone levels were observed in animals exposed to Roundup. Our results reveal different toxic effects of pesticides contributing to the knowledge of the pesticides' potential deleterious impact in the habitat of S. merianae.

TI  - Effect of an environmental microplastic mixture from the Seine River and one of the main associated plasticizers, dibutylphthalate, on the sentinel species Hediste diversicolor
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the adverse effects of a microplastic (MP) mixture obtained from litter accumulated in the Seine River (France) compared to those of their major co-plasticizer, dibutylphthalate (DBP), on the sentinel species Hediste diversicolor. A suite of biomarkers has been investigated to study the impacts of MPs (100 mg kg-1 sediment), DBP (38 & mu;g kg-1 sediment) on worms compared to non-exposed individuals after 4 and 21 days. The antioxidant response, immunity, neurotoxicity and energy and respiratory metabolism were investigated using biomarkers. After 21 days, worms exposed to MPs showed an increasing aerobic metabolism, an enhancement of both antioxidant and neuroimmune responses. Energy-related biomarkers demonstrated that the energy reallocated to the defence system may come from proteins. A similar impact was depicted after DBP exposure, except for neurotoxicity. Our results provide a better understanding of the ecotoxicological effects of environmental MPs and their associated-contaminants on H. diversicolor.

TI  - InSAR time series and LSTM model to support early warning detection tools of ground instabilities: mining site case studies
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Early alarm systems can activate vital precautions for saving lives and the economy threatened by natural hazards and human activities. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) products generate valuable ground motion data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Integrating the InSAR products and forecasting models make possible to set up early alarm systems to monitor vulnerable areas. This study proposes a technical support to early warning detection tools of ground instabilities using machine learning and InSAR time series that is capable of forecasting regions affected by potential collapses. A long short-term memory (LSTM) model is tailored to predict ground movements in three forecast ranges (i.e., SAR observations): 3, 4, and 5 multistep. A contribution of the proposed strategy is utilizing adjacent time series to decrease the possibility of falsely detecting safe regions as significant movements. The proposed tool offers ground motion-based outcomes that can be interpreted and utilized by experts to activate early alarms to reduce the consequences of possible failures in vulnerable infrastructures, such as mining areas. Three case studies in Spain, Brazil, and Australia, where fatal incidents happened, are analyzed by the proposed early alert detector to illustrate the impact of chosen temporal and spatial ranges. Since most early alarm systems are site dependent, we propose a general tool to be interpreted by experts for activating reliable alarms. The results show that the proposed tool can identify potential regions before collapse in all case studies. In addition, the tool can suggest an optimum selection of InSAR temporal (i.e., number of images) and spatial (i.e., adjacent measurement points) combinations based on the available SAR images and the characteristics of the study area.

TI  - Adjuvant Radiation Therapy Improves Local Control in the Treatment of Adnexal Carcinoma.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Adnexal carcinoma (AC) is a rare subset of cutaneous malignancies derived from skin adnexa. There are limited data on the role of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). This study investigates outcomes associated with adjuvant RT at our high-volume referral center.MATERIALS/METHODS: Using an institutional pathology database we identified 45 patients with locoregionally-confined AC treated between 2001-2020 with curative intent surgery and RT at initial diagnosis or at the time of locoregionally-confined recurrence. Clinicopathologic variables were described and time to relapse events were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Median age was 64 yrs (IQR 57-71). Primary tumors were in the head and neck (H&N, n = 36, 80%), trunk/extremities (n = 8, 18%) or unknown (n = 1). The most common histologic subtypes were: sebaceous-14 (31%), microcystic adnexal carcinoma-9 (20%), eccrine-6 (13%), and trichilemmal-5 (11%). Twenty-two (50% of known primaries) had PNI. All patients had primary tumor excision. Six had clinically evident lymphadenopathy (13%), all of whom had lymph node dissection (LND). Five patients without evidence of nodal disease (13%) had sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with one having SLN+ disease. Thirty patients (67%) received adjuvant locoregional RT at initial diagnosis with the following targets: 21 (30%) primary only, 4 (13%) nodal only, and 5 (17%) both. Of those receiving nodal RT, 7 (78%) had LN+ LND with 2 of those receiving concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation. Sixteen were treated at recurrence with the following targets: 4 (25%) primary only (1 having had prior adjuvant nodal RT), 4 (25%) nodal only, and 8 (50%) both. Across the full cohort, median RT dose was 60 Gy in 30 fractions. Median follow-up from initial surgical resection was 60 months (IQR 30-160). 5-year LC, NC, DFS and DSS were 71%, 86%, 66%, and 91% respectively. The only evaluated factor associated with better outcome was adjuvant primary site RT (5-yr LC 83% vs. 56%, p = 0.01 and 5-yr DFS 83% vs. 46%, p = 0.0003). All 15 patients with local recurrence (LR) had salvage surgery with median subsequent follow-up of 75 months (IQR 2-94). Overall, 5 patients receiving adjuvant primary site RT at any time (initial or salvage) developed subsequent local recurrence (13%). Of the 8 patients who developed nodal recurrence (NR) during follow-up, 1 received adjuvant nodal RT at initial diagnosis. Six of 7 who did not receive prior RT then received adjuvant nodal RT after LND and only 1 developed subsequent NR.CONCLUSION: AC is a rare skin cancer with a primarily locoregional recurrence pattern. In our experience, adjuvant RT was associated with improved LC which, depending on the tumor location, may help prevent morbid or cosmetically-impactful salvage surgery. Patients with AC would benefit from radiation oncology referral to discuss adjuvant treatment.

TI  - Comparison of gap-filling methods for producing all-weather daily remotely sensed near-surface air temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared remotely sensed near-surface air temperature (Ta) can provide gridded temperature information at relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions, and such measurements are thus widely used as an essential environmental parameter in numerous fields. However, data gaps caused by clouds highly restrict the applicability of remotely sensed Ta. Only a few studies have explored the production of seamless remotely sensed Ta products, and all of them estimated Ta from the gap-filled land surface temperature (LST). This study first estimates the daily minimum, average and maximum Ta of clear-sky pixels from remote sensing data over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Ningxia Autonomous Region (NAR), China, during 2016-2020, and then applies five gap-filling methods, including spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal and two multisource fusion-based gap-filling methods, to fill the data gaps in the remotely sensed Ta data. The performances of these methods under different cloud, terrain and landscape conditions are also assessed. The validation results indicate that the Temporal Fourier analysis (TFA) method exhibits high accuracy, good robustness under various cloud and surface conditions, and good ability to describe spatial details of Ta of cloud-cover areas. It is the most suitable method to fill data gaps in remotely sensed Ta. This study provides a valuable reference for selecting appropriate methods to develop seamless remotely sensed Ta products.

TI  - Ground Truth Validation of Sentinel-2 Data Using Mobile Wireless Ad Hoc Sensor Networks (MWSN) in Vegetation Stands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based remote sensing (RS) data are increasingly used to map and monitor local, regional, and global environmental phenomena and processes. Although the availability of RS data has improved significantly, especially in recent years, operational applications to derive value-added information products are still limited by close-range validation and verification deficits. This is mainly due to the gap between standardized and sufficiently available close-range and RS data in type, quality, and quantity. However, to ensure the best possible linkage of close-range and RS data, it makes sense to simultaneously record close-range data in addition to the availability of environmental models. This critical gap is filled by the presented mobile wireless ad hoc sensor network (MWSN) concept, which records sufficient close-range data automatically and in a standardized way, even at local and regional levels. This paper presents a field study conducted as part of the Durable Environmental Multidisciplinary Monitoring Information Network (DEMMIN), focusing on the information gained with respect to estimating the vegetation state with the help of multispectral data by simultaneous observation of an MWSN during a Sentinel-2A (S2A) overflight. Based on a cross-calibration of the two systems, a comparable spectral characteristic of the data sets could be achieved. Building upon this, an analysis of the data regarding the influence of solar altitude, test side topography and land cover, and sub-pixel heterogeneity was accomplished. In particular, variations due to spatial heterogeneity and dynamics in the diurnal cycle show to what extent such complementary measurement systems can improve the data from RS products concerning the vegetation type and atmospheric conditions.

TI  - Estimation of surface ozone concentration over Jiangsu province using a high-performance deep learning model.
T2  - Journal of environmental sciences (China)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Recently, the global background concentration of ozone (O3) has demonstrated a rising trend. Among various methods, groun-based monitoring of O3 concentrations is highly reliable for research analysis. To obtain information on the spatial characteristics of O3 concentrations, it is necessary that the ground monitoring sites be constructed in sufficient density. In recent years, many researchers have used machine learning models to estimate surface O3 concentrations, which cannot fully provide the spatial and temporal information contained in a sample dataset. To solve this problem, the current study utilized a deep learning model called the Residual connection Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory network (R-ConvLSTM) to estimate daily maximum 8-hr average (MDA8) O3 over Jiangsu province, China during 2020. In this research, the R-ConvLSTM model not only provides the spatiotemporal information of MDA8 O3, but also involves residual connection to avoid the problem of gradient explosion and gradient disappearance with the deepening of network layers. We utilized the TROPOMI total O3 column retrieved from Sentinel-5 Precursor, ERA5 reanalysis meteorological data, and other supplementary data to build a pre-trained dataset. The R-ConvLSTM model achieved an overall sample-base cross-validation (CV) R2 of 0.955 with root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.372g/m3. Model estimation also showed a city-based CV R2 of 0.896 with RMSE of 14.029g/m3, the highest MDA8 O3 in spring being 122.60±31.60g/m3 and the lowest in winter being 69.93±18.48g/m3.

TI  - Supervised Geomorphic Mapping of Himalayan Rivers Based on Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayan region is a hotspot in terms of expected future hydrological and geomorphological variations induced by climate change on proglacial areas and the related implications for human societies established along the downstream rivers. Due to the remoteness of the proglacial zones in the Himalayas and the associated logistical problems in carrying out traditional field and UAV-based morphological monitoring activities, remote sensing here plays a crucial role to monitor past and current fluvial dynamics, which could be used to anticipate future changes; however, there has been, so far, limited research on morphological changes in Himalayan proglacial rivers. To address this gap, a morphological classification model was designed to classify recent changes in Himalayan proglacial rivers using the Google Earth Engine platform. The model is the first of its kind developed for the Himalayan region and uses multispectral S-2 satellite data to delineate submerged water channels, vegetated surfaces, and emerged, unvegetated sediment bars, and then to track their variations over time. The study focused on three training sites: Langtang-Khola (Nepal), Saltoro (Pakistan), and Nubra (Jammu and Kashmir) rivers, and one testing site, the Ganga-Bhagirathi River (India). A total of 900 polygons were used as training samples for the random forest classifier, which were further divided into 70% calibration and 30% validation datasets for the training sites, and a separate validation dataset was acquired from the testing site to assess the model performance. The model achieved high accuracy, with an average overall accuracy of 96% and a kappa index of 0.94, indicating the reliability of the S2 data for modeling proglacial geomorphic features in the Himalayan region. Therefore, this study provides a reliable tool to detect past and current morphological changes occurring in the Himalayan proglacial rivers, which will be of great value for both research and river management purposes.

M3  - Review
AB  - The article presents a revue of the estimates of soil surface moisture, soil water content, and evapotranspiration as elements of water and heat regimes of land surface areas at various spatial scales, made with the use of remote sensing data for Earth in various spectral ranges. In most cases considered in the study, such estimates were obtained with the use of land surface models. A special section is focused on the results of estimating soil surface moisture and water content using satellite data from microwave range, including radar data. Estimates of soil surface moisture content obtained with the use of neural networks are presented. A brief description is given to international hydrological-atmosphere experiments carried out under world research projects aimed to obtain data on the processes of moisture and heat exchange between the land surface and the surface atmosphere layer. Land surface, satellite, and model databases that have been formed using the results of studies in the field under consideration since the mid-1980s are reviewed. Prospects of further studies based on the development of new multispectral instrumentation, the creation of new databases, and the use of a new generation of satellites-global-coverage microsatellites with high-resolution sensors are presented.

TI  - Accuracy of Intraoperative Frozen Section Analysis of Lymph Nodes in Women Undergoing Axillary Sampling for Treatment of Breast Cancer: Single Institution Audit
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node (LN) positivity is an important prognostic factor in breast cancer. Almost 30% clinically node negative (cN0) early breast cancers have positive nodes on pathology, wherein an axillary dissection is done as a second stage surgery. Intra operative frozen section (FS) potentially avoids redo surgery. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective audit for the false negative rate of intraoperative FS, from 2014 to 2018. All cN0 women undergoing upfront surgery, who underwent low axillary sampling (LAS) with FS were included. Results: Of 22,854 breast cancer cases, 2230 underwent LAS, of which 877 were node positive. Intraoperative FS was negative in 1423/2230 (63.81%) cases, of which 71/1423 (4.98%) were false negative, and came positive on final histopathology report (HPR). These 71 women had a median of 5 nodes (mean 4.85) dissected on FS (range 1-12) with a median 1 (mean 1.3) node positive (range 1-6) on HPR. The sensitivity of FS was 91.89% (95% CI, 89.89-93.62), with a negative predictive value of 95.01% (95% CI, 93.84-95.97), accuracy of 96.73% (95% CI, 95.90-97.43) and false negative rate 4.98%. On logistic regression analysis, micrometastasis (Odds ratio (OR) 7.76, 95% CI, 3.49-17.25, P < .001) lobular histology (OR 2.50, 95% CI, 1.007-6.223, P = .04) and nodes dissected (OR 1.18, 95% CI, 1.07-1.30, P = .001) were associated with higher false negative FS, and extra nodal extension (OR 0.32, 95% CI, 0.18-0.57, P <= .001) with lower false negative FS. Conclusion: The high concordance between intraoperative FS and definitive histology, suggests it's routine use for Sentinel lymph node/LAS LN can help avoid a second surgery.

To this end, we trained Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models by using the statistical, geometrical, and textural features of Sentinel-1 SAR data. Our results in the Persian Gulf showed that CNN is superior to RF and SVM classifiers in oil spill detection, as evidenced by the testing accuracy of 95.8%, 86.0%, and 78.9%, respectively. The results suggested utilizing both ascending and descending orbit pass directions to track the movement of oil spill and the underlying transport rate. The proposed methodology enables the detection of probable leaking tankers and platforms, which aids in identifying other sources of oil pollution than tankers and platforms.

TI  - Paddy Rice mapping in fragmented lands by improved phenology curve and correlation measurements on Sentinel-2 imagery in Google earth engine
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely rice crop mapping is important to address the challenges of food security, water management, disease transmission, and land use change. However, accurate rice crop mapping is difficult due to the presence of mixed pixels in small and fragmented rice fields as well as cloud cover. In this paper, a phenology-based method using Sentinel-2 time series images is presented to solve these problems. First, the improved rice phenology curve is extracted based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Land Surface Water Index time series data of rice fields. Then, correlation was taken between rice phenology curve and time series data of each pixel. The correlation result of each pixel shows the similarity of its time series behavior with the proposed rice phenology curve. In the next step, the maximum correlation value and its occurrence time are used as the feature vectors of each pixel to classification. Since correlation measurement provides data with better separability than its input data, training the classifier can be done with fewer samples and the classification is more accurate. The implementation of the proposed correlation-based algorithm can be done in a parallel computing. All the processes were performed on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform on the time series images of the Sentinel 2. The implementations show the high accuracy of this method.

TI  - Is it the Type of Axillary Surgery or the Number of Removed Lymph Nodes That Increases the Risk of Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema (BCRL)? Results from a Prospective Screening Trial.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Axillary surgery has been identified as the main risk factor for BCRL regardless the delivery of regional nodal radiation (RLNR). Yet it remains unknown if it is the type of axillary surgery or the number of removed lymph nodes (LN) that increases BCRL risks.MATERIALS/METHODS: Between 2008 and 2021, 3,350 patients (pts) who received surgery for breast cancer were enrolled in a lymphedema screening trial. Patients with bilateral breast cancer or without axillary surgery were excluded. Perometry was used to assess limb volume preoperatively in all patients. BCRL was defined as a ≥10% relative arm-volume increase arising >3 months postoperatively. The cohort was divided by axillary surgery type: axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Radiation was delivered using 3D conformal technique and RLNR was defined as the usage of anterior supraclavicular field. No hypofractionation was used and doses ranged between 50 and 50.4 Gy in 25-28 fractions. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models compared the cumulative incidence of BCRL and local failure between different patient groups.RESULTS: After applying inclusion criteria, 2,623 pts were available with overall median follow-up s of 6.1 years. Of the entire cohort, 709 (27%) had ALND with a median of 16 LN removed, while 1,914 (73%) received SLNB only with a median of 2 LN removed. The median number of malignant LN and patients receiving RLNR was higher in ALND group compared to SLNB only group. Frequency distribution analysis showed that the main overlap between ALND and SLNB only groups happen in the range of 3-11 LN removed. Therefore, the primary analysis focused only on pts with 3-11 LN across both groups (n = 690: ALND n = 140, SLNB n = 550). The multivariable model adjusted for BMI, RLNR, age and breast surgery showed that in this group with 3-11 LN removed in both cohorts, ALND remained significantly associated with BCRL (HR: 4.2, p<0.0001). Separate analyses for the entire SLNB only group and ALND groups were conducted to evaluate if the BCRL risk increases per each removed LN within the same axillary surgery group. The multivariable analysis for SLNB only pts(N = 1,914) showed that for each LN removed the risk of BCRL did not increase significantly (HR:1.06, p = 0.3), similarly for ALND group (N = 709) for each LN removed (HR:1.02, p = 0.08). For pts with pathologic N2-N3 disease and clinical node negative without neoadjuvant chemotherapy receiving ALND, the number of LN removed did not significantly improve neither Local control (HR:1.02, p = 0.8) nor distant disease survival (HR:1.01, p = 0.6).CONCLUSION: ALND procedure per se is the main risk factor for BCRL not the number of LNs removed. For high-risk pts with >N2 disease, aggressive ALND did not improve tumor outcome. De-escalation with targeted axillary sampling followed by RLNR should be evaluated. Future lymphedema research should account for type of axillary surgery instead of number of LNs removed as a factor. (NCT01521741).

TI  - Ecological monitoring of urban thermal field variance index and determining the surface urban heat island effects in Lahore, Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lahore is the second major metropolitan city in Pakistan in terms of urban population and built-up area, making the city a more ideal place to form the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effects. In the last two decades, the considerable land-use conversion from a natural surface (vegetation) and permeable (waterbody) surface into an impervious (built-up area) surface has lead to an increase in land surface temperature (LST) in Lahore. The human thermal comfort (HTC) of the residents is also impacted by the higher LST. The present study uses multi-temporal Landsat (5 & 8) satellite imageries to examine the ecological and thermal conditions of Lahore between 2000 and 2020. The ecological and thermal conditions of Lahore are assessed by calculating the urban heat islands and UTFVI (urban thermal field variance index), based on LST data which quantitatively assessed the UHI effect and the quality of human life. The outcomes establish that the urban built-up area has increased by 18%, while urban vegetation, vacant land, and waterbody decreased by 13%, 4%, and 0.04%, respectively. In the last 20 years, the mean LST of the study region has risen by about 3.67 & DEG;C. The UHI intensity map shows intensification and a rise in surface temperature variation from 4.5 & DEG;C (2000) to 5.9 & DEG;C (2020). Furthermore, the finding shows that the ecological and thermal conditions are worse in construction sites, transition zones, and urban areas in comparison to nearby rural areas. The lower UTFVI was observed in dense vegetation cover areas while a hot spot of higher UTFVI was predominantly observed in the areas of transition zones and built-up area expansion. Those areas with higher hot spots are more vulnerable to the urban heat island effect. The main conclusions of this study are essential for educating city officials and urban planners in developing a sustainable urban land development plan to reduce urban heat island effects by investing in open green spaces for urban areas of cities.

TI  - Monitoring the physical changes of lakes Bakhtegan and Tashk through land surface temperature and groundwater-level changes using remote-sensing technology
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional methods are inefficient and costly when it comes to collecting information on changes in water level and land surface temperatures (LST). Whereas, satellite data can be used to comprehensively investigate these parameters. By duplicating telemetry data at different times, it is possible to identify and study variable and dynamic phenomena in the environment. Overall, any change in the land surface has severe effects on the weather in these areas. Drying inland lakes is one of the emerging meteorological problems, such as the drying of Bakhtegan and Tashk lakes. The purpose of this research is the changes in Tashk and Bakhtegan lakes. In this study, Landsat 5-8 satellite data and the NDWI index were used to calculate the area of Tashk and Bakhtegan lakes from 1986 to 2018. During the study period, the area of the aforementioned lakes decreased significantly, so Lake Bakhtegan has dried up completely since 2009. As a result of coding LST in the Google Earth Engine system, the average land surface temperature has increased from 22.1 & DEG;C in 1986 to 30.34 & DEG;C in 2018, an increase of more than 8 & DEG;C. Furthermore, using the Grace satellite data and studying the change in groundwater level, it has been found that the highest rate of groundwater drop occurred in 2017 by 20 cm, and there is a general decreasing trend of more than 8 cm/year.

TI  - Artificial intelligence with temporal features outperforms machine learning in predicting diabetes.
T2  - PLOS digital health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Diabetes mellitus type 2 is increasingly being called a modern preventable pandemic, as even with excellent available treatments, the rate of complications of diabetes is rapidly increasing. Predicting diabetes and identifying it in its early stages could make it easier to prevent, allowing enough time to implement therapies before it gets out of control. Leveraging longitudinal electronic medical record (EMR) data with deep learning has great potential for diabetes prediction. This paper examines the predictive competency of deep learning models in contrast to state-of-the-art machine learning models to incorporate the time dimension of risk. The proposed research investigates a variety of deep learning models and features for predicting diabetes. Model performance was appraised and compared in relation to predominant features, risk factors, training data density and visit history. The framework was implemented on the longitudinal EMR records of over 19K patients extracted from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). Empirical findings demonstrate that deep learning models consistently outperform other state-of-the-art competitors with prediction accuracy of above 91%, without overfitting. Fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c and body mass index are the key predictors of future onset of diabetes. Overweight, middle aged patients and patients with hypertension are more vulnerable to developing diabetes, consistent with what is already known. Model performance improves as training data density or the visit history of a patient increases. This study confirms the ability of the LSTM deep learning model to incorporate the time dimension of risk in its predictive capabilities.

TI  - Investigating the Variability in Aerosol Optical Depth and Associated Population Exposure Risk in Pakistan Using MAIAC Data
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - With rapid urbanization and industrialization, atmospheric pollution and health challenges induced by the escalation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) become severe. Therefore, health risk due to AOD has become a hot research topic these days. In this study, we use the AOD dataset of the MCD19A2 product of MODIS C6 and PM2.5 from 2000 to 2022. This study uses the MAIAC AOD of 13 selected cities to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of AOD and PM2.5. AOD in Pakistan continuously increased from 2000 to 2022. The average value of AOD is 3.67. The average value of AOD is high in Bahawalpur (0.73). We observe significant differences in the seasonal variation of AOD across Pakistan. Therefore, the highest value of AOD occurred in summer. AOD had the highest value (0.76) in July. The dry areas of Pakistan have a high value of AOD. Dust and anthropogenic activities are the major sources of high AOD in Pakistan. Generally, the AOD is increasing from 2000 to 2022. The population exposure risk is increasing continuously. The regions that are at high risk are (>9) in Punjab (Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Bahawalpur, Sialkot, Sahiwal, and Rawalpindi) and Sindh (Karachi, Hyderabad). We also evaluate the slope of the population exposure risk. The slope of the population exposure risk keeps increasing from 2000 to 2022.

TI  - Soil moisture at 30 m from multiple satellite datasets fused by random forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a key variable used to characterize the climate process between the land surface and atmosphere, the surface soil moisture (SM) plays an irreplaceable role in the fields of hydrology, meteorology and agriculture. However, the relatively coarse spatial resolution of SM products currently limit the application in water resource management at the field scale. In this study, we proposed a high-spatial-resolution SM retrieval framework based on the random forest algorithm (RF-SM) to integrate in situ SM dataset from in the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN), Landsat 8 optical and thermal observations, soil properties from SoilGrids V2.0, meteorological variables from the fifth generation of the European ReAnalysis (ERA5) dataset and four coarse-scale SM products including the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) and U.S. National Climate Assessment Land Data Assimilation System (NCA-LDAS). Compared to three other machine learning (ML) algorithms [extremely randomized trees (Extra-Trees), gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)], the random forest (RF) algorithm exhibited the best performance against a subset of 100 validation sites with a Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.69 and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.063 m3/m3. In terms of different land cover types and typical sites, RF-SM also showed a better accuracy than any of the individual SM product. Finally, the retrieval framework was applied to map the 30-m resolution SM spatial distributions in five substudy areas in the U.S. The results suggest that it is feasible to retrieve accurate SM at a 30-m spatial resolution from multiple satellite datasets based on the RF algorithm, which has important practical significance for agricultural drought monitoring at the field scale.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We set out to reveal the effects of long-term changes in land use and long-term average climate on the regional biophysical environment in southern Malawi. Object-oriented supervised image classification was performed on Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images from 1990 to 2020 to identify and quantify past and present land use-land cover changes using a support vector machine classifier. Subsequently, using 2000 and 2010 land use-land cover in an artificial neural network, land use-land cover for 2020 driven by elevation, slope, precipitation and temperature, population density, poverty, distance to major roads, and distance to villages data was simulated. Between 1990 and 2020, area of land cover increased in built-up (209%), bare land (10%), and cropland (10%) and decreased in forest (30%), herbaceous (4%), shrubland (20%), and water area (20%). Overall, the findings reveal that southern Malawi is dominantly an agro-mosaic landscape shaped by the combined effects of urban and agricultural expansions and climate. The findings also suggest the need to enhance the machine learning algorithms to improve capacity for landscape modelling and, ultimately, prevention, preparedness, and response to environmental risks.

TI  - The involvement of axillary reverse mapping nodes in patients with node-positive breast cancer
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) procedure is useful in reducing lymphedema. However, concerns regarding oncologic safety have limited the adoption of the ARM procedure. This study aimed to evaluate the involvement of ARM nodes in node-positive breast cancer patients.Materials and methods: Two hundred twenty-three node-positive patients were enrolled in this study: 90 were clinically node-negative, but had one or more positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) (SLN-positive group); 68 were clinicopathologically node-positive (CpN-positive group); and 65 had confirmed nodal involvement and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) (NAC group). All patients underwent axillary lymph node dissection with fluorescent ARM.Results: ARM nodes were involved in 33 (36.7%) patients of the SLN-group. Residual ARM nodes after SLN biopsy were involved in 11 patients (12.2%), including 5 patients (19.2%) with crossover type nodes and 6 patients (9.4%) with non-crossover type nodes. However, the difference in involvement rates between the two types was not high enough to be significant. Of these 11 patients, moreover, four patients had three or more than 3 involved SLNs. On the other hand, the involvement rate of ARM nodes in the NAC group was significantly lower than that of the CpN-positive group (35.4% vs. 64.7%: p < 0.01). Despite lower involvement, the risk of metastases in the ARM nodes was still too high to spare ARM nodes in both the NAC group and CpN-positive group. Conclusions: Suspicious or involved ARM nodes should be removed even when detected in ARM procedure, particularly in NAC-group and CpN-positive-group patients.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd, BASO -The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - Can satellite-retrieved data increase farmers' willingness to insure against drought?-Insights from Germany
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: As the demand for index insurance in Europe remains low, the use of satellite-retrieved data has received considerable research attention because it can reduce the basis risk, increase hedging effectiveness and thus potentially increase the attractiveness of index insurance to farmers. However, there is limited knowledge on farmers' demand and specific preferences for satellite-based index insurance.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to obtain initial insights into farmers' preferences for satellite-based index insur-ance. In particular, farmers' overall preferences for satellite-based compared to precipitation-based index in-surance are investigated. The objective is further deepened by investigating the effect of partially subsidizing index insurance. Finally, we focus on differences in preferences caused by the farmer's individual specific factors as this allows to identify the potential target groups for satellite-based index insurance.METHODS: As satellite-based index insurance is still hard to find in Europe, a discrete choice experiment has been conducted with 127 German farmers. In a hypothetical scenario, farmers had to choose whether or not to insure themselves against drought by purchasing hypothetical index insurance products. Specifically, based on a labeled design, they had to choose between a satellite-based and a precipitation-based index insurance, or could choose not to use either alternative (opt-out). We include other insurance attributes such as premium, strike level and payout as they were rated as important by the farmers.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Mixed logit model results show a preference for both index insurance products against no insurance. Particularly, the average farmer has a statistically significant higher preference for the satellite-based index insurance. In addition, subsidizing satellite-based index insurance has a higher effect on farmers' preferences. Moreover, the latent class model identifies heterogeneous preferences among farmers. Insurers can be advised to incorporate satellite data into the design of index insurance. By integrating them into existing index insurance products or by developing purely satellite-based index insurance, insurers could tailor index insurance better to farmers' preferences. Policymakers can be advised that farmers are differentially sensitive to subsidies. Especially farmers with a stronger preference for the satellite-based index insurance derive a huge increase in utility from subsidies. SIGNIFICANCE: The study provides initial insights into farmers' preferences for satellite-based index insurance that can guide insurers regarding the design of index insurance products and give policymakers insights into how governmental support would change farmers' demand for index insurance.

TI  - Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) For HER2+ Early-Stage Breast Cancer.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Historically, HER2+ breast cancer exhibited poor outcomes and, hence, has not been well-studied among trials of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). We hypothesized that in contemporary practice with effective HER2-targeted agents, patients with HER2+ breast cancer now have excellent disease control and survival outcomes when treated with adjuvant APBI.MATERIALS/METHODS: Using a prospectively-maintained institutional database, we identified all HER2+ breast cancer patients treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) and adjuvant APBI from 2000 - 2022. Salient clinicopathologic parameters were collected, as were receipt of systemic and endocrine therapies. All patients received external beam APBI to a total dose of 40Gy in 10 daily fractions over 2 weeks. We analyzed outcomes including local recurrence (LR), regional recurrence, distant recurrence, and death. Cumulative incidence functions were calculated to estimate the incidence of LR with the competing risk of death. All statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.2.2.RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 52 patients with HER2+ breast cancer (median age 64 years; range 44-87). Nearly all had T1 tumors (98%; median size 15 mm; range 1 - 21 mm). Approximately 10% had multifocal disease, with one exhibiting suspicion for lymphovascular invasion. Most patients had ER+ disease (88%). All patients had negative final surgical margins. Nearly all underwent sentinel node biopsy (94%), with the remainder undergoing no surgical axillary evaluation. 42 (81%) received chemotherapy, 40 (77%) endocrine therapy, and 42 (81%) HER2-directed therapy, most commonly trastuzumab. At 143.8 person-years of follow-up (range 7 - 226 months for each patient), we observed two LR events, at 14 and 26 months, yielding a 2-year LR rate of 3.8%. No regional or distant recurrences were observed, nor were any contralateral invasive breast cancer events or breast-specific mortality events. Two deaths were noted in the cohort, both without evidence of disease.CONCLUSION: Among a cohort of HER2+ early-stage breast cancer patients managed with BCS and APBI, we observed a 2-year LR rate of 3.8% with no regional or distant recurrences, and excellent overall survival. These findings merit longer term follow-up among larger cohorts, although are thus far consistent with the results of contemporary randomized trials of APBI unselected for HER2-status.

M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary For lymph node staging in the early stages of cervical cancer, sentinel lymph node (SLN) assessment, instead of full pelvic lymph node dissection, decreased the postoperative morbidity compared to full pelvic lymph node dissection. Bilateral negative SLN predicts the absence of nodal metastases, but the risk factors for lymph node involvement beyond a positive SLN remain poorly described. Through a pooled analysis of 405 patients with early cervical cancers issued from prospective multicentric cohorts SENTICOL I and II, age and lympho-vascular invasion were retained as predictors of metastasis in non-SLN patients with SLN metastasis in early-stage cervical cancer.Abstract Background: The goal of this study was to identify the risk factors for metastasis in the remaining non-sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in the case of positive SLN in early-stage cervical cancer. Methods: An ancillary analysis of two prospective multicentric databases on SLN biopsy for cervical cancer (SENTICOL I and II) was performed. Patients with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO 2018 IA to IIA1), with bilateral SLN detection and at least one positive SLN after ultrastaging, were included. Results: 405 patients were included in SENTICOL I and Il. Fifty-two patients had bilateral SLN detection and were found to have SLN metastasis. After pelvic lymphadenectomy, metastatic involvement of non-SLN was diagnosed in 7 patients (13.5%). Patients with metastatic non-SLN were older (51.9 vs. 40.8 years, p = 0.01), had more often lympho-vascular space invasion (LVSI) (85.7% vs. 35.6%, p = 0.03), and had more often parametrial involvement (42.9% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis retained age (OR = 1.16, 95% IC = [1.01-1.32], p = 0.03) and LVSI (OR = 25.97, 95% IC = [1.16-582.1], p = 0.04) as independently associated with non-SLN involvement. Conclusions: Age and LVSI seemed to be predictive of non-SLN metastasis in patients with SLN metastasis in early-stage cervical cancer. Larger cohorts are needed to confirm the results and clinical usefulness of such findings.

TI  - Daily detection and quantification of methane leaks using Sentinel-3: a tiered satellite observation approach with Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-5p
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The twin Sentinel-3 satellites have multi-band radiometers which observe in methane-sensitive shortwave infrared bands with daily global coverage and 500 m ground pixel resolution. We investigate the methane observation capability of Sentinel-3 and how its coverage-resolution combination fits between Sentinel-5p and Sentinel-2 within a tiered observation approach for methane leak monitoring. Sentinel-5p measures methane with high precision and daily global coverage, allowing worldwide leak detection but with a coarse spatial resolution of 7 km x 5.5 km. The Sentinel-2 twin satellites have multi-band instruments that can identify source locations of major leaks (> 1 t/h) with their methane observations of 20 m resolution under favorable observational conditions, but these satellites lack daily global coverage.We show that methane enhancements can be retrieved from the shortwave infrared band measurements of Sentinel-3. We report the lowest emission detections by Sentinel-3 in the 8-20 t/h range, depending on location and wind conditions. We demonstrate Sentinel-3's capability of identification and monitoring of methane leaks using two case studies. Near Moscow, Sentinel-3 shows that two major short-term leaks, separated by 30 km, occurred simultaneously at a gas pipeline and appear as a single methane plume in Sentinel-5p data. For another Sentinel-5p leak detection near the Hassi Messaoud oil/gas field in Algeria, Sentinel-3 identifies the leaking facility emitting continuously for 6 days, and Sentinel-2 pinpoints the source of the leak at an oil/gas well. Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 also show the 6-day leak was followed by a four-month period of burning of the leaking gas, suggesting a gas well blowout to be the cause of the leak. We find similar source rate quantifications from plume detections by Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 for these leaks, demonstrating Sentinel-3's utility for emission quantification. We show that zooming in with Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 in synergy allows precise identification, quantification, and monitoring of the sources corresponding to methane plumes observed in Sentinel-5p's global scans.

TI  - Agricultural Land Cover Mapping through Two Deep Learning Models in the Framework of EU's CAP Activities Using Sentinel-2 Multitemporal Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The images of the Sentinel-2 constellation can help the verification process of farmers' declarations, providing, among other things, accurate spatial explicit maps of the agricultural land cover. The aim of the study is to design, develop, and evaluate two deep learning (DL) architectures tailored for agricultural land cover and crop type mapping. The focus is on a detailed class scheme encompassing fifteen distinct classes, utilizing Sentinel-2 imagery acquired on a monthly basis throughout the year. The study's geographical scope covers a diverse rural area in North Greece, situated within southeast Europe. These architectures are a Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a combination of a Recurrent and a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN), and their accuracy is compared to the well-established Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm. The comparative approach is not restricted to simply presenting the results given by classification metrics, but it also assesses the uncertainty of the classification results using an entropy measure and the spatial distribution of the classification errors. Furthermore, the issue of sampling strategy for the extraction of the training set is highlighted, targeting the efficient handling of both the imbalance of the dataset and the spectral variability of instances among classes. The two developed deep learning architectures performed equally well, presenting an overall accuracy of 90.13% (Temporal CNN) and 90.18% (R-CNN), higher than the 86.31% overall accuracy of the RF approach. Finally, the Temporal CNN method presented a lower entropy value (6.63%), compared both to R-CNN (7.76%) and RF (28.94%) methods, indicating that both DL approaches should be considered for developing operational EO processing workflows.

TI  - A Framework for Assessing the Bearing Capacity of Sandy Coastal Soils from Remotely Sensed Moisture Contents
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The strength of partially saturated sand is critical for addressing engineering challenges such as beach trafficability or coastal erosion. Mapping strength remotely would allow for surficial geotechnical characterization despite reduced site access. A framework for estimating and mapping the bearing capacity of sandy beach soils from remotely sensed moisture contents and standard sand characteristics is presented. Toward this goal, the variability of relevant sediment parameters (d60, d10, dry unit weights, porosities, moisture contents, and angles of repose) were documented for the quartz sand beach located near the US Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility in Duck, North Carolina, and were assumed to follow normal distributions. Concurrently, in situ bearing capacity measurements were recorded using a portable free fall penetrometer (PFFP). Measured values were compared to bearing capacities derived using a model for partially saturated sands, resulting in a correlation coefficient, ?, of 0.83 for stations where sediment samples were collected simultaneously. When sediment data was unknown, standard characteristics for medium sand were used to estimate the bearing capacity, yielding ?=0.71 when compared to PFFP deployments. For stations where the estimated and measured bearing capacities did not match (residuals >10 kPa), impacts of upward-directed hydraulic gradients, rapid changes in moisture content, and unit weight estimates are discussed. Finally, the proposed framework is applied to spatially estimate bearing capacities using moisture contents derived from satellite-based data and medium sand characteristics to suggest the safest pathways for a test vehicle. Moisture contents were derived from an optical WorldView-4 image and an image from the X-band synthetic aperture radar Cosmo-SkyMed 2 satellite. The spatial estimates of moisture content and bearing capacity generally follow the expected trends for both images. Shortcomings of the framework for predicting the safest path are discussed, and an alternative analysis using moisture contents is presented.

TI  - Wildfire likelihood in Canadian treed peatlands based on remote-sensing time-series of surface conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - While peatland fires are less common than upland fires, long periods of moisture deficit can increase fuel availability and lead to greater fire risks in peatlands. Peatland fire likelihood is crucial as these ecosystems serve as natural fire breaks under normal hydrological conditions but can easily turn into fuel sources under drought conditions. Furthermore, peatland fires have significant implications for atmospheric pollution, releasing fine particulates, carbon, and mercury emissions. Current frameworks for estimating wildfire likelihood predominantly rely on fuel-moisture indices developed for upland environments, which cannot adequately capture the hydrological and fuel-moisture conditions specific to peatlands. Additionally, common fuel-moisture indices are reliant on station-derived meteorological data, which are scarce in remote areas and therefore imprecise over large portions of sub-Arctic Canada and the boreal forest.Remote sensing data represents a proxy for near real-time surface conditions for remote locations, such as moisture and vegetation, where a time series of remotely-sensed metrics provides information about patterns and trends in local conditions over longer periods. With this in mind, we used SAR (Sentinel-1), multispectral (Sentinel-2) and human infrastructure data as a predictor of wildfire probability in treed peatlands of Canada. We developed a fire probability model based on metrics drawn from a seasonally decomposed time series of SAR backscatter and common multispectral indices of greenness, soil moisture and vegetation moisture. Sample sites were derived from an existing treed peatland map, then the Canadian Forest Service National Burned Area Composite dataset was used to identify fire events within those areas. This study presents a robust and versatile framework for training fire probability models that leverage remote sensing data and temporally-invariant ancillary predictors. Fire probability in peatland locations, given current conditions, was predicted through a model algorithm called extreme gradient boosting. To obtain fire probabilities over a four-week timeframe, the output of the binary classifier was calibrated, transforming its raw scores into more accurate probabilities.This approach showcases the effectiveness of machine learning methods in harnessing seasonally-decomposed remotely sensed time-series to improve fire prediction. The most important predictors of fire likelihood in treed peatlands were found to be multispectral moisturerelated indices (Tasseled cap Wetness and Normalized Difference Moisture Index) and the distance to human infrastructure, which may indicate an overrepresentation of human-caused fires in the predictions. Using subsets of predictors, different iterations of the model demonstrate that incorporating SAR backscatter data can enhance the accuracy of fire likelihood predictions. However, models relying solely on SAR data exhibited lower performance, indicating limited applicability of SAR backscatter in treed peatlands without more advanced filtering and a correction method.The fire likelihood model presented here adds seasonally-detrended time series metrics from remote sensing observations to inform fire risk, independent from meteorological data. Such models could be implemented for a near-real time assessment of fire conditions that could complement the existing framework for fire risk predictions in Canada.

TI  - Mapping Slums in Mumbai, India, Using Sentinel-2 Imagery: Evaluating Composite Slum Spectral Indices (CSSIs)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate geographic data of slums are important for handling urban poverty issues. Previous slum mapping studies using high-resolution or very-high-resolution (HR/VHR) remotely sensed (RS) images are commonly not suitable for city-wide scale tasks. This study aims to efficiently generate a slum map on a city-wide scale using freely accessed multispectral medium-resolution (MR) Sentinel-2 images. Composite slum spectral indices (CSSIs) were initially proposed based on the shapes of spectral profiles of slums and nonslums and directly represent slum characteristics. Specifically, CSSI-1 denotes the normalized difference between the shortwave infrared bands and the red edge band, while CSSI-2 denotes the normalized difference between the blue band and the green band. Furthermore, two methods were developed to test the effectiveness of CSSIs on slum mapping, i.e., the threshold-based method and the machine learning (ML)-based method. Experimental results show that the threshold-based method and the ML-based method achieve intersection over unions (IoU) of 43.89% and 54.45% in Mumbai, respectively. The accuracies of our methods are comparable to or even higher than the accuracies reported by existing methods using HR/VHR images and transfer learning. The threshold-based method exhibits a promising performance in mapping slums larger than 5 ha, while the ML-based method refines mapping accuracies for slum pockets smaller than 5 ha. The threshold-based method and the ML-based method produced the slum map in Mumbai in 2 and 28 min, respectively. Our methods are suitable for rapid large-area slum mapping owing to the high data availability of Sentinel-2 images and high computational efficiency.

TI  - Axillary Surgical Attitude Changing with Retrospective Application of ACOSOG Z0011 Eligible Criteria: An Institutional Evaluation.
T2  - European journal of breast health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) represents the gold standard for axillary surgical staging. The aim of this study was to assess the proportion of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) that could be avoided after retrospective application of the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria and to evaluate the shortterm complications associated with axillary surgery.Materials and Methods: We reviewed breast cancer (BC) patients treated by primary breast-conserving surgery from 2012 to 2015. The percentage of SLNB vs ALND performed before and after the application of the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria was calculated. Complications were analyzed using crosstabs, with p<0.05 considered significant.Results: Two hundred fifty one patients with a median age of 59.3 years were included. BC tumors had a median size of 13 mm and were mostly unifocal (83.9%). There were 30.3% with 1-2 metastatic lymph nodes (MLN). ALND was performed in 44.2%. The patients with 1-2 MLN, had only SLNB in 14.5% of cases. By applying the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria, ALND would have been avoided in 40.2% of patients. At least one postoperative complication was reported after SLNB or ALND for 45.7% and 74.7% of patients respectively. Seroma was the most frequent complication, and occurred in 29.3% of cases after SLNB and in 59.5% after ALND.Conclusion: SNLB is the most commonly used axillary surgical staging procedure in this series (55.8%). With a retrospective application of the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria in our population, ALND could have been avoided for 40.2% patients. Post-operative complications rate was higher after ALND, with a seroma rate at 59.5%.

TI  - Phase I-II Study of Prone Hypofractionated Accelerated Breast and Nodal Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): In patients (pts) with breast cancer, prone radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to reduce heart and lung dose which may decrease late toxicity. Routinely used for whole breast irradiation, its use to treat regional lymph nodes (LNs) is not widespread.MATERIALS/METHODS: In this phase I-II study, pts treated with partial mastectomy or mastectomy with 1-5 pathologically involved LNs underwent whole breast or post-mastectomy RT plus regional nodal irradiation using IMRT to the supraclavicular and level III axillary LNs. Pts who underwent sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) alone (no axillary dissection) had the level I and II axillary LNs included in the RT field. 40.5Gy in 15 daily 2.7Gy fractions with daily concomitant 0.5Gy tumor bed boost was prescribed. Normal tissue dose constraints included heart V5Gy<5%, ipsilateral lung V10Gy<20%, contralateral lung V5Gy<15%, ipsilateral brachial plexus (BP) maximal dose (Dmax)<43Gy, spinal cord Dmax≤37.5Gy, spinal cord + 0.5cm Dmax<41Gy, thyroid contralateral lobe Dmax<16Gy, esophagus V30Gy<50% and Dmax≤40.5Gy. The primary endpoints were dosimetric feasibility and incidence of >grade 2 acute toxicity according to CTCAE, v3.0. The secondary endpoint was late toxicity. Exploratory outcomes were local recurrence, disease free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: Between January 2011 to December 2016, 97 pts with stage IB-IIA breast cancer were enrolled. 66 pts underwent partial mastectomy and 31 pts underwent mastectomy. 16 pts had SLNB alone. 33% (95% CI: 23.8%, 43.3%) met all protocol dose constraints. Heart, contralateral lung, spinal cord and esophagus V30Gy constraints were met by all pts. The ipsilateral lung constraint was met in 95% (95% CI: 88.6%, 98.4%) of plans with a mean V10Gy of 9.44% (SD: 6.08). The BP Dmax constraint was exceeded in 31.6% (95% CI: 22.4%, 41.9%) of plans with a mean increase of 2.86 Gy (SD: 7.92 Gy) over target. The esophageal Dmax<40.5Gy constraint was exceeded in 6 plans with an increase in 0.74 Gy (SD: 0.46 Gy) over target. There were no grade 3 acute toxicities meeting the primary toxicity endpoint. Common acute low-grade toxicities by pt included fatigue (grade 1: 54 [56%]; grade 2: 2 [2%]), esophagitis (grade 1: 8 [8%]; grade 2: 2 [2%]), dermatitis (grade 1: 81 [84%]; grade 2: 6 [6%]). At median and maximum follow up of 8.02 (IQR: 3.31) and 13.3 years, respectively, there were 2 local recurrences (2.1%). DFS and OS were 86.6% (95% CI: 78.2%, 92.7%) and 90.7% (95% CI: 83.1%, 95.7%), respectively. The incidence of pts with maximum grade 1, 2 and 3 late toxicities were 39 (40%), 14 (14%), and 2 (2%), respectively. The maximum grade late toxicities included 1 grade 3 retraction and 2 grade 3 asymmetries. There was no brachial plexopathy or pneumonitis.CONCLUSION: Patients treated with prone hypofractionated hybrid breast/chest wall tangents and IMRT to the regional LNs demonstrate excellent dosimetry to the heart, lungs and spinal cord, minimal acute and late toxicity and excellent clinical outcomes.

TI  - Development and validation of a nomogram for predicting internal mammary sentinel node metastasis in breast cancer patients
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Internal mammary nodes are important in breast cancer prognosis, but their diagnosis is often missed in clinical practice, leading to inaccurate staging and treatment. We developed a validated nomogram to predict the presence of internal mammary sentinel nodes (IMSN) metastasis.Methods: A total of 864 sequential IMSN biopsy procedures from a prospective studies database of 1505 cases were used for model development and validation. Multivariable logistic regression was performed on 519 sequential IMSN biopsy procedures from multi-center data between August 2018 and July 2022 to predict the presence of IMSN metastasis. A nomogram was developed based on the logistic regression model and subsequently applied to 345 sequential IMSN biopsy procedures from single-center data between November 2011 and July 2018. The model's discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.Results: The overall frequency of IMSN metastasis was 17.0% in our study. A predictive model for IMSN metastasis was constructed using tumor size, tumor location, lymphovascular invasion, the number of positive axillary nodes (P < 0.05 for all variables in multivariate analysis), and histological grade (P < 0.05 only in univariate analysis). The nomogram was accurate, with a concordance index of 0.84 in the bootstrapping analysis and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 in the validation population.Conclusion: Our nomogram provides an accurate and validated multivariable predictive model for estimating the individual likelihood of having IMSN metastasis. This may be useful for personalized treatment decisions regarding internal mammary radiotherapy in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Experimental evaluation of four protocols for assessing white-tailed deer browse intensity
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Native and introduced deer populations have expanded on many continents and are now considered primary drivers of ecosystem degradation. Large herbivore management can be controversial, requiring appropriate tools to gauge impacts and guide management decisions. While many different protocols have been proposed to measure deer impacts to vegetation, few have been experimentally validated to assess whether they respond reliably to changes in deer browse intensity. Here we used a network of large (2 ha) long-term deer exclosures in New York State to assess utility and reliability of AVID (Assessing Vegetation Impacts of Deer), the Ten-Tallest, and Twig-Age protocols to capture changes in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) browse intensity. We also assessed whether three herbaceous species: blue-stemmed goldenrod (Solidago caesia), white wood aster (Eurybia divaricata), and zigzag goldenrod (Solidago flexicaulis) could expand upon a red oak (Quercus rubra) Sentinel protocol. Finally, we evaluated whether these four protocols adhered to criteria defined for ecological indicator selection. AVID, Ten-Tallest, and Twig-Age protocols rely on existing vegetation to measure deer browse intensity, which limited their ability to adhere to basic sampling principles and be standardized across different forest types, especially in areas with little vegetation remaining in browse height. The Ten-Tallest protocol did not consis-tently detect differences in deer browse intensity, calling into question its scientific validity. The Sentinel pro-tocol utilizes propagated and planted species, which standardizes impact assessments across sites and captures annual changes in deer browse intensity. Sentinel met nearly all criteria required to function as a reliable deer browse indicator. Validation and selection of additional sentinel species is necessary to build out a portfolio of regionally relevant species that can gauge deer browse intensity across vegetation and habitat types. Of the herbaceous species evaluated, S. caesia showed promise as a new sentinel species, but further evaluations are necessary. Evidence-based deer management will require scientifically rigorous and validated impact monitoring approaches and metrics. We caution against adopting protocols that have not been thoroughly vetted to avoid misguided deer management and policy.

TI  - Satellite imagery and modeling contribute understanding cover crop effect on nitrogen dynamics and water availability
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cover crops (CCs) can affect the cropping systems' N dynamics and soil water content (SWC), but optimizing their potential effects requires knowledge of their growth pattern, N accumulation, and mineralization. For this purpose, a 3-year field experiment was initiated in northeast Italy involving a maize-soybean rotation. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the use of time series vegetation indices (VIs) obtained from the Sentinel-2 satellite for monitoring the growth of CCs and estimating their biomass and N uptake at termination; (ii) investigate the effects of different CCs on cash crop yield and SWC; and (iii) use the simulation model CC-NCALC to predict the nitrogen contribution of CCs to subsequent cash crops. Three CC systems were tested: a fixed treatment with triticale; a 3-year succession of rye, crimson clover, and mustard; and a control with no CCs. Satellite imagery revealed that rye and triticale grew faster during the winter season than clover but slower compared to mustard, which suffered a frost winterkilling. Both grasses and mustard produced greater biomass at termination compared to clover, but none of the CC species affected SWC or yield and N uptake of the cash crop. A net N mineralization of all the CC residues was estimated by the model (except for the N immobilization after triticale roots residues). During the subsequent cash crop season, the estimated clover and mustard N released was around 33%, and the triticale around 3% of their total N uptake, with a release peak 2 months after their termination. The use of remote sensing imagery and a prediction model of CC residue decomposition showed potential to be used as instruments for optimizing the CCs utilization and enhancing cropping water and N fertilization management efficiency; however, it must be further analyzed with other CCs species, environmental conditions, and cropping systems.

TI  - A synergetic approach for quantification and analysis of coal fires in Jharia Coalfield, India
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal monitoring and understanding of the dynamics of coal fires in the Jharia Coalfield (JCF) are required to reduce its effect on sustainable industrial growth, environment & human safety. This research explores temporal dataset of Landsat 8 OLI Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) from 2015 to 2019 to detect, map and quantify coal fire affected areas in JCF at the colliery level. The results indicated that the East Barora, Sijua, Katras, Kusunda, Kustore, Pootkee Balihari, Bastacolla, Jharia, and Lodna are intensely fire-affected collieries with a significant increase in risk area from 4.57 km2 in 2015 to 11.43 km2 in 2019. The central part of the area is highly affected. The extent of coal fire shows temporal fluctuation between 2015 and 2019, but overall exhibit a significant increase from 2.76 km2 to 7.52 km2. Sijua, Katras, Kusunda, Lodna, and Kustor occupying the central and southeastern parts of the JCF, respectively, constitute nearly -85% of the total fire. However, in comparison to the information inferred from the field-based knowledge, the results derived from satellite-based observations are slightly underestimated due to the reason that the coal fire-derived thermal anomalies are the function of depth, intensity and proportion of coal fire in a coarse resolution TIR pixel, structural attributes, interventions from the mining operation and regional land use planning. Further, the risk areas map out using the TIR-based approach have been integrated with the prevailing structural attributes and Landsat 8 OLI-derived surface thermal anomalies, which enabled an understanding of the dynamics of coal fire propagation in JCF.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon monoxide (CO) total column (TC) measurements of the TROPOMI high-resolution orbital spectrometer have been validated by ground-based spectroscopic measurements at sites of the A.M. Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics (OIAP), Russian Academy of Sciences, in Moscow and Zvenigorod for the period from June 28, 2018, to December 31, 2021. Correlation coefficients (R) between TROPOMI orbital data and ground-based stationary data are determined and analyzed. The high values of the correlation coefficient are obtained (R similar to 0.81-0.97) depending on the observation point, spatial averaging, and filtration applied. For different averaging of satellite data, the dependences of correlation parameters on the orbital angles, underlying surface albedo, and the height of atmospheric boundary layer are being investigated. No influence of albedo on the correlation parameters of orbital and ground-based measurements is found for both observation sites. No significant dependence of correlation parameters on the viewing zenith angle is detected either. However, the correlation coefficients depend on the viewing azimuth angles and the height of the atmospheric boundary layer. An increase in the correlation is obtained during observations at viewing azimuth angles of less than 40 degrees (up to R similar to 0.97), as well as under an increase in the height of the atmospheric boundary layer (up to R similar to 0.90).

TI  - Relative performance evaluation of machine learning algorithms for land use classification using multispectral moderate resolution data
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyses of spatial and temporal patterns of land use and land cover through multi-resolution remote sensing data provide valuable insights into landscape dynamics. Land use changes leading to land degradation and deforestation have been a prime mover for changes in the climate. This necessitates accurately assessing land use dynamics using a machine-learning algorithm's temporal remote sensing data. The current study investigates land use using the temporal Landsat data from 1973 to 2021 in Chikamagaluru district, Karnataka. The land cover analysis showed 2.77% decrease in vegetation cover. The performance of three supervised learning techniques, namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Maximum Likelihood classifier (MLC) were assessed, and results reveal that RF has performed better with an overall accuracy of 90.22% and a kappa value of 0.85. Land use classification has been performed with supervised machine learning classifier Random Forest (RF), which showed a decrease in the forest cover (48.91%) with an increase of agriculture (6.13%), horticulture (43.14%) and built-up cover (2.10%). Forests have been shrinking due to anthropogenic forces, especially forest encroachment for agriculture and industrial development, resulting in forest fragmentation and habitat loss. The fragmentation analysis provided the structural change in the forest cover, where interior forest cover was lost by 27.67% from 1973 to 2021, which highlights intense anthropogenic pressure even in the core Western Ghats regions with dense forests. Temporal details of the extent and condition of land use form an information base for decision-makers.Landscape dynamics were assessed in the Chikamagaluru district of Karnataka state over five decadesVegetation decreased by 209.58 sq. km from 65.5% in 1973 to 62.7% in 2021The forest cover has decreased by 48.91% (3527.73 sq. km) with increase in horticulture from 4.35 to 25.05%.Random Forest performed better among machine learning algorithms

TI  - Single-Fraction Pre-Operative Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Pathological Findings.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): to assess pathological results after single-fraction pre-operative stereotactic radiosurgery of early-stage breast cancer.MATERIALS/METHODS: A phase 2 clinical trial to investigate the feasibility of pre-operative radiosurgery for early-stage breast cancer was conducted. Eligible patients are women older than 50 years, with histologically proven breast invasive ductal carcinoma, hormonal receptors positive/human epidermal grow factor receptor 2 negative, any grade, tumor size < 3cm, unifocal, with no nodal involvement, and suitable for breast conservative surgery. An expert radiologist injected ultrasound-guided a fiducial marker to precisely identify tumor positioning. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) is created by adding a 3mm margin to the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV). A single fraction of 30-33 Gy is delivered to 95% of PTV. Patients had a breast MRI scan 6-12 weeks after treatment to evaluate the rate of radiological response. Surgery was performed at 9 to 16 weeks after irradiation.RESULTS: From January 2022 to December 2022, 33 patients underwent single-fraction radiosurgery, of whom 29 had breast conserving surgery (BCS). BCS was performed at 9-10 weeks for the first 14 patients, at 14-16 weeks for 13 patients, and at 18-19 weeks for 2 patients. The pathological response was defined as complete response (pCR) if no residual tumor cells were found, partial response (pPR), or no response. The pPR were also subdivided into 3 subgroups according to the rate of residual disease: < 10%, 10-50%, and > 50%. Two patients (7%) achieved pCR, both treated with 33 Gy and operated at 14 weeks. Twenty-five patients (86%) had pPR, of which 7 patients (24%) had residual disease < 10%, 9 patients (31%) between 10-50% and 9 patients (31%) over 50%. Two patients (7%) had no pathological response. All patients had sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of surgery. Positive micrometastatic nodal involvement was found in 3 patients (11%), of which 2 patients (7%) had macrometastases (pN1a) and received subsequent axillary lymph node dissection. All patients had negative surgical margins. Not any acute and sub-acute surgical complications were observed.CONCLUSION: Single-fraction pre-operative stereotactic radiosurgery for early-stage breast cancer leads to a high rate of complete or partial pathological response with surgery performed at 2-4 months following irradiation.

TI  - Evaluating the feasibility and potential of unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor implementation of forestry best management practices in the coastal plain of the southeastern United States
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared to undisturbed areas, timber harvest activities, including road construction, skid trails, and stream crossings, exhibit the potential for causing erosion and sedimentation if forestry best management practices (BMPs) are not implemented. Forestry BMP monitoring serves as a tool to evaluate BMP implementation status. Conventional on-the-ground BMP monitoring has contributed substantially to assessing BMP implementation. However, conventional on-the-ground surveys can be time consuming. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been rapidly emerging as a new tool for local-scale monitoring. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility and potential of UAVs for monitoring forestry BMPs in the coastal plain of southeastern United States. We compared the performance of UAV-live feed surveys and UAV-created map surveys with conventional on-the-ground surveys across major BMP categories on 30 study sites using BMP guidelines and implementation survey questions from Alabama, Georgia, and Florida for the sites specific to that state (10 sites in each state). The UAV-live feed surveys involved real-time assessments conducted using the live feed function, enabling on-the-spot evaluations. Whereas the UAV-created map surveys entailed autonomous UAV flight to collect imagery specifically for generating maps and facilitating subsequent assessments. We found that using a UAV for monitoring BMPs efficiently provided an overview of a timber harvest area from above. UAV-live feed surveys were as effective as conventional on-the-ground surveys across all major BMP categories. Specifically, the Cramer's V correlation between the responses from UAV-live feed and conventional on-the-ground surveys for all BMP categories, was 0.95 (p < 0.0001) for detecting implemented BMPs and 0.86 (p < 0.0001) for detecting when BMPs were not implemented but needed to be. UAV-created map survey results vs. conventional on-the-ground surveys were not as effective (V of 0.79 for detecting implemented BMPs and 0.46 for detecting BMPs not implemented but needed). Waste and stream crossing BMP implementation were the most difficult to verify using the map surveys, which was not an issue with the live feed surveys due to the capability to evaluate those BMPs at different camera angles. While UAV-created map surveys may be less effective, they provide an observation record that includes a map of the site. This project also developed a standardized framework for using UAVs to monitor forestry BMPs, including instructions and procedures for conducting UAV-live feed and map surveys. In conclusion, a UAV using the live feed function in the field is a feasible option to monitor forestry BMPs.

TI  - Prediction of negative axillary node clearance by sentinel node-positive to total node ratio: a retrospective cohort study.
T2  - Annals of medicine and surgery (2012)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction: Increasing evidence suggests that de-escalation of axillary surgery is safe, without significantly impacting patient outcome. Obtaining positive lymph nodes at a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) can guide decisions toward the requirement of axillary nodal clearance (ANC). However, methods to predict how many further nodes will be positive are not available. This study investigates the feasibility of predicting the likelihood of a negative ANC based on the ratio between positive nodes and the total number of lymph nodes excised at SNB.Methods: Retrospective data from January 2017 to March 2022 was collected from electronic medical records. Patients with oestrogen receptor (ER) positive and HER2 negative receptor disease were included in the study. ER-negative and HER2-positive disease was excluded, alongside patients who had chemotherapy before ANC.Results: Of 102 patients, 58.8% (n=60) had no macrometastasis at ANC. On average, 2.76 lymph nodes were removed at SNB. A higher SNB ratio of positive to total nodes [OR 11.09 (CI 95% 2.33-52.72), P=0.002] had a significant association with positive nodes during ANC. SNB ratio less than or equal to 0.33 (1/3) had a specificity of 79.2% in identifying cases that later had a negative completion ANC, with a 95.8% specificity of no further upgrade of nodal staging.Conclusion: A low SNB ratio of less than 0.33 (1/3) has a high specificity in excluding the upgradation of nodal staging on completion of ANC, with a false-negative rate of less than 5%. This may be used to identify patients with a low risk of axillary metastasis, who can avoid ANC.

TI  - Uncovering the hidden: Leveraging sub-pixel spectral diversity to estimate plant diversity from space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed spectral diversity has emerged as a promising proxy for plant diversity. However, spectral diversity approaches relate image spectra to plant community diversity by only incorporating variation among adjacent pixels, considering each pixel as a homogeneous entity composed of one class, and disregarding the within-pixel variability. Although such approaches might work for remotely-sensed data with fine spatial resolution, they might not be viable solutions to estimate plant diversity using coarse-resolution data from forthcoming spaceborne imagers. To address the limitations associated with spectral diversity approaches, we proposed a novel approach, known as endmember diversity, for remote estimation of plant diversity through quantifying spectral diversity at the sub-pixel level and taking into account the within-pixel variability. The approach consisted of deriving the number and abundance of distinct spectral entities within each pixel via spectral unmixing. In doing so, we considered the spectral signature of each pixel as a mixture of distinct spectral entities, commonly known as endmembers. We then used the per-pixel endmembers and their abundance to calculate different spectral diversity metrics for every pixel. We assessed the performance of the endmember diversity approach at estimating plant taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity based on two experiments using a simulated spectral dataset and a real-world spaceborne DESIS (DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer) dataset. In both experiments, we found significant associations between endmember diversity and in situ plant diversity. Additionally, our method applied to DESIS data outperformed a conventional spectral diversity metric based on the coefficient of variation when applied to 1-m airborne imaging spectroscopy data. Collectively, our results demonstrate the capability of forthcoming spaceborne imagers to monitor local plant diversity.

TI  - Is deeper always better? Evaluating deep learning models for yield forecasting with small data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting crop yields, and especially anomalously low yields, is of special importance for food insecure countries. In this study, we investigate a flexible deep learning approach to forecast crop yield at the provincial administrative level based on deep 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks using limited data. This approach meets the operational requirements-public and global records of satellite data in an application ready format with near real time updates-and can be transferred to any country with reliable yield statistics. Three-dimensional histograms of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and climate data are used as input to the 2D model, while simple administrative-level time series averages of NDVI and climate data to the 1D model. The best model architecture is automatically identified during efficient and extensive hyperparameter optimization. To demonstrate the relevance of this approach, we hindcast (2002-2018) the yields of Algeria's three main crops (barley, durum and soft wheat) and contrast the model's performance with machine learning algorithms and conventional benchmark models used in a previous study. Simple benchmarks such as peak NDVI remained challenging to outperform while machine learning models were superior to deep learning models for all forecasting months and all tested crops. We attribute the poor performance of deep learning to the small size of the dataset available.

TI  - Radioactive remote signatures derived from Sentinel-2 images and field verification in West Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mamuju, West Sulawesi, is an area in Indonesia with high radiation levels. A high radiation dose rate was detected in Adang volcanic rock. Activities related to radioactive minerals contained in rocks and soil may release hazardous radiation into the environment. The study area generally exhibits a highly irregular morphology that provides limited access because of the high slope gradient of the volcanic terrain. Therefore, it is challenging to identify and map minerals carrying radioactive elements via Sentinel-2 remote sensing. Since optical satellite images are superior in land cover detection, we proposed a mapping technique for radioactive carrier minerals based on vegetation indices verified by chlorophyll field measurements. We applied band rationing to identify the distribution of hydrothermal alteration minerals and vegetation stress, while field chlorophyll measurements of Dryopteris marginalis and Nephrolepis exaltata were conducted. The Sentinel-2 color composite of images with 4/2, 8A/11, and 11/12 RGB band ratios revealed the distribution of iron oxide, ferromagnesian silicates, and clay minerals. High levels of uranium (U) were scattered in leucite basalt rocks, with a broad distribution of iron oxide minerals and small amounts of ferromagnesian minerals. In contrast, the presence of thorium was not affected by the presence of these minerals. In addition, band rationing of chlorophyll spectra captured by the red edge vegetation index (REVI) was used as the basis for vegetation stress mapping related to radiation exposure based on the chlorophyll content in ferns in the study area. The REVI image showed an anomalous vegetation stress concordant with the high radioactivity. To obtain more accurate results, ground measurements were also performed to identify the vegetation stress due to the presence of minerals carrying radioactive elements. The areas with radioactive mineralization and vegetation stress were located upstream of the Mamuju River and the Botteng and Ahu areas in Tapalang.

T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): The management of patients with lymph node positive, nonmetastatic cutaneous melanoma has changed significantly with the adoption of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. We compared clinical outcomes and patterns of recurrence of patients with lymph node positive, nonmetastatic cutaneous melanoma who received adjuvant immunotherapy with those who did not receive immunotherapy.MATERIALS/METHODS: Patients with lymph node or in-transit metastasis positive, nonmetastatic cutaneous melanoma diagnosed from 2013-2020 were identified from a prospectively-maintained, single-institution database. Baseline patient demographics and treatment details were recorded. Patients were stratified by receipt of adjuvant immunotherapy. Local and regional recurrence, distant metastasis, first site of recurrence, and overall survival (OS) were recorded, and rates of OS, progression-free survival (PFS), freedom from distant metastasis (ffDM), local recurrence (ffLR), and regional lymph node recurrence (ffRR) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fisher's exact test, and chi-square test of independence were used to analyze variables between groups.RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were included with a median age of 67 years and a median follow-up of 2.9 years. Fifty-six (61%) patients received adjuvant immunotherapy for a median duration of 8.5 months. Fifty-three (58%) patients had a sentinel lymph node dissection alone while thirty-two (35%) had a complete regional lymph node dissection. A median of 3 lymph nodes were removed (range 0-83) with a median of 1 positive lymph node (range 1-15). Twenty-four (26%) patients had extranodal extension, thirty-nine (42%) had ulceration of the primary site, and twenty-eight (30%) had LVSI present. Median age of patients receiving immunotherapy versus those who did not was 63 years versus 72 years (p = 0.02). There were no differences in primary site, disease thickness, Clark stage, primary site ulceration, LVSI, extranodal extension, satellite metastasis, AJCC T- and N-stage, and completion lymph node dissection rates between the groups. Patients receiving immunotherapy had significantly improved OS (HR = 0.3, p = 0.001) with no difference in PFS (HR = 0.6, p = 0.08), ffDM (HR = 0.66, p = 0.28), ffLR (HR = 0.18, p = 0.1), and ffRR (HR = 2.5, p = 0.08). The initial site of recurrence was regional lymph nodes in thirteen (23%) patients receiving immunotherapy versus two (6%) patients who did not receive immunotherapy (p = 0.01). On UVA, male gender, number of positive lymph nodes, clinically positive lymph nodes, extranodal extension, in-transit metastasis, LVSI, and tumor thickness were significant predictors of regional lymph node recurrence.CONCLUSION: Patients with lymph node positive cutaneous melanoma receiving immunotherapy had a higher rate of initial disease progression in the regional lymph nodes compared with patients not receiving immunotherapy.

T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Different regression-based machine learning techniques, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Bagged trees algorithm (BaT), and Boosting trees algorithm (BoT) were adopted for modeling daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) in a semi-arid region (Hemren catchment basin in Iraq). An assessment of the methods with various input combinations of climatic parameters, including solar radiation (SR), wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), and maximum and minimum air temperatures (Tmax and Tmin), indicated that the RF method, especially with Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, and SR inputs, provided the best accuracy in estimating daily ET0 in all stations, while the SVM had the worst accuracy. This work will help water users, developers, and decision makers in water resource planning and management to achieve sustainability.

AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Both interstitial multi-catheter brachytherapy based accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and ultra-hypo-fractionated whole breast irradiation (WBI) with 5 fractions can complete treatment in a short time and result in lower treatment-related costs. Although data are available on their toxicity compared with conventional and hypo-fractionated regimens, there are few data directly comparing these two techniques.MATERIALS/METHODS: This prospective cohort study enrolled early breast cancer patients with negative ink margin, T1 or T2 stage, and tumor size of 3 cm or less, with 0 to 3 positive lymph nodes after adequate axillary dissection or negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (N0-1), regardless of receptor status (ER, PR, HER2neu). Of the total 31 patients, 15 received APBI with multi-catheter interstitial brachytherapy (35 Gy in10 fractions over 5 days with a minimum interval of 6 hours between fractions) and 16 patients received WBI (27 Gy in 5 fractions over 5 days) with either 3DCRT or VMAT technique. Acute toxicity was assessed using the RTOG toxicity grading and breast cosmesis was assessed using the Harvard breast cosmesis score. Toxicity and cosmesis were assessed immediately after treatment, after one month, and after three months of treatment. Results were compared between groups using the Mann Whitney U test.RESULTS: All patients completed a 3-month follow-up after completion of treatment. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of highest grade toxicity (p = 0.97) and acute toxicity immediately after RT (p = 1.0) and after 1 month of RT (p = 0.91). However, at 3 months, more patients in the WBI group had a residual skin reaction than in the APBI group (p = 0.03). There was no statistically significant difference in breast cosmesis scores at any time point. 53.3%, 6.6% had grade 1 and 2 skin toxicities respectively immediately after RT in the APBI group and 62.5% of patients had grade 1 skin toxicity in WBI group. After 1 month 26.6%, 26.6% & 13.3% patients had grade 2, grade 1 and grade 3 toxicities respectively. In the WBI group, at 1 month, 50%, 18.7% and 12.5% patients had grade 1, 3 and 2 skin toxicities respectively. At 3 months, 42.8% and 7.1% of patients in the APBI group had grade 1 and grade 2 toxicities, respectively. In the WBI group, 78.5% and 7.1% of patients had grade 1 and 2 skin toxicities respectively.CONCLUSION: In this study, no difference in acute toxicity or breast cosmesis was demonstrated between APBI-based interstitial brachytherapy and ultra-hypo-fractionated WBI. Since both regimens can be administered within 5 days, the decision between them is challenging for both physicians and patients. This study can be considered hypothesis-generating and used for further planning of equivalence or noninferiority studies.

TI  - Planning for cooler cities in Ghana: Contribution of green infrastructure to urban heat mitigation in Kumasi Metropolis
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the spatial variability of some remote sensing indices representing built-up areas, vege-tation, bareness, and urban heat island (UHI), based on time-series Landsat TM/ETM+ and OLI/TIRS datasets archived for 1980-2020 period from the US Geological Survey's website for Kumasi Metropolitan Area in Ghana. Modules for Land Use Change Evaluation (MOLUSCE) and Cellular Automata Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) algorithms and simulations in QGIS were used to predict future changes (2020-2050) for land-use systems in Kumasi. Findings revealed urbanization/built-up areas (+108.02%) contributed massively to the decline of forest areas (-93.34%) and farmlands/shrubs (-31.53%), thereby making Kumasi lose its once critical green position as the "Garden City of West Africa." UHI moderately and strongly correlated positively against built-up (R-2=0.78, p < 0.0001) and bareness (R-2=0.96, p < 0.0001) indices, respectively. By contrast, UHI showed a statistically significant inverse relationship with the vegetative index (R-2=0.97, p < 0.0001). Future land-use scenarios revealed more forests, waterbodies, and farmlands/shrubs will be lost, influencing urban temperature and water supply. The multipurpose advantages of urban green space are ingrained in the grand urban model. Contextually, the Metropolis's resilience has been hampered by inconsistency in the performance of institutional roles, competition for land ownership rights over green areas, and little investments or prioritization of green spaces. An integrated collaborative governance framework is proposed to unify actions, address power crisis and factors that influence governance of green infrastructure, UHI and land cover change.

TI  - Partial least-squares regression for soil salinity mapping in Bangladesh
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the salinity of the soil along the coast of south-western Bangladesh is the focus of this study. Thirteen soil salinity indicators were computed using the Landsat OLI images, and 241 soil salinity samples were gathered from secondary sources. In this research, partial least-squares regression was used to estimate soil salinity. Soil salinity zones were then divided into five classes based on Jenks natural breaks. There is a strong relationship between soil salinity and several indices, including B2 (Blue band), B5 (Near-Infrared band), SI_1 (Salinity index 1), and SI_2 (Salinity index 2). The correlation between B2 and soil salinity is particularly high, hovering around 0.92. The majority of other factors, however, have a negative or barely positive correlation of -0.260 to 0.032. Very high and high levels of salinity are estimated to cover 29.02% and 13.45% of the study area, respectively, based on the soil salinity map. Finally, cross-validation has been used to see how well the model works to predict soil salinity for a specified weight. Iteration has been done three times in order to assess the model's performance on various subsets of data and produce a more accurate prediction. In the third iteration, PRESS, RSS, and Q2cum values were 1.844826, 3.354687, and 0.9705131, correspondingly, which indicates a higher predictive accuracy. The findings of the study will be useful as a tool for policymakers in the south-western coastal area of Bangladesh who are responsible for integrated coastal zone management.

TI  - Large-scale stresses, decay of River Jamuna and resilience strategies in the Anthropocene
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent decades, many worlds' large rivers have been exceptionally modified by human interference. The principal objective of this study is to investigate the causes and consequences of decay of river Jamuna (distributary of river Bhagirathi-Hooghly). The entire investigation was conducted by the data of historical maps like Rennel's map of Bengal, Hunter's map, digital version of US army map, landsat satellite imageries (1980-MSS, 1990-TM, 2000-TM, 2010-ETM+ and 2020-OLI) and fluvio-hydrological study. Maximum likelihood classification algorithm was used to delineate the land use and land cover classes and Kappa based accuracy assessment indices were also used for the validation. There is no scientific work on this historically important river and afterward, millions of people are also underprivileged from this river ecosystem services due to severe degeneration. In this milieu, it is a genuine research gap. Novelty of the work is exposed the authentic causes of river decay and anthropogenic stressors. Result showed that the average width of river Jamuna has been significantly decreased whereas maximum average width of the channel was recorded in the year 1956 (319.81 m) and the present channel is flowing comparatively within narrow path (69.27 m). Rate of siltation (average rate of siltation 0.23 m/year) on channel bed has been increased due to impacts of channelization. Channel bed, natural levee and proximity floodplain have been encroached by large scale human intervention. LULC patterns showed that the urban built-up area is rapidly amplified from 2000 (22.26%) to 2020 (31.50%) whereas, agricultural and swampy land turned into built up area. Off-take of Jamuna is completely detached from the parent river Bhagirathi-Hooghly in the early 1956 and gradual anthropogenic interferences within river corridor accelerate river decaying processes. River restoration is highly required for sustainable river ecosystem health management and environmental development. Some management strategies have been recommended such as reconnecting of river Jamuna with Bhagirathi-Hooghly, dredging, decommissioning of culvert and sluice gate, cleaning of fishing pool and water hyacinth and sustainable land-use planning.

TI  - Satellite Monitoring of Salinization of Irrigated Soils in Southern Kazakhstan
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of approbation of new approach to monitoring soil salinization in irrigated massifs are presented. It is based on the indirect detection of soil salinization using long-term archive satellite data. The research was carried out by the example of irrigated lands in Maktaaral district, Turkestan oblast of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The frequency and terms of salt removal from soils were used as indicators of soil salinization level and were determined from the long-term (2016 to 2022) archive satellite data Sentinel-1,2 and Landsat-8. Information about the frequency of soil leaching from salts and the year of the last leaching allowed ranking fields by soil salinization degree. Comparison of the information obtained from the small-scale soil map with statistical data on field survey revealed a high similarity of soil salinization in the test region. The same approach may be used for other regions with irrigated soils subjected to secondary salinization. It does not require any additional adaptation and is based on simple algorithms of recognizing water surface by satellite data.

TI  - Large-Scale Controls on the Leaf Economic Spectrum of the Overstory Tree Species <i>Metrosideros polymorpha</i>
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of intraspecific trait variation in functional ecology has gained traction in recent years as many papers have observed its importance in driving community diversity and ecology. Yet much of the work in this field relies on field-based trait surveys. Here, we used continuous canopy trait information derived from remote sensing data of a highly polymorphic tree species, Metrosideros polymorpha, to quantify environmental controls on intraspecific trait variation. M. polymorpha, an endemic, keystone tree species in Hawai'i, varies morphologically, chemically, and genetically across broad elevation and soil substrate age gradients, making it an ideal model organism to explore large-scale environmental drivers of intraspecific trait variation. M. polymorpha canopy reflectance (visible to shortwave infrared; 380-2510 nm) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data collected by the Global Airborne Observatory were modeled to canopy trait estimates of leaf mass per area, chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, total carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, phenols, cellulose, and top of canopy height using previously developed leaf chemometric equations. We explored how these derived traits varied across environmental gradients by extracting elevation, slope, aspect, precipitation, and soil substrate age data at canopy locations. We then obtained the feature importance values of the environmental factors in predicting each leaf trait by training random forest models to predict leaf traits individually. Of these environmental factors, elevation was the most important predictor for all canopy traits. Elevation not only affected canopy traits directly but also indirectly by influencing the relationships between soil substrate age and canopy traits as well as between nitrogen and other traits, as indicated by the change in slope between the variables at different elevation ranges. In conclusion, intraspecific variation in M. polymorpha traits derived from remote sensing adheres to known leaf economic spectrum (LES) patterns as well as interspecific LES traits previously mapped using imaging spectroscopy.

TI  - Estimations for Water Quality Factors of Kumho River, South Korea, using Remote Sensing Technology
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, water quality factors (water temperature, turbidity, T-P, T-N, Chl-a) in the downstream of the Kumho River were simulated through multiple regression analysis using remote sensing data of the Landsat 8 satellite. The approach for simulating water quality factors in Kumho River using Landsat 8 satellite data showed reliable results since the R values of turbidity, T-N, T-P, and Chl-a were 0.797, 0.877, 0.804, and 0.889, respectively, within the significance level (p) 0.01 for the calibration processes and those were 0.933, 0.663, 0.845 and 0.931 within the significance level (p) of 0.01, respectively, for the validation processes. The water temperature calculation using Band 10 of the TIRS sensor of the Landsat 8 satellite also showed stable results with an R value of 0.884 and an RMSE of 1.306 celcius. Overall, the approach for estimating water quality factors using satellite data was reliable, so water quality prediction using satellite data is considered to be a very useful method for water quality management of the Kumho River. As a result, the monitoring system using satellite data is expected to support for managing the water quality of the Kumho River.

TI  - Habitat loss of the chestnut-leaved oak<i> (Quercus</i><i> castaneifolia)</i> in the Hyrcanian forests of Iran: impacts of anthropogenic factors on forest thinning and degradation
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyrcanian forests are a green belt of deciduous forests in the south of the Caspian Sea whose integrity and survival of its commercial species, such as the chestnut-leaved oak (Quercus casta-neifolia), are at risk due to anthropogenic activities. This study performed coupled spatial-statistical modeling to identify the rate and determinants of Q. castaneifolia in parts of the for -est landscape (5400 km2) in Mazandaran Province, Northern Iran. According to the Maximum Entropy model (MaxEnt), the species' most suitable habitats were small in area (9.03 % of the total forest cover of the region) and uneven in spatial distribution due to the prevailing effect of bioclimatic variables (Bios). Using object-based segmentation analysis, the oak's suitable habitats were divided into spectrally and topographically homogenous areas as working units to search for their occurrence and rate thinning operations. The mean annual Landsat-NDVI of each unit was regressed against the year to use its slope as a measure of thinning, indicating that more than 80 % of the units experienced different thinning levels over the past two decades (2002-2022). Using the multiple linear regression model (p < 0.001), three anthropogenic factors, including road access, surface slope, and elevation, were positively linked to thinning levels, suggesting that the oak loss in the region might be anthropogenic in origin. Based on the results, forest managers and policymakers need to act more effectively and outline holistic conservation plans in the region.

TI  - Comparative Verification of Leaf Area Index Products for Different Grassland Types in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key indicator of vegetation structure and function, and its products have a wide range of applications in vegetation condition assessment and usually act as important input parameters for ecosystem modeling. Grassland plays an important role in regional climate change and the global carbon cycle and numerous studies have focused on the product-based analysis of grassland vegetation changes. However, the performance of various LAI products and their discrepancies across different grassland types in drylands remain unclear. Therefore, it is critical to assess these products prior to application. We evaluated the accuracy of four commonly used LAI products (GEOV2, GLASS, GLOBMAP, and MODIS) using LAI reference maps based on both bridging and cross-validation approaches. Under different grassland types, the GLASS LAI performed better in meadow steppe (R2 = 0.26, RMSE = 0.41 m2/m2) and typical steppe (R2 = 0.32, RMSE = 0.38 m2/m2); the GEOV2 LAI performed better in desert steppe (R2 = 0.39, RMSE = 0.30 m2/m2). When we assessed their spatial and temporal discrepancies during the period from 2010 to 2019, the four LAI products overall showed a high spatial and temporal consistency across the region. Compared with GLASS LAI, the most consistent to least consistent correlations can be ordered by GEOV2 LAI (R2 = 0.94), MODIS LAI (R2 = 0.92), and GLOBMAP LAI (R2 = 0.87). The largest differences in LAI throughout the year occurred in July for all grassland types. Limited by the location and number of sample plots, we mainly focused on spatial and temporal variations. The spatial heterogeneity of land surface is pervasive, especially in vast grassland areas with rich grassland types, and the results of this study can provide a basis for the application of the product in different grassland types. Furthermore, it is essential to develop highly accurate and reliable satellite-based LAI products focused on grassland from the regional to the global scale according to these popular approaches, which is the next step in our work plan.

TI  - Developing an operational algorithm for near-real-time monitoring of crop progress at field scales by fusing harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 time series with geostationary satellite observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop phenology has been widely detected from multiple historical satellite observations. Conversely, Near-Real-Time (NRT) monitoring of crop progress from timely available remote sensing data is barely investigated because of the lack of high-frequency cloud-free satellite observations and future potential crop development. To address the challenge, this study proposes a novel algorithm for operational NRT monitoring of crop progress at the field scale. This algorithm first fuses the high spatial resolution (30 m) Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data and the high temporal frequent (10 min) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) observations to generate cloud-free time series of HLS-ABI EVI2 (two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index) with a Spatiotemporal Shape-Matching Model (SSMM). It then predicts future potential EVI2 values at a given pixel using a reference EVI2 time series obtained from the neighboring pixels in the preceding year. Integrating the currently available HLS-ABI observations and the predicted future EVI2 values to generate annual EVI2 time series, the algorithm finally detects six crop phenometrics including greenup onset, mid-greenup phase, maturity onset, senescence onset, mid-senescence phase, and dormancy onset. The NRT monitoring, which are separated as near-real-time prediction (phenological event detected after the occurrence), real-time prediction (phenological event detected around the occurrence), and short-term prediction (phenological event detected before the occurrence), are continuously updated and improved with new HLS and ABI observations at a weekly basis throughout the growing season. We evaluate the NRT monitoring against standard phenology products, PhenoCam observations, as well as the weekly Crop Progress Reports (CPRs) released from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2020 across Iowa. The evaluation demonstrates the robustness of the developed algorithm in NRT monitoring of crop phenology. Although the uncertainties are relatively large for short-term prediction compared with standard detections, the real-time prediction shows that the Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) is <10 days for greenup and dormancy onset, and similar to 5 days in the other four phenometrics. Further, the real-time prediction aligns well with PhenoCam observations (R-2 = 0.96, P < 0.001) with a MAD of 7.8 days. Moreover, the HLS-ABI real-time prediction of crop phenometrics is capable of tracking NASS crop progress closely with small time shifts (<= 5 days) and significant correlations (R-2 > 0.85, P < 0.001) for various phenological stages of corn and soybean. These results prove that the algorithm could be implemented for NRT monitoring of various crop phenometrics from field, state, to national scales.

TI  - Formation and Hazard Analysis of Landslide Damming Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing plays an increasingly important role in the investigation of natural hazards, not only by obtaining specific data related to hazards, but also by realizing targeted research by combining with other data and/or technologies. Small-scale landslide hazard chain events occur frequently in mountainous areas with fragile geological environments and have strong destructive effects, yet have been somewhat understudied. This paper analyzes the Zhoujiaba (ZJB) landslide hazard chain that occurred in Longnan City on 18 August 2020. On the basis of the comprehensive application of multi-source remote sensing data, combined with time-series InSAR technology, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), and numerical simulations, we studied the formation mechanism, damming characteristics, and potential outburst scenarios of this event. Our research suggests that geological structure and strong natural weathering are the preconditions for landslide development, which is eventually induced by extreme rainfall. Specific topographic conditions determine the rapid sliding and accumulation of landslide materials, and ultimately result in river damming. Our simulation results showed that a flood, rather than a debris flow, will be the result of dam outburst. When the simulated upstream inflow is 1.5 times that when the landslide occurred, 68% of the downstream village area will be flooded. The artificial spillway can effectively reduce the scale of the potential outburst flood, but there remains a risk of dam failure owing to the shallow depth. Our study of the hazard chain of a small-scale landslide using a combination of methods will provide a valuable reference for the analysis and treatment of similar hazard chains.

TI  - Can atmospheric reanalysis datasets reproduce flood inundation at regional scales? A systematic analysis with ERA5 over Mahanadi River Basin, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The prime challenges limiting efficient flood management, especially over large regions, are concurrently related to limited hydro-meteorological observations and exorbitant economics with computational modeling. Reanalysis datasets are a valuable alternative, as they furnish relevant variables at high spatiotemporal resolutions. In recent times, ERA5 has gained significant recognition for its applications in hydrological modeling; however, its efficacy at the inundation scale needs to be understood. The advent of "global flood models" has ensured flood inundation and hazard modeling over large regions, otherwise obscure with regional models. For the first time, the present study explores the fidelity of ERA5 reanalysis at the inundation scale over the Mahanadi River basin, a severely flood-prone region in India. The biases in the discharges within ERA5 are ascertained by comparing them with station-level data at the nascent and extreme levels (i.e., 95th and 99th percentiles). Later, ERA5 is fed to LISFLOOD-FP, an acclaimed global flood model, to reenact the 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2014 flood events. Hit rates exceeding 0.8 compared to MODIS satellite imageries affirm the suitability of ERA5 in accurately capturing flood inundation. Distributed design discharges for 50 yr and 100 yr are derived using a set of extreme value distributions and fed to LISFLOOD-FP to derive design flood inundation and hazards in terms of both "depth" and "product of depth and velocity" of flood waters. Results derived from the study provide vital lessons for efficient land-use planning and adaptation strategies linked to flood protection and resilience.

TI  - Viewpoint: Two more lamps. Augmenting urban planning for biodiversity
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Parris et al.'s seven lamps (principles) of planning for biodiversity in the city (2018) provides a framework for achieving two objectives. Firstly, to alter the normative basis on which urban planning is predicated by integrating a concern for nonhuman inhabitants. Secondly, it argues for the greater enrolment of ecologists and the field of ecology within environmental planning. It seeks to encourage a paradigm-shift to reorient society on a more sustainable path by demonstrating that planning for more-than-human cities does not require a conceptual leap, rather it resonates with extant planning concerns. It thus takes a pragmatic approach to radical change. However, I argue that this framework as originally stated insufficiently considers the diversity of society or the field of ecology and entails an anthropocentric worldview. This undermines the lamps framework's radical agenda. I argue that this issue could be ameliorated by developing two further principles, Justice and Contact. Integrating these concerns into the lamps framework will strengthen its ability to contribute to efforts to transition society into a sustainable state.

TI  - Feasibility and safety of targeted axillary dissection guided by intraoperative ultrasound after neoadjuvant treatment.
T2  - European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Axillary management in cN+axillary nodes after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) in breast cancer (BC) remains under research with the aim of de-escalation of axillary node dissection (ALND). Several axillary guided localization techniques have been reported. This study evaluates the safety of intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) guided targeted axillary dissection (TAD) in a large sample after the results of ILINA trial.MATERIALS: Prospective data have been collected from October 2015 to June 2022 in patients with cT0-T4 and positive axillary lymph nodes (cN1) treated with NST. Before NST, an ultrasound visible marker was placed into the positive node. After NST, IOUS guided TAD was performed including sentinel node biopsy (SLN). Until December 2019, all patients underwent an ALND after TAD procedure. From January 2020, ALND was spared in those patients with an axillary pathological complete response (pCR).RESULTS: 235 patients were included. pCR (ypT0/is ypN0) was achieved in 29% patients. Identification rate (IR) of the clipped node by IOUS was 96% (95% IC, 92.5-98.1%) and IR of SLN was 95% (95% IC, 90.8-97.2%). False negative rate (FNR) for TAD procedure (SLN+clipped node) was 7.0% (95% IC, 2.3-15.7%), which decreased to 4.9% when a total of 3 or more nodes were removed. Axillary ultrasound before surgery assessed residual disease with an AUC of 0.5241. Residual axillary disease tend to be the most significant factor for axillary recurrences.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the feasibility, safety and accuracy of IOUS guided surgery for axillary staging after NST in node positive BC patients.

TI  - Estimation of surface PM2.5 concentrations from atmospheric gas species retrieved from TROPOMI using deep learning: Impacts of fire on air pollution over Thailand
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface PM2.5 concentration is routinely observed at limited number of surface monitoring stations. To overcome its limited spatial coverage, space-borne monitoring system has been established. However, it also faces various challenges such as cloud contamination and limited vertical resolution. In this study, we propose a deep learning -based surface PM2.5 estimation method using the attentive interpretable tabular learning neural network (Tab -Net) with atmospheric gas species retrieved from the tropospheric monitoring instrument (TROPOMI). Unlike previous applications that primarily used decision tree-based algorithms, TabNet provides interpretable decision -making steps to identify dominant factors. By incorporating five TROPOMI products (i.e., NO2, SO2, O3, CO, HCHO), we have tested the system's capability to produce surface PM2.5 concentration without aerosol optical property, which was used more traditionally. The proposed model successfully captures spatiotemporal varia-tions over Thailand in the period of 2018-2020, and it outperforms other leading machine learning models, particularly at high concentrations. The interpretable decision-making steps highlight that carbon monoxide is the most influential chemical component, which relates to the seasonal burning in southeast Asia. It is found that air quality impacts from fire are stronger in the northern part of Thailand and fires in neighboring countries should not be neglected. The proposed method successfully estimates surface PM2.5 concentration without aerosol optical property, implying its potential to advance monitoring air quality over remote regions.

TI  - Water Area Extraction and Water Level Prediction of Dongting Lake Based on Sentinel-1 Dual-Polarization Data Decomposition
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 imaging radar mission provides a short revisit-time, continuous all-weather, and day-and-night imagery at the C-band, which brings opportunities for the dynamic extraction of lake water areas. For wetland-type lakes, it is difficult to distinguish between the water, submerged plants, and mudflats at the edge of a lake, which leads to difficulty in recognizing the water edge of a lake and affects the accuracy of lake water area extraction. In this paper, a water area extraction and water level prediction algorithm based on Sentinel-1 dual-polarization data decomposition is proposed to solve the problem. We can accurately extract lake water through generalized Stokes polarization decomposition. At the same time, we can verify the accuracy of water area extraction by establishing the water area and in situ water level elevation (A-E) relationship, and predicting the water level according to the calculated water area. In this study, dual-polarization Sentinel-1 time series SAR data covering the Dongting Lake wetland from 2018 to 2022 are used to verify the proposed water area extraction algorithm and establish the A-E relationship of the East Dongting Lake basin. The results show that the generalized Stokes decomposition parameters are very sensitive to the water boundary, and the R of the water area and the water level can reach 0.98 by using the piecewise linear function. It confirms the accuracy of the water area inversion, which is of extremely important significance for the high-precision monitoring of the water area of Dongting Lake with long-term Sentinel-1 data. Meanwhile, the predicted lake water level acquired using the A-E relationship established in this paper is compared with the field water level, with an RMSE of 0.4857 m and R-2 of 0.9930. This means that the water level derived using the method in this study is quite compatible with the field observations, which provides a good idea for the water level monitoring of lakes lacking hydrological monitoring stations.

TI  - Toxicity and Efficacy of Hypofractionated Regional Nodal Irradiation.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (HF-WBI) has been widely adopted. However, there are still limited data on whether hypofractionated regional nodal irradiation (HF-RNI) is safe and effective. We report toxicity and cancer outcomes with our HF-RNI approach.MATERIALS/METHODS: This retrospective study included 154 patients with node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer treated with HF-RNI with curative intent at a single academic institution from 2008-2020. Median dose to the breast or chest wall/reconstructed breast was 40 Gy in 16 fractions (interquartile range [IQR], 40-45 Gy in 16-18 fractions). Median dose to the regional nodes was 40 Gy in 16 fractions (IQR, 40-40 Gy in 16-16 fractions). The primary end-point was the rate of chronic toxicity. Secondary endpoints were local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), regional recurrence-free survival (RRFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Toxicities were scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale where appropriate. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.RESULTS: Median follow-up was 46 months (IQR 33-63 mo). Median age at diagnosis was 58 years. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed in 49% of patients, 16% underwent both SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), 32% underwent ALND alone, and 3% had no axillary surgery; 79% had partial mastectomy and 21% had total mastectomy with or without reconstruction. The nodal target included the supraclavicular and axillary Level 1-3 nodes in 66% of patients and supraclavicular and Level 3 nodes in 34%. The crude incidence of grade 1 chronic brachial plexopathy was 2%, grade 1 chronic limited range of motion (LROM) of the upper extremity was 3%, and chronic upper extremity lymphedema was 8% (11 patients with grade 1 toxicity and 1 patient with grade 2 toxicity). The only grade 3+ chronic toxicity was hyperpigmentation (1%). The median time to the development of the highest-grade toxicity was 10 months for brachial plexopathy, 10 months for LROM, and 11 months for lymphedema, respectively. Five-year actuarial rates of LRFS, RRFS, DFS, and OS were 98%, 99%, 90%, and 88%, respectively.CONCLUSION: HF-RNI resulted in low rates of chronic toxicities and excellent disease control in this study. Results of randomized trials of HF-RNI are needed for definitive evidence, but these retrospective data support wider adoption of HF-RNI.

TI  - Etiology of lipid-laden macrophages in the lung
T2  - INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Uniquely positioned as sentinel cells constantly exposed to the environment, pulmonary macrophages are vital for the maintenance of the lung lining. These cells are responsible for the clearance of xenobiotics, pathogen detection and clearance, and homeostatic functions such as surfactant recycling. Among the spectrum of phenotypes that may be expressed by macrophages in the lung, the pulmonary lipid-laden phenotype is less commonly studied in comparison to its circulatory counterpart, the atherosclerotic lesion-associated foam cell, or the acutely activated inflammatory macrophage. Herein, we propose that lipid-laden macrophage formation in the lung is governed by lipid acquisition, storage, metabolism, and export processes. The cellular balance of these four processes is critical to the maintenance of homeostasis and the prevention of aberrant signaling that may contribute to lung pathologies. This review aims to examine mechanisms and signaling pathways that are involved in lipid-laden macrophage formation and the potential consequences of this phenotype in the lung.

TI  - Mapping Grassland Based on Bio-Climate Probability and Intra-Annual Time-Series Abundance Data of Vegetation Habitats
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate inventories of grasslands are important for studies of greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics, as grasslands store about one-third of the global terrestrial carbon stocks. This paper develops a framework for large-area grassland mapping based on the probability of grassland occurrence and the interactive pathways of fractional vegetation and soil-related endmember nexuses. In this study, grassland occurrence probability maps were produced based on data on bio-climate factors obtained from MODIS/Terra Land Surface Temperature (MOD11A2), MODIS/Terra Vegetation Indices (MOD13A3), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM 3B43) using the random forests (RF) method. Time series of 8-day fractional vegetation-related endmembers (green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, sand land, saline land, and dark surfaces) were generated using linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) based on MODIS/Terra Surface Reflectance data (MOD09A1). Time-series endmember fraction maps and grassland occurrence probabilities were employed to map grassland distribution using an RF model. This approach improved the accuracy by 5% compared to using endmember fractions alone. Additionally, based on the grassland occurrence probability maps, we identified extensive ecologically sensitive regions, encompassing 1.54 (104 km2) of desert-to-steppe (D-S) and 2.34 (104 km2) of steppe-to-meadow (S-M) transition regions. Among these, the D-S area is located near the threshold of 310 mm/yr in precipitation, an annual temperature of 10.16 degrees C, and a surface comprehensive drought index (TVPDI) of 0.59. The S-M area is situated close to the line of 437 mm/yr in precipitation, an annual temperature of 5.49 degrees C, and a TVPDI of 0.83.

TI  - Interactions of urbanisation, climate variability, and infectious disease dynamics: insights from the Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and shifts in land use/land cover (LULC) are critical factors affecting the environmental, societal, and health landscapes, notably influencing the spread of infectious diseases. This study delves into the intricate relationships between climate change, LULC alterations, and the prevalence of vector-borne and waterborne diseases in Coimbatore district, Tamil Nadu, India, between 1985 and 2015. The research utilised Landsat-4, Landsat-5, and Landsat-8 data to generate LULC maps, applying the maximum likelihood algorithm to highlight significant transitions over the years. This study revealed that built-up areas have increased by 67%, primarily at the expense of agricultural land, which was reduced by 51%. Temperature and rainfall data were obtained from APHRODITE Water Resources, and with a statistical analysis of the time series data revealed an annual average temperature increase of 1.8 & DEG;C and a minor but statistically significant rainfall increase during the study period. Disease data was obtained from multiple national health programmes, revealing an increasing trend in dengue and diarrhoeal diseases over the study period. In particular, dengue cases surged, correlating strongly with the increase in built-up areas and temperature. This research is instrumental for policy decisions in public health, urban planning, and climate change mitigation. Amidst limited research on the interconnections among infectious diseases, climate change, and LULC changes in India, our study serves as a significant precursor for future management strategies in Coimbatore and analogous regions.

TI  - Near-real-time estimation of global horizontal irradiance from Himawari-8 satellite data
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) is not only an essential requirement of setting up a photoelectric power generation system but also critical information for terrestrial ecological models. Current methods to estimate GHI are mostly focused on hourly or daily scales and very often also require additional meteorological data. In comparison, few works have ever estimated GHI on the near-real-time scale, as the dynamically changing clouds pose great challenges for instantaneously estimating it. In this study, we adopt the Himawari-8 satellite data as the sole input without any supplementary meteorological parameters, to estimate the near-real-time GHI based on four machine learning algorithms and their ensemble. All models achieved similarly good performance, with R2 being about 0.81, and nRMSE being within the range of 25.22%-26.34%. Ground validations revealed that our result outperform the official Himawari-8 shortwave radiance product. Further analyses revealed that different machine learning models behave differently under different weather conditions, while all performed badly under overcast conditions, suggesting an in-depth investigation is required to improve the model performance. Even so, we foresee that this efficient way, which relies solely on the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite data, can be applied widely to estimate near-real-time GHI in the future.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Dynamic of Disturbances in Planted and Natural Forests for the Saihanba Region of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Various disturbances like extreme climate events, fires, and insect outbreak severely impact forest ecosystems, and differences are expected between planted and natural forests. However, there is little information on the spatio-temporal dynamics of the disturbances in terms of both forest types. In this study, we used the LandTrendr algorithm to detect disturbances in planted and natural forests in a temperate region of Northern China from 1985 to 2020 using Landsat and Sentinel 2 satellite data. The planted and natural forests suffered severe disturbances in 1994 in the south (park establishment) and in 2012 in the north (severe drought). More than one third of the area of planted (37.5%) or natural (35.8%) forests was highly disturbed. The duration of forest disturbances was mostly 1 to 3 years in terms of planted or natural forests. The NDVI anomaly of the planted forests decreased from 0.24 to -0.08 after drought events, while the reduction was from 0.22 to -0.06 for natural forests. Afterwards, the NDVI anomaly of the planted forests showed a slow upward variation but not for the natural forests. This study allows us to evaluate the response of various forest types to disturbance regimes.

TI  - Estimating Agricultural Cropping Intensity Using a New Temporal Mixture Analysis Method from Time Series MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural cropping intensity plays an important role in evaluating the food security and the sustainable development of agriculture. The existing indicators measuring cropping intensity include cropping frequency and multiple cropping index. As a nominal measurement, cropping frequency classifies crop patterns into single-cropping and/or double-cropping and leads to information loss. Multiple cropping index is calculated on the basis of statistical data, ignoring the spatial heterogeneity within the administrative region. Neither of these indicators can meet the requirements of precision agriculture, and new methods for fine cropping intensity mapping are still lacking. Time series remote sensing data provide vegetation phenology information and reveal temporal development of vegetation, which can be used to facilitate the fine cropping intensity mapping. In this study, a new temporal mixture analysis method is introduced to estimate the abundance level cropping intensity from time series remote sensing data. By analyzing phenological characteristics of major land-cover types in time series vegetatiosacan indices, a novel feature space was constructed by using the selected PCA components, and three unique endmembers (double-cropping, natural vegetations and water bodies) were found. Then, a linear spectral mixture analysis model was applied to decompose mixed pixels by replacing spectral data with multi-temporal data. The spatio-temporal continuous, fine resolution, abundance level cropping intensity maps were produced for the North China Plain and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Valley. The experiments indicate a good result at both county and pixel level validation. The method of manually delineating endmembers can well balance the accuracy and efficiency. We also found the size of the study area has little effect on the unmixing accuracy. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can model cropping intensity finely at large scale and long temporal span, at the same time with high efficiency and ease of implementation.

TI  - The Integrated i31-GEP Test Outperforms the MSKCC Nomogram at Predicting SLN Status in Melanoma Patients.
T2  - Anticancer research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for patients with cutaneous melanoma is primarily a prognostic procedure that broadly identifies patients who may have disease progression and may warrant additional intervention. However, 88% of patients undergoing SLNB receive a negative result and of those, some will succumb to their disease. One clinical utility of the integrated 31-GEP test, which combines gene expression data with clinicopathologic factors to provide a personalized, precise risk of SLN positivity, is SLNB guidance. This study compared the i31-GEP for SLNB to a nomogram that predicts SLN positivity using only clinicopathologic factors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with T1-T2 tumors and known SLN status (N=465) were analyzed by the i31-GEP for SLNB and a nomogram developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). A 5% risk threshold was used to conform with national guidelines.RESULTS: In patients with <5% predicted risk, SLN positivity was 2.7% (3/111) for i31-GEP versus 10.0% (11/110, p=0.026) for MSKCC. In each T-category, the i31-GEP maintained a false-negative rate below the 5% risk threshold in those predicted to have a <5% risk, while the MSKCC nomogram did not.CONCLUSION: Integrating the 31-GEP with traditional factors outperformed a nomogram that uses clinicopathologic factors alone to predict SLN status. Incorporating the i31-GEP into clinical practice could improve identification of patients for SLNB, resulting in better risk-aligned management.

TI  - In Vitro Validation of a Novel Continuous Intra-Abdominal Pressure Measurement System (TraumaGuard)
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) has been recognized as an important vital sign in critically ill patients. Due to the high prevalence and incidence of intra-abdominal hypertension in surgical (trauma, burns, cardiac) and medical (sepsis, liver cirrhosis, acute kidney injury) patients, continuous IAP (CIAP) monitoring has been proposed. This research was aimed at validating a new CIAP monitoring device, the TraumaGuard from Sentinel Medical Technologies, against the gold standard (height of a water column) in an in vitro setting and performing a comparative analysis among different CIAP measurement technologies (including two intra-gastric and two intra-bladder measurement devices). A technical and clinical guideline addressing the strengths and weaknesses of each device is provided as well. Methods: Five different CIAP measurement devices (two intra-gastric and three intra-vesical), including the former CiMON, Spiegelberg, Serenno, TraumaGuard, and Accuryn, were validated against the gold standard water column pressure in a bench-top abdominal phantom. The impacts of body temperature and bladder fill volume (for the intra-vesical methods) were evaluated for each system. Subsequently, 48 h of continuous monitoring (n = 2880) on top of intermittent IAP (n = 300) readings were captured for each device. Using Pearson's and Lin's correlations, concordance, and Bland and Altman analyses, the accuracy, precision, percentage error, correlation and concordance coefficients, bias, and limits of agreement were calculated for all the different devices. We also performed error grid analysis on the CIAP measurements to provide an overview of the involved risk level due to wrong IAP measurements and calculated the area under the curve and time above a certain IAP threshold. Lastly, the robustness of each system in tracking the dynamic variations of the raw IAP signal due to respirations and heartbeats was evaluated as well. Results: The TraumaGuard was the only technology able to measure the IAP with an empty artificial bladder. No important temperature dependency was observed for the investigated devices except for the Spiegelberg, which displayed higher IAP values when the temperature was increased, but this could be adjusted through recalibration. All the studied devices showed excellent ability for IAP monitoring, although the intra-vesical IAP measurements seem more reliable. In general, the TraumaGuard, Accuryn, and Serenno showed better accuracy compared to intra-gastric measurement devices. On average, biases of +0.71, +0.93, +0.29, +0.25, and -0.06 mm Hg were observed for the CiMON, Spiegelberg, Serenno, TraumaGuard, and Accuryn, respectively. All of the equipment showed percentage errors smaller than 25%. Regarding the correlation and concordance coefficients, the Serenno and TraumaGuard showed the best results (R2 = 0.98, p = 0.001, concordance coefficient of 99.5%). Error grid analysis based on the Abdominal Compartment Society guidelines showed a very low associated risk level of inappropriate treatment strategies due to erroneous IAP measurements. Regarding the dynamic tracings of the raw IAP signal, all the systems can track respiratory variations and derived parameters; however, the CiMON was slightly superior compared to the other technologies. Conclusions: According to the research guidelines of the Abdominal Compartment Society (WSACS), this in vitro study shows that the TraumaGuard can be used interchangeably with the gold standard for measuring continuous IAP, even in an empty artificial bladder.Confirmation studies with the TraumaGuard in animals and humans are warranted to further validate these findings.

TI  - Enhanced Soil Moisture Retrieval through Integrating Satellite Data with Pedotransfer Functions in a Complex Landscape of Ethiopia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed soil moisture products potentially provide a valuable resource for monitoring agricultural drought and assessing food security. The agriculture dominated countries of Eastern Africa experience high inter-annual variability of rainfall, but the monitoring and assessment of the predominantly rainfed agriculture systems is hindered by an absence of ground-based observations. This study evaluates the accuracy of three soil moisture products: ASCAT SWI 12.5 km, SMAP soil moisture data 9 km (SPL3SMP_E), and enhanced surface soil moisture map derived through integrating ASCAT SWI and Pedotransfer Functions (PTFs) (ASCAT_PTF_SM), in Ethiopia, through comparison with in situ-observed soil moisture datasets. Additionally, a new water retention PTF, developed for Ethiopian soils, is integrated with a high-resolution soil property dataset to enhance the spatial resolution of the soil moisture product. The results show that the new integrated dataset performs better in terms of unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE = 0.0398 m3/m3) and bias (0.0222 m3/m3) in comparison with ASCAT SWI 12.5 km (ubRMSE = 0.0.0771 m3/m3, bias = 0.1065 m3/m3). SMAP is found to have limitations during the wet season, overestimating soil moisture. The finer spatial resolution of the data allows for a better depiction of heterogeneity of soil moisture across the landscape and can be used to identify water-related issues and improve hydrological models for agricultural water management.

TI  - Wildlife habitat association over a twelve-year period (2008-2020) in the Greater Mahale Ecosystem, western Tanzania
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greater Mahale Ecosystem (GME) in western Tanzania hosts high faunal biodiversity, including charismatic species such as elephants and chimpanzees. Across the GME, habitat occurs in differently administered, unprotected and protected areas, including village land, forest reserves, and national parks. Areas of lower protective status are prone to deforestation and land cover changes. These land cover changes influence suitable habitat itself as well as the connectivity between habitat patches, but the impact on different mammal species in this region is unknown. In this study, we investigated changes in habitat availability by creating species distribution models for 11 medium-large mammal species based on species occurrence data collected from 2008 to 2020. We tested habitat associations for each species and evaluated the importance of the static predictor variables elevation, slope, aspect and terrain-ruggedness and the dynamic predictor variables distance to deforestation, percent forest, vegetation intensity, and vegetation variability, retrieved through remotely sensed data analysis. Our models suggest habitat declined for most, but not all species. Whilst elephants and buffalo lost more than 50 % of available habitat during this period, primates exhibited habitat stability. Habitat losses were pronounced in the southeast of the GME. Slope, elevation and median tasseled-cap wetness index (vegetation intensity) and distance to deforestation were the most important predictor variables. Our study presents a spatially and temporally explicit estimation of habitat changes in a critically important, biodiverse region undergoing drastic land cover changes. We call for consideration in land-use planning to foster connectivity and landscape integrity to protect and conserve wildlife across the ecosystem.

TI  - Exploring the functional connectivity between the Kis-Balaton Water Protection System and Lake Balaton using satellite data
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Balaton, a shallow polymictic freshwater lake in Central Europe, became eutrophic in the 1970s. To retain the inorganic nutrients from the main tributary River Zala, a semi-artificial system called the Kis-Balaton Water Protection System (KBWPS) was constructed in the early 1980s. In 2015, the system was reconstructed and modernised, thus offering the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of the functional connection between the KBWPS and Lake Balaton over the past 20 years and to compare its impact before and after the reconstruction. To this end, time series data of algal biomass in Lake Balaton between 1999 and 2019 based on Landsat 7 satellite data were analysed. Over the last 20 years, the algal biomass in Lake Balaton showed an increasing trend (0.009 +/- 0.011% increase per year), with territorial specificities also observed. No change was noted in the western part, while an increase was recorded in the eastern part of the lake. A significant difference in the rate of algal biomass accumulation was noticed before (annual increase of 0.008 +/- 0.019%) and after (0.240 +/- 0.306% per year) the KBWPS reconstruction. Given that the largest increase in algal biomass after reconstruction was observed in the outermost KBWPS basin of Lake Balaton, it appears that mesoscale environmental, water balance, or other factors affecting the lake are playing a role in this increase, rather than the KBWPS reconstruction. This research highlights the potential to study aquatic ecosystems using Earth observation techniques, and how mesoscale factors such as changes in the local climate regime or shifts in lake management can greatly impact the trophic state of a large shallow lake. Effectively identifying these factors is crucial in maintaining the proper status of aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Cyclic loading tests and numerical modeling of concrete-filled 700 MPa high-strength steel tubes incorporating deep plasticity
T2  - THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Concrete-filled high-strength steel tubes (CFHST) could improve structural efficiency with lighter weight and higher capacity. However, the relative lower ductility and higher yield-to-tensile strength ratio of high-strength steel arouse worries about seismic performance of CFHST. In order to reveal the influence of high-strength steel on the elastoplastic hysteretic behavior of CFHST, 8 cantilever columns with Q550 and Q690 steel were subjected to constant axial load and cyclic top displacement. The actual yield strength of the steel was over 700MPa and the maximum axial load ratio was over 0.5. Based on the experimental observations, a finite element model was developed in ABAQUS that could consider deep plasticity behavior of CFHST members more precisely by introducing full-range elastoplastic constitutive model of high-strength steel and damaging-crushing behavior of infill concrete. The model was validated by the 8 tests of this study and other 34 cyclic-loaded CFST specimen from different researchers. 288 cyclic-loaded CFHST models were simulated by the effective numerical model in the parametric study on the elastoplastic deformation capacity of CFHST columns. The experimental and numerical investigations show that the CFHST could still have considerable deformation capacity if the local deformation of the steel tubes develop moderately. For heavy loaded CFST columns, high-strength thin-walled steel tubes have satisfying elastoplastic deformation capacity and ductility that are not worse than CFST with thick conventional steel tubes. The application of high-strength steel could delay the steel yield and control the damage of the concrete, leading to larger pre-peak deformation capacity. Finally, the empirical formulas were proposed to roughly yet efficiently estimate the ultimate drift ⠒u of cyclic-loaded CFSTs with fy = 345 & SIM; 690 MPa, fc'=24 & SIM;72 MPa, ⠘ = 1.0 & SIM;6.0 and n = 0.20 & SIM;0.80, which is fairly practical in plastic inter-story-drift check and seismic design of CFHST structures.

TI  - The plight of urban settlements based on the proliferation of dichotomy in Tanzania
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The observation of the juxtaposition of formal and informal urban settlements in the commonwealth and sub-Saharan developing countries has been trending as a common mundane phenomenon in emerging and fast-growing cities. Dar Es Salaam is one of the largest, and most populous cities in Tanzania; the dichotomy of informal and formal settlement is ubiquitous in peri-urban areas and its urban vicinities where land evolves from village to urban. The dichotomy of urban settlements occurs when the public authorities do not satisfactorily provide public urban services which are customarily attributed to poor governance and policies formulated, financial deficiencies, and nonstrategic urban land development. Different strategies and approaches have been applied by the government for at least providing the proper infrastructure; however, most of the approaches are not well successful and deliver the expected results following the high cost of urban land development. To comprehend the urban typology and land development characteristics of Dar es Salaam, urban land transformation, and to detect the change in the built-up area, data from 1975-2020 were examined through remote sensing, and images with ArcView GIS and LADER. The field survey data analysis supported the cause of unplanned settlements and the limitation of urban land acquisition and development. The aim of this study is to analyze the built-up area growth through the years for the study area. The result showed that rapid urbanization and dramatic growth in built-up areas especially between 1990-2000 years were easily observed, financial deficiencies and conventional urban land development policies have a significant contribution to the thriving of dichotomy settlement. The study suggested that innovative urban land development must be integrated with conventional approaches to leverage urban land development and cater to sustainable urban development.

TI  - Identification of Soil Types and Salinity Using MODIS Terra Data and Machine Learning Techniques in Multiple Regions of Pakistan
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil, a significant natural resource, plays a crucial role in supporting various ecosystems and serves as the foundation of Pakistan's economy due to its primary use in agriculture. Hence, timely monitoring of soil type and salinity is essential. However, traditional methods for identifying soil types and detecting salinity are time-consuming, requiring expert intervention and extensive laboratory experiments. The objective of this study is to propose a model that leverages MODIS Terra data to identify soil types and detect soil salinity. To achieve this, 195 soil samples were collected from Lahore, Kot Addu, and Kohat, dating from October 2022 to November 2022. Simultaneously, spectral data of the same regions were obtained to spatially map soil types and salinity of bare land. The spectral reflectance of band values, salinity indices, and vegetation indices were utilized to classify the soil types and predict soil salinity. To perform the classification and regression tasks, the study employed three popular techniques in the research community: Random Forest (RF), Ada Boost (AB), and Gradient Boosting (GB), along with Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Extra Tree (ET). A 70-30 test train validation split was used for the implementation of these techniques. The efficacy of the multi-class classification models for soil types was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. On the other hand, the regression models' performances were evaluated and compared using R-squared (R2), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results demonstrated that Random Forest outperformed other methods for both predicting soil types (accuracy = 65.38, precision = 0.60, recall = 0.57, and f1-score = 0.57) and predicting salinity (R2 = 0.90, MAE = 0.56, MSE = 0.98, RMSE = 0.97). Finally, the study designed a web portal to enable real-time prediction of soil types and salinity using these models. This web portal can be utilized by farmers and decision-makers to make informed decisions regarding soil, crop cultivation, and agricultural planning.

TI  - This house believes that: MARI/TAD is better than sentinel node biopsy after PST for cN plus patients
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing use and effectiveness of primary systemic treatment (PST) enables tailored locoregional treatment. About one third of clinically node positive (cN+) breast cancer patients achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) of the axilla, with higher rates observed in Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor (HER)2positive or triple negative (TN) breast cancer subtypes. Tailoring axillary treatment for patients with axillary pCR is necessary, as they are unlikely to benefit from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), but may suffer complications and long-term morbidity such as lymphedema and impaired shoulder motion. By combining pre-PST and post-PST axillary staging techniques, ALND can be omitted in most cN + patients with pCR. Different post PST staging techniques (MARI/TAD/SN) show low or ultra-low false negative rates for detection of residual disease. More importantly, trials using the MARI (Marking Axillary lymph nodes with Radioactive Iodine seeds) procedure or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as axillary staging technique post-PST have already shown the safety of tailoring axillary treatment in patients with an excellent response. Tailored axillary treatment using the MARI procedure in stage I-III breast cancer resulted in 80% reduction of ALND and excellent five-year axillary recurrence free interval (aRFI) of 97%. Similar oncologic outcomes were seen for post-SLNB in stage I-II patients. The MARI technique requires only one invasive procedure pre-NST and a median of one node is removed post PST, whereas for the SLNB and TAD techniques two to four nodes are removed. A disadvantage of the MARI technique is its use of radioactive iodine, which is subject to extensive regulations.

TI  - Glyphosate affects larval gut microbiota and metamorphosis of honey bees with differences between rearing procedures
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The honey bee Apis mellifera is a sentinel species of the pollinator community which is exposed to a wide variety of pesticides. In the last half-century, the pesticide most applied worldwide has been the herbicide glyphosate (GLY) used for weed control and with microbiocide effects. After its application in crops, the GLY residues have been detected in flowers visited by honey bees as well as in the stored food of their hives. Therefore, the honey bee brood can ingest the herbicide during larval development. Recent studies proved that GLY has detrimental effects on adult honey bees and other insects associated with the disturbance of their gut microbiota. GLY induces changes in the growth, metabolism and survival of honey bees and stingless bees reared in vitro. However, the effect of GLY on larval microbiota is unknown so far and there are few studies with an in-hive exposure to GLY. For these reasons, this study aims to determine whether GLY induces dysbiosis in honey bee larvae and affects their metamorphosis during the exposure period (pre-defecation) and the post-exposure period. Furthermore, we assessed this herbicide in vitro and in the hive to compare its effects on different rearing procedures. Finally, we tested the pigment BLUE1 as an indirect exposure marker to detect and estimate the in-hive intake concentration of GLY. Our results indicate that the intake of field-relevant concentrations of GLY induced a slowdown in growth with dysbiosis in the larval gut microbiota followed by late effects on their metamorphosis such as teratogenesis and mortality of newly emerged bees. Nevertheless, brood from the same colonies expressed different signs of toxicity depending on the rearing procedure and in a dose-dependent manner.

TI  - Field study of metal concentrations and biomarker responses in resident oysters of an estuarine system in southern Brazil.
T2  - Chemosphere
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Pollutant exposure is considered an important factor responsible for the decline in marine biodiversity of Latin American coastal ecosystems. This threat has been detected in an estuarine system in southern Brazil, which prompted an investigation into the long-term biological effects of a chronic metal contamination on resident oysters from the Laguna Estuarine System (LES). Here, we present the species- and size-specific variations of biomarker responses (catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione S-transferase, and protein carbonylation) in the gills and digestive gland of Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea gasar. In parallel, concentrations of eight metals (Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn) in soft tissues were measured. Our analyses revealed that the metal levels exhibited decreasing order in both species: Zn>Fe>Al>Cu>Mn>Cd. Except for Cu and Al, metal concentrations did not differ between oyster species. Biomarker results highlighted that C. gasar presented higher antioxidant responses, whereas C. gigas showed increased biotransformation upon exposure to LES pollutants, which varied according to the tissue. However, C. gasar showed a significant higher content of protein carbonylation but was not related to metals. In our research approach, the observation of metals presence and biomarkers-related responses are considered biologically relevant from an ecotoxicological perspective and serve as a baseline for future pollution studies in estuaries of Latin America. Finally, we recommend adopting a suite of biomarkers in both C. gasar and C. gigas, regardless their size and weight, as sentinel organisms in future regional biomonitoring studies in southern Brazil.

TI  - A comparison study between the use of single-point versus areal-mean rainfall values from a high-resolution model when verified against satellite retrievals for three typhoons hitting the Philippines
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, effects of using areal-mean instead of single-point output values from a cloud-resolving model to verify its quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) in terms of the categorical 2 x 2 matrix against satellite rainfall retrievals are assessed for three typhoons that hit the Philippines. The motivation behind this work stemmed from the fact that categorical measures are point-to-point methods but satellite estimates are considered areal-mean values. Overall, we find that using areal-mean values have small but positive impacts on categorical statistics, mainly due to a better overall agreement between satellite-derived rainfall and model outputs after areal averaging with a smoothing effect. These impacts are also statistically significant up to high thresholds of roughly= 350 mm. Using areal means from the model, the threat scores (TSs) improve at low thresholds by about 0.02-0.05, primarily owing to increases in the probability of detection (POD) of observed rainfall events, so the smoothing effect helps convert some misses into hits. In cases with low frequency bias, similar improvements in TSs also occur across middle and even high thresholds (up to 500-750 mm) as both POD and success ratio (SR) rise, with the latter indicative of a lowered false alarm ratio (FAR). Toward the extreme thresholds, results are more mixed and the confidence level of significance drops, but the TSs there are already low (& LE; 0.08) against the satellite data regardless of the method adopted.

TI  - Albedo-dominated biogeophysical warming effects induced by vegetation restoration on the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation restoration can reduce surface albedo and retain more heat on the land surface. This feedback would partially offset the cooling effect of vegetation by absorbing CO2. Ignoring the climate feedback from changes in albedo will lead us to overestimate the contribution of increased vegetation to warming mitigation. Utilizing remote sensing data and employing a radiative forcing algorithm, we quantified the climatic feedback associated with vegetation restoration on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). The surface albedo on the CLP decreased from 2001 to 2017, correlating with increased vegetation greenness, resulting in positive radiative forcing (multi-year average: 1.58 W/m2, average growth rate: 0.125 W/m2/yr). The radiative feedback of reduced albedo due to vegetation restoration is equivalent to the warming effect of emitting 3.7 kgCO2/m2. Contrary to expectations, CLP vegetation restoration efforts lacked a significant cooling effect, potentially increasing surface warming risks from albedo changes. These results emphasize the dominant role of biogeophysical feedback mechanisms induced by vegetation restoration. It will contribute to a comprehensive assessment of the climate benefits of large-scale vegetation increases in temperate regions. Decision makers can provide diverse vegetation man-agement and restoration strategies depending on the differences in climate feedback for vegetation restoration at different locations.

TI  - Understanding the differences in the effect of urbanization on land surface temperature and air temperature in China: insights from heatwave and non-heatwave conditions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accelerated urbanization and frequent heatwave events pose significant threats to human health. Analyses of the differences in air and land surface temperature (LST) under extreme climates can aid in understanding human-nature ecosystem coupling and the required adaptations to climate change. In this study, we quantified differences in urban and rural temperatures in China under heatwave (CHW) and non-heatwave periods (NHW) conditions and the influence of meteorological factors on these differences. Based on impervious surface data, 2421 urban and rural stations were dynamically classified from 2008 to 2017. Heatwaves were identified using relative thresholds, and differences were explored using meteorological data and MODIS LST data. For LST, urban-rural temperature difference (U-RTempdiff) was highest during the day, whereas air temperature peaks occurred at night, under both NHW and CHW conditions. During CHWs, the daytime U-RTempdiff was greater for LST than for air temperature, reaching 4.24 & PLUSMN; 3.38 & DEG;C. At night, U-RTempdiff was slightly lower (1.04 & PLUSMN; 1.41 & DEG;C). The proportion of air U-RTempdiff contributed by rural air temperature was significantly higher during CHW nights than during NHW nights, whereas the proportion of land surface and air U-RTempdiff remained relatively stable during daytime. Spatially, the daytime temperature difference in the north decreased with latitude, whereas the difference in the south was lower. Under CHWs, urbanization had a stronger effect on LST than on air temperature, with a slightly smaller difference (0.01 & DEG;C yr-1) during the day and a slightly larger difference (0.03 & DEG;C yr-1) at night. The contribution of urbanization to LST was higher than that to air temperature, particularly during the day (16.34%). The effects of wind speed and precipitation on the average air urban-rural temperature difference was greater than those of LST under CHW, accounting for 16.13%, with the effects of wind speed being more significant. These results show that a comprehensive perspective is needed to understand the risks associated with a temperature rise risk under extreme climate conditions and to formulate effective mitigation measures that will they improve human thermal comfort under climate change.

TI  - The Short-Time Prediction of Thermospheric Mass Density Based on Ensemble-Transfer Learning
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable short-time prediction of thermospheric mass density along the satellite orbit is always essential but challenging for the operation of Low-Earth orbit satellites. In this paper, three machine-learning prediction algorithms are investigated, including the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, the Transformer, and the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) ensemble model of the above models. We use satellite data from CHAMP, GOCE, and SWARM-C to evaluate the robustness and accuracy of different density variations. The comparison demonstrates that all models achieve compelling predictions and are much better than NRLMSISE-00. The LightGBM ensemble model (LE-model) consistently outperforms others in accuracy and stability. Furthermore, when the obtained density data from the newly launched satellites are limited, the trained LE-model can provide a valid prediction for the new satellite orbit by transfer learning. This study offers a promising insight into the short-time prediction of thermospheric mass density using ensemble-transfer learning and may be advantageous to future research on space whether.Low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites play an important role in many aspects, such as navigation, aerospace, military industry, and so on. The LEO satellites suffer atmospheric drag caused by thermospheric mass density. Therefore, we present three different machine-learning algorithms to achieve a robust short-time prediction for thermospheric mass density. All models can provide effective results from testing with three satellite data, and the ensemble model always outperforms others. Then, when the obtained density data from the newly launched satellites are very limited, the pre-trained ensemble model is also useful for the new satellite orbit by transfer learning. We offer a good insight into the short-time prediction of thermospheric mass density and assistance for aerospace digitization and intellectualization.Based on three different machine-learning algorithms, we present a robust short-time prediction for thermospheric mass densityWe evaluate the model performances using data from CHAMP, GOCE, and SWARM-C with NRLMSISE-00 as the referenceThe LightGBM ensemble model of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Transformer outperforms others and can provide reliable transfer predictions for new satellites

TI  - A novel semi-empirical model for crop leaf area index retrieval using SAR co- and cross-polarizations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of continuous leaf area index (LAI) in space and time from remote sensing is beneficial for cropland monitoring and management. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with the advantages of all-weather operation and fine spatial resolutions has been utilized in various agricultural applications. Although the water cloud model (WCM) has been extensively used for LAI estimation over croplands, it is modified for application to crop canopies with large gaps. The requirement of prior information on soil moisture is also a hinderance for the model application. In this study, WCM is theoretically modified to consider the correlation of active microwave propagation through the canopy in downward and upward directions. Such a modification is particularly important for sparse vegetation with large gaps between crop plants in the early stage of the growing season. A parameter with explicit physical meaning, i.e. the full-vegetation backscattering coefficient, was defined to simplify our model scheme and make the model applicable for the whole growing season. In addition, a physicsbased SAR data processing scheme is developed to entangle the influences of LAI and soil moisture on SAR backscatter by taking advantage of the multiple polarizations of RADARSAT-2 (R2) SAR data. In this way, LAI was estimated using modified WCM without the prior knowledge of soil moisture. To evaluate LAI retrieved from the R2 datasets (R2 LAI), ground-based LAI measurements were made at the experimental area of SMAPVEX16MB in Canada with twenty approximately 800 m. 800 m plots in soybeans and corn. R2 LAI was well correlated to these ground-based LAI (n = 15, R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.99 m(2)center dot m-(2) for soybeans; n = 5, R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 1.20 m(2)center dot m(-2) for corn). LAI was also retrieved from optical data acquired by Sentinel-2/MSI (S2), denoted as S2 LAI. The R2 LAI and S2 LAI are well correlated and achieved coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.76 and 0.71 and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 1.1 and 1.4 m(2)center dot m(-2) for soybeans and corn, respectively. The seasonal variations of R2 LAI and S2 LAI are generally similar except at the end of the growing season when S2 LAI is considerably larger than R2 LAI. S2 LAI followed the trend of the reduction in leaf chlorophyll content, while R2 LAI reduced only slightly due to the decrease in leaf water content near the end the growing season. R-2 LAI represents the total standing leaf area useful for surface energy balance estimation, while S2 LAI responds to green leaf area useful for crop productivity modeling.

TI  - Analysis of Land Use/Cover Changes and Driving Forces in a Typical Subtropical Region of South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/cover change (LULCC) is an integral part of global environmental change and is influenced by both natural and socioeconomic factors. This study aims to comprehensively analyze land use and land cover (LULC) in Kwazulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces in eastern South Africa from 1995 to 2020 and to identify the driving force behind LULCC. Utilizing Landsat series satellite imagery as a data source and based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and eCognition software 9.0, two different classification methods, pixel-based classification and object-oriented classification, were adopted to gather LULC data every five years. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the data were then analyzed. Using an optimal parameter-based geodetector (OPGD), this study explored the driving factors of LULCC in this region. The results show the following: (1) Of the two classification methods examined, the object-oriented classification had higher accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 80-90%. The pixel-based classification had lower accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 62.33-72.14%. (2) From 1995 to 2020, the area of farmland in the study area showed a fluctuating increase, while the areas of forest and grassland declined annually. The area of constructed land increased annually, whereas the areas of water and unused land fluctuated over time. (3) Socioeconomic factors generally had greater explanatory power than natural factors, with population growth and economic development being the main drivers of LULCC in the region. This study provides a reliable scientific basis for the formulation of sustainable land resource development strategies in the area, as well as for the management and implementation of urban and rural planning, ecological protection, and environmental governance by relevant departments.

TI  - Assessing the Sustainability Impacts of the Xiaolangdi Dam: Land Use and Socioeconomic Change in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yellow River Basin
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper assesses the sustainability impacts in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River in China after the Xiaolangdi Dam was constructed. Based on land use data interpreted from Landsat remote sensing images, covering the time period from 2000 to 2020 at 5-year intervals, this research uses a land dynamic attitude index and comprehensive index of land use degree to reveal the degree of land use type change in the study area and analyze the relationship between land use and social economy. The results show that urban and rural construction land is the land use type with the largest annual change rate, and the increase is most obvious from 2005 to 2010, growing by nearly 900 km(2). The six types of land use in the research area changed sharply from 2000 to 2010, with grassland and unused land showing the most significant change. On the whole, the dynamic attitude of comprehensive land use tends to be stable. The comprehensive index analysis of land use degree indicates that the study area has developed in the direction of urban settlement. Population and GDP are the main driving factors affecting the constant change in land use types in this region, in which population growth and rapid economic development are the main factors leading to the decline of grassland area, and are also the main driving factors for the expansion of construction land. The research results provide a scientific basis for sustainable land use and development in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River Basin.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node procedure in early-stage vulvar cancer: Correlation of lymphoscintigraphy with surgical outcome and groin recurrence
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In early-stage vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) a sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure is regarded successful if at least one SLN is removed with minimal residual radioactivity. An inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy is considered if not all SLNs visualized on lymphoscintigraphy can be found, with subsequent increased morbidity. We correlated lymphoscintigraphy findings with surgical outcome and groin recurrence with focus on number of SLNs found. Methods: This study concerns a retrospective cohort of 171 women treated for early-stage VSCC who underwent a SLN procedure between 2000 and 2020. The risk of groin recurrence was compared after either a successful or complete SLN procedure, i.e. removal of all SLNs that were visualized on lymphoscintigraphy. Results: In 13 (7.6%) groins of 171 patients SLN visualization on lymphoscintigraphy failed. In 230 of the 246 (93.5%) groins in which a SLN was visualized, at least one SLN was found during surgery. In 224 of the 246 (91.1%) groins the SLN procedure was regarded either successful (n = 14) or complete (n = 210). An isolated groin recurrence was documented in 5 out of 192 (2.6%, 95%-CI; 0.34 to 4.9) SLN-negative groins after a median follow-up of 47.0 months. All recurrences were noted in the complete SLN group (5/180 groins). The difference with the successful SLN group (0/12 groins) was not significant. Conclusion: Risk of groin recurrence was 2.6% after SLN negative biopsy in early-stage VSCC. The risk appeared not increased if at least one SLN was found with minimal residual radioactivity, in case more SLNs were visualized on lymphoscintigraphy.

TI  - Wheat biomass, yield, and straw-grain ratio estimation from multi-temporal UAV-based RGB and multispectral images
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate crop monitoring and harvest property prescription map making before harvesting is valuable for the precision operation of combine harvesters. The development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and sensor technology makes it feasible to acquire crop remote sensing images with high temporal and spatial resolution. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of UAV-based time series remote sensing data and multimodal data fusion using RGB and multispectral sensors in estimating wheat yield, biomass, and straw-grain ratio in the ripening stage. Wheat RGB and multispectral images of nine major growth stages were collected using a UAV (DJI P4M, Phantom4 Multispectral). To extract data's temporal and spatial features, a new deep neural network, CNN-LSTM, was proposed. Multimodal information, including wheat canopy colour, spectral, and space structure features, was extracted and integrated to predict wheat harvest properties in the model, and the three types of feature predictive power were compared. The highest precision rates (0.553, 0.527) were obtained by CNN-LSTM on yield and biomass, when the three types of features of nine stage were inputs. The prediction accuracy of the classical convolutional neural network (CNN) (0.367, 0.387) and long short term memory (LSTM) (0.467, 0.46) used for comparison was worse than that of the proposed model. Furthermore, the increasing rate in yield prediction at each period indicates that heading is the most important stage for wheat yield estimation. The study proves that the proposed approach can provide a relatively precise estimations of crop harvest properties.(c) 2023 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation and death of people in clinical risk groups during the Delta variant period: English primary care network cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be highly effective against hospitalisation and death following COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness estimates against severe endpoints among individuals with clinical conditions that place them at increased risk of critical disease are limited.Methods: We used English primary care medical record data from the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre sentinel network (N > 18 million). Data were linked to the National Immunisation Management Service database, Second Generation Surveillance System for virology test data, Hospital Episode Statistics, and death registry data. We estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) against COVID-19 infection followed by hospitalisation and death among individuals in specific clinical risk groups using a cohort design during the delta-dominant period. We also report mortality statistics and results from our antibody surveillance in this population.Findings: aVE against severe endpoints was high, 14-69d following a third dose aVE was 96.4% (95.1%-97.4%) and 97.9% (97.2%-98.4%) for clinically vulnerable people given a Vaxzevria and Comirnaty primary course respectively. Lower aVE was observed in the immunosuppressed group: 88.6% (79.1%-93.8%) and 91.9% (85.9%-95.4%) for Vaxzevria and Comirnaty respectively. Antibody levels were significantly lower among the immunosuppressed group than those not in this risk group across all vaccination types and doses. The standardised case fatality rate within 28 days of a positive test was 3.9/1000 in people not in risk groups, compared to 12.8/1000 in clinical risk groups. Waning aVE with time since 2nd dose was also demonstrated, for example, Comirnaty aVE against hospitalisation reduced from 96.0% (95.1-96.7%) 14-69days post-dose 2-82.9% (81.4-84.2%) 182days+ post-dose 2.Interpretation: In all clinical risk groups high levels of vaccine effectiveness against severe endpoints were seen. Reduced vaccine effectiveness was noted among the immunosuppressed group. (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The British Infection Association.

TI  - Assessment of the Radiometric Calibration Consistency of Reflective Solar Bands between Terra and Aqua MODIS in Upcoming Collection-7 L1B
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two MODIS sensors onboard the Terra and Aqua spacecraft have been successfully operating for over twenty-three and twenty-one years, respectively, providing the worldwide user community with high-quality imagery and radiometric Earth observations of the land, atmosphere, cryosphere, and oceans. This study provides an assessment of the radiometric calibration stability and consistency of Terra and Aqua MODIS RSB using the L1B from the upcoming Collection 7 release. Several independent vicarious approaches based on measurements from the Libya-4 desert, Dome C, DCC, and SNO are used to assess the calibration stability at the beginning of scan, nadir, and end of scan. Results indicate that both Terra and Aqua RSB are stable to within 1% over their mission periods. Comparison of the normalized reflectances with either a BRDF model or a common reference sensor provides a radiometric assessment of Terra and Aqua calibration consistency. Comparison results show the VIS/NIR bands are in good agreement around the nadir and at the beginning of the scan for all the approaches. For cases at the end of the scan, the agreement varies depending on the approach but is typically within +/- 2%. The differences observed in the SWIR bands are slightly larger than the VIS/NIR bands, which are likely due to their high sensitivity to atmospheric conditions and relatively larger electronic crosstalk impact on the Terra instrument.

TI  - Comparing the performance of machine learning algorithms for estimating aboveground biomass in typical steppe of northern China using Sentinel imageries
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring aboveground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing, managing, and utilizing grassland ecosystems. While the technical form of combining remote sensing and machine learning algorithms is widely used to estimate AGB at a regional scale, few studies have assessed and compared the performance of popular algorithms on the typical steppe in northern China. In this study, the northern Xilinhot, a representative area of typical steppe in China, was selected as the study area to compare the performance of six widely used machine learning algorithms for AGB estimation, namely stepwise linear regression (SLR), partial least square regression (PLS), principal component regression (PCR), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). Additionally, the study explored the modeling capability of multisource variables from Sentinel imagery and auxiliary data. The results showed that (1) considering the aspects of prediction accuracy, noise resistance, ease of operation, and transferability, the SLR algorithm is more suitable for estimating typical steppe AGB in northern China at the Sentinel scale. (2) Vegetation Indices (VI) play a significant role in the development of selected models, with significant contributions from both traditional and soil-adjusted indices. (3) Sentinel C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is unsuitable for modeling typical steppe AGB. (4) Among the selected environmental factors, only clay content and soil pH are significantly linearly correlated with AGB, while elevation, precipitation, temperature, soil pH, and sand content are advantageous for RF prediction. This study can provide important technical references for the research on AGB in typical steppe in northern China.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation of vegetation NPP and analysis of influencing factors in Heilongjiang Province, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) plays an important role in investigating carbon cycle and NPP provided by forest constitutes the main component of terrestrial vegetation NPP. Since late 1990s, a series of policies for protecting forest have been implemented in Heilongjiang Province, China, directly leading to the continuous change of forest area and growth environment. As a result, analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics of NPP after the implementation of protection policies was conducted in this study, and influencing factors leading to the distribution and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of NPP was also compared quantitatively, aiming to reveal the changing characteristics and influencing factors of NPP in a large area over a longer time span. In this study, multi-source data including MOD17A3 NPP product, meteorological data, topographic data and land-use data was selected, and then the spatiotemporal characteristics of NPP from 2001 to 2020 were analyzed through commonly-used spatiotemporal analysis indices and methods. Finally, influencing factors leading to the distribution and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of NPP in the study area were quantitatively compared and analyzed. Results show that the total amount of NPP in Heilongjiang Province has a fluctuating trend with an increasing rate of 23.47% over the past twenty years, and the increase/decrease scenarios of NPP usually can be found in forest regions with high forest coverage and urban regions experiencing dramatic urbanization processes, respectively. Meanwhile, this study also finds that there is no absolute dominant factor can be responsible for the difference in spatial distribution of NPP, but the conversion between forest and other land-use types are the main factors leading to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of NPP in the study area. The conclusions in this study may provide guiding significance for formulating forestry protection policies in forest regions and designing land-use plans in the future, aiming to achieve the balance between ecological protection and urban development.

AB  - Alxa League of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a concentrated desert distribution area in China, and the latest desertification process and its driving mechanism under the comprehensive influence of the extreme dry climate and intense human activities has attracted much attention. Landsat data, including ETM+ images obtained in 2000, TM images obtained in 2010, and OLI images obtained in 2020, were used to extract three periods of desertification land information using the classification and regression tree (CART) decision tree classification method in Alxa League. The spatio-temporal variation characteristics of desertification land were analyzed by combining the transfer matrix and barycenter migration model; the effects of climate change and human activities on regional desertification evolution were separated and recombined using the multiple regression residual analysis method and by considering the influence of non-zonal factors. The results showed that from 2000 to 2020, the overall area of desertification land in Alxa League was reduced, the desertification degree was alleviated, the desertification trend was reversed, and the desertification degree in the northern part of the region was more serious than in the southern part. The barycenter of the slight, moderate, and severe desertification land migrated to the southeast, whereas the serious desertification land's barycenter migrated to the northwest in the period of 2000-2010; however, all of them hardly moved from 2010 to 2020. The degree of desertification reversal in the south was more significant than in the north. Regional desertification reversal was mainly influenced by the combination of human activities and climate change, and the area accounted for 61.5%; meanwhile, the localized desertification development was mainly affected by human activities and accounted for 76.8%.

TI  - Study on the mechanisms of interannual variation in suspended sediment concentration in the Bohai Sea based on GOCI
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The launch of the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite has made it possible to observe suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the Bohai Sea (BHS) over a long time and a large area. We utilized remote sensing data from GOCI from 2011 to 2021 to study the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of SSC in the BHS and identified the contribution of each oceanic element to the changes in SSC. Our findings indicate that SSC is high in winter and low in summer, and related to the southeastward winds in winter (>7 m/s) and northwestward winds in summer (<4 m/s), with a correlation coefficient of 0.634. The average annual increase in SSC is 0.07 g/m3 (an increase of 1.2% per year). In terms of spatial distribution, SSC is highest in Bohai Bay and Laizhou Bay, followed by the Liaodong Bay, and is greater than that in the Central Bohai Sea, which is related to multiple river estuaries in the three bays. Additionally, the Bohai and Liaodong Bay in the BHS are covered by sea ice during winter, which affects the response of waves and currents to wind and changes the ocean current field, thereby affecting the resuspension and transport of sediment. Our EOF analysis revealed that wind-induced changes are the dominant factors in the variations of SSC, while changes in river runoff, sediment discharge, and sea ice cover are also important factors influencing SSC changes.

TI  - Response of vegetation normalized different vegetation index to different meteorological disaster indexes in karst region of Guangxi, China.
T2  - Heliyon
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Fragile karst areas of Guangxi are the key areas of vegetation protection and restoration work of the government. It is of great significance to study the effects of meteorological disasters on vegetation change for disaster prevention and reduction and ecological protection in the karst areas. The Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), as a tool for monitoring vegetation growth, has a strong responsiveness to vegetation and can qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the vegetation cover and its growth vitality. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the trend of vegetation change and the impacts of multiple meteorological hazards, such as drought, torrential rainfall, high temperature, and low temperature, on the vegetation of the karst region in Guangxi by using the linear trend method, GIS spatial analysis, and correlation analysis, using the MODIS NDVI and temperature and precipitation information from 2000 to 2020 in the karst region of Guangxi. The results show that: (1) NDVI increased significantly in the karst areas, and 32.2% of the areas had significant improvement in vegetation. The improvement was the most obvious mainly in the central part of the study area, while the vegetation degradation trend was obvious in partial scattered areas in northeast and southwest. (2) On the interannual scale, NDVI was negatively correlated with some meteorological disaster indexes, such as relative humidity index, the number of drought days, the amount of extremely heavy rainstorm, the amount of heavy rainstorm, the number of days with high temperature of ≥35°C, the number of days with high temperature of 35-37°C, the number of days with high temperature of ≥37°C, the minimum temperature, and the effective accumulated temperature of ≤0°C. The obvious negative effect area of drought on vegetation was mainly concentrated in the middle of the study area, and that of rainfall was mainly distributed in the southwest, northeast and northwest; that of high temperature was mainly distributed in the northwest and northeast, and that of low temperature was mainly concentrated in the southwest and north. (3) On the multi-year monthly scale, the responses of NDVI to drought, high temperature and low temperature disaster indexes had a lag effect, but had no lag effect on rainfall disaster indexes. The lag time of vegetation to drought was 1 month, and the lag time to high temperature and low temperature was 3 months.

TI  - Advancements in Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging with System-on-Chip Architecture and System Fault-Tolerant Technology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous development of satellite payload and system-on-chip (SoC) technology, spaceborne real-time synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging systems play a crucial role in various defense and civilian domains, including Earth remote sensing, military reconnaissance, disaster mitigation, and resource exploration. However, designing high-performance and high-reliability SAR imaging systems that operate in harsh environmental conditions while adhering to strict size, weight, and power consumption constraints remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a spaceborne SAR imaging chip based on a SoC architecture with system fault-tolerant technology. The fault-tolerant SAR SoC architecture has a CPU, interface subsystem, memory subsystem, data transit subsystem, and data processing subsystem. The data processing subsystem, which includes fast Fourier transform (FFT) modules, coordinated rotation digital computer (CORDIC) modules (for phase factor calculation), and complex multiplication modules, is the most critical component and can achieve various modes of SAR imaging. Through analyzing the computational requirements of various modes of SAR, we found that FFT accounted for over 50% of the total computational workload in SAR imaging processing, while the CORDIC modules for phase factor generation accounted for around 30%. Therefore, ensuring the fault tolerance of these two modules is crucial. To address this issue, we propose a word-length optimization redundancy (WLOR) method to make the fixed-point pipelined FFT processors in FFT modules fault tolerant. Additionally, we propose a fault-tolerant pipeline CORDIC architecture utilizing error correction code (ECC) and sum of squares (SOS) check. For other parts of the SoC architecture, we propose a generic partial triple modular redundancy (TMR) hardening method based on the HITS algorithm to improve fault tolerance. Finally, we developed a fully automated FPGA-based fault injection platform to test the design's effectiveness by injecting errors at arbitrary locations. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improved the chip's fault tolerance, making the SAR imaging chip safer and more reliable. We also implemented a prototype measurement system with a chip-included board and demonstrated the proposed design's performance on the Chinese Gaofen-3 strip-map continuous imaging system. The chip requires 9.2 s, 50.6 s, and 7.4 s for a strip-map with 16,384 x 16,384 granularity, multi-channel strip-map with 65,536 x 8192 granularity, and multi-channel scan mode with 32,768 x 4096 granularity, respectively, and the system hardware consumes 6.9 W of power to process the SAR raw data.

TI  - Encapsulated papillary carcinoma of the breast: A single institution experience
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Encapsulated papillary carcinoma (EPC) is a relatively rare form of breast cancer. To date, no evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of EPC have been established. Between January 2015 and December 2021, patients with histologically confirmed EPC of the breast were recorded in a database by The Third Hospital of Nanchang City (Nanchang, China). A total of 46 patients with EPC were retrieved from the database. Age at diagnosis ranged from 41-88 years (median age, 62 years). A total of 21 of these patients had pure EPC, 6 patients had EPC associated with ductal carcinoma in situ and 19 patients had EPC associated with invasive carcinoma. The majority of EPC cases were low nuclear grade, hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-negative. Additionally, myoepithelial cells were always absent in the papillae of the EPC. All patients underwent lumpectomy or mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy, and almost all of the patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was only suggested to 4 patients who were diagnosed with axillary lymph node involvement. Subsequently, the clinicopathological features of non-invasive EPC were compared with invasive EPC. The results indicated that larger tumor sizes and axillary lymph node metastases were more common in invasive tumors. During the follow-up, only 2 patients with invasive EPC experienced recurrence or metastasis. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of invasive EPC cases display aggressive characteristics and metastatic potential, despite it being considered a subtype of carcinoma in situ with excellent prognosis, and local surgical resection is the initial method of treatment. Therefore, adjuvant endocrine therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy should be considered in select patients, especially in those diagnosed with invasive EPC tumors.

TI  - What Is the Threshold Elevation at Which Climatic Factors Determine Snow Cover Variability? A Case Study of the Keriya River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and topography are pivotal factors influencing snow cover variation, highlighting the significance of investigating the altitudinal response of snow cover to climate change. This study adopted a new MODIS snow cover extent product over China, reanalysis climate data, and digital elevation model (DEM) data to analyze the variation characteristics of snow cover frequency (SCF) and climatic factors with elevation in the Keriya River Basin (KRB) during the hydrological years from 2000 to 2020. The Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) method was utilized to explore the elevation-based relationships between SCF and climatic factors. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) The SCF exhibited an "increasing-decreasing-increasing-decreasing" pattern intra-annually, with insignificant monthly inter-annual variations. Only November, January, April, and May demonstrated upward trends, whereas October and December remained relatively stable, and other months exhibited declines. (2) Vertical variations in SCF and climatic factors revealed fluctuating upward trends in SCF and wind speed. On the other hand, the air temperature consistently decreased at a lapse rate ranging from 0.60 to 0.85 degrees C/100 m. Precipitation demonstrated "rising-falling" or "rapidly rising-slowly rising" patterns, bounded by 3821 m (range 3474-4576 m). (3) A new decision scheme, which took into account the alteration of the primary SCF controlling factors and shifts between positive and negative impacts caused by these factors, was used to determine five threshold elevation zones: 2585 m (range 2426-2723 m), 3447 m (range 3125-3774 m), 4251 m (range 4126-4375 m), 5256 m (range 4975-5524 m), and 5992 m (range 5874-6425 m). These threshold elevation zones were evident in spring, with four of these appearing in autumn (excluding 4251 m) and summer (excluding 2585 m). Only two threshold elevation zones were observed in winter with elevation values of 3447 m and 5992 m, respectively. Our findings are crucial for a deeper understanding of snow cover variation patterns at different elevations and offer essential insights for the responsible management of regional water resources.

TI  - Study of Changes in the Ulan Buh Desert under the Dual Impacts of Desert Farmland Development and Climate Change
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Desert farmland provides food for desert areas, but water is the main limiting factor of this region, thus desert farmland has an extremely fragile ecological environment. This study investigated the temporal and spatial variations of vegetation NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) in the Ulan Buh Desert, China, from 1990 to 2022, using long-term Landsat satellite data obtained from the Google Earth Engine platform and local statistical data. The results showed that from 1990 to 2022, the NDVI exhibited relatively small fluctuations and a steady increase. Furthermore, the study analyzed the impact of climate factors, namely precipitation and temperature, on NDVI, and collected the groundwater lever changes under irrigation and farmland development. The results demonstrated a positive correlation between NDVI and both precipitation and temperature from 1990 to 2006. The study area experienced an overall trend of increasing humidity. Specifically, from 1990 to 2006, significant positive correlations with precipitation and temperature were observed in 4.4% and 5.5% of the region, respectively. From 2007 to 2022, significant positive correlations were observed in 5.4% and 72.8% of the region for precipitation and temperature, respectively. These findings suggest that temperature has become increasingly influential on vegetation NDVI, while the impact of precipitation remains relatively stable. Moreover, the study assessed the impact of human activities on vegetation NDVI. The results revealed that from 1990 to 2006, human activities contributed to 43.1% of the promotion of local vegetation NDVI, which increased to 90.9% from 2007 to 2022. This study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of vegetation in the Ulan Buh Desert and its response to climatic changes and human activities. The findings highlight the significance of climate conditions and human interventions in shaping the vegetation dynamics in the region, offering essential information for ecological restoration and conservation efforts.

TI  - Land surface phenology and its response to climate change in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area during 2001-2020
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP), an important branch of vegetation phenology, which is sensitive to climate change and play important role in ecosystem. As a typical subtropical area, in spite of its complex vegetation structure, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) LSP was not focused fully. Hence, In this study, a long time series LSP data from 2001 to 2020 was obtained based on MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using classical Savitzky-Golay filter. Subsequently, phenology spatial pattern and spatiotemporal trends and their correlation with climate change were analyzed for different vegetation types in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. The results revealed an obvious spatial heterogeneity and significant annual variation trend in vegetation phenology. The start of growing season (SOS) and the end of growing season (EOS) appeared delayed trend and the length of growing season (LOS) showed a prolonged trend, with average slope values of 0.55, 0.52 and 0.81 days per year, respectively. In general, preseason precipitation and solar radiation are the main climatic factors regulating vegetation phenology in the Greater Bay Area, and the enhancement of preseason precipitation and solar radiation is the main reason for the delay of vegetation withering and yellowing period and the extension of growing season. Ecosystems of the Greater Bay Area were mainly depending on preseason precipitation and solar radiation to regulate the leaf senescence and control plant growth duration. The present study can enhance performance of vegetation phenology models and provide useful information on ecological protection in subtropical areas.

TI  - A Transformer Model for Coastline Prediction in Weitou Bay, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The simulation and prediction of coastline changes are of great significance for the development and scientific management of coastal zones. Coastline changes are difficult to capture completely but appear significantly periodic over a long time series. In this paper, the transformer model is used to learn the changing trend of the coastline so as to deduce the position of the coastline in the coming year. First, we use the distance regularization level set evolution (DRLSE) model for instantaneous waterline extraction (IWE) from preprocessed Landsat time-series images from 2010-2020 in Weitou Bay, China. Then, tidal correction (TC) is performed on the extracted instantaneous waterline dataset to obtain coastlines projected to a single reference tidal datum. Finally, the coastline datasets from 2010-2019 are used for model training, and the coastline in 2020 is used for accuracy assessment. Three precision evaluation methods, including receiver operating characteristic curve matching, the mean offset, and the root mean square error, were used to verify the predicted coastline data. The receiver operating characteristic curve was specifically designed and improved to evaluate the accuracy of the obtained coastline. Compared with the support vector regression (SVR) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) methods, the results showed that the coastline predicted by the transformer model was the closest to the accurate extracted coastline. The accuracies of the correct values corresponding to SVR, LSTM, and transformer models were 88.27%, 94.08%, and 98.80%, respectively, which indicated the accuracy of the coastline extraction results. Additionally, the mean offset and root mean square error were 0.32 pixels and 0.57 pixels, respectively. In addition, the experimental results showed that tidal correction is important for coastline prediction. Moreover, through field investigations of coastlines, the predicted results obtained for natural coastlines were more accurate, while the predicted results were relatively poor for some artificial coastlines that were intensely influenced by human activities. This study shows that the transformer model can provide natural coastline changes for coastal management.

TI  - Predicting and Mapping Dominant Height of Oriental Beech Stands Using Environmental Variables in Sinop, Northern Turkey
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The dominant height of forest stands (SDH) is an essential indicator of site productivity in operational forest management. It refers to the capacity of a particular site to support stand growth. Sites with taller dominant trees are typically more productive and may be more suitable for certain management practices. The present study investigated the relationship between the dominant height of oriental beech stands and numerous environmental variables, including physiographic, climatic, and edaphic attributes. We developed models and generated maps of SDH using multilinear regression (MLR) and regression tree (RT) techniques based on environmental variables. With this aim, the total height, diameter at breast height, and age of sample trees were measured on 222 sample plots. Additionally, topsoil samples (0-20 cm) were collected from each plot to analyze the physical and chemical soil properties. The statistical results showed that latitude, elevation, mean annual maximum temperature, and several soil attributes (i.e., bulk density, field capacity, organic carbon, and pH) were significantly correlated with the SDH. The RT model outperformed the MLR model, explaining 57% of the variation in the SDH with an RMSE of 2.37 m. The maps generated by both models clearly indicated an increasing trend in the SDH from north to south, suggesting that elevation above sea level is a driving factor shaping forest canopy height. The assessments, models, and maps provided by this study can be used by forest planners and land managers, as there is no reliable data on site productivity in the studied region.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities experience rapid growth, and various drivers shape this growth. Notably, developing countries experience challenges on land use and transportation conflict. The idea of transit-oriented developments (TODs) is a solution for this concern of urbanization while there is no consensus on defining and identifying them. This study concentrated on the dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) effects on transit-oriented developments (TODs) by utilizing light rail stations from a metropolitan area in Turkey, as this is the first attempt in this geography. Spatial data covers of high-resolution Sentinel 2A remotely sensed data and Google Earth images acquired in 2021. The study performed the analyses within a 500-m light rail train station buffer. The results reveal that TODs include more urbanized, open space, street connection, commercials, and dense population as expected from the TOD concept. Local officials, practitioners, and developers should be involved with the TOD implementation and policy phases to establish tangible developments in urbanization.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral power coefficient (eta) of the particulate backscattering coefficient (b(bp)(lambda)) is directly estimated from the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) with a neural network-based scheme (NN eta) in this study. Evaluations with both synthetic dataset and in-situ measurements show that NN eta could significantly improve the accuracy of estimated eta compared to several conventional schemes reported in the literature that are based on chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl), band ratios of R-rs(lambda), or remotely sensed b(bp)(lambda). Demonstrations with measurements from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua further confirm the robustness of NN eta, where reasonable spatial distribution and seasonality of eta in the global oceans can be acquired by NN eta. High and low eta values are observed in the oligotrophic gyres and the coastal zones, respectively, which are consistent with the current understanding of eta distribution concluded from theoretic analysis and repeated field measurements in the global ocean. Implementation of NN eta to 19-year MODIS monthly composite measurements from 2003 to 2021 reveals strong seasonal variations of eta in most of the global ocean, but the decadal changes of eta are insignificant in the majority (similar to 82.2%) of the global ocean. Similar to any empirical algorithms, the performance of NN eta is dependent on the training dataset, particularly its range, here a proper upper limit of eta for natural waters is provided.

AB  - The growth of vegetation in desert areas is expected to cause considerable changes to the local climate. Compared to bare ground desert, the balance of different processes related to vegetation such as reduced albedo and increased evapotranspiration can either warm up or cool down the surface climate. Quantifying these changes is essential for impact assessments of climate mitigation and adaptation measures, especially in regions increasingly hit by heat waves such as the Arabian Peninsula. In this respect, the analysis of in situ observations is challenging owing to limited data, uneven vegetation distribution, complex terrain, and other confounding factors. Thus, this study, using long-term satellite data at the daily temporal resolution, estimates the impact of vegetation on land surface temperature for several agricultural regions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Results demonstrate that managed vegetation has a significant cooling effect during the day and particularly during hot weather events, reducing the highest temperatures by > 5 degrees C. During heat waves, managed vegetation can provide an additional cooling effect of about 3 degrees C (2 to 4 degrees C depending on the location). This effect is robustly assessed though a tailored statistical indicator that is suitable for application over complex terrain that are found in the Saudi agricultural sites. However, a situation is identified where the vegetation vigor collapsed and the cooling effect vanished, which was possibly related to issues associated with water management sustainability. Thus, herein, this paper discusses several potential solutions to achieve sustainable irrigation among those that were recently proposed in the scientific literature, such as desalinization from renewable energy and land-use change options that could enhance local precipitation. This study supports the decision-making process of the green initiatives undertaken in the Middle East and similar efforts in other arid regions.

TI  - Habitat heterogeneity explains cultivated and spontaneous plant richness in Haikou City, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent urbanization and human activities have led to the fragmentation of natural landscape patches and reduced the connectivity and degradation of urban ecosystems and biodiversity. Urban plant richness affects social functions and the well-being of urban residents and is driven by land use, local wealth, and urban green space management. Among these drivers, it remains unclear which factors play a more important role in driving the relative diversity of cultivated and spontaneous plant species richness in cities. Therefore, we investigated the spatial patterns and the drivers of cultivated and spontaneous plant species richness within 190 urban functional units (UFUs) in the tropical coastal city of Haikou, China, based on remote sensing data, fieldwork, and surveys of socioeconomic and greening management practices. Using multiple linear regression, we found that the most cultivated plants were located at colleges and universities, public affair service districts, and around hospitals, while the most spontaneous plants were found in transportation districts. The spatial organization of these plants was influenced by factors such as patchiness, connectivity, maintenance frequency and fertilizing frequency. Cultivated plants, conversely, were found to increase with patchiness and connectivity, and their presence was positively related to fertilizing and maintenance frequency. The richness of both spontaneous and cultivated plants was found to be influenced by various factors among different urban functional units (UFUs). The prox-imity to freshwater resources was found to increase the number of spontaneous plant species. Our findings underscore the significant impact of human activities on urban plant richness and highlight the importance of understanding these dynamics for urban planning and biodiversity conservation. Our work contributes to the scarce literature on the drivers of cultivated and spontaneous plant richness in recently developed tropical cities.

TI  - Winter wheat yield prediction using integrated Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 vegetation index time-series data and machine learning algorithms
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate forecasting of winter wheat yield is important to crop management, food security, and sustainable agricultural development. Unfortunately, the process of predicting winter wheat yield using satellite time series data often fails to capture complete and critical information about the crop growth process, which can restrict the accuracy of crop yield predictions. To overcome this challenge, it is necessary to increase the frequency of monitoring crop growth dynamics, identify suitable vegetation index (VI), and determine the optimal prediction model for time-series remote sensing data. In this study, we propose proposes a novel method for predicting winter wheat yield using integrated Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) vegetation index time-series data and machine learning algorithms. Firstly, the integrated L8 and S2 dataset was obtained through the steps of cloud masking, re-sampling, re-projection, BRDF correction, and band adjustment. Then, the optimal VI was determined based on the association between the growth characteristics of winter wheat and the time-series characteristic curves of each VI. Subsequently, we employed Bayesian optimized CatBoost (BO-CatBoost) regression model to predict winter wheat yield, and compared this method with three other data-driven methods, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), support vector regression (SVM), and random forest (RF). Our results showed that the winter wheat yield prediction accuracies reached the best performance using integrated Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 WDRVI (Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index) time-series data and BO-CatBoost model. The R2 values were 0.70, 0.63, and 0.68, and RMSE values were 0.62, 0.73, and 0.62 t/ha for the years 2019 to 2021, respectively. In addition, acceptable accuracy was obtained for yield prediction in 2021 based on the model trained with historical data from 2019 and 2020. Moreover, this study demonstrated the result that winter wheat yield could be predicted about 40 days earlier using the proposed method. Finally, results showed that the harmonized data improved the yield estimation accuracies by a factor of 1.52, 1.29, and 1.13 compared with single S2 dataset for years 2019-2021. Various experiments demonstrated that the proposed method could effectively estimate and predict winter wheat yield data with good accuracy and robustness. This study provides technical support for improving the accuracy of winter wheat yield prediction and has the potential to be extended to yield estimation for other crops.

TI  - Monitoring of subpixel impervious surface dynamics using seasonal time series Landsat 8 OLI imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since impervious surface is one of the core urban ecological indices, its high-precision time series monitoring at regional or global scales is highly desirable. Spectral features, spatial features, and temporal features have been successfully applied to regional impervious surface monitoring. However, few studies focus on the extraction of optimal features for subpixel impervious surface monitoring at the regional or global scales. In order to solve the above problem, this study proposes a new method for subpixel time series impervious surface estimation based on optimal spectral-temporal features. The proposed method first extracts various spectral indices from time series Landsat imagery to construct a spectral-temporal feature library. A feature scoring model is then established to optimize spectral-temporal features from the feature library. Based on the optimal spectral-temporal features, a modified semi-supervised Fuzzy C-means (FCM) method is proposed to identify stable pixels and extract endmembers from stable pixels. Finally, the endmembers are applied to the Fully Constrained Least Squares (FCLS) for time series impervious surface abundance extraction. The optimal spectral-temporal features can effectively distinguish impervious surfaces from pervious surfaces through feature optimization selection, and improve the feature utilization performances, thereby obtaining high-precision impervious surface mapping. The proposed method is applied in Wuhan, China, from 2013 to 2021, using seasonal time series Landsat 8 OLI images. Experimental results show that the impervious surface area of Wuhan expands from 567.27 km2 in winter 2013 to 1056.95 km2 in winter 2021 at the pixel scale. The impervious surface area expands from 545.80 km2 in winter 2013 to 921.01 km2 in winter 2021 at the subpixel scale. The subpixel impervious surface monitoring effectively solve the overestimation and underestimation problem of the pixel-scale impervious surface monitoring. This study characterizes the long-term dynamics of impervious surfaces at the subpixel scale and can provide reliable urban growth information for evaluating the impact of urbanization on the ecological environment.

TI  - Development and application of a vegetation degradation classification approach for the temperate grasslands of northern China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - To establish a unified grassland degradation assessment system, this study proposed a classification approach using a statistical method based on the percent decrease in the annual maximum leaf area index from a long time series of remote sensing data. The obtained classification thresholds for vegetation degradation were temporally stable and spatially universal and were thus well-suited as a new standard. They were specific for different temperate grassland types and applicable to large and heterogeneous areas. Meadow steppes had the lowest degradation thresholds, sensitive to changes in plant growth, desert-related steppes had the highest thresholds, and typical steppes had intermediate thresholds. We then used the obtained thresholds to assess the degradation status of temperate grasslands in northern China from 1981 to 2017. Degraded grasslands accounted for 8.2 % (1.72 x 10(7) ha), of which moderately, severely, and extremely severely degraded grasslands accounted for 38.6, 34.9, and 4.6 %, respectively. More than half (similar to 67 %) of the degraded grasslands in northern China occurred in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and these were dominated by severely degraded grasslands. About 20 % of all degraded grasslands in northern China occurred in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and were dominated by moderate degradation. These results were highly consistent with the Chinese national standard regarding the total degraded area. However, differences occurred in specific grassland degradation levels and grassland types. Therefore, compared with traditional approaches, the new approach provided a more accurate degradation assessment, which is crucial for protecting and restoring the different temperate grasslands of China.

TI  - Water Body Extraction of the Weihe River Basin Based on MF-SegFormer Applied to Landsat8 OLI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the era of big data, making full use of remote sensing images to automatically extract surface water bodies (WBs) in complex environments is extremely challenging. Due to the weak capability of existing algorithms in extracting small WBs and WB edge information from remote sensing images, we proposed a new method-Multiscale Fusion SegFormer (MF-SegFormer)-for WB extraction in the Weihe River Basin of China using Landsat 8 OLI images. The MF-SegFormer method adopts a cascading approach to fuse features output by the SegFormer encoder at multiple scales. A feature fusion (FF) module is proposed to enhance the extraction of WB edge information, while an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module is employed to enhance the extraction of small WBs. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of four kinds of band combinations on WB extraction by the MF-SegFormer model, including true color composite images, false color images, true color images, and false color images enhanced by Gaussian stretch. We also compared our proposed method with several different approaches. The results suggested that false color composite images enhanced by Gaussian stretching are beneficial for extracting WBs, and the MF-SegFormer model achieves the highest accuracy across the study area with a precision of 77.6%, recall of 84.4%, F1-score of 80.9%, and mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 83.9%. In addition, we used the determination coefficient (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) to evaluate the performance of river width extraction. Our extraction results in an overall R2 of 0.946 and an RMSE of 28.21 m for the mainstream width in the "Xi'an-Xianyang" section of the Weihe River. The proposed MF-SegFormer method used in this study outperformed other methods and was found to be more robust for WB extraction.

TI  - Large-scale apple orchard mapping from multi-source data using the semantic segmentation model with image- to- image translation and transfer learning
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale mapping of apple orchards through remote sensing is of great significance for apple production management and the sustainable development of the apple industry. The flexible unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data and a wide swath of Sentinel-2 (S2) data provided the opportunity to map apple orchards accurately and in a timely manner over a large area. In order to fully combine the advantages of these data and realize the accurate monitoring of apple orchards, this study proposed a semantic segmentation method based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) and transfer learning model (Trans_GAN). First, semantic segmentation models (Fully Convolutional Networks, U-Net, SegNet, DeepLabv3+) were compared. The model with the best performance on both S2 and UAV was selected as the optimal apple orchard recognition model. Second, to solve the problem of domain differences between S2 and UAV, CycleGAN was introduced to convert UAV images into the style of S2 images (Fake S2, F_S2). Finally, this study introduced the transfer learning method and used the F_S2 to assist S2 images to complete the task of extracting large-scale apple planting. Trans_GAN was tested in Zibo and Yantai. The results showed the ability of SegNet to refine the segmentation results and, as a result, achieve the highest extraction accuracy on both UAV and S2 images. The proposed method produced results as high as 20.93% in recall and 15.93% in F1 when compared to the SegNet method based on S2 without image-to-image translation and transfer learning. Therefore, the Trans_GAN method opens a new window for large-scale remote sensing apple orchard mapping.

TI  - Impact of Hydrological Changes on Wetland Landscape Dynamics and Implications for Ecohydrological Restoration in Honghe National Nature Reserve, Northeast China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Marsh wetlands are significant ecosystems located between land and water bodies which can both protect species diversity and provide habitats. Changes in the hydrological situation of marsh wetlands as a result of climate change and human activities have led to the degradation of wetland landscapes. Taking the Honghe National Nature Reserve (HNNR) in Heilongjiang Province, China, as an example, this paper gathered information on the reserve's wetland landscape before and after dam construction. The information was obtained using field survey data and a random forest classification method based on Landsat data powered by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. Then, on the basis of the water level data and the digital elevation model, the wetland landscape dynamics of HNNR under three water level conditions were simulated. The findings were as follows: (1) From 1998 to 2008, the area of marsh and meadow had a downward trend, while the area of forest, farmland and water showed a gradual and upward trend; a marked rise in the area of marsh and a continued rise in the area of forest, farmland and water, and a sharp decline in the area of meadow during 2008 to 2018 was observed. (2) There was a significant increase in the area of marsh under the 20 and 40 cm water level simulation scenarios, with a decrease in the number of patches, and an increase in the aggregation index with rising water levels; in contrast, when the water level rose to 60 cm, the area of marsh and the number of patches decreased, but the aggregation index continued to increase. (3) The correlation between wetland landscape and the water level was a nonlinear one. The area of marsh increased and then decreased with increasing water level, reaching a maximum at the 40 cm water level; therefore, 40 cm was the optimal water level regulation scenario. Hydrological processes are the most fundamental ecological processes in marsh wetlands. Understanding the scientific pattern of the spatial pattern characteristics of species as a function of water level environment is important for scientifically guiding the restoration of marsh vegetation.

TI  - The imprint of urbanization on vegetation in the ecologically fragile area: A case study from China's Loess Plateau
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization significantly affects vegetation growth in urban environments. Responses of vegetation to urbanization at high spatial resolutions and long temporal ranges are still unclear, especially in ecologically fragile areas. Here, we explored urbanization impacts on vegetation across China's Loess Plateau (CLP) from 2000 to 2020 at a spatial resolution of 30 m. Urbanization and annual maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in urban agglomerations, provincial capital cities, also the whole CLP experienced a rapid increase over this period; the annual maximum NDVI (NDVImax) in urban areas decreased before 2011 but increased afterward to reach its maximum value in 2018, and in non-urban areas, a significant increase was found between 2000 and 2020. NDVImax with significant reduction areas were mostly distributed in the urbanization area. A total of 97.56%, 53.66%, 80.49%, and 100% of all cities' urban core, urbanization, urban, and non-urban areas, respectively, indicated an increase in NDVImax during 2000-2020. For 97.56% (40/41) of the cities in the CLP, the increases in NDVImax in the non-urban areas were stronger than the NDVImax increases detected in the urban areas of these cities. In general, the urban areas of most cities (29/41) in the CLP had positive NDVI trends of greater than 50%. The NDVImax generally decreased with increasing urbanization development intensity (UDI) in 2000 and 2020 in the CLP along with five urban agglomerations. These findings have important implications for understanding urbanization impacts on vegetation, urbanization management, and development in ecologically fragile areas.

TI  - The continuing decrease of sandy desert and sandy land in northern China in the latest 10 years
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely monitoring of the sandy desert and sandy land (SDSL) dynamics and their driving factors is vital for ecological restoration policy-making to combat the expansion of the SDSL. Northern China, being the principal implementation area of ecological restoration projects, is ecologically fragile and encompasses almost all of the SDSL regions in China. To explore and compare the dominant driving factors for SDSL changes by extracting both aeolian activity information and vegetation indices, the SDSL datasets in northern China from 2010 to 2020 were first constructed in this study by the human-computer interactive interpretation method based on the series Landsat image data. The spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of SDSL were subsequently analyzed, and the dominant driving factors of SDSL changes were further explored via the geodetector model by the fractional vegetation cover trend and the difference of aeolian activity index. The results showed a net decrease of 3,780.25 km2 in the total SDSL area between 2010 and 2020, and the decrease rate was 2.44 times higher in the shorter period of 2015-2020 compared to 2010-2015. The spatial differentiation between the western and eastern parts of the Helan Mountains was prominently exhibited by the relatively higher changed SDSL area in the eastern part (62.74% for aeolian activity weakened and 83.32% for aeolian activity intensified) and the increasingly changed SDSL area in the western part (from 33.09% to 39.60% in aeolian activity weakened and from 13.02% to 19.60% in aeolian activity intensified). Especially, the increased aeolian activity intensified SDSL area has happened on the southern edge of the Gurbantunggut Desert and along both sides of the Tarim River from 2015 to 2020 deserve attention. The co-driving of the multiple driving factors dominated the change of SDSL from 2010 to 2020, with the county mean value of the difference in aeolian activity index (MDAAI) and the county mean value of the trend in fractional vegetation cover (MFVCT) as dependent variables, respectively. Climatic factors of the mean annual average temperature, the mean annual cumulative precipitation, and the mean annual aridity index have a relatively larger explanatory power for the change of SDSL in both MDAAI and MFVCT. Anthropogenic factors of the mean annual afforestation area and the mean annual number of large livestock and sheep and goats (year-end) have a greater explanatory power in MDAAI, while the mean annual number of large livestock and sheep and goats (year-end) and the mean annual population density in MFVCT. In particular, the dependent variable MDAAI is better at identifing the dominant drivers of aeolian activity intensified SDSL area compared to MFVCT, with anthropogenic factors playing a stronger dominant role.

TI  - Identifying the Effects of Vegetation on Urban Surface Temperatures Based on Urban-Rural Local Climate Zones in a Subtropical Metropolis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have observed the crucial role of vegetated local climate zone (LCZ) types in mitigating the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect. However, research analyzing the spatial variations in land surface temperature (LST) in a metropolis based on an urban-rural LCZ scheme and exploring the cooling effects of different vegetation types is still lacking. Here, our study focuses on the Guangzhou-Foshan metropolis and aims to elucidate the spatial variations in LST in subtropical cities and the regulating effect of vegetation on LST changes. We used a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and LST data from space-borne MODIS products for the years 2000, 2009, and 2019, as well as LCZ maps, urban-rural gradient data, and land use and land cover (LULC) maps. Urban-rural, seasonal, daytime, nighttime, and diurnal comparative analyses were conducted using logarithmic regression, Pearson partial correlation, and comparison analysis. The results showed that LST values for built LCZ types were generally higher than those of land cover LCZ types, showing a positive correlation with building density and height. The LST decreased logarithmically across the urban-rural gradients, with a rapid decrease initially in the near-gradient urban area, followed by a flattening trend in farther-gradient suburban and rural areas. Regarding vegetated LCZ types, the NDVI metrics showed a significant negative correlation with the LST during the daytime but a positive correlation during the nighttime. The cooling effect of vegetated LCZ types was evident, with an average cooling amplitude of 1.92 degrees C over the three investigated years. In conclusion, urban LST changes are closely associated with LCZ types, urban-rural gradients, NDVI values, and vegetation types. The cooling ability of vegetation exhibited seasonal and diurnal variations, with a special emphasis on the cooling effect of dense evergreen broadleaf forests. Our findings offer valuable insights and can guide urban ecological construction and management by comprehensively assessing the impact of vegetation on urban surface temperatures.

TI  - An Overview of Coastline Extraction from Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The coastal zone represents a unique interface between land and sea, and addressing the ecological crisis it faces is of global significance. One of the most fundamental and effective measures is to extract the coastline's location on a large scale, dynamically, and accurately. Remote sensing technology has been widely employed in coastline extraction due to its temporal, spatial, and sensor diversity advantages. Substantial progress has been made in coastline extraction with diversifying data types and information extraction methods. This paper focuses on discussing the research progress related to data sources and extraction methods for remote sensing-based coastline extraction. We summarize the suitability of data and some extraction algorithms for several specific coastline types, including rocky coastlines, sandy coastlines, muddy coastlines, biological coastlines, and artificial coastlines. We also discuss the significant challenges and prospects of coastline dataset construction, remotely sensed data selection, and the applicability of the extraction method. In particular, we propose the idea of extracting coastlines based on the coastline scene knowledge map (CSKG) semantic segmentation method. This review serves as a comprehensive reference for future development and research pertaining to coastal exploitation and management.

AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is an important index with which to evaluate the safety and quality of regional carbon sinks. Based on the improved CASA model, climate data, social data, remote-sensing ecological data, and other multi-source data types, this article took a Chinese city, Yangzhou, as the research object, used Theil-Sen medium-trend analysis and the Hurst index to analyze its spatial-temporal-evolution characteristics and future change trends, and used geographical detectors to analyze the impact of climate, social, ecological, and other factors on the change in NPP in the study area, with the intention of providing a theoretical exploration and practical basis for achieving the "dual carbon" goals in the region. The results showed that the annual average NPP levels of the vegetation in Yangzhou in the five sampling years were 445.343 gc/m(2)center dot a, 447.788 gc/m(2)center dot a, 427.763 gc/m(2)center dot a, 398.687 gc/m(2)center dot a, and 420.168 gc/m(2)center dot a, respectively, exhibiting a trend that first decreases and then increases, with a slight overall decrease from 2000 to 2020. The area in which the vegetation in Yangzhou had the higher grades of NPP increased by 203,874 km(2), and an increase of 321,769 km(2) in the lower levels was observed. The NPP level of vegetation showed polarization, with relatively high levels in the surrounding farmland and mountain-forest areas and relatively low levels in densely populated urban areas. The ranking was highest in Baoying and lowest in Gaoyou. From the average NPP of all the land types in the study area, the following trend was exhibited: forest land > farmland > bare soil > impermeable surface > water. The future change in vegetation NPP in Yangzhou City will mainly follow the trend of the past 20 years, with a slow decrease. The NDVI (q = 0.728) and LUCC (q = 0.5601) were the leading driving factors of vegetation NPP change in Yangzhou City, and the interaction effect of double driving factors was greater than that of single driving factors.

TI  - Human Disturbance Increases Health Risks to Golden Snub-Nosed Monkeys and the Transfer Risk of Pathogenic Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria from Golden Snub-Nosed Monkeys to Humans
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - From the perspective of interactions in the human-animal-ecosystem, the study and control of pathogenic bacteria that can cause disease in animals and humans is the core content of "One Health". In order to test the effect of human disturbance (HD) on the health risk of pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria (PARBs) to wild animals and transfer risk of the PARBs from wild animals to humans, golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) were used as sentinel animals. Metagenomic analysis was used to analyze the characteristics of PARBs in the gut microbiota of golden snub-nosed monkeys. Then, the total contribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) of the PARBs were used to assess the health risk of PARBs to golden snub-nosed monkeys, and the antimicrobial drug resistance and bacterial infectious disease of PARBs were determined to assess the transfer risk of PARBs from golden snub-nosed monkeys to humans. There were 18 and 5 kinds of PARBs in the gut microbiota of golden snub-nosed monkeys under HD (HD group) and wild habitat environments (W group), respectively. The total health risks of PARBs to the W group and the HD group were -28.5 x 10(-3) and 125.8 x 10(-3), respectively. There were 12 and 16 kinds of KEGG pathways of human diseases in the PARBs of the W group and the HD group, respectively, and the gene numbers of KEGG pathways in the HD group were higher than those in the W group. HD increased the pathogenicity of PARBs to golden snub-nosed monkeys, and the PARBs in golden snub-nosed monkeys exhibited resistance to lincosamide, aminoglycoside, and streptogramin antibiotics. If these PARBs transfer from golden snub-nosed monkeys to humans, then humans may acquire symptoms of pathogens including Tubercle bacillus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Yersinia, Pertussis, and Vibrio cholera.

TI  - Increased risk of recurrence and disease-specific death following delayed postoperative radiation for Merkel cell carcinoma.
T2  - Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is often treated with surgery and postoperative radiation therapy (PORT). The optimal time to initiate PORT (Time-to-PORT [ttPORT]) is unknown.PURPOSE: We assessed if delays in ttPORT were associated with inferior outcomes.METHODS: Competing risk regression was used to evaluate associations between ttPORT and locoregional recurrence (LRR) for patients with stage I/II MCC in a prospective registry and adjust for covariates. Distant metastasis and death were competing risks.RESULTS: The cohort included 124 patients with median ttPORT of 41days (range: 8-125days). Median follow-up was 55months. 17 (14%) patients experienced a LRR, 14 (82%) of which arose outside the radiation field. LRR at 5years was increased for ttPORT >8weeks vs≤8weeks, 28.0% vs 9.2%, P=.006. There was an increase in the cumulative incidence of MCC-specific death with increasing ttPORT (HR=1.14 per 1-week increase, P=.016).LIMITATIONS: The relatively low number of LRRs limited the extent of our multivariable analyses.CONCLUSIONS: Delay of PORT was associated with increased LRR, usually beyond the radiation field. This is consistent with the tendency of MCC to spread quickly via lymphatics. Initiation of PORT within 8weeks was associated with improved locoregional control and MCC-specific survival.

TI  - Beauty, baby and backlash? Anti-feminist influencers on TikTok
T2  - FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Grounded in empirical data, this qualitative study analyses how female anti-feminist influencers engage in metapolitics and how anti-feminist practices of metapolitics unfold within visual social media content. Employing multimodal content analysis and netnography this study adds to the research on metapolitics and political influencers. Applying network media logic as an analytical lens this paper is focusing on three female anti-feminist influencers and their metapolitical practices on TikTok. Results show that female anti-feminist influencers use different practices to metapolitize their (supposed) private life while introducing their audience to anti-feminist ideas and other anti-feminist actors, e.g., actors of the so-called manosphere. Further, they use TikTok to commodify their anti-feminist worldview.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this research was to distinguish and estimate natural forest areas at Parana, Brazil. Forest plantations (Silviculture) and natural forests have high annual vegetative vigor, as well as agricultural areas in the periods of agricultural harvests, which can bring classification errors between these classes of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC), these classes have similar spectral signatures, but have a distinct texture that can be separated in the supervised classification process, with the joining of object and pixel-to-pixel classification method approaches. Thus, image segmentation techniques through Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Machine Learning (ML) made forest mapping possible over a large territorial extension. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was used to calculate the vegetation indices (VIs) and Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) fraction spectral from Sentinel-2 images, and the creation of homogeneous spectrally shaped regions under supervised classification of phytoecological regions and mesoregions. The overall precision obtained in the mappings resulted in 0.94 Kappa Index (KI) and 96% of Overall Accuracy (OA), which indicates a high performance in large-scale forest mapping. The proposed dataset, source codes and trained models are available on Github (https://github.com/Cechim/simepar-brazil/), creating opportunities for further ad vances in the field.Le but de cette recherche etait de distinguer et d'estimer les superficies forestieres indigenes du Parana, au Bresil. Les plantations forestieres (sylviculture) et les forets naturelles ont une vigueur vegetative annuelle elevee de meme que les zones agricoles pendant les periodes de recoltes agricoles, ce qui peut entrainer des erreurs de classification entre ces trois classes d'utilisation des terres (LULC). Ces classes ont des signatures spectrales similaires, mais ont une texture distincte qui peut etre separee dans le processus de classification supervisee en combinant les methodes de classification par objet et par pixel. Ainsi, les techniques de segmentation d'images par l'analyse basee sur les objets (OBIA) et l'apprentissage automatique (ML) ont rendu possible la cartographie forestiere sur un grand territoire. La plate-forme Google Earth Engine (GEE) a ete utilisee pour calculer les indices de vegetation (VIs), pour analyser les melanges spectraux (SMA) d'images Sentinel-2, et pour creer des regions spectralement ho-mogenes lors de la classification supervisee des regions phytoecologiques et des mesoregions. Les classifications resultantes ont obtenu un indice Kappa (KI) global de 0,94 et une precision globale (OA) de 96%, ce qui indique une performance elevee dans la cartographie forestiere a grande echelle. L'ensemble de donnees, les codes sources et les modeles entraines sont disponibles sur Github1, ce qui ouvre la voie a de nouvelles avancees dans ce domaine.

TI  - Duo satellite-based remotely sensed land surface temperature prediction by various methods of machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA SCIENCE AND ANALYTICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The entire world is witnessing challenges in climate change and control catastrophes. Addressing and investigating sustainable climate and urban thermal harmony can be done by getting deeper into pattern and anomalies identification in land surface temperature studies. In this paper, we have discussed duo satellite-based remotely sensed land surface temperature prediction using various methods of machine learning in the western Indian smart city, Ajmer from data range 2003-2021. Quad LST datasets (two for daytime and two for nighttime) from MODIS sensor on board Aqua and Terra satellites were incubated in this study. In the field of remote sensing, neural networks and the essence of artificial intelligence are now being smelled in a diverse assortment of applications, and regular new application proposals are being made. In the present study, machine learning techniques are used to predict the temperature of the same day and future day. To evaluate the accuracy of the predictions made by each method, the R-2 score and RMSE were calculated. R-2 score is a statistical measure that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). A score of 1 indicates a perfect fit, while a score of 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variability in the data. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is a measure of the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. By calculating these metrics, the researchers and urban dwellers are able to determine the accuracy of the different Machine Learning methods. These findings and future developments can be used in land surface temperature prediction in different contexts such as quality and quantity of available different satellite data, duration, and study area in climate studies, earth and atmospheric sciences.

TI  - Distribution of sentinel nodes from parotid tumors-A feasibility study
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundOptimum management of the N0 neck is unresolved in parotid salivary gland cancer. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) can reliably detect microscopic lymph node metastasis and its ' clinical use is increasing for head and neck tumors. The object of this study was to establish whether the technique is applicable to detect distribution of sentinel nodes for parotid tumors.Materials and MethodsProsepective observational study in 30 patients with benign or low-grade T1-T2N0 malignant tumors in the parotid gland planned for surgical treatment. Distribution of SN was detected with a preoperative ultrasound-guided peritumoral injection with a technetium-99 (Tc-99 m) laballed tracer followed by a SPECT-CT and intraoperative measurement in the neck and parotidal tissue. In patients with cytologically suspected malignant tumor or highly unclerar cytology, SNB was also performed.ResultsSentinel nodes (SNs) were detected in 26/30 cases. Out of these, 7 presented with only one SN, whereas multiple sentinel nodes where detected in 19 cases. No SNs were found in neck level 1. SN was detected in level 5 independent of tumor location within the parotid gland. An intraparotidal distribution of SNs was more frequent in larger tumors.ConclusionsThe use of SN-technique in the planning of surgical treatment of parotid tumors seems feasible. It may be of clinical value for patients with parotid cancer to enable a more accurate staging and to detect occult metastasis in the SNs within the parotid as well as in the neck, enabaling the possibility to surgically remove all positive SNs at primary surgery and with reduced surgical morbidity.Prosepective observational study in 30 patients with T1-T2N0 benign or low-grade malignant tumors in the parotid gland planned for surgical treatment. Sentinel nodes (SNs) were detected in 26/30 cases, also within the parotid gland. The use of SN-technique in the planning of surgical treatment of parotid tumors seems feasible and may enable to detect occult metastasis in the SNs within the parotid as well as in the neck.image

TI  - Assessment of Wetland Ecosystem's Health Using Remote Sensing - Case Study: Burullus Wetland - Ramsar Site
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Complex ecosystems as wetlands are very sensitive to changes and disturbances. Human activities causing habitat fragmentation that alter landscapes affect the wetland ecosystems and negatively influence biodiversity. The health of the ecosystem is measured as a homeostasis between the system components and stability or resilience of the system against disturbance; therefore, any anthropogenic disturbances can cause dramatic changes in the balance of wetland ecosystem. Burullus, the second largest of the Egyptian northern coastal wetlands along the Mediterranean coast, has been recognized recently as critically endangered ecosystem according to an assessment using IUCN Red List of ecosystems. The study sought to assess Burullus wetland's health based on multispectral indicators related to the structure, function, and resilience of the ecosystem. Three indices were calculated to quantify the health of the wetland: the structure index, vigor index, and resilience index. The overall status of the wetland indicates a dynamic state and rapid transformation, which occurred over the study period. The outcomes indicated that Burullus's health has progressively deteriorated in the recent investigated years of 2016 and 2019 compared to the reference years of 1984 and 1986. The assessed indicators revealed a trend towards more deterioration of its ecological system due to the LULC transformations, anthropogenic interventions, and overexploitation of its natural resources. In addition, the growth in the impervious surfaces by 9% in the recent years due to expansion in urbanization was detected. All of these factors may affect the ecological balance and the health of the wetland to some extent. The fragility of this wetland and the continuous fragmentation of it occurs due to human activities that threaten its important and unique habitats. The integrated framework for the assessment of Burullus wetland's health based on remotely sensed data and using geospatial techniques can be utilized for the assessment of other similar coastal wetlands at national and regional scales.

TI  - MODIS Terra and Aqua images bring non-negligible effects to phytoplankton blooms derived from satellites in eutrophic lakes.
T2  - Water research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Phytoplankton-induced lake eutrophication has drawn ongoing interest on a global scale. One of the most popular remote sensing satellite data for observing long-term dynamic changes in phytoplankton is Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, it is worth noting that MODIS provides two images with different transit times: Terra (local time, about 10:30 am) and Aqua (local time, about 1:30 pm), which may result in a considerable bias in monitoring phytoplankton bloom areas due to the rapid migration of phytoplankton under wind or hydrodynamic conditions. To analyze this quantitatively, we selected MODIS Terra and Aqua images to generate datasets of phytoplankton bloom areas in Lake Taihu from 2003 to 2022. The results showed that Terra more frequently detected larger ranges of phytoplankton blooms than Aqua, whether on daily, monthly, or annual scales. In addition, long-term trend changes, seasonal characteristics, and abrupt years also varied with different transit times. Terra detected mutation years earlier, while Aqua displayed more pronounced seasonal characteristics. There were also differences in sensitivity to climate factors, with Terra being more responsive to temperature and wind speed on monthly and annual scales, while Aqua was more sensitive to nutrient and meteorological factors. These conclusions have also been further confirmed in Lake Chaohu, Lake Dianchi, and Lake Hulun. In conclusion, our findings strongly advocate for a linear relationship to fit Terra to Aqua results to mitigate long-term monitoring errors of phytoplankton blooms in inland lakes (R2=0.70, RMSE=101.56). It is advised to utilize satellite data with transit times between 10 am and 1 pm to track phytoplankton bloom changes and to consider the diverse applications resulting from the transit times of Terra and Aqua.

TI  - The left-wing legacy in '70s Hong Kong television: Chameleon (1978) and Lee Sil-hong's Rediffusion (RTV) tetralogy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHINESE CINEMAS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - A missing chapter in the history of postwar left-wing Hong Kong cinema involves the channeling of its energies into television in the 1970s. At Rediffusion (RT V), producer Lee Sil-hong - son of director Lee Sun-fung - mobilized veterans from the classical period of the left-wing studios to produce a tetralogy of serialized television dramas that represent the apotheosis of the jiating lunli pian, not only resurrecting the spirit behind such classic Union melodramas as In the Face of Demolition (1953) or their celebrated adaptation of Ba Jin's "Torrents" trilogy, but doing so with an epic ambition with regard to historical scope and scale that had been inconceivable even in the heyday of left-wing Hong Kong cinema in the 1950s. Providing a panoramic account of twentieth--century Chinese history, Lee's tetralogy - Chameleon (1978), Gone with the Wind (1980), Fatherland (1980), and Hong Kong Gentlemen (1981) - predates by at least a decade attempts by China's Fifth Generation, New Taiwan Cinema, and the Hong Kong New Wave to address such subject matter in comparable fashion through the social epic or family melodrama. Factors that made possible Lee's achievement include: (i) the central importance of television as a medium for the expression of local cultural identity during the period of Hong Kong's economic takeoff, (ii) the renewal on television of left-wing filmmaking philosophy and practices inherited from Thirties Shanghai and Fifties Hong Kong, and (iii) the social realist sensibility of the left-wing tradition - along with its strong interest in the transcultural adaptation of foreign literature - that allowed it to frame local experience in terms of the global, benefitting from an awareness of both the 19th-century European novel and the contemporary American television epic. Situating Lee's tetralogy within the broader historical context of persistent Chinese left-wing efforts across generations to contest politically rival screen practices, this essay analyzes Chameleon for its distinctive worldview and methods characteristic of the jiating lunli pian, while assessing its functional aesthetic as rooted in the literature-inspired realist melodrama with didactic aims - an inherited tradition to which it contributed a magisterial endpoint but beyond which it was unwilling to advance, unlike the groundbreaking modernism of the Hong Kong New Wave's television work.

TI  - Combining multi-temporal airborne LiDAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral data for assessment of disturbances and recovery of mangrove forests
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbances such as tropical cyclones and insect pests in mangroves can cause defoliation, tree mortality, and other changes in ecosystem processes. Understanding the resistance and resilience of mangroves to disturbance is critical to developing strategies for conservation. However, most studies apply multi-temporal optical data which have limited power to detect structural changes, especially for forests with complex architectures. We combined multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) images and airborne LiDAR Scanning (ALS) datasets to assemble a comprehensive view of the effects of two disturbance events (a moth pest and a super-typhoon) on mangroves in Mai Po, Hong Kong. A series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) estimates derived from S2 data indicated changes in greenness before and after the moth pest and typhoon events. An object-based stratification method was applied with ALS data to separate the overstory and understory to distinguish stratum changes. The results showed that moth larvae were more likely to encroach leafy mangroves of Avicennia marina. Double-layered and single-layered short mangroves have better resistance to typhoons than younger tall mangroves without understory beneath. NDVI recovered rapidly after three to six months post-disturbance but significant changes in canopy structures were found from the ALS data. Canopy gaps increased both in size and quantity in mature overstory areas, likely benefitting the growth of the understories beneath. Finally, the understory area grew resulting in a transition from single-layered to double-layered structures. The combination of multi-temporal LiDAR and multispectral data used here highlights the power of complementary remote sensing products in documenting mangrove ecosystem processes.

TI  - Perfluorooctanoic Acid Promotes Recruitment and Exocytosis of Rodlet Cells in the Renal Hematopoietic Tissue of Common Carp.
T2  - Toxics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants, with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) being a prominent member. PFOA poses a risk to aquatic ecosystems and human health due to its presence in water, environmental persistence, and bioaccumulation. Since rodlet cells (RCs) have emerged as potential biomarkers for chemical stressors, this study aimed to investigate the effects of sub-chronic PFOA exposure on RCs in the renal hematopoietic tissue of common carp. Three groups of fish were used: an unexposed control group and two groups exposed to environmentally relevant (200 ng L-1) and elevated (2 mg L-1) PFOA concentrations. Light and transmission electron microscopy were employed to assess RCs' distribution patterns and exocytosis, while biometry quantified RCs in the hematopoietic tissue. The results showed that, even at environmentally relevant concentrations, PFOA significantly influenced RCs' distribution patterns, leading to increased occurrence and cluster formation, as well as heightened exocytosis activity. This research highlights PFOA's immunotoxicity in fish and suggests the potential of RCs as sentinel cells in the immunological response to environmental contaminants. These findings enhance our understanding of PFAS toxicity and emphasise the importance of monitoring their impact on fish as representative vertebrates and reliable animal models.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Purpose In Japan, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare decided to suspend govermental recommendation for HPV vaccination in FY 2013. The HPV vaccination rate for those born in FY 2000 or thereafter declined dramatically. In 2021, the "suspension of recommendation" ended. The catch-up vaccinations for the unvaccinated have been offered nationwide from FY 2022 to FY 2024. We aimed to quantify the vaccination intentions and characteristics of those young women now eligible for catch-up vaccination.Methods In February of 2022, we conducted an internet survey targeted women who were born in 1997-2004 but who had not yet been HPV vaccinated.Results We received 1,648 valid responses. 41.6% of the respondents wanted to uptake the catch-up HPV vaccination, 29.7% were undecided, and 28.7% did not want to be vaccinated. The intention to uptake catch-up HPV vaccination was associated with a good history of gynecological visits, intention to receive cervical cancer screening, sexual activity, degree of anxiety about cervical cancer, familiarity with problems associated with cervical cancer, experience with vaccination recommendations, and knowledge about cervical cancer (p < 0.05, respectively). In the vaccinated generation, the proportion of the group that did not want to be vaccinated was significantly higher (p < 0.05). In the vaccine-suspended generation, the proportion of the group that wanted to be vaccinated was significantly higher (p < 0.05).Conclusion Our survey revealed that catch-up vaccination intentions differed depending on the vaccination environment. It is necessary for all organizations involved with HPV vaccination, such as government, medical institutions, and educational institutions, to make recommendations based on an understanding of the characteristics of the "vaccinated generation" and the "vaccine-suspended generation".

TI  - Evaluating topography-based methods in 3D decomposition of InSAR 1D velocities obtained for translational landslides: Thompson River valley in Canada
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has gained considerable attention as a landslide monitoring strategy owing to its high accuracy, large coverage, and relatively low associated costs. A crucial drawback of InSAR, however, has limited its further incorporation: one-dimensional estimations along the sensor's line-of-sight (LOS). This leads to an ambiguity in results and a less intuitive understanding of landslide kinematics. A frequently exercised approach to address this issue has been taking inspiration from the topography to establish compatibility assumptions between velocity components, yet little insight exists on the performance of these methods. The objective of this paper is to investigate the performance of four renowned topography-based methods-Surface Parallel Flow Model (SPFM), SPFM coupled with least-squares method (SPF-LSM), Aspect Parallel Flow Model (APFM), and Steepest Terrain Following Model (STFM)-in evaluating the magnitude and geometry of total velocity vectors. To this end, the analysis is performed on 202 Radarsat-2 and 243 Sentinel-1 scenes acquired over a section of the Thompson River valley, a critical railway corridor in Western Canada traversing 14 landslides. The results indicate that the APFM provides estimations with the lowest magnitude error (15-19 mm/yr or 18.75-23.75% of in situ measurements) compared to the other approaches. SPFM and SPF-LSM are highly sensitive to LOS variance and tend to bias the interpreted vectors toward the north orientation. However, APFM and STFM reflect more realistic aspect angles, with the former inclined to steeper travel angles and the latter suffering from erratic upward travel angles due to local topographies.

TI  - The Attachment Mapping Protocol (AMP): An Assessment and Treatment Tool for General Psychotherapy, Systemic Family Therapy and Multifaith Spiritual Care
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper introduces the Attachment Mapping Protocol (AMP), which is an assessment and treatment tool for use in individual psychotherapy, systemic family therapy and multifaith spiritual care, using a bio-psycho-social-spiritual model of care. Attachment theory has a long and significant history in psychology, with an evolving relationship within the above clinical domains. A central aim of this paper will be to recognize and affirm the extension of attachment theory beyond the traditional parameters of nascent parental, guardianship bonds and individual, developmental psychology, to reveal a much broader spectrum of valid attachment considerations for mental health and spiritual well-being. A case study will be applied to the interviewing instrument to demonstrate its utility for broadening assessment beyond attachment figures to include surrogate attachments of other persons, places and things. A model of spiritual discernment derived from the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola will undergird this larger worldview of attachment considerations.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node detection in thyroid carcinoma using [68Ga]Ga-tilmanocept PET/CT: a proof-of-concept study.
T2  - European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is rarely used for thyroid carcinoma staging. This is due to challenges associated with conventionalTc-99m-labeled tracers, often producing a large hotspot at the injection site, potentially hiding nearby SLNs (shine-through effect). The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of SLN visualization using the new PET tracer [68Ga]Ga-tilmanocept.METHODS: Patients with thyroid carcinoma underwent ultrasound-guided peritumoral injection of [68Ga]Ga-tilmanocept and ICG-[99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid. [68Ga]Ga-tilmanocept PET/CT scans were conducted at 15min and 60min post-injection to visualize the SLNs. SLN biopsy was performed using ICG-[99mTc]TC-nanocolloid for intraoperative identification. The corresponding lymph node level was resected for reference.RESULTS: Seven differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and 3 medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) patients were included, of which 6 were clinically node-negative. The median number of SLNs detected on [68Ga]Ga-tilmanocept PET/CT and resected was 3 (range 1-4) and 3 (range 1-5), respectively. Eight SLNs were found on PET/CT in the central compartment and 19 in the lateral compartment. The SLN procedure detected (micro)metastases in all patients except one. Seventeen of 27 pathologically assessed SLNs were positive, 8 negative, and 2 did not contain lymph node tissue, which led to upstaging in 5 out of 6 clinically node-negative patients.CONCLUSIONS: [68Ga]Ga-tilmanocept PET/CT identified SLNs in all patients, mainly in the lateral neck. The SLNs were successfully surgically detected and resected using ICG-[99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid. This technique has the potential to improve neck staging, enabling more personalized treatment of thyroid cancer according to the lymph node status.TRIAL REGISTRATION: 2021-002470-42 (EudraCT).

TI  - The potential for bluetongue virus serotype 16 to cause disease in sheep in New South Wales, Australia
T2  - AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Bluetongue virus serotype 16 detection in NSW In coastal New South Wales (NSW), bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes 1 and 21 are endemic and transmitted in most years without evidence of disease. However, serotype 16 (BTV-16) infection was detected for the first time in NSW in November 2016 in cattle undergoing testing for export. Retrospective testing of blood samples collected from sentinel cattle as part of the National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP) established that the first detected transmission of BTV-16 in NSW occurred in April 2016 in sentinel cattle on the NSW North Coast. Subsequently, until 2022, BTV-16 has been transmitted in most years and was the predominant serotype in the 2018-2019 transmission season. The data available suggests that BTV-16 may have become endemic in NSW. Experimental studies During experimental infection studies with BTV-16, all sheep were febrile, with the peak of viremia occurring 6-10 days after inoculation. There was nasal and oral hyperaemia in most sheep with several animals developing a nasal discharge and nasal oedema. All sheep developed coronitis of varying severity, with most also developing haemorrhages along the coronary band. There was a high incidence of haemorrhage in the pulmonary artery, epicardial petechiae, extensive pericardial haemorrhages and moderate body cavity effusions including pericardial effusions. Conclusion Overall, experimental pathogenicity findings suggest moderate disease may occur in sheep in the field. These findings, when combined with climatic variability that could result in an expansion of the range of Culicoides brevitarsis into major sheep-producing areas of the state, suggest that there is an increasing risk of bluetongue disease in NSW.

TI  - Bluetongue disease in sheep in New South Wales - April 2023
T2  - AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In 2016, bluetongue virus (BTV), serotype 16 (BTV-16), was detected in New South Wales (NSW) in sentinel cattle for the first time. Over the next 6 years, BTV-16 has been detected regularly and over an increasing area of the BTV zone in NSW. In April 2023, disease was reported in sheep on two farms on the Northern Tablelands of NSW. The consistent clinical signs included reduced exercise tolerance, facial swelling, serous nasal discharges with encrustation of the nasal plane, subcutaneous oedema of the neck and brisket and variable congestion of the coronary band. Affected sheep were mainly mature ewes and rams, with an estimated morbidity of 20% over a period of 6-8 weeks. Although there were several unexpected deaths, no veterinary examination was sought. Predominantly BTV-16 RNA was detected in sick sheep, with an incidence of infection of approximately 40% in a cross section of one flock. These events represent the first confirmation of disease due to bluetongue virus in NSW. As these cases occurred in a region with a high density of sheep, if there is ongoing transmission of BTV-16 during subsequent summers, further disease might be expected.

TI  - Adolescents with substance use referred to child protective services: Does substance use treatment prevent foster care entry?
T2  - CHILD & FAMILY SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Adolescent substance use has been linked to several negative outcomes, which can be exacerbated by exposure to adversity such as child maltreatment. However, few studies have examined the intersection of adolescent substance use and child protective service (CPS) involvement. This study examined the relationship between substance use treatment and entries into foster care among adolescents referred to CPS for maltreatment. Data for this study came from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS), an annually reported database that contains information on all CPS reports screened for investigation. NCANDS was merged with county-level data from the American Community Survey to explore the relationship between treatment and foster care entry while adjusting for contextual factors. Our sample included 2326 adolescents who were referred to CPS in fiscal year (FY) 2018 and were followed until FY 2019 to examine correlates of foster care entry. A series of multilevel logistic regressions were conducted. Approximately 1 in 20 adolescents entered foster care during the study period and 1 in 10 used treatment services prior to foster care entry. Substance use treatment increased the odds of foster care entry (adjusted odds ratios = 2.30, p < 0.05), while adolescents residing in counties with higher percentages of non-Hispanic White residents had lower odds of foster care entry (adjusted odds ratios = 0.67, p < 0.05). Among adolescents with substance use referred to CPS, substance use treatment increases the likelihood of foster care entry. This may highlight the need to provide services earlier and to ensure that adolescents can access treatment without entering state custody. Future research should explore these relationships in more depth.

TI  - Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant protein RBD fusion heterodimer vaccine against SARS-CoV-2
T2  - NPJ VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to COVID-19 pandemic, we have launched a vaccine development program against SARS-CoV-2. Here we report the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant protein RBD fusion heterodimeric vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (PHH-1V) evaluated in a phase 1-2a dose-escalation, randomized clinical trial conducted in Catalonia, Spain. 30 young healthy adults were enrolled and received two intramuscular doses, 21 days apart of PHH-1V vaccine formulations [10 mu g (n = 5), 20 mu g (n = 10), 40 mu g (n = 10)] or control [BNT162b2 (n = 5)]. Each PHH-1V group had one safety sentinel and the remaining participants were randomly assigned. The primary endpoint was solicited events within 7 days and unsolicited events within 28 days after each vaccination. Secondary endpoints were humoral and cellular immunogenicity against the variants of concern (VOCs) alpha, beta, delta and gamma. All formulations were safe and well tolerated, with tenderness and pain at the site of injection being the most frequently reported solicited events. Throughout the study, all participants reported having at least one mild to moderate unsolicited event. Two unrelated severe adverse events (AE) were reported and fully resolved. No AE of special interest was reported. Fourteen days after the second vaccine dose, all participants had a >4-fold change in total binding antibodies from baseline. PHH-1V induced robust humoral responses with neutralizing activities against all VOCs assessed (geometric mean fold rise at 35 days p < 0.0001). The specific T-cell response assessed by ELISpot was moderate. This initial evaluation has contributed significantly to the further development of PHH-1V, which is now included in the European vaccine portfolio.

TI  - Assessing the effects of drought on rainfed maize water footprints based on remote sensing approaches
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BACKGROUNDDrought affects the characteristics of water use during crop production and so quantitatively evaluating the impacts is important. However, it remains unclear how crop water use responds to drought. To address this gap, water footprint (WF) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) were calculated by remote sensing approaches to assess the effects of drought on crop water use. Rainfed maize is the most important crop in Jilin Province, and its growth and water use are more susceptible to drought. The present study explored not only the impact of growing season drought on the maize WF values in Jilin Province, but also the response of WF values to drought at different time scales.RESULTSSpatially, 72.94% of the WFblue pixels showed a non-significant increase, and the WFgreen in 68% pixels decreased significantly, being mainly concentrated in the middle region. Furthermore, the pixels affected by monthly time scale drought were mainly in the middle region, whereas the pixels affected by annual time scale drought were mainly in the western region.CONCLUSIONDrought not only affected on the source and structure of agricultural water consumption, but also had different effects on WF values at different time scale. These effects had obvious spatial differences. The present study systematically explored the effects of drought on the WF values for rainfed maize in different climate regions and a consideration of these effects could provide valuable information on rainfed maize growth and the agricultural water use response to a changing climate. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - Mapping the distribution and temporal trends of dust storm sources in the Middle East using satellite data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Over recent decades, dust storms have had a severe impact on the Middle East at the local and regional scales. Remote sensing is a feasible method for exploring dust storm sources, and this study utilized SeaWiFS satellite data and GIS modeling to investigate the issue in the region. Aerosol optical depth was used as an indicator to detect dust events and identify sources. The results revealed an increase in dust sources in some areas of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Oman in recent years, while the situation remained stable in eastern neighbors. Four main areas were identified as high-intensity dust producers: the northern part of Iraq near Mosul and Baghdad, the common border of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq, the southeast of Saudi Arabia and the western border of the UAE, and the middle of Oman. To validate the results, the study used 35 AERONET ground stations, including 608 comparative data. The achieved results showed a correlation coefficient of 0.75 and RMSE error of 8.6% between the AERONET stations and the findings of the study. These results provide valuable insights into dust storm sources and trends in the Middle East, which can inform efforts to mitigate their impact on the region.

TI  - Aerosol-CCN characteristics and dynamics associated with a pre-monsoon dust storm over a high-altitude site in Western Ghats, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Aerosol-CCN characteristics and dynamics during a pre-monsoon dust storm (April 6-11, 2015) over a high-altitude site ((17.92 degrees N, 73.66 degrees E, and 1348 m above mean sea level (MSL)) in Western Ghats, India, has been studied using ground-based observations, satellite, and reanalysis datasets. Spatial distribution of dust surface mass concentration along with the back trajectory analysis showed the Arabian Desert area (Rub-Al-khali desert) as the source region and strong westerly winds transported the dust particles toward the Indian subcontinent. High values noticed in the surface PM10 (PM2.5), i.e., similar to 450 (similar to 130) mu g m(-3), MODIS AOD(550nm) (0.6), and MERRA 2 dust surface mass concentration (5 x 10(-7) kg m(-3)) along MODIS true color images confirmed the dust storm event on April 6, 2015 over the observational site. Size-segregated aerosol number concentration measured from ground-based observations showed the dominance of Aitken, accumulation, and coarse mode particles during dust period. CCN concentrations at 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9% SS were analyzed. A low value of CCN concentration and activation fraction (similar to 0.3) near surface was noticed during dust storm day, suggesting insoluble mineral dust particle being transported. Analyzed vertical velocity during pre-dust period showed downdraft between 900 and 750 hPa, suggesting dust transport from upper altitudes toward the observational site. WRF-Chem model simulation also captured the dust storm event, and the results are in good agreement with the observation with a significance of 95% confidence level.

TI  - LAI estimation based on physical model combining airborne LiDAR waveform and Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important biophysical parameter of vegetation and serves as a significant indicator for assessing forest ecosystems. Multi-source remote sensing data enables large-scale and dynamic surface observations, providing effective data for quantifying various indices in forest and evaluating ecosystem changes. However, employing single-source remote sensing spectral or LiDAR waveform data poses limitations for LAI inversion, making the integration of multi-source remote sensing data a trend. Currently, the fusion of active and passive remote sensing data for LAI inversion primarily relies on empirical models, which are mainly constructed based on field measurements and do not provide a good explanation of the fusion mechanism. In this study, we aimed to estimate LAI based on physical model using both spectral imagery and LiDAR waveform, exploring whether data fusion improved the accuracy of LAI inversion. Specifically, based on the physical model geometric-optical and radiative transfer (GORT), a fusion strategy was designed for LAI inversion. To ensure inversion accuracy, we enhanced the data processing by introducing a constraint-based EM waveform decomposition method. Considering the spatial heterogeneity of canopy/ground reflectivity ratio in regional forests, calculation strategy was proposed to improve this parameter in inversion model. The results showed that the constraint-based EM waveform decomposition method improved the decomposition accuracy with an average 12% reduction in RMSE, yielding more accurate waveform energy parameters. The proposed calculation strategy for the canopy/ground reflectivity ratio, considering dynamic variation of parameter, effectively enhanced previous research that relied on a fixed value, thereby improving the inversion accuracy that increasing on the correlation by 5% to 10% and on R-2 by 62.5% to 132.1%. Based on the inversion strategy we proposed, data fusion could effectively be used for LAI inversion. The inversion accuracy achieved using both spectral and LiDAR data (correlation=0.81, R-2 = 0.65, RMSE=1.01) surpassed that of using spectral data or LiDAR alone. This study provides a new inversion strategy for large-scale and high-precision LAI inversion, supporting the field of LAI research.

AB  - Nitrate (NO3-) is the primary source of nitrogen preferred by most arable crops, including wheat. The pioneering experiment on primary nitrate response (PNR) was carried out three decades ago. Since then, much research has been carried out to understand the NO3- signaling. Nitrate is sensed by the dual affinity NO3- transceptor NPF6.3, which further relays the information to a master regulator NIN-like protein 7 (NLP7) through calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPK10, CPK30, CPK32), highlighting the importance of calcium ion (Ca2+) as one of the important secondary messengers in relaying the NO3- signaling in Arabidopsis. In a previous study, we found that Ca2+ regulates nitrogen starvation response in wheat. In this study, 10 days old NO3--starved wheat seedlings were exposed to various treatments. Our study on time course changes in expression of PNR sentinel genes; NPF6.1, NPF6.2, NRT2.1, NRT2.3, NR, and NIR in wheat manifest the highest level of expression at 30 min after NO3- exposure. The use of Ca2+ chelator EGTA confirmed the involvement of Ca2+ in the regulation of transcription of NPFs and NRTs as well the NO3- uptake. We also observed the NO3- dose-dependent and tissue-specific regulation of nitrate reductase activity involving Ca2+ as a mediator. The participation of Ca2+ in the PNR and NO3- signaling in wheat is confirmed by pharmacological analysis, physiological evidences, and protoplast-based Ca2+ localization.

TI  - Profiling consumers who reported mass marketing scams: demographic characteristics and emotional sentiments associated with victimization
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - We examine the characteristics of consumers who reported scams to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. We assess how consumers vary demographically across six scam types, and how the overall emotional sentiment of a consumer's complaint (positive, negative, neutral/mixed) relates to reporting victimization versus attempted fraud (no losses). For romance, tech support, and prize, sweepstakes, and lottery scams, more older than young and middle-aged adults reported victimization. Across all scam types, consumers classified as Black, Hispanic, and Asian/Asian Pacific Islander were more likely than non-Hispanic white consumers to report victimization than attempted fraud. Relative to complaints categorized as emotionally neutral or mixed, we find that emotionally positive complaints and emotionally negative complaints were significantly associated with victimization, but that these relationships differed by scam type. This study helps identify which consumer groups are affected by specific scams and the association between emotion and victimization.

TI  - Spatial Aggregation of Satellite Observations Leads to an Overestimation of the Radiative Forcing Due To Aerosol-Cloud Interactions
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of cloud radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions, RFaci (also known as the first indirect effect), relies on approximating the cloud albedo susceptibility to changes in droplet concentration, & beta;. & beta; depends on the cloud albedo and droplet concentration, both of which can be observed by satellites. Satellite observations are often spatially aggregated to coarser resolutions, typically 1 x 1 & DEG; scenes. However, on such spatial scales, the cloud albedo tends to be heterogeneous, whereas the & beta; approximation assumes homogeneity. Here, we demonstrate that the common practice of aggregating satellite data and neglecting cloud albedo heterogeneity results in an average overestimation of 10% in previous estimates of the RFaci. Additionally, we establish a relationship between the magnitude of the bias in & beta; and Stratocumulus morphologies, providing a physical context for cloud heterogeneity and the associated bias. Lastly, we propose a correction method that can be applied to cloud albedo gridded data.This paper explores the effect of cloud albedo morphology, which is a reflection of cloud heterogeneity, on radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions (RFaci). The RFaci is estimated from satellite observations based on the assumption that clouds are homogeneous within a given scene. However, when satellite data is spatially aggregated to reduce the amount of data to a user-friendly gridded format-a common practice-this assumption is no longer valid. Consequently, an overestimation of the RFaci occurs, particularly in heterogeneous scenes, where the overestimation can reach up to 50%. This means that the RFaci is lower than previously estimated. Our results also suggest that cloud albedo enhancement due to an increase in droplet concentrations would be most effective in homogeneous scenes. Therefore, marine cloud brightening strategies should take cloud albedo homogeneity into account to achieve the most effective albedo enhancement.The common practice of spatial aggregation of satellite data into 1 x 1 & DEG; scenes leads to an average 10% overestimation of the RFaciThe overestimation is due to neglecting cloud albedo heterogeneity, and is associated to different types of Stratocumulus morphologiesA correction is proposed, which calls for the incorporation of cloud reflectance statistics in Level 3 data

TI  - Assessment of aerosol optical and physical properties and implications for radiative effects over the semiarid region of Indo-Gangetic Basin
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study assesses the physical and optical properties and estimated the radiative forcing of aerosol at Agra over the Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) during July 2016-December 2019 using black carbon (BC) mass concentration (AE-33 aethalometer), data sets from satellite and model simulations. The optical properties of aerosol and radiative forcing have been measured by the Optical and Physical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (OPAC) and Santa Barbara Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model. The high BC mass concentration has been observed in November and lowest in August. An adverse meteorological condition due to a combination of temperature and low wind speed results in poor dispersion in the wintertime is a common factor for high concentration level pollutants over Agra. The diurnal and temporal cycle of BC mass concentration exhibits a high concentration at nighttime due to the lower atmospheric boundary layer. The seasonal variation of absorption coefficient (& beta;abs) and Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE) is found to be higher during post-monsoon and lowest in monsoon season. This suggests that black carbon concentration over Agra is mainly generated from crop burning, waste burning, automobile exhaust and long-range transport from Punjab and Haryana as the present site is downwind. OPAC-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD), single-scattering albedo (SSA), Angstrom Exponent (AE) and asymmetry parameter (AsyP) were estimated to be 0.57 & PLUSMN; 0.07, 0.78 & PLUSMN; 0.16, 0.99 & PLUSMN; 0.21 and 0.81 & PLUSMN; 0.15, respectively. AOD and AE from the OPAC and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) have shown the consistent relationship. The mean radiative forcing is 18.3 & PLUSMN; 2.1 W m-2 at the top of the atmosphere while, at the surface, net radiative forcing is -42.4 & PLUSMN; 7.2 and 59.1 & PLUSMN; 6.5 W m-2 at the atmosphere during the study period. Vertical profiles were estimated using the observations from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite and the change in heating rate from the SBDART model over Agra.First-time short-lived climate forcer black carbon mass concentration along with optical properties of aerosols has been reported, and quantification of radiative forcing has been done at the Agra region.The radiative forcing due to black carbon has been found to be high highlighting the heat risk over this region.image

TI  - A retrieval model of surface geochemistry composition based on remotely sensed data
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The geochemical sampling work in the difficult and dangerous areas is very hard; hence, it can be greatly improved by combining with the remotely sensed data. Thus, a retrieval model is proposed by Kernel Principal Component Analysis and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) models based on Landsat 8 remotely sensed data and the geochemical data in the study area. The analysis results show that the geochemical data delineate the areas with relatively enriched elements, but indicate the low-abnormal ore (chemical) points, and the anomalies delineated by the inversion data are better for this purpose, for better indication. At the same time, the distribution and intensity of the corresponding abnormal areas found that the abnormal areas delineated by the inversion data basically contain the abnormal areas delineated by the original data, and the anomalies located at the ore spots are obviously enhanced; it shows that the SVM model of ABC Optimization can establish the relation between geochemistry data and remote sensing data, can supply the original data effectively, and can also provide the direction for the next prospecting work.

TI  - Cryoablation Allows the Ultimate De-escalation of Surgical Therapy for Select Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundWidespread use of screening mammography has allowed breast cancer to be detected at earlier stages. This allows for increased customization of treatment and less aggressive management. De-escalation of therapy plays an important role in decreasing treatment burden and improving patient quality of life. This report examines cryoablation as the next step in the surgical de-escalation of breast cancer.MethodsWomen with a diagnosis of clinically node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive (ER +), progesterone receptor-positive (PR +), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2 -) infiltrating ductal carcinomas 1.5 cm or smaller underwent ultrasound-guided cryoablation. Either the Visica 2 treatment system (before 2020) or the ProSense treatment system (since 2020) was used to perform the cryoablation. Patients received mammograms and ultrasounds at a 6 months follow-up visit, and magnetic resonance images at baseline, then at 1 year follow-up intervals. Adjuvant therapy decisions and disease status were recorded.ResultsThis study enrolled 32 patients who underwent 33 cryoablation procedures (1 patient had bilateral cancer). One patient had a sentinel node biopsy in addition to clinical staging of the axilla. For all the patients, adjuvant endocrine therapy was recommended, and six patients (18.75%) received adjuvant radiation. Of the 32 patients, 20 (60.6%) have been followed up for 2 years or longer, with no residual or recurrent disease at the site of ablation.ConclusionCryoablation of the primary tumor foregoing sentinel node biopsy offers an oncologically safe and feasible minimally invasive office-based procedure option in lieu of surgery for patients with early-stage, low-risk breast cancer.

TI  - A high-resolution canopy height model of the Earth
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The worldwide variation in vegetation height is fundamental to the global carbon cycle and central to the functioning of ecosystems and their biodiversity. Geospatially explicit and, ideally, highly resolved information is required to manage terrestrial ecosystems, mitigate climate change and prevent biodiversity loss. Here we present a comprehensive global canopy height map at 10 m ground sampling distance for the year 2020. We have developed a probabilistic deep learning model that fuses sparse height data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) space-borne LiDAR mission with dense optical satellite images from Sentinel-2. This model retrieves canopy-top height from Sentinel-2 images anywhere on Earth and quantifies the uncertainty in these estimates. Our approach improves the retrieval of tall canopies with typically high carbon stocks. According to our map, only 5% of the global landmass is covered by trees taller than 30 m. Further, we find that only 34% of these tall canopies are located within protected areas. Thus, the approach can serve ongoing efforts in forest conservation and has the potential to foster advances in climate, carbon and biodiversity modelling.Using a deep learning approach, the authors outline a global canopy height map at 10-m resolution combining publicly available optical satellite images and space-borne LiDAR and show that only 5% of the global landmass is covered by trees taller than 30 m.

TI  - Vulnerability and risk assessment mapping of Bhitarkanika national park, Odisha, India using machine-based embedded decision support system
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The vulnerability and flood risk assessment of Bhitarkanika National Park in Odisha, India, was conducted using a data-driven approach and a machine-based embedded decision support system. The park, located in the estuaries of the Brahmani, Baitarani, Dharma, and Mahanadi river systems, is home to India's second-largest mangrove environment and the world's most active and diverse saline wetland. To evaluate its vulnerability and risk, various threats were considered, with a focus on floods. Satellite imageries, such as Landsat 8 OLI, SRTM digital elevation model, open street map, Google pro image, reference map, field survey, and other ancillary data, were utilized to develop vulnerability and risk indicators. These indicators were then reclassified into 'Cost' and 'Benefit' categories for better understanding. The factors were standardized using the max-min standardization method before being fed into the vulnerability and risk model. Initially, an analytical hierarchy approach was used to develop the model, which was later compared with machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM) and uncertainty analysis indices (e.g., overall accuracy, kappa, map quality, etc.). The results showed that the SVM-RBF machine learning algorithm outperformed the traditional geostatistical model (AHP), with an overall accuracy of 99.54% for flood risk mapping compared to AHP's 91.12%. The final output reveals that a large area of Bhitarkanika National park falls under high flood risk zone. The Eastern coastal regions of Govindapur, Kanhupur, Chinchri, Gobardhanpur and Barunei fall under high risk zone of tidal floods, The Northern and western regions of Ramachandrapur, Jaganathpur, Kamalpur, Subarnapur, Paramanandapur, etc., Fall under high risk region of riverine floods. The study also revealed that the areas covered with mangroves have a higher elevation and hence are repellent to any kind of flood. In the event of a flood high priority conservation measures should be taken along all high flood risk areas. This study is helpful for decision-making and carrying out programs for the conservation of natural resources and flood management in the national park and reserve forest for ecological sustainability to support sustainable development goals (e.g., SDGs-14, 15).

T2  - NATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Monitoring environmental DNA can track the presence of organisms, from viruses to animals, but requires continuous sampling of transient sequences from a complex milieu. Here we designed living sentinels using Bacillus subtilis to report the uptake of a DNA sequence after matching it to a preencoded target. Overexpression of ComK increased DNA uptake 3,000-fold, allowing for femtomolar detection in samples dominated by background DNA. This capability was demonstrated using human sequences containing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with facial features. Sequences were recorded with high efficiency and were protected from nucleases for weeks. The SNP could be determined by sequencing or in vivo using CRISPR interference to turn on reporter expression in response to a specific base. Multiple SNPs were recorded by one cell or through a consortium in which each member recorded a different sequence. Sentinel cells could surveil for specific sequences over long periods of time for applications spanning forensics, ecology and epidemiology.Nou et al. engineered Bacillus subtilis cells into a living sentinel system, which can take up environmental DNA and fluoresce when a matching sequence is detected. This system enables recording of SNPs for facial features and has broad applications spanning forensics to agriculture.

TI  - Has there been an increase in nitrous oxide use and associated harms in Australia? An analysis of triangulated data sources, 2003-2020.
T2  - The International journal on drug policy
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing concern, globally, regarding use of nitrous oxide (N2O) for intoxication purposes. This paper aims to examine trends in: (i) past six month N2O use among a sample of people who use regularly use ecstasy and/or other illicit stimulants (2003-2020); (ii) volume of N2O-related Google searches and social media posts (2009-2020); and (iii) N2O-related calls to Poisons Information Centres (PIC) (2004-2020).METHODS: Data were obtained from annual interviews with sentinel samples of Australians aged ≥16 years who used ecstasy and/or other illicit stimulants ≥monthly and resided in a capital city (800 each year); Google search activity; social media posts; and exposure calls to four PIC.RESULTS: Among samples of people who regularly use ecstasy and/or other illicit stimulants, past six-month N2O use increased 10% each year from 2009 to 2020, with the sharpest increase observed between 2015 and 2018 (25.4% p/year; 95% CI: 14.6-37.1). Frequency and quantity of N2O use remained stable and low. Google search probabilities increased by 1.8% each month from January 2009 and December 2019 (95% CI: 1.5-2.2), with the sharpest increase observed between July 2016 to December 2017 (6.0% p/month; 95% CI: 4.4-7.5). Social media posts increased 2.0% per month from January 2009 and December 2019 (95% CI: 1.1-3.0), with the sharpest increase observed between March and October 2017 (19.2% p/month; 95% CI: 1.7-39.7). The number of N2O-related calls to Australian PIC increased sixfold between 2016 (16) and 2020 (111).CONCLUSIONS: Triangulation of various data sources indicate significant shifts in N2O use and harms in Australia. This includes increases in use, Google searches and social media posts, although these have plateaued in recent years, coupled with increased rates of harm. These findings correspond with evidence of a global increase in N2O use and harm, highlighting the need for education of both people who use N2O and health professionals.

TI  - Research on land cover classification of multi-source remote sensing data based on improved U-net network.
T2  - Scientific reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In recent years, remote sensing images of various types have found widespread applications in resource exploration, environmental protection, and land cover classification. However, relying solely on a single optical or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image as the data source for land cover classification studies may not suffice to achieve the desired accuracy in ground information monitoring. One widely employed neural network for remote sensing image land cover classification is the U-Net network, which is a classical semantic segmentation network. Nonetheless, the U-Net network has limitations such as poor classification accuracy, misclassification and omission of small-area terrains, and a large number of network parameters. To address these challenges, this research paper proposes an improved approach that combines both optical and SAR images in bands for land cover classification and enhances the U-Net network. The approach incorporates several modifications to the network architecture. Firstly, the encoder-decoder framework serves as the backbone terrain-extraction network. Additionally, a convolutional block attention mechanism is introduced in the terrain extraction stage. Instead of pooling layers, convolutions with a step size of 2 are utilized, and the Leaky ReLU function is employed as the network's activation function. This design offers several advantages: it enhances the network's ability to capture terrain characteristics from both spatial and channel dimensions, resolves the loss of terrain map information while reducing network parameters, and ensures non-zero gradients during the training process. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through land cover classification experiments conducted on optical, SAR, and combined optical and SAR datasets. The results demonstrate that our method achieves classification accuracies of 0.8905, 0.8609, and 0.908 on the three datasets, respectively, with corresponding mIoU values of 0.8104, 0.7804, and 0.8667. Compared to the traditional U-Net network, our method exhibits improvements in both classification accuracy and mIoU to a certain extent.

TI  - Surface Subsidence Monitoring of Mining Areas in Hunan Province Based on Sentinel-1A and DS-InSAR.
T2  - Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Monitoring the surface subsidence in mining areas is conducive to the prevention and control of geological disasters, and the prediction and early warning of accidents. Hunan Province is located in South China. The mineral resource reserves are abundant; however, large and medium-sized mines account for a low proportion of the total, and the concentration of mineral resource distribution is low, meaning that traditional mining monitoring struggles to meet the needs of large-scale monitoring of mining areas in the province. The advantages of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology in large-scale deformation monitoring were applied to identify and monitor the surface subsidence of coal mining fields in Hunan Province based on a Sentinel-1A dataset of 86 images taken from 2018 to 2020, and the process of developing surface subsidence was inverted by selecting typical mining areas. The results show that there are 14 places of surface subsidence in the study area, and accidents have occurred in 2 mining areas. In addition, the railway passing through the mining area of Zhouyuan Mountain is affected by the surface subsidence, presenting a potential safety hazard.

M3  - Article
AB  - We used Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) float observation profiles and satellite data to investigate the physical-biogeochemical processes of a phytoplankton biomass rise in the Kuroshio region south of Japan during a period of two sequential tropical cyclones (TCs)-Hagibis and Neoguri-in October 2019. During TC Hagibis, prominent sea surface cooling and surface chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) increase occurred within a pre-existing cyclonic eddy (CE) south of Japan. Because of TC-induced mixing and upwelling, the maximum cooling happened at the depth of 57 m where water temperature dropped by 6 degrees C. The dramatic mixing and upwelling redistributed chlorophyll-a vertically (reducing subsurface Chl-a and increasing surface Chl-a) with little augment of depth-integrated Chl-a in the upper ocean above 160 m depth. Meanwhile, the mixing and upwelling transported nutrients from the subsurface to the surface layer. In the week after Hagibis, the depth-integrated Chl-a greatly increased. Subsequently, TC Neoguri obviously enhanced the augment of phytoplankton biomass although it was weaker than Hagibis. The upwelling induced by Hagibis increased nutrients in the water below 80 m, providing a very favorable condition for the subsequent TC Neoguri to further promote the growth of phytoplankton. The intense precipitation accompanying with Neoguri brought the coastal water with rich terrestrial material to offshore ocean, increasing nutrients and decreasing salinity in the subsurface layer. These both contributed to the marked increase in Chl-a during Neoguri. Our results demonstrated that the two sequential TCs worked together with a cyclonic eddy to cause a drastic and complex Chl-a enhancement event in the Kuroshio region south of Japan.

AB  - The Solar Physics Group at the INAF-Turin Astrophysical Observatory (OATo) is actually involved in different Space Weather (SW) projects and missions. In particular, this Group is currently providing for the ESA SWESNET portal two new data analysis tools aimed at (1) the automated identification of magnetic flux ropes from the in situ data (CME magnetic effectiveness tool) and (2) the automated identification and arrival prediction of CMEs from remote sensing and in situ data (CME propagation and forecast tool). The Group is also developing numerical tools for future applications of interest for SW under the project SWELTO-Space WEather Laboratory in Turin Observatory. Moreover, the Group is participating in two SW missions, and in particular in Helianthus (research and development project on solar photonic propulsion for early SW warnings) and Selene (Solar Exploration by Lunar Eclipsing with Nanosatellites Experiment). In addition to this, the Group is leading or is involved in other "SW enabling science" projects, and in particular the Metis coronagraph on-board ESA Solar Orbiter mission, the ASPIICS coronagraph on-board ESA PROBA-3 mission, and the CorMag coronagraph on-board HEMERA stratospheric balloon. In this framework, the OATo Solar Physics Group is working on fundamental research on "SW enabling science", dealing with the origin and acceleration of solar wind and Coronal Mass Ejections with remote-sensing data, and their interplanetary propagation and evolution with in situ data.

TI  - Dust in Western Iran: the emergence of new sources in response to shrinking water bodies.
T2  - Scientific reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We detected sources of dust in the Middle East that contribute to dust events in Western Iran in different seasons. By the analysis of the synoptic data, we identified 309 dusty days in Western Iran during the period 2000-2016. A dusty day is diagnosed if under low horizontal visibility (<1 km), the dust in suspension is reported at least once a day in at least three synoptic stations. We identified dust sources in the Middle East based on the analysis of the MOD04L2 data from MODIS, the backward HYSPLIT trajectory model, and synoptic conditions. The most influential sources affecting Western Iran are located on the shore and northwest of Lake Tharthar, Hour-al-Azim Marsh, the shore of Razzaza, Habbaniyah Lakes, and West Hammar Marsh, which contributed to 110, 79, 59, 56, and 51 dusty days, respectively. The fluctuation of the surface water area largely contributes to the variability of dusty days in Western Iran. Indeed, the peak dust activity in Western Iran was during the period 2008-2012 in response to the substantial shrinkage of the main water bodies in Iraq. The main sources of dust influencing Western Iran are located in northern and eastern Saudi Arabia in spring, Deir ez-Zur in Syria's Aleppo and Raqqa in summer, and Syria's Homs and Al-Hasakah in winter and spring. Sources of dust in Western Iraq and in most parts of entire Iraq have, respectively, led to the formation of summer and spring dust events in Western Iran. Decreased precipitation in the Middle East from autumn 2007 to 2012 and the occurrence of severe droughts have also contributed to the shrinkage of lakes and wetlands, as well as the reduced agricultural productivity in the Middle East, all of which contributed to the intensification of dust activity in Western Iran in recent decades.

TI  - Modelling change detection for unveiling urban transitions: using machine learning algorithms and Sentinel-2 data in Larache City, Morocco
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In achieving sustainable urban development, the intricate dynamics of spatio-temporal land use changes and their regional driving forces necessitate comprehensive investigation, particularly in developing countries. This study aims to analyze the detection of land use and land cover (LULC) changes, focusing on urban sprawl and future predictions. The performance of five supervised machine learning algorithms for LULC classification in Larache City, Morocco, during 2015-2021 is evaluated, addressing the research question of which algorithm best captures LULC changes accurately. Based on the theoretical foundation that accurate LULC mapping informs sustainable resource management, a theoretical framework rooted in remote sensing and machine learning principles is employed. The research methodology involves the analysis of archived Sentinel 2 imagery to detect LULC changes, incorporating change detection modelling and metrics such as overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. Results highlight the superiority of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, with an average overall accuracy of 93.67% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.93 across the study years. In contrast, the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm achieves a lower accuracy of 82.67% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.79. The implications are substantial. Accurate LULC classification is pivotal for effective urban planning and resource management, especially in developing countries. The accuracy of SVM underscores its potential as a robust tool for developing LULC maps, aiding decision-makers in land management strategies. This study contributes to understanding LULC dynamics, urban sprawl, and future projections, thereby providing essential data for informed urban development decisions and sustainable land use strategies. As cities in the developing world evolve, integrating precise LULC insights becomes paramount for achieving balanced urban growth and environmental conservation.

TI  - Topographic Correction of Optical Remote Sensing Images in Mountainous Areas
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Rugged terrain distorts optical remote sensing observations and subsequently impacts land cover classification and biophysical and biochemical parameter retrieval over mountainous areas. Therefore, topographic correction (TC) is a prerequisite for many remote sensing applications. Although various TC methods have been explored over the past four decades to mitigate topographic effects, a systematic and global review of these studies is still lacking. Using a multicomponent bibliometric approach, we extracted bibliometric metadata from 426 publications identified by searching titles, keywords, and abstracts for research on "topographic correction" and "topographic effects" in Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) from 1980 to 2022. This systematic review revealed a rapid growth in the number of TC studies since the 1980s, primarily driven by the availability of decametric-resolution remote sensing observations and digital elevation models (DEMs). Most of the research has focused on relatively low-elevation regions, with increasing attention beyond American and European regions, particularly in China. The seasonal distribution of satellite acquisition for TC showed considerable imbalance, mainly concentrated in months with favorable solar illumination conditions (e.g., May to October). Important themes emerged from the keyword analysis, including satellite sensors, DEMs, TC methods, evaluation criteria, and applications.

TI  - Assessing Methods for Replacement of Soiled Bedding Sentinels in Cage-level Exhaust IVC Racks.
T2  - Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science : JAALAS
M3  - Journal Article
AB  -             Soiled bedding sentinel programs have long been the cornerstone of rodent health monitoring surveillance. Many recentstudies have evaluated methods to replace live animals in these programs; however, the type of ventilated rack being usedgreatly influences the detection rate of adventitious pathogens. This study evaluated 4 alternative sampling techniquesacross 5 distinct vivaria and assessed their accuracy in detecting 5 pathogens. Testing was done in an operational (real-world)setting using IVC racks that vent air at the cage level. The 5 agents surveyed were mouse norovirus, Helicobacter spp.,Rodentibacter spp. Entamoeba muris, and Spironucleus muris. Samples were collected for subsequent PCR assays asfollows: 1) cages with live sentinels exposed to soiled bedding; ; 2) filter paper placed on the lid of an unoccupied cage containingsoiled bedding; 3) filter paper placed in the bedding of an unoccupied cage that contained soiled bedding; 4) swabsfrom an unoccupied sentinel cage that contained soiled bedding; and 5) pooled swabs from colony cages admixed withswabs from soiled bedding sentinel mice. Cumulative accuracy for all pathogens of interest was highest with the existingsoiled bedding sentinel program, followed by pooled swabs of colony cages mixed with swabs from occupied soiled beddingsentinel cages. Soiled bedding sentinel cages detected mouse norovirus, Helicobacter spp., and S. muris with the highest accuracy;the pooled swabs were best in detecting Rodentibacter spp. and E. muris. The findings suggest that with the type ofrack and caging used in our facilities, the soiled bedding sentinel method has highest concurrence with the expected healthstatus of an animal room, and the results this method can be enhanced with the addition of pooled swabs of colony animals.

TI  - Pathway to Independence Awards (K99/R00): Funding Dynamics and Prediction of Future National Institutes of Health Research Project Funding.
T2  - Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: The authors use the National Institutes of Health (NIH) RePORTER (Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools) to evaluate funding trends and historic NIH investment increase in the K99 award pathway and examine whether R00 to R01 or R21 achievement time correlates with the future success of an early-stage NIH-funded investigator.METHOD: All K99 awards and funding data in this study were limited to all clinical departments. The authors identified all researchers and awards through a K99 search from fiscal years (FYs) 2007 to 2022 across all clinical departments and investigated trends in K99 awards and funding from NIH FYs 2007 to 2022. They generated an R00 data set and analyzed the K99 to R00 achievement statistics from FYs 2007 to 2022. The authors aggregated NIH annual data files for FYs 2007 to 2021 to generate a master data file of all R01 and R21 awards. They linked R01 and R21 award data to the researcher previously identified through the K99 search and focused on the connection between K99/R00 awardees and subsequent R01 or R21 awards.RESULTS: From FY 2008 to FY 2022, the NIH K99 budget increased 127.0%, whereas the NIH program-level budget increased 17.3%. A principal investigator's mean funding per year significantly decreased as time from R00 to R01 or R21 increased (P < .001); 7 of 15 comparisons differed significantly (2 at P < .01 and 5 at P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: NIH investment in the K99 award pathway has substantially outpaced the NIH program-level budget increase, and there is a strong association between mean funding per year since the start of the R00 phase and time from R00 to R01 or R21. This analysis may be useful to clinical departments as they evaluate selecting new and retaining current biomedical scientists for independent research positions.

TI  - The Therapy of Vulvar Carcinoma-Evaluation of Surgical Options in a Retrospective Monocentric Study.
T2  - Life (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - (1) Background: Surgical-oncological treatment methods are continuously put to the test in times of evidence-based medicine-notably, a constant reevaluation remains key, especially for tumor entities with increasing incidence such as vulvar carcinoma. (2) Methods: In order to determine the postoperative clinical course of different methods of vulvar excision (vulvectomy, hemivulvectomy) as well as inguinal lymph node removal (lymphadenectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy) with regard to postoperative wound-healingprocess, perioperative hemorrhage, and re-resection rates, we retrospectively analyzed surgical, morphological and laboratory data of 76 patients with a pathological diagnosed vulvar cancer. (3) Results: Analysis of our data from a single center revealed a comparable perioperative clinical course regardless of the chosen method of vulvar excision and inguinal lymph node removal. (4) Conclusions: Thus, our results emphasize the current multimodality in surgical therapy of vulvar carcinoma, in which consideration of known prognostic factors together with the individual patient's clinical situation allow guideline-based therapy aimed at maximizing surgical safety.

TI  - Lymph node metastasis in cancer progression: molecular mechanisms, clinical significance and therapeutic interventions
T2  - SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION AND TARGETED THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph nodes (LNs) are important hubs for metastatic cell arrest and growth, immune modulation, and secondary dissemination to distant sites through a series of mechanisms, and it has been proved that lymph node metastasis (LNM) is an essential prognostic indicator in many different types of cancer. Therefore, it is important for oncologists to understand the mechanisms of tumor cells to metastasize to LNs, as well as how LNM affects the prognosis and therapy of patients with cancer in order to provide patients with accurate disease assessment and effective treatment strategies. In recent years, with the updates in both basic and clinical studies on LNM and the application of advanced medical technologies, much progress has been made in the understanding of the mechanisms of LNM and the strategies for diagnosis and treatment of LNM. In this review, current knowledge of the anatomical and physiological characteristics of LNs, as well as the molecular mechanisms of LNM, are described. The clinical significance of LNM in different anatomical sites is summarized, including the roles of LNM playing in staging, prognostic prediction, and treatment selection for patients with various types of cancers. And the novel exploration and academic disputes of strategies for recognition, diagnosis, and therapeutic interventions of metastatic LNs are also discussed.

TI  - Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions during COVID-19 on future influenza trends in Mainland China.
T2  - BMC infectious diseases
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Influenza is a common illness for its high rates of morbidity and transmission. The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the COVID-19 pandemic to manage its dissemination could affect the transmission of influenza.METHODS: A retrospective analysis, between 2018 and 2023, was conducted to examine the incidence of influenza virus types A and B among patients in sentinel cities located in North or South China as well as in Wuhan City. For validations, data on the total count of influenza patients from 2018 to 2023 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, which is not included in the sentinel hospital network. Time series methods were utilized to examine seasonal patterns and to forecast future influenza trends.RESULTS: Northern and southern cities in China had earlier outbreaks during the NPIs period by about 8 weeks compared to the 2018-2019. The implementation of NPIs significantly reduced the influenza-like illness (ILI) rate and infection durations. Influenza B Victoria and H3N2 were the first circulating strains detected after the relaxation of NPIs, followed by H1N1 across mainland China. The SARIMA model predicted synchronized H1N1 outbreak cycles in North and South China, with H3N2 expected to occur in the summer in southern cities and in the winter in northern cities over the next 3 years. The ILI burden is expected to rise in both North and South China over the next 3 years, with higher ILI% levels in southern cities throughout the year, especially in winter, and in northern cities mainly during winter. In Wuhan City and the Central Hospital of Wuhan, influenza levels are projected to peak in the winter of 2024, with 2 smaller peaks expected during the summer of 2023.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we report the impact of NPIs on future influenza trends in mainland China. We recommend that local governments encourage vaccination during the transition period between summer and winter to mitigate economic losses and mortality associated with influenza.

TI  - Upper Limb Morbidity in Newly Diagnosed Individuals After Unilateral Surgery for Breast Cancer: Baseline Results from the AMBER Cohort Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeWe aimed to examine potential associations between post-surgical upper limb morbidity and demographic, medical, surgical, and health-related fitness variables in newly diagnosed individuals with breast cancer.MethodsParticipants were recruited between 2012 and 2019. Objective measures of health-related fitness, body composition, shoulder range of motion, axillary web syndrome, and lymphedema were performed within 3 months of breast cancer surgery, and prior to or at the start of adjuvant cancer treatment.ResultsUpper limb morbidity was identified in 54% of participants and was associated with poorer upper limb function and higher pain. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified mastectomy versus breast-conserving surgery (odds ratio [OR] 3.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.65-4.65), axillary lymph node dissection versus sentinel lymph node dissection (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.73-4.10), earlier versus later time from surgery (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.15-2.18), and younger versus older age (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.03) as significantly associated with a higher odds of upper limb morbidity, while mastectomy (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.10-2.25), axillary lymph node dissection (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.34-3.60), lower muscular endurance (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.16) and higher percentage body fat (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.07) were significantly associated with higher odds of moderate or greater morbidity severity.ConclusionsUpper limb morbidity is common in individuals after breast cancer surgery prior to adjuvant cancer treatment. Health-related fitness variables were associated with severity of upper limb morbidity. Findings may facilitate prospective surveillance of individuals at higher risk of developing upper limb morbidity.

TI  - Selective Electrocatalytic Reduction of NO to NH<sub>3</sub> by Iron Porphyrins at Physiologically Relevant Potentials
T2  - ACS CATALYSIS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO), a toxic gas, is a key intermediate in the global nitrogen cycle that may be reduced to produce NH3. However, there are few molecular catalysts which can catalyze this transformation. The heme nitrosyls, which are NO adducts of ferric or ferrous heme, are intermediates in denitrification, dissimilatory nitrite reduction, and assimilatory ammonification which are abundant in nature, and they need to have diverse reactivity. A particularly curious case of such divergent reactivity is presented by the ferrous nitrosyl ({FeNO}(7)) species in heme c containing cytochrome c nitrite reductase (CcNiR) and siroheme containing CSNiR, both of which catalyze the 6e(-)/8H(+) reduction of NO2 (-) to NH4 (+). In CcNiR the {FeNO}(7) species is generally considered to be a kinetically inert thermodynamic sink. CSNiR, on the other hand, comfortably uses this {FeNO}(7) species as an intermediate in the 6e(-)/8H(+) reduction of NO2 (-) to NH4 (+). A clear demarcation between the heme cofactors heme c and siroheme in CcNiR and CSNiR is the presence of four -CH2-COOH substituents in the latter. Past efforts to reduce NO to NH4 (+) using iron porphyrins required very high cathodic potentials (-1 V vs NHE) and were mostly not selective and produced N2O and NH2OH as major products. In this work, iron porphyrins with different numbers of electron-withdrawing -COOEt groups are used to understand any role that the inductive effect of substituents on the porphyrin ring may play in the reduction of NO. The crystallographic structure of the ferrous heme nitrosyl {FeNO}(7) species is found to be not very sensitive to the number of -COOEt substituents. However, the potential for electrochemical NO reduction in these porphyrins is shifted by 500 mV and 700 mV more positive relative to iron porphyrins without -COOEt groups when two and four -COOEt groups are introduced, respectively, raising it into the physiologically relevant potential range. In situ spectroelectrochemistry with labeled (NO)-N-15 shows that the reduction of {FeNO}(7) species follows a PCET pathway to produce {FeHNO}(8) species in the presence of water (a weak acid, pK a similar to 25). Under these conditions NO is reduced to N2O via a hyponitrite intermediate, but in the presence of strong acid (pK a 8.5 in MeCN) the {FeHNO}(8) species is rapidly reduced to NH4 (+), and FY yields >90% are obtained with the iron porphyrin with two -COOEt groups. In these iron porphyrins, the {FeHNO}(8) species appears to be a branching point in the reduction of NO, and either N2O or NH4 (+) can be obtained selectivity by controlling the acidity of the proton source.

TI  - Multi-band SAR intercomparison study in the Antarctic Peninsula for sea ice and iceberg detection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems are one of the best resources to gather information in polar environments, but the detection and monitoring of sea ice types and icebergs using them is still a challenge. Limitations using single-frequency images in sea ice characterization are well known, and using different SAR bands has been revealed to be useful. In this paper, we present the quantitative results of an intercomparison experiment conducted by the Argentine Naval Hydrographic Service (SHN) using X-, C-, and L-bands from COSMO-SkyMed, Sentinel-1, and SAOCOM satellites, respectively. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate SAOCOM for its use on SHN products. There were 25 images with different SAR parameters that were analyzed, incorporating the diversity in the information that everyday Ice Services attend to. Particularly, iceberg detections, fast first-year ice, and belts and strips were studied in the Antarctic Sound, the surroundings of Marambio Island, and Erebus and Terror Gulf. The results show that the HV polarization channel of the L-band provides useful information for iceberg detection and fast first-year ice surface feature recognition and is a promising frequency for the study of strip identification under windy sea conditions and snow accumulation on first-year ice.

TI  - Scaling up benthic primary productivity estimates in a large intertidal estuary using remote sensing.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - As two main primary producers in temperate intertidal regions, seagrass and microphytobenthos (MPB) support estuarine ecosystem functions in multiple ways including stabilizing food webs and regulating sediment resuspension among others. Monitoring estuary productivity at large scales can inform ecosystem scale responses to environmental stressors (climate change, pollution and habitat degradation). Here we use a case study to show how Sentinel-2 data can be used to estimate estuary-wide emerged and submerged gross primary productivity (GPP) on intertidal flats by coupling a new machine learning model to map seagrass and unvegetated habitats with literature-derived photosynthesis-irradiance (P - I) relationships. The model consisted of (1) supervised classification with random forest to delineate seagrass and unvegetated areas and (2) artificial neural network (ANN) regression to predict % seagrass coverage. Our seagrass delineation by supervised classification had an overall accuracy of 0.96, while the ANN regression on seagrass coverage provided high predictive accuracy (R2=0.71 and RMSE=0.11). The estimated GPP showed seagrass contributed slightly more to intertidal benthic productivity than MPB in the case-study estuary over the 3-year study period. This model can be used to predict the response of seagrass and MPB GPP to sea level rise, which shows that the future state may be very sensitive to increased turbidity. For example, by the year 2100, the model shows a sharp decline in productivity with sea level rise, assuming current turbidity trends, (loss of up to 52-53% for seagrass and 23-45% for MPB, a function of whether shoreward migration of seagrass is incorporated). However, GPP under conditions of unchanging turbidity (and no seagrass migration), exhibits minimal negative impact of sea level rise (loss of 3% for seagrass and increase of 29% for MPB). Therefore, controlling water turbidity might be an efficient solution to maintaining the current GPP as sea level rises.

TI  - 4D modeling of precipitable water vapor to assess flood forecasting by using GPS signals
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Every year the government and people suffer from the cost of damages caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods. Thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) permanent station data, today it is possible to determine the amount of Water Vapor (WV) very accurately and reliably. GPS signals pass through different layers of the atmosphere, such as the ionosphere and troposphere, and therefore they are delayed. A significant part of the delay is due to the troposphere, which is one of the serious sources of error in GPS. In this research, by using 5 GPS permanent stations located in the Arasbaran region, in northwest of Iran, the Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) is evaluated in order to show the capacity of this method in forecasting the October 2012 flood over the region. The results showed that the amount of PWV in the atmosphere had increased by 2 mm a few hours before the flood, which could be used as a forecast indicator. The Tikhonov regularization for tropospheric tomography covering the GPS stations region was also performed for latitude and altitude components for 3 consecutive days: the day before the flood, the flood day, and the day after the flood. A high amount of PWV was observed in the troposphere on the day before the flood, and especially on the flood day. During the study period, the results from tomography and the radiosonde were in good agreement, with a significance correlation of around 0.95. Also, the values of PWV obtained from GPS and MODIS-NIR do not have an absolute error more than 4.4 mm over the 8 days from 8 October 2012 to 15 October 2012.

TI  - Pectoralis Muscle Dosimetry and Posttreatment Rehabilitation Utilization for Patients With Early-Stage Breast Cancer.
T2  - Practical radiation oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: Up to 50% of women treated for localized breast cancer will experience some degree of arm or shoulder morbidity. Although radiation is thought to contribute to this morbidity, the mechanism remains unclear. Prior studies have shown biologic and radiographic changes in the pectoralis muscles after radiation. This study thus aimed to investigate the relationship between radiation to the pectoralis muscles and referrals for rehabilitation services posttreatment for arm and shoulder morbidity.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective 1:1 matched case-control study was conducted for patients with breast cancer who were and were not referred for breast or shoulder rehabilitation services between 2014 and 2019 at a single academic institution. Patients were included if they had a lumpectomy and adjuvant radiation. Patients who underwent an axillary lymph node dissection were excluded. Cohorts were matched based on age, axillary surgery, and use of radiation boost. Muscle doses were converted to equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions assuming an alpha:beta ratio of 2.5 and were compared between the 2 groups.RESULTS: In our cohort of 50 patients of a median age 60 years (interquartile range, 53-68 years), 36 patients (72%) underwent a sentinel lymph node biopsy in addition to a lumpectomy. Although pectoralis muscle doses were generally higher in those receiving rehabilitation services, this was not statistically significant. Pectoralis major V20-40 Gy reached borderline significance, as did pectoralis major mean dose (17.69 vs 20.89 Gy; P=.06).CONCLUSIONS: In this limited cohort of patients, we could not definitively conclude a relationship between pectoralis muscle doses and use of rehabilitation services. Given the borderline significant findings, this should be further investigated in a larger cohort.

TI  - Sensitivity of Burned Area and Fire Radiative Power Predictions to Containment Efforts, Fuel Density, and Fuel Moisture Using WRF-Fire
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting the evolution of burned area, smoke emissions, and energy release from wildfires is crucial to air quality forecasting and emergency response planning yet has long posed a significant scientific challenge. Here we compare predictions of burned area and fire radiative power from the coupled weather/fire-spread model WRF-Fire (Weather and Research Forecasting Tool with fire code), against simpler methods typically used in air quality forecasts. We choose the 2019 Williams Flats Fire as our test case due to a wealth of observations and ignite the fire on different days and under different configurations. Using a novel re-gridding scheme, we compare WRF-Fire's heat output to geostationary satellite data at 1-hr temporal resolution. We also evaluate WRF-Fire's time-resolved burned area against high-resolution imaging from the National Infrared Operations aircraft data. Results indicate that for this study, accounting for containment efforts in WRF-Fire simulations makes the biggest difference in achieving accurate results for daily burned area predictions. When incorporating novel containment line inputs, fuel density increases, and fuel moisture observations into the model, the error in average daily burned area is 30% lower than persistence forecasting over a 5-day forecast. Prescribed diurnal cycles and those resolved by WRF-Fire simulations show a phase offset of at least an hour ahead of observations, likely indicating the need for dynamic fuel moisture schemes. This work shows that with proper configuration and input data, coupled weather/fire-spread modeling has the potential to improve smoke emission forecasts.Predicting wildfire growth and smoke behavior is an important and historically difficult task. Here we compare a coupled fire-weather model to current practices used in air quality forecasting in their ability to predict daily wildfire spread and fire intensity for the 2019 Williams Flats Fire. We also evaluate the fire-weather model against high-resolution satellite and aircraft measurements in ways previously unexplored. We find that including fire-fighting efforts in our model makes the biggest improvements toward accurate wildfire forecasting. When we account for fire-fighting efforts, fuel moisture maps, and increased fuel loads, our coupled fire-weather model significantly outperforms simpler methods with reasonable computational time. Despite this, modeled fire intensity tends to lead observations by at least an hour. Optimal configuration options and avenues for forecasting improvements are discussed.Adding containment lines into our wildfire model made the biggest difference in improving accuracy of daily burned area predictionsAccounting for containment, fuel moisture content maps, and increased fuel density consistently increased prediction skill above persistenceModeled fire radiative power leads observations by at least an hour, but with similar accuracy to prescribed diurnal cycles

TI  - Pilonidal Sinus Disease is Associated with Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa in a Spanish Cohort.
T2  - Acta dermato-venereologica
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the hair follicle with a high level of morbidity. Pilonidal sinus disease is a comorbid disorder and may be the reason for first contact with the healthcare system of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of association of pilonidal sinus disease and hidradenitis suppurativa and to explore whether pilonidal sinus disease defines a different clinical profile for patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. A cross-sectional study in which data regarding past history of pilonidal sinus disease, clinical and sociodemographic information were recorded during the first visit to the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinic of 2 tertiary hospitals. A total of 839 patients were included in the study. Of these, 51.7% (434/839) were male and mean age was 37.3±13.6 years. Pilonidal sinus disease was present in 32.6% (269/839) of the patients and was associated with an early debut of hidradenitis suppurativa, a higher Hurley stage, inflammatory phenotype and a greater number of fistulas and perianal involvement. Elapsed time between pilonidal sinus disease and diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa was associated with higher disease severity. Pilonidal sinus disease is a frequent comorbidity and risk marker for hidradenitis suppurativa disease severity. Pilonidal sinus disease could be a sentinel event to identify patients who would benefit from close treatment and follow-up.

Its main advantage is in the context of logistics, with the possibility to inject several weeks before surgery and the possibility to give access to sentinel lymph node biopsy for women worldwide in places without nuclear medicine facilities. We have not yet seen the full potential of this technique, and new implications have been developed for breast tumour localisation with paramagnetic clips and axillary staging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy using paramagnetic clips inserted in lymph node metastases before chemotherapy. In this report, we have presented our experience of the magnetic technique starting in 2014, and we have highlighted our current and future research directions.

TI  - Accurate estimation of fractional vegetation cover for winter wheat by integrated unmanned aerial systems and satellite images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is essential for crop growth monitoring. Currently, satellite remote sensing monitoring remains one of the most effective methods for the estimation of crop FVC. However, due to the significant difference in scale between the coarse resolution of satellite images and the scale of measurable data on the ground, there are significant uncertainties and errors in estimating crop FVC. Here, we adopt a Strategy of Upscaling-Downscaling operations for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and satellite data collected during 2 growing seasons of winter wheat, respectively, using backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) as support to fully bridge this scale gap using highly accurate the UAS-derived FVC (FVCUAS) to obtain wheat accurate FVC. Through validation with an independent dataset, the BPNN model predicted FVC with an RMSE of 0.059, which is 11.9% to 25.3% lower than commonly used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and traditional Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-based method (NDVI-based) models. Moreover, all those models achieved improved estimation accuracy with the Strategy of Upscaling-Downscaling, as compared to only upscaling UAS data. Our results demonstrate that: (1) establishing a nonlinear relationship between FVCUAS and satellite data enables accurate estimation of FVC over larger regions, with the strong support of machine learning capabilities. (2) Employing the Strategy of Upscaling-Downscaling is an effective strategy that can improve the accuracy of FVC estimation, in the collaborative use of UAS and satellite data, especially in the boundary area of the wheat field. This has significant implications for accurate FVC estimation for winter wheat, providing a reference for the estimation of other surface parameters and the collaborative application of multisource data.

TI  - Disparate permafrost terrain changes after a large flood observed from space
T2  - PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The 2015 spring flood of the Sagavanirktok River inundated large swaths of tundra as well as infrastructure near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. Its lasting impact on permafrost, vegetation, and hydrology is unknown but compels attention in light of changing Arctic flood regimes. We combined InSAR and optical satellite observations to quantify subdecadal permafrost terrain changes and identify their controls. While the flood locally induced quasi-instantaneous ice-wedge melt, much larger areas were characterized by subtle, spatially variable post-flood changes. Surface deformation from 2015 to 2019 estimated from ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 InSAR varied substantially within and across terrain units, with greater subsidence on average in flooded locations. Subsidence exceeding 5 cm was locally observed in inundated ice-rich units and also in inactive floodplains. Overall, subsidence increased with deposit age and thus ground ice content, but many flooded ice-rich units remained stable, indicating variable drivers of deformation. On average, subsiding ice-rich locations showed increases in observed greenness and wetness. Conversely, many ice-poor floodplains greened without deforming. Ice wedge degradation in flooded locations with elevated subsidence was mostly of limited intensity, and the observed subsidence largely stopped within 2 years. Based on remote sensing and limited field observations, we propose that the disparate subdecadal changes were influenced by spatially variable drivers (e.g., sediment deposition, organic layer), controls (ground ice and its degree of protection), and feedback processes. Remote sensing helps quantify the heterogeneous interactions between permafrost, vegetation, and hydrology across permafrost-affected fluvial landscapes. Interdisciplinary monitoring is needed to improve predictions of landscape dynamics and to constrain sediment, nutrient, and carbon budgets.

TI  - Protocol for the T-REX-trial: tailored regional external beam radiotherapy in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients with 1-2 sentinel node macrometastases - an open, multicentre, randomised non-inferiority phase 3 trial.
T2  - BMJ open
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Modern systemic treatment has reduced incidence of regional recurrences and improved survival in breast cancer (BC). It is thus questionable whether regional radiotherapy (RT) is still beneficial in patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) macrometastasis. Postoperative regional RT is associated with an increased risk of arm morbidity, pneumonitis, cardiac disease and secondary cancer. Therefore, there is a need to individualise regional RT in relation to the risk of recurrence.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this multicentre, prospective randomised trial, clinically node-negative patients with oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative BC and 1-2 SLN macrometastases are eligible. Participants are randomly assigned to receive regional RT (standard arm) or not (intervention arm). Regional RT includes the axilla level I-III, the supraclavicular fossa and in selected patients the internal mammary nodes. Both groups receive RT to the remaining breast. Chest-wall RT after mastectomy is given in the standard arm, but in the intervention arm only in cases of widespread multifocality according to national guidelines. RT quality assurance is an integral part of the trial.The trial aims to include 1350 patients between March 2023 and December 2028 in Sweden and Norway. Primary outcome is recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 5years. Non-inferiority will be declared if outcome in the de-escalation arm is not >4.5percentage units below that with regional RT, corresponding to an HR of 1.41 assuming 88% 5-year RFS with standard treatment. Secondary outcomes include locoregional recurrence, overall survival, patient-reported arm morbidity and health-related quality of life. Gene expression analysis and tumour tissue-based studies to identify prognostic and predictive markers for benefit of regional RT are included.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial protocol is approved by the Swedish Ethics Authority (Dnr-2022-02178-01, 2022-05093-02, 2023-00826-02, 2023-03035-02).

TI  - The white racial frame of public health discourses about racialized health differences and "disparities": what it reveals about power and how it thwarts health equity
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although several public health scholars have advocated for more clarity about concepts such as health disparities and health equity, attention to the framing of public health discourses about racialized health differences and "disparities" in the U.S., and what it reveals about power and the potential for achieving health equity, is surprisingly rare. Sociologist Joe Feagin, in his book, The White Racial Frame: Centuries of Racial Framing and Counter-Framing coined the term white racial frame to describe the predominantly white racialized worldview of majority white and white-oriented decisionmakers in everyday and institutional operations. Informed by insights from critical race theories about the white racial frame, white epistemological ignorance, and colorblind racism; critical perspectives on social class; Black feminist perspectives; framing; and critical discourse analysis, in this perspective I discuss: (1) the power of language and discourses; (2) the white racial frame of three common public health discourses - health disparities, "race," and social determinants of health (SDOH); (3) the costs and consequences of the white racial frame for advancing health equity; and (4) the need for more counter and critical theoretical frames to inform discourses, and in turn research and political advocacy to advance health equity in the U.S.

TI  - Evaluation and Comparison of Multi-Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth Products over East Asia Ocean.
T2  - Toxics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The atmosphere over the ocean is an important research field that involves multiple aspects such as climate change, atmospheric pollution, weather forecasting, and marine ecosystems. It is of great significance for global sustainable development. Satellites provide a wide range of measurements of marine aerosol optical properties and are very important to the study of aerosol characteristics over the ocean. In this study, aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from seventeen AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) stations were used as benchmark data to comprehensively evaluate the data accuracy of six aerosol optical thickness products from 2013 to 2020, including MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer), VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite), MISR (Multi-Angle Imaging Spectrometer), OMAERO (OMI/Aura Multi-wavelength algorithm), OMAERUV (OMI/Aura Near UV algorithm), and CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) in the East Asian Ocean. In the East Asia Sea, VIIRS AOD products generally have a higher correlation coefficient (R), expected error within ratio (EE within), lower root mean square error (RMSE), and median bias (MB) than MODIS AOD products. The retrieval accuracy of AOD data from VIIRS is the highest in spring. MISR showed a higher EE than other products in the East Asian Ocean but also exhibited systematic underestimation. In most cases, the OMAERUV AOD product data are of better quality than OMAERO, and OMAERO overestimates AOD throughout the year. The CALIPSO AOD product showed an apparent underestimation of the AOD in different seasons (EE Below = 58.98%), but when the AOD range is small (0 < AOD < 0.1), the CALIPSO data accuracy is higher compared with other satellite products under small AOD range. In the South China Sea, VIIRS has higher data accuracy than MISR, while in the Bohai-Yellow Sea, East China Sea, Sea of Japan, and the western Pacific Ocean, MISR has the best data accuracy. MODIS and VIIRS show similar trends in R, EE within, MB, and RMSE under the influence of AOD, Angstrom exponent (AE), and precipitable water. The study on the temporal and spatial distribution of AOD in the East Asian Ocean shows that the annual variation of AOD is different in different sea areas, and the ocean in the coastal area is greatly affected by land-based pollution. In contrast, the AOD values in the offshore areas are lower, and the aerosol type is mainly clean marine type aerosol. These findings can help researchers in the East Asian Ocean choose the most accurate and reliable satellite AOD data product to better study atmospheric aerosols' impact and trends.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Remote sensing via hyperspectral imaging delivers the crucial earth's surface information in narrow spectral bands, which may not be possible with multispectral imaging. The classification algorithms play a vital role in highlighting or categorizing the essential features of the earth's surface with respect to spectral information and generate thematic maps for further processing in different applications. Therefore, it is essential to explore the impact of well-defined or emerging classifiers on hyperspectral and multispectral datasets. In the present work, the performance of various classifiers, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), feedforward neural networks (FF-NN) and maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), has been evaluated using Earth Observation-1 (EO-1) Hyperion and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor over a part of the North Indian states. The experimental outcomes have confirmed that the FF-NN classifier achieved higher accuracy (91.20% with Hyperion; 82% with Landsat-8) as compared to other classification methods, i.e., SVM (87.60% with Hyperion and 80% with Landsat-8) and MLC (84.40% with Hyperion and 72.40% with Landsat-8). This study is important in terms of exploring the potential of hyperspectral imaging with different classification algorithms in various emerging applications.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation in sensitivity of urban vegetation growth and greenness to vegetation water content: Evidence from Chinese megacities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the sensitivity of vegetation growth and greenness to vegetation water content change is crucial for elucidating the mechanism of terrestrial ecosystems response to water availability change caused by climate change. Nevertheless, we still have limited knowledge of such aspects in urban in different climatic contexts under the influence of human activities. In this study, we employed Google Earth Engine (GEE), remote sensing satellite imagery, meteorological data, and Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) to explore the spatiotemporal pattern of vegetation growth and greenness sensitivity to vegetation water content in three megacities (Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou) located in eastern China from 2001 to 2020. We found a significant increase (slope > 0, p < 0.05) in the sensitivity of urban vegetation growth and greenness to vegetation water content (S-LSWI). This indicates the increasing dependence of urban vegetation ecosystems on vegetation water resources. Moreover, evident spatial heterogeneity was observed in both S-LSWI and the trends of S-LSWI, and spatial heterogeneity in S-LSWI and the trends of S-LSWI was also present among identical vegetation types within the same city. Additionally, both SLSWI of vegetation growth and greenness and the trend of S-LSWI showed obvious spatial distribution differences (e.g., standard deviations of trends in S-LSWI of open evergreen needle-leaved forest of GPP is 14.36 x 10(-2) and standard deviations of trends in S-LSWI of open evergreen needle-leaved forest of EVI is 10.16 x 10(-2)), closely associated with factors such as vegetation type, climatic conditions, and anthropogenic influences.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Dynamics of Forest Cover in Mid-Upstream Basins of Taedong River in DPR Korea Using Landsat Time Series
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Deforestation has become a critical concern that brings about changes in the global ecological environment. The forest inventory is the first step toward the adoption of the necessary decisions at the national and regional level for the protection of the ecological environment and the sustainable development and use of forest resources. The present study analyzed the forest cover change dynamics in the mid-upstream area of the Taedong River in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea during 1990-2020 by applying remote sensing technology. For the analysis, annual image datasets layered with spectral index bands fitted to vertices of the normalized burned ratio segment curve were created by implementing LandTrendr algorithm in the Google Earth Engine platform. The sample dataset used to conduct random forest classification was collected by sampling from pixels in which ecological change events were not observed during the study period. The overall accuracy was 95.12 & PLUSMN; 0.14% in all years. The results showed that over the past 20 years (1990-2010), the forest area of the study area decreased by 652.5 km2, accounting for 13.6% of the total forest area in the starting year (1990). The annual rate of deforestation in the study area between 1990 and 2000 was 1.043% year-1, which was much higher than the global deforestation rate (0.184% year-1) during the same period. For the period from 2000 to 2010, the deforestation rate was 0.423% year-1, 3.4 times the global deforestation rate (0.125% year-1). During these two time periods, deforestation in the study area was substantial. However, from 2010 to 2020, the forest area showed a tendency to increase, especially in the midstream region where it increased significantly. The average growth rate of forest area in the midstream region was much higher than that in the upstream region, where there was no significant change in forest area between 2010 and 2020. The current forest area of the research area was estimated at 92% of the forest area in 1990 (4783.9 km2).

TI  - Performance assessment of NASA POWER temperature product with different time scales in Iran
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - With the expansion of science and technology worldwide, various satellite products of meteorological parameters have been developed, which can compensate for the lack of observational data. However, to use these products effectively, their accuracy needs to be verified. Therefore, this study investigates the precision of NASA POWER satellite minimum and maximum air temperature data in 70 synoptic stations in Iran from 1987 to 2018. The study examines the data on three-time scales, with 0.5 degree spatial resolution. The findings indicate that the degree of exactness in the NASA POWER temperature data was greater during the monthly interval. The performance of the minimum and maximum air temperature data of the NASA POWER database has been relatively constant in different latitudes. However, changes in the performance of NASA POWER products in stations with different altitudes indicate that the performance of maximum air temperature is better in stations with an altitude of > 1900 m.a.s.l. On the other hand, altitude greatly affects the accuracy of the performance of the satellite model's maximum air temperature. On a daily and monthly time scale, altitude does not significantly impact the minimum temperature data, but on an annual scale, NASA POWER products perform better at low-altitude stations. Hence, the RMSE error values are lower in stations with an altitude of 400-700 m.a.s.l (RMSE = 2.8 degrees C) than in stations with an altitude of > 1900 m.a.s.l (RMSE = 6.9 degrees C). NASA-POWER products perform better in summer than in winter. The RMSE error values in the hot months of the year were between 2.64 and 2.81 degrees C all over Iran, while the minimum temperature in the cold months of the year was between 6.26 and 7.48 degrees C, which is significantly different. The research also showed that NASA POWER data are more accurate at maximum temperature than at minimum temperature, and these products have less accuracy at minimum temperatures in cold regions. Additionally, the results showed that the error rate in minimum and maximum data in dry and hot regions was less than in other regions, and this satellite product had a more acceptable performance in detecting the temperature of hot and desert regions. The investigation of diverse return periods of minimum and maximum air temperatures elucidates that in arid and parched areas, the maximum air temperature escalates as the return period amplifies; conversely, in hilly and moist regions, the minimum air temperature heightens with the upsurge of the return period. The consequences garnered from this exploration can be employed in meteorological and climatologic analyses and drought inquiries.

TI  - Cropping intensity map of China with 10 m spatial resolution from analyses of time-series Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2 images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropping intensity maps at high spatial resolution play a crucial role in guiding agricultural policies and ensuring food security. So far, most of nationwide cropping intensity maps have been developed from satellite images at moderate or coarse resolutions. In this study, we first assembled and integrated time-series dataset with high spatial resolution, specifically Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery in 2017. We then used an object-and phenology-based algorithm and integrated images to create a 10-m resolution cropping intensity map over China. The map evaluation results revealed an overall accuracy of 96.68 +/- 0.01 % and a Kappa coefficient of 0.90. In 2017, single cropping dominated the agricultural practices in China, with an approximate area of 1.189 x 106 km2 +/- 7.90 x 103 km2, constituted 79.26 % of the entire cropland area. Simultaneously, double and triple cropping covered approximately 0.306 x 106 km2 +/- 8.03 x 103 km2 and 5.00 x 103 +/- 1.75 x 103 km2, cor-responding to 20.41 % and 0.33 % of the entire cropland area, respectively. On average, the national multiple cropping index (MCI) was 1.21. The results in the study prove the reliability of the generated mapping products and high potential of the developed mapping framework (the algorithm and integrated datasets), which can be readily applied to quantify the interannual changes of cropping pattern on a nationwide level with a high spatial resolution.

TI  - Cultivating resilience for sustainable service ecosystems in turbulent times: evidence from primary health care
T2  - JOURNAL OF SERVICES MARKETING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate how and why some service ecosystems are more resilient and, consequently, more sustainable than others during turbulent times, and how resilience can be cultivated to enable pathways to service ecosystem sustainability.Design/methodology/approachThis work integrates disparate literature from multiple service and sustainability literature streams, iterating through constant comparison with findings from 44 semistructured interviews conducted in the context of primary health care clinic service ecosystems.FindingsThe authors offer a novel conceptual framework comprising pillars (shared worldview, individual actor well-being and multiactor interactions), changing practices to cultivate resilience through resilience levers (orchestrators, individual actor effort, actor inclusivity and digitaltech-humanness approach), and pathways to service ecosystem sustainability (volume vs value, volume to value, volume and value). The authors demonstrate that service ecosystems need to change practices, integrating resources differently in response to the turbulent environment, emphasizing the importance of a shared worldview across the ecosystem and assessing different pathways to sustainability.Originality/valueThis paper offers new insights into the important intersection of service marketing, sustainability and health care. The authors provide guidance to practitioners aiming to cultivate resilience in service ecosystems to achieve pathways to sustainability in primary health care clinics. Finally, implications for theory are discussed, and directions to guide future service research offered.
