TI  - A review of the sentinel prey method as a way of quantifying invertebrate predation under field conditions
T2  - INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel prey can provide a direct, quantitative measure of predation under field conditions. Live sentinel prey provides more realistic data but rarely allows the partitioning of the total predation pressure; artificial prey is less natural but traces left by different predators are identifiable, making it suitable for comparative studies. We reviewed the available evidence of the use of both types of invertebrate sentinel prey. Fifty-seven papers used real prey, usually measuring predation on a focal (often pest) species, with studies overwhelmingly from North America. The median predation was 25.8% d(-1). Artificial sentinel prey (45 papers) were used in both temperate and tropical areas, placed more above ground than at ground level. The most commonly used artificial prey imitated a caterpillar. Up to 14 predator groups were identified, registering a median of 8.8% d(-1) predation; half the studies reported only bird predation. Predation on real prey was higher than on artificial ones, but invertebrate predation was not higher than vertebrate predation. Invertertebrate but not vertebrate predation was negatively related to prey size. Predation near the Equator was not higher than at higher latitudes, nor in cultivated than noncultivated habitats. The use of sentinel prey is not yet standardised in terms of prey size, arrangement, exposure period or data reporting. Due to the simplicity and ease of use of the method, such standardisation may increase the usefulness of comparative studies, contributing to the understanding of the importance and level of predation in various habitats worldwide.

TI  - Degradation Analysis for FY3B/VIRR Reflective Solar Bands Based on the Dunhuang Radiometric Calibration Site
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visible and Infrared Radiometer (VIRR) boarded on FY3B which is the new generation polar orbit meteorological satellite of China needs constant radiometric calibration after launch for improving the quality of data and better meeting the needs of users. In order to investigate the radiometric response degradation of FY3B/VIRR, the radiometric calibration coefficients of its reflective solar bands are calculated by the reflectance-based method, using the in-situ experiment data of Dunhuang radiometric calibration site from 2011 to 2015. The corresponding relative standard deviation of each band's radiometric calibration coefficient is less than 1.5%, except band 10 which is influenced by water vapor absorption. By comparing with the Aqua/MODIS observation data, the average deviation of our results is less than 2.5%. Then, the annual degradation rates of VIRR are achieved based on its five-year calibration coefficients, compared with the pre-launch calibration coefficient. This paper suggests that: (1) The degradation rate depends on the wavelength of the band, the degradation rate increases with the decrease of wavelength; (2) Compared with the pre-launch calibration coefficient, the VIRR sensor shows dramatic radiometric response change after one-year orbiting operation; (3) In general, the degradation rate decreases with the extension of operating time, especially in the second and the third year; (4) After three-year orbiting operation, the degradation rate of the band with wavelength less than 0.8 mu m appear to increase; (5) After two-year orbiting operation, the radiometric response of the band with wavelength greater than 0.8 mu m increases in some period; (6) Comparing to the degradation changes of FY3A/MERSI proposed by Sun, both of the two sensors demonstrate a negative correlation between the degradation rate and the wavelength, but the radiometric responses of MERSI's band 3 and 13 at 0.65 mu m appear to increase, on the contrary, the degradation of VIRR' s band 1 at the same wavelength tends to increase; (7) The annual degradation rate of short wavelength band 7, 8 and 9 is greater than 5% in the long run.

TI  - Multi-Model Ensemble Approaches to Assessment of Effects of Local Climate Change on Water Resources of the Hotan River Basin in Xinjiang, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of global climate change threaten the availability of water resources worldwide and modify their tempo-spatial pattern. Properly quantifying the possible effects of climate change on water resources under different hydrological models is a great challenge in ungauged alpine regions. By using remote sensing data to support established models, this study aimed to reveal the effects of climate change using two models of hydrological processes including total water resources, peak flows, evapotranspiration, snowmelt and snow accumulation in the ungauged Hotan River Basin under future representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. The results revealed that stream flow was much more sensitive to temperature variation than precipitation change and increased by 0.9-10.0% according to MIKE SHE or 6.5-10.5% according to SWAT. Increased evapotranspiration was similar for both models with a range of 7.6-31.3%. The snow-covered area shrank from 32.5% to 11.9% between the elevations of 4200-6400 m, respectively, and snow accumulation increased when the elevation exceeded 6400 m above sea level (asl). The results also suggested that the fully distributed and semi-distributed structures of these two models strongly influenced the responses to climate change. The study proposes a practical approach to assess the climate change effect in ungauged regions.

TI  - Temporal and spatial variation of land use and their influence on ecosystem service function values in the Yanghe Watershed, China.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yanghe Watershed is located in a typical farming pastoral zone of North China. It is an important water source conservation site and an ecological protection barrier for Beijing. Furthermore, the 2022 Winter Olympic Games will be held in Zhangjiakou City, which is a key region of the Yanghe Watershed. A study of land use changes and their ecosystem service-function values of the watershed can provide important theories for effective decision-making regarding water resource protection and environmental quality improvement in fields of the areas where the games will be held. ArcGIS was used to analyze remote sensing data of land-use changes that occurred within the Yanghe Watershed from 1990 to 2013, and ecosystem service-function values of the lands were estimated. The results showed that forest and unused lands within the watershed increased, whereas grassland and aquatic areas decreased during the study period. Based on absolute values of the changing rate of a single land-use type, apart from forestland, the other land-use types were more greatly affected by human or natural changes in 2000-2013 than in 1990-2000. Land transfers mainly occurred in Xihe, Yanggao, Tianzhen, Xuanhua, and Huailia Counties, and the land change degree and distribution increased in recent years. The annual value of total ecosystem service functions of the lands increased during 1990-2000 and decreased during 2000-2013; however, overall it decreased from 1990 to 2013. Service function values of grassland, aquatic areas, and farmland decreased, whereas that of forest and unused land increased during 1990-2013. Percentages of values of raw material production., climate regulation, air conditioning, biodiversity conservation, and esthetic landscape increased owing to increases of forestland within the watershed during the study period. Forest-, grass-, and farmlands were not only the main contributors but also sensitive factors to ecosystem service function values of the lands within the Yanghe Watershed from 1990 to 2013.

TI  - Simultaneous Estimation of Leaf Area Index, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, and Surface Albedo From Multiple-Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), and surface broadband albedo are three routinely generated land-surface parameters from satellite observations, which have been widely used in land-surface modeling and environmental monitoring. Currently, most global land products are retrieved separately from individual satellite data. Many issues, such as data gaps, spatial and temporal inconsistencies, and insufficient accuracy under certain conditions resulting from the inadequacies of single-sensor observations, have made the incorporation of multiple sensors a reasonable solution. In this paper, an approach to simultaneous estimation of LAI, broadband albedo, and FAPAR from multiple-satellite sensors is further refined. The method, improved from that proposed in an earlier study using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, consists of several steps. First, a coupled dynamic and radiative-transfer model based on MODIS, SPOT/VEGETATION, and Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer data was developed to retrieve LAI values and use them to construct a time-evolving dynamic model. Second, an iteration process with predefined exit criteria was developed to obtain consistent gap-filled LAI estimates. Third, a spectral albedo based on the retrieved LAI values was simulated using a radiative-transfer model and then converted to a broadband albedo using empirical methods. Snow-covered pixels identified by normalized difference snow index thresholds were adjusted to the weighted average of the underlying albedo and the maximum snow albedo. Finally, the FAPAR of green vegetation was calculated as a combination of the albedo at the top of the canopy, the soil albedo, and the transmittance of the PAR down to the background. Validation of retrieved LAI, albedo, and FAPAR values obtained from multiple-satellite data over ten study sites has demonstrated that the proposed method can produce more accurate products than presently distributed global products.

TI  - A review of supervised object-based land-cover image classification
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Object-based image classification for land-cover mapping purposes using remote-sensing imagery has attracted significant attention in recent years. Numerous studies conducted over the past decade have investigated a broad array of sensors, feature selection, classifiers, and other factors of interest. However, these research results have not yet been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the effect of different supervised object-based land-cover classification processes. In this study, we first construct a database with 28 fields using qualitative and quantitative information extracted from 254 experimental cases described in 173 scientific papers. Second, the results of the meta-analysis are reported, including general characteristics of the studies (e.g., the geographic range of relevant institutes, preferred journals) and the relationships between factors of interest (e.g., spatial resolution and study area or optimal segmentation scale, accuracy and number of targeted classes), especially with respect to the classification accuracy of different sensors, segmentation scale, training set size, supervised classifiers, and land cover types. Third, useful data on supervised object-based image classification are determined from the meta-analysis. For example, we find that supervised object-based classification is currently experiencing rapid advances, while development of the fuzzy technique is limited in the object-based framework. Furthermore, spatial resolution correlates with the optimal segmentation scale and study area, and Random Forest (RF) shows the best performance in object-based classification. The area-based accuracy assessment method can obtain stable classification performance, and indicates a strong correlation between accuracy and training set size, while the accuracy of the point-based method is likely to be unstable due to mixed objects. In addition, the overall accuracy benefits from higher spatial resolution images (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicle) or agricultural sites where it also correlates with the number of targeted classes. More than 95.6% of studies involve an area less than 300 ha, and the spatial resolution of images is predominantly between 0 and 2 m. Furthermore, we identify some methods that may advance supervised object-based image classification. For example, deep learning and type-2 fuzzy techniques may further improve classification accuracy. Lastly, scientists are strongly encouraged to report results of uncertainty studies to further explore the effects of varied factors on supervised object based image classification.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing research interests in differentiating the relative importance of climate factors and human activities in impacting vegetation dynamics. In this study, based on residual trend method, we used MOD13A3 (MODIS vegetation index product), MCD12Q1 (MODIS land cover product) and meteorological datasets to differentiate the relative importance of climate factors and human activities in impacting vegetation dynamics during 2000-2015 in the Otindag Sandy Land, northern China. Results show that during the study period (2000-2015), the overall vegetation condition had improved in the Otindag Sandy Land. The driving forces of vegetation dynamics differed spatially in the whole study area over the study period. The area with vegetation degradation solely resulted from human activities accounted for 8.23% of the study area, while the area with vegetation degradation resulted from others (including climate factors and combination of climate factors and human activities) occupied 1.53%. The area with vegetation recovery benefitted from human activities occurred over 26.02% of the study area; the area benefitted from climate factors accounted for 23.69%; and the area benefitted from both climate factors and human activities occupied 37.74%. All in all, impacts of climate factors and human activities on vegetation dynamics varied at the county/city/banner scales and locality-specific measures should be adopted to protect the environments.

TI  - Optical properties and source analysis of aerosols over a desert area in Dunhuang, Northwest china
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol observational data for 2012 obtained from Dunhuang Station of CARE-China (Campaign on Atmospheric Aerosol Research Network of China) were analyzed to achieve in-depth knowledge of aerosol optical properties over Dunhuang region. The results showed that the annual average aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500 nm was 0.32 +/- 0.06, and the ngstrom exponent (alpha) was 0.73 +/- 0.27. Aerosol optical properties revealed significant seasonal characteristics. Frequent sandstorms in MAM (March-April-May) resulted in the seasonal maximum AOD, 0.41 +/- 0.04, and a relatively smaller alpha value, 0.44 +/- 0.04. The tourism seasons, JJA (June-July-August) and SON (September-October-November) coincide with serious emissions of small anthropogenic aerosols. While in DJF (December-January-February), the composition of the atmosphere was a mixture of dust particles and polluted aerosols released by domestic heating; the average AOD and alpha were 0.29 +/- 0.02 and 0.66 +/- 0.17, respectively. Different air masses exhibited different degrees of influence on the aerosol concentration over Dunhuang in different seasons. During MAM, ranges of AOD (0.11-1.18) and alpha (0.06-0.82) were the largest under the dust influence of northwest-short-distance air mass in the four trajectories. Urban aerosols transported by northwest-short-distance air mass accounted for a very large proportion in JJA and the mixed aerosols observed in SON were mainly conveyed by air masses from the west. In DJF, the similar ranges of AOD and alpha under the three air mass demonstrated the analogous diffusion effects on regional pollutants over Dunhuang.

TI  - Multi-Index Soil Moisture Estimation from Satellite Earth Observations: Comparative Evaluation of the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) and the Improved TVDI (iTVDI)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture estimation from satellite earth observation has emerged effectively advantageous due to the high temporal resolution, spatial resolution, coverage, and processing convenience it affords. In this paper, we present a study carried out to estimate soil moisture level at every location within Enugu State Nigeria from satellite earth observation. Comparative analysis of multiple indices for soil moisture estimation was carried out with a view to evaluating the robustness, correlation, appropriateness and accuracy of the indices in estimating the spatial distribution of soil moisture level in Enugu State. Results were correlated and validated with In-Situ soil moisture observations from multi-sample points. To achieve this, the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), based on digital elevation data, the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) and an improved TVDI (iTVDI) incorporating air temperature and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were calculated from ASTER global DEM and Landsat images. Possible dependencies of the indices on land cover type, topography, and precipitation were explored. In-Situ soil moisture data were used to validate the derived indices. The results showed that there was a positive significant relationship between iTVDI versus TVDI (R = 0.53, P value < 0.05), while in iTVDI versus TWI (R = 0.00, P value > 0.05) and TVDI versus TWI (R = -0.01, P value > 0.05) no significant relationship existed. There was a strong relationship between iTVDI and topography, land cover type, and precipitation than other indices (TVDI, TWI). In situ measured soil moisture values showed negative significant relationship with TVDI (R = -0.52, P value < 0.05) and iTVDI (R = -0.63, P value < 0.05) but not with TWI (R = -0.10, P value > 0.05). The iTVDI outperformed the other two index; having a stronger relationship with topography, precipitation, land cover classes and soil moisture. It concludes that although iTVDI outperformed other indices (TVDI, TWI) in soil moisture estimation, the decision of which index to apply is dependent on available data, the intent of usage and spatial scale.

TI  - Quantification of Agricultural Water Productivity at Field Scale and Its Implication in On-Farm Water Management
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is under extreme water shortage conditions. About 80 % of water in KSA is utilized by the agricultural sector; therefore, proper management of irrigation water is required to produce more food from less water. Water productivity concept was emerged and successfully quantified with the use of remote sensing as well as variable-rate application technologies. In this study, water productivity (WP) of three major crops (alfalfa, corn and Rhodes grass), cultivated in the Eastern Province of KSA under center pivot irrigation system, was estimated using Landsat-8 images in conjunction with in situ field observations. Evapotranspiration (ET)/water use maps (WUM) of irrigated fields was generated from Landsat-8 data using SEBAL model. Subsequently, the crop type and growth stage wise amount of water required for the irrigation was estimated and the irrigation schedules were prepared. Zone based Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) system was used to optimize the application of irrigation water. Classified ET maps are used as a base for the formulation of prescription map for VRI. The accuracy of SEBAL derived ET maps were assessed against the actual ET recorded by the Eddy Covariance (EC) flux tower installed on an alfalfa field. Crop Productivity Map (CPM) of alfalfa and Rhodes grass were developed using hay yield monitor data, while forage corn productivity was represented by the relationship between the NDVI and sampled silage corn yield (kg m(-2)). Water productivity map was generated by dividing the CPM with the WUM. The deviation between SEBAL predicted and EC flux tower recorded ET was ranged from 2.92 to 7.13 %. The mean predicted yield (kg ha(-1)) of alfalfa, corn and Rhodes grass was 2934, 4650 and 3368, respectively. The fields with remote sensing (RS) and VRI application was shown higher WP compared to without RS and VRI inputs. The recorded WP of silage corn, Rhodes grass and Alfalfa with RS and VRI inputs was 1.09, 0.81 and 0.83 respectively, whereas, it was decreased to 1.03, 0.64 and 0.61 kg m(-3) respectively for the fields without RS and VRI inputs.

AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate the superficial lymph drainage patterns of primary skin cancers of the head arising from the occipital or parietal region.Method The dominant patterns of lymph drainage were retrospectively reviewed in eight patients aged 36-85 years with skin cancers in the occipital or parietal region in whom sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymph node dissection had been performed at Hokkaido University Hospital between January 1981 and December 2015.Results Lymph drainage was mainly to the occipital (6/8, 75%), level II (5/8, 63%), and level V lymph nodes (5/8, 63%). Of the six patients with drainage to the occipital lymph nodes, four (67%) also had drainage to level V nodes.Conclusions The dominant lymph drainage pattern in patients with skin cancer arising from the occipital or parietal region was to the occipital, level II, and level V lymph nodes. Further, lymph tended to drain directly from the occipital region to the level V lymph nodes.

TI  - Mapping wheat nitrogen uptake from RapidEye vegetation indices
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping wheat nitrogen (N) uptake at 5 m spatial resolution could provide growers with new insights regarding nitrogen-use efficiency at the field scale. This study explored the use of spectral information from high resolution (5 x 5 m) RapidEye satellite data at peak leaf area index (LAI) to estimate end-of-season cumulative N uptake of wheat (Triticum spp.) in a heterogeneous, rainfed system. The primary objectives were to evaluate the usefulness of simple, widely used vegetation indices (VIs) from RapidEye as a tool to map crop N uptake over three growing seasons, farms and growing conditions, and to examine the usefulness of remotely sensed N uptake maps for precision agriculture applications. Data on harvested wheat N was collected at twelve plots over three seasons at four farms in the Palouse region of Northern Idaho and Eastern Washington. Seventeen commonly used spectral VIs were computed for images collected during 'peak greenness' (maximum LAI) to determine which VIs would be most appropriate for estimating wheat N uptake at harvest. The normalized difference red-edge index was the top performing VI, explaining 81 % of the variance in wheat N uptake with a regression slope of 1.06 and RMSE of 15.94 kg/ha. Model performance was strong across all farms over all three seasons regardless of crop variety, allowing the creation of high accuracy wheat N uptake maps. In conclusion, for this particular agro-ecosystem, mid-season VIs that incorporate the use of the NIR and red-edge bands are generally better predictors of end-of-season crop N uptake than VIs that do not include these bands, thereby further enabling their use in precision agriculture applications.

The Northern Dvina River discharges into the White Sea and the Pechora River flows into the Barents Sea. They are major rivers in northern European Russia. The main hydrological hazards at the mouths of these rivers include dangerous ice phenomena, inundations from both pure maximum stream flow and peak discharges with ice jams, surge-induced flooding, wind-induced down-surges, low-water periods and seawater intrusion into the delta branches. These hazards repeatedly caused significant socioeconomic loss and environmental damage to the riparian areas. Causes and characteristics of hydrological hazards have been evaluated and considered with respect to features, pattern and factors of their long-term, seasonal and spatial variability using statistic methods, remote sensing data and numerical simulation. Furthermore, the impact of regional climate change and economic activities is discussed. As a result, detailed information about the Northern Dvina river mouth is presented. It included the structure and the efficiency of measure for preventing ice jam formation and protecting from river discharge, ice jam and surge-induced inundations. The article also included fundamental and updated data on the structure, parameters and hydrological regime of the Northern Dvina and the Pechora river mouths and specifics of their changes in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

TI  - Axillary Micrometastases and Isolated Tumor Cells Are Not an Indication for Post-mastectomy Radiotherapy in Stage 1 and 2 Breast Cancer

AB  - Background. Randomized trials demonstrate equivalent locoregional control with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for T1-2 micrometastatic breast cancer, but include few mastectomy patients. Consensus is lacking on indications for post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in this population. Herein, we evaluate locoregional recurrence (LRR) in an unselected, modern cohort of T1-2 breast cancer patients with micrometastases or isolated tumor cells (ITCs; N0i+/N1mi) having a mastectomy.Methods. We identified patients with T1-2N0i+/N1mi breast cancer treated with mastectomy from January 2006 to December 2011. Recurrent, bilateral, and neoadjuvant cases were excluded. The primary outcome of interest was LRR.Results. Overall, 352 patients [211 (60%) with ITCs and 141 (40%) with micrometastases] were identified. 162 (46%) patients had SLNB alone and one node was positive in 295 (84%) cases; 31 (9%) patients had PMRT and 95% had systemic therapy. At a median 6 years of follow-up, the overall crude LRR rate was 2.8% (n = 9), with no axillary recurrences, and the crude LRR rate was 3.9% among those who had SNB alone. Those with LRR had a median age of 55 years, median tumor size of 1.7 cm, and ductal histology; the majority were high-grade (89%) and estrogen receptor positive (78%), with one positive node (89%). There was no association between LRR and receipt of PMRT (p = 0.4), SLNB versus ALND (p = 0.2), or number of positive nodes (p = 0.7) using the log-rank test.Conclusions. LRR was infrequent among T1-2N0i+/N1mi patients treated with mastectomy without PMRT, with no axillary failures, suggesting that PMRT or nodal radiotherapy are not routinely indicated in this population.

TI  - Random forest wetland classification using ALOS-2 L-band, RADARSAT-2 C-band, and TerraSAR-X imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important ecosystems around the world, although they are degraded due both to anthropogenic and natural process. Newfoundland is among the richest Canadian province in terms of different wetland classes. Herbaceous wetlands cover extensive areas of the Avalon Peninsula, which are the habitat of a number of animal and plant species. In this study, a novel hierarchical object-based Random Forest (RF) classification approach is proposed for discriminating between different wetland classes in a sub-region located in the north eastern portion of the Avalon Peninsula. Particularly, multi polarization and multi -frequency SAR data, including X-band TerraSAR-X single polarized (HH), L-band ALOS-2 dual polarized (HH/HV), and C-band RADARSAT-2 fully polarized images, were applied in different classification levels. First, a SAR backscatter analysis of different land cover types was performed by training data and used in Level-I classification to separate water from non-water classes. This was followed by Level-II classification, wherein the water class was further divided into shallow-and deep water classes, and the non-water class was partitioned into herbaceous and non-herbaceous classes. In Level-III classification, the herbaceous class was further divided into bog, fen, and marsh classes, while the non-herbaceous class was subsequently partitioned into urban, upland, and swamp classes. In Level-II and -III classifications, different polarimetric decomposition approaches, including Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi decompositions, and Kennaugh matrix elements were extracted to aid the RF classifier. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were determined in each classification level for evaluating the classification results. The importance of input features was also determined using the variable importance obtained by RF. It was found that the Kennaugh matrix elements, Yamaguchi, and Freeman-Durden decompositions were the most important parameters for wetland classification in this study. Using this new hierarchical RF classification approach, an overall accuracy of up to 94% was obtained for classifying different land cover types in the study area.

TI  - An Advanced Radiative Transfer and Neural Network Scheme and Evaluation for Estimating Water Vapor Content from MODIS Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work made an improvement upon and a further evaluation of previous work for estimating water vapor content from near-infrared around 1 mu m from MODIS data. The accuracy of RM-NN is determined by the complicated relationship of the geophysical parameters. An advanced scheme is proposed for building different training databases for different seasons in different regions to reduce the complexity. The training database includes three parts. The first part is a simulation database by MODTRAN for different weather conditions, which is made as a basic database; the second part is reliable field measurement data in observation stations; and the third part is the MYD05_L2 product on clear days, which is produced by the standard product algorithm for water vapor content. The comparative analyses based on simulation data indicate that maximum accuracy of single condition could be improved by about 34% relative to the "all conditions" results. Two study regions in China and America are selected as test areas, and the evaluation shows that the mean and the standard deviation of estimation error are about 0.08 g cm(-2) and 0.09 g cm(-2), respectively. All the analysis indicates that the advanced scheme can improve the retrieval accuracy of water vapor content, which can make full use of the advantages of previous methods.

TI  - A Study of Landfast Ice with Sentinel-1 Repeat-Pass Interferometry over the Baltic Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of fast ice displacement and investigating sea ice rheological behavior is a major open topic in coastal ice engineering and sea ice modeling. This study presents first results on Sentinel-1 repeat-pass space borne synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) in the Gulf of Bothnia over the fast ice areas. An InSAR pair acquired in February 2015 with a temporal baseline of 12 days has been studied here in detail. According to our results, the surface of landfast ice in the study area was stable enough to preserve coherence over the 12-day baseline, while previous InSAR studies over the fast ice used much shorter temporal baselines. The advantage of longer temporal baseline is in separating the fast ice from drift ice and detecting long term trends in deformation maps. The interferogram showed displacement of fast ice on the order of 40 cm in the study area. Parts of the displacements were attributed to forces caused by sea level tilt, currents, and thermal expansion, but the main factor of the displacement seemed to be due to compression of the drift ice driven by southwest winds with high speed. Further interferometric phase and the coherence measurements over the fast ice are needed in the future for understanding sea ice mechanism and establishing sustainability of the presented InSAR approach for monitoring dynamics of the landfast ice with Sentinel-1 data.

TI  - Attribution of changes in stream flow to land use change and climate change in a mesoscale tropical catchment in Java, Indonesia
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the stream flow of the Samin catchment (277.9 km(2)) in Java, Indonesia, have been attributed to land use change and climate change. Hydroclimatic data covering the period 1990-2013 and land use data acquired from Landsat satellite imageries for the years 1994 and 2013 were analysed. A quantitative measure is developed to attribute stream flow changes to land use and climate changes based on the changes in the proportion of excess water relative to changes in the proportion of excess energy. The results show that 72% of the increase in stream flow might be attributed to land use change. The results are validated by a land use change analysis and two statistical trend analyses namely the Mann-Kendall trend analysis and Sen's slope estimator for mean annual discharge, rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. The results of the statistical trend analysis are in the same direction as the results of the attribution analysis, where climate change was relatively minor compared to significant land uses change due to deforestation during the period 1994-2013. We conclude that changes in stream flow can be mainly attributed to land use change rather than climate change for the study catchment.

TI  - Molecular analysis of sentinel lymph node in colon carcinomas by one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) reduces time to adjuvant chemotherapy interval
T2  - DIGESTIVE AND LIVER DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The interval between surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) is a predictive factor of survival in high-risk colon cancer (CC). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) analysis using the one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) technique on the time interval between surgery and AC.Methods: We performed a prospective study analyzing 56 consecutive patients who had surgery for CC between July 2012 and October 2014, including 20 patients needing AC. SLN status was determined intraoperatively in 17 patients in the OSNA group; when positive, a portacath (PAC) was placed during the procedure for upcoming AC. In the remaining patients, we proceeded without SLN status determination and the PAC was installed after definitive histopathological analysis of the specimen if needed.Results: There was no difference between the groups regarding cancer staging, duration of hospitalization (7.5 days in the OSNA group and 10 days in the control group, p = 0.43) and major complications (20% vs 30% respectively, p = 0.55). The time interval between surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly shorter in the OSNA group at 35 (+8) days vs 67 (+36) days (p = 0.021).Conclusion: SLN status determination by the OSNA technique is safe, feasible and could significantly reduce time between surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy in a pilot study.

TI  - High sensitivity of North Iceland (Trollaskagi) debris-free glaciers to climatic change from the "Little Ice Age' to the present
T2  - HOLOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Trollaskagi peninsula is located in northern Iceland, between meridian 19 degrees 30W and 18 degrees 10W, jutting out into the North Atlantic to latitude 66 degrees 12N. The aim of this research is to study recent glacier changes in relation to climatic evolution of the Gljufurarjokull and Tungnahryggsjokull debris-free valley glaciers in Trollaskagi. Glacier extent mapping and spatial analysis operations were performed with ArcGIS (ESRI), using analysis of aerial photographs from 1946, 1985, 1994 and 2000, and a 2005 SPOT satellite image. The results show that these glaciers lost a quarter of their surface area between the Little Ice Age' and 2005. In this paper, the term Little Ice Age' follows Grove (2001) as the most recent period when glaciers extended globally between the medieval period and the early 20th century. The abrupt climatic transition of the early 20th century and the 25-year warm period 1925-1950 triggered the main retreat and volume loss of these glaciers since the end of the Little Ice Age'. Meanwhile, cooling during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s altered the trend, with advances of the glacier snouts. Between the Little Ice Age' and the present day, the mean annual air temperature and mean ablation season air temperature increased by 1.9 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C, respectively, leading to a 40-50 m rise in the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of the glaciers during this period. The response of these glaciers depends not only on the mean ablation season air temperature evolution but also on other factors such as winter precipitation. The models applied show a precipitation increase of up to more than 700 mm since the Little Ice Age'.

TI  - Higher Order Nonlinear Hyperspectral Unmixing for Mineralogical Analysis Over Extraterrestrial Bodies
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Algorithms allowing the deconvolution of hyperspectral data play a key-role in remotely sensed data processing for mineralogical investigation. Modified Gaussian model (MGM) based methods are of particular interest because they are able to retrieve accurate estimates of minerals abundances and chemistry in surface's rocks. However, MGM-based frameworks deliver high computational complexity and sensitivity to initial parameters for statistical distribution definition. In this paper, a new approach for efficient and robust mineralogical investigation over extraterrestrial bodies is introduced. The proposed framework takes advantage of the solid characterization of remote sensing hyperspectral images by unmixing higher order nonlinear combinations of reflectance features associated with mafic minerals. Experimental results achieved overMars and Moon hyperspectral images show that the proposed scheme is able to retrieve magmatic mineral abundance maps that are highly correlated to those achieved by means of MGM-based scheme while overcoming the aforesaid issues. Finally, an empirical study allowing to distinguish between clino- and orthopyroxenes by properly processing the outcomes of nonlinear hyperspectral unmixing method is reported.

TI  - Remote sensing of surface water quality in relation to catchment condition in Zimbabwe
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The degradation of river catchments is one of the most important contemporary environmental problems affecting water quality in tropical countries. In this study, we used remotely sensed Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to assess how catchment condition varies within and across river catchments in Zimbabwe. We then used non-linear regression to test whether catchment condition assessed using the NDVI is significantly (alpha = 0.05) related with levels of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) measured at different sampling points in thirty-two sub-catchments in Zimbabwe. The results showed a consistent negative curvilinear relationship between Landsat 8 derived NDVI and TSS measured across the catchments under study. In the drier catchments of the country, 98% of the variation in TSS is explained by NDVI, while in wetter catchments, 64% of the variation in TSS is explained by NDVI. Our results suggest that NDVI derived from free and readily available multispectral Landsat series data (Landsat 8) is a potential valuable tool for the rapid assessment of physical water quality in data poor catchments. Overall, the finding of this study underscores the usefulness of readily available satellite data for near-real time monitoring of the physical water quality at river catchment scale, especially in resource-constrained areas, such as the sub-Saharan Africa.

T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Debate remains about prognostic factors in prithary Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). We investigated clinicopathological factors as determinants of survival in patients with MCC submitted to sentinel node biopsy.Methods: Sixty-four consecutive patients treated for a primary MCC were identified from a prospectively maintained database at Fonda-zione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan. Time to events outcome were described by product limit estimators and proportional hazards model was used to investigate the association between outcome and potential predictors.Results: The most common site of primary tumor was lower limbs (56.3%). The size of primary lesion was <= 2 cm in 67.2% of cases. Presence of residual disease after the diagnostic surgical excision was observed in 28% of cases. All patients received sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and a SN positivity was detected in 26.6%. The median follow up was 78 months. Disease recurrence occurred in 17 patients (26.6%). In the SN negative group 10 recurrences occurred (21.3%), whereas 7 (41.2%) were found in SN positive one. Nine patients SN negative (19.1%) died of disease and 3 (17.6%) among SN positive. SN status was not associated with survival (p = 0.78). Neither age, gender, size and site of primary tumor resulted predictors of patients' outcome. The presence of residual tumor in the specimen of the wide local excision, after the diagnostic surgical excision, was the only variable associated with survival (p = 0.03).Conclusions: Presence of residual tumor in the specimen of the wide local excision is the main prognostic factor in MCC patients.

TI  - Going beyond the green: senesced vegetation material predicts basal area and biomass in remote sensing of tree cover conditions in an African tropical dry forest (miombo woodland) landscape
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), tropical dry forests and savannas cover over 2.5 million km(2) and support livelihoods for millions in fast-growing nations. Intensifying land use pressures have driven rapid changes in tree cover structure (basal area, biomass) that remain poorly characterized at regional scales. Here, we posed the hypothesis that tree cover structure related strongly to senesced and non-photosynthetic (NPV) vegetation features in a SSA tropical dry forest landscape, offering improved means for satellite remote sensing of tree cover structure compared to vegetation greenness-based methods. Across regrowth miombo woodland sites in Tanzania, we analyzed relationships among field data on tree structure, land cover, and satellite indices of green and NPV features based on spectral mixture analyses and normalized difference vegetation index calculated from Landsat 8 data. From satellite-field data relationships, we mapped regional basal area and biomass using NPV and greenness-based metrics, and compared map performances at landscape scales. Total canopy cover related significantly to stem basal area (r(2)= 0.815, p< 0.01) and biomass (r(2)= 0.635, p< 0.01), and NPV dominated ground cover (> 60%) at all sites. From these two conditions emerged a key inverse relationship: skyward exposure of NPV ground cover was high at sites with low tree basal area and biomass, and decreased with increasing stem basal area and biomass. This pattern scaled to Landsat NPV metrics, which showed strong inverse correlations to basal area (Pearson r= -0.85, p< 0.01) and biomass (r= -0.86, p< 0.01). Biomass estimates from Landsat NPV-based maps matched field data, and significantly differentiated landscape gradients in woody biomass that greenness metrics failed to track. The results suggest senesced vegetation metrics at Landsat scales are a promising means for improved monitoring of tree structure across disturbance and ecological gradients in African and other tropical dry forests.

TI  - Changes in Fertility at the Population Level in the Era of ART in Rural Malawi
T2  - JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: HIV reduces fertility through biological and social pathways, and antiretroviral treatment (ART) can ameliorate these effects. In northern Malawi, ART has been available since 2007 and lifelong ART is offered to all pregnant or breastfeeding HIV-positive women.Methods: Using data from the Karonga Health and Demographic Surveillance Site in Malawi from 2005 to 2014, we used total and age-specific fertility rates and Cox regression to assess associations between HIV and ART use and fertility. We also assessed temporal trends in in utero and breastfeeding HIV and ART exposure among live births.Results: From 2005 to 2014, there were 13,583 live births during approximately 78,000 person years of follow-up of women aged 1549 years. The total fertility rate in HIV-negative women decreased from 6.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.5 to 6.8] in 2005-2006 to 5.1 (4.8-5.5) in 2011-2014. In HIV-positive women, the total fertility rate was more stable, although lower, at 4.4 (3.2-6.1) in 2011-2014. In 2011-2014, compared with HIV-negative women, the adjusted (age, marital status, and education) hazard ratio was 0.7 (95% CI: 0.6 to 0.9) and 0.8 (95% CI: 0.6 to 1.0) for women on ART for at least 9 months and not (yet) on ART, respectively. The crude fertility rate increased with duration on ART up to 3 years before declining. The proportion of HIV-exposed infants decreased, but the proportion of ART-exposed infants increased from 2.4% in 2007-2010 to 3.5% in 2011-2014.Conclusions: Fertility rates in HIV-positive women are stable in the context of generally decreasing fertility. Despite a decrease in HIV-exposed infants, there has been an increase in ART-exposed infants.

TI  - A geomorphic classification of intermittently open/closed estuaries (IOCE) derived from estuaries in Victoria, Australia
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A large proportion of estuaries along microtidal wave-dominated coastlines worldwide have entrances that intermittently close to the ocean when tidal currents and fluvial discharge are insufficient to erode sediment delivered onshore by waves. In this study, these systems are termed intermittently open/closed estuaries (IOCE) in order to include all estuaries which intermittently close to the ocean. IOCE do not fit neatly into existing generalized estuary classification models and have been traditionally recognized as a single estuary type that constitute a rare subset of wave-dominated estuaries. In this study, 111 estuaries in Victoria, Australia, are used to develop a classification model that delineates between different IOCE types. This was undertaken using historic aerial imagery and quantification of the estuary channel width, catchment area, lagoon dimensions and tidal prism derived from remotely sensed data. Field surveying of entrance morphology was undertaken for a subsample of 35 IOCE characteristic of each section of the coast and which had detailed entrance condition records. Using this subset, IOCE were classified into three distinct types using multiple methods of statistical delineation (non-metric multidimensional scaling, hierarchical cluster analysis and distribution analysis). These three types are: (1) Type A, the largest IOCE which both close and open infrequently but for the longest durations; (2) Type B, medium sized IOCE which open and close several times per year for weekly to monthly durations; and (3) Type C (tidal creeks), the smallest IOCE located specifically in high rainfall, mountainous catchments and which exist in a predominantly open state. The three types of IOCE showed an order of magnitude difference in entrance closure duration as controlled by variations in the catchment area, tidal prism volume, dimensions of the estuarine lagoon and the entrance channel at the mouth. The classification is also applicable to wave-dominated coastlines internationally where IOCE are present.

TI  - Breast cancer in a patient with Kindler's syndrome
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast Cancer (BC) has associated risk factors and genetic factors like BRCA1, and BRCA2. Many benign and malignant disease processes are found concurrently with BC and believed to be additional risk factors like gall bladder stones (cholelithiasis), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular lesions, arthritis, spine and spinal cord degenerative lesions, infertility, depression, sleep disturbances, obesity, autoimmune diseases (SLE), and thyroid diseases. There are some malignant disease associations like synchronous or metachronous ovarian, colonic and endometrial tumours with Breast cancer.Kindler Syndrome (KS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder manifesting as generalized dermatoses, described in 1954 by Theresa Kindler. KS is associated with acral skin blistering inducible by trauma, mucosal inflammation, photosensitivity, progressive pigmentation, telangiectasia, and skin atrophy (Poikiloderma). Repeated and progressive inflammation and subsequent fibrosis leads to ectropion, esophageal, anal, urethral, and vaginal stenosis and dryness.About 100 cases of Kindler syndrome have been reported in literature so far some from Arab World as well. Pathobiology of Kindler syndrome is not well understood. There are defects in KIND1 gene on chromosome 20. This gene expresses itself in basal keratinocytes, where it encodes a protein, called Kindlin 1.We report the second only case of Kindler's syndrome having breast cancer. These very very rare combinations have diagnostic issues, management restrictions, prognostic and follow up implications.

TI  - Retrieval of aerosol optical properties using MERIS observations: Algorithm and some first results
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) instrument on board European Space Agency (ESA) Envisat made measurements from 2002 to 2012. Although MERIS was limited in spectral coverage, accurate Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) from MERIS data are retrieved by using appropriate additional information. We introduce a new AOT retrieval algorithm for MERIS over land surfaces, referred to as eXtensible Bremen AErosol Retrieval (XBAER). XBAER is similar to the "dark-target" (DT) retrieval algorithm used for Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in that it uses a lookup table (LUT) to match to satellite-observed reflectance and derive the AOT. Instead of a global parameterization of surface spectral reflectance, XBAER uses a set of spectral coefficients to prescribe surface properties. In this manner, XBAER is not limited to dark surfaces (vegetation) and retrieves AOT over bright surface (desert, semiarid, and urban areas). Preliminary validation of the MERIS-derived AOT and the ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements yield good agreement, the resulting regression equation is y = (0.92x +/- 0.07) + (0.05 +/- 0.01) and Pearson correlation coefficient of R = 0.78. Global monthly means of AOT have been compared from XBAER, MODIS and other satellite derived datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Cloud masking algorithm for the XBAER aerosol retrieval using MERIS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine aerosol optical thickness, AOT, and other geophysical parameters describing conditions in the atmosphere and at the earth's surface by inversion of remote sensing measurements from space based instrumentation, it is necessary to separate ground scenes into cloud free and cloudy or cloud contaminated. Identifying the presence of cloud in a ground scene and establishing an accurate and adequate cloud mask is a challenging task. In this study, measurements by the European Space Agency (ESA) MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) have been used to develop a cloud identification and cloud mask algorithm for preprocessing prior to application of the new algorithm called eXtensible Bremen AErosol Retrieval (XBAER), which retrieves AOT. The new XBAER cloud identification and cloud mask algorithm is called XBAER-CM. This uses thresholds of the reflectance and reflectance ratios measured by MERIS at Top Of Atmosphere (TOA). In this study the parameters used to determine the presence of cloud in ground scenes are i) the brightness of the scenes, ii) the homogeneity or variability of the radiance and iii) cloud height or altitude information. The threshold values used to identify the presence of cloud are selected by using accurate radiative transfer modeling with different surface and atmospheric scenarios. A histogram analysis has been used for different cloud (thin, thick, two-layers, aerosol contaminated cloud), aerosol (dust and biomass burning) and surface scenarios (vegetation, urban, desert and water). Additionally, a snow/ice detection algorithm has been adapted from MerIs Cloud fRation fOr Sciamachy (MICROS) algorithm.A validation for the resulting cloud mask data products has been undertaken. This comprised i) comparison of regions scenes, which have beenmanually generated by experts and ii) more global comparisonwith cloud identification data products from surface synoptic observations (SYNOP) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). As a part of verification and validation, the XBAER-CM results have been shown to be in good agreement with the "manually"-created masks, considered to be the true reference for a set of challenging scenarios. The overall accuracy compared with SYNOP and CALIOP are 84.4% and 83.2%, respectively. The XBAER-CM data product is a standalone data product but valuable for use with algorithms, which retrieve other cloud, aerosol and surface parameters from the measurements of MERIS and the follow on instruments such as Sentinel 3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) now in space.

TI  - High-Temporal-Resolution High-Spatial-Resolution Spaceborne SAR Based on Continuously Varying PRF
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a well-established and powerful imaging technique for acquiring high-spatial-resolution images of the Earth's surface. With the development of beam steering techniques, sliding spotlight and staring spotlight modes have been employed to support high-spatial-resolution applications. In addition to this strengthened high-spatial-resolution and wide-swath capability, high-temporal-resolution (short repeat-observation interval) represents a key capability for numerous applications. However, conventional SAR systems are limited in that the same patch can only be illuminated for several seconds within a single pass. This paper considers a novel high-squint-angle system intended to acquire high-spatial-resolution spaceborne SAR images with repeat-observation intervals varying from tens of seconds to several minutes within a single pass. However, an exponentially increased range cell migration would arise and lead to a conflict between the receive window and 'blind ranges'. An efficient data acquisition technique for high-temporal-resolution, high-spatial-resolution and high-squint-angle spaceborne SAR, in which the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is continuously varied according to the changing slant range, is presented in this paper. This technique allows echo data to remain in the receive window instead of conflicting with the transmitted pulse or nadir echo. Considering the precision of hardware, a compromise and practical strategy is also proposed. Furthermore, a detailed performance analysis of range ambiguities is provided with respect to parameters of TerraSAR-X. For strong point-like targets, the range ambiguity of this technique would be better than that of uniform PRF technique. For this innovative technique, a resampling strategy and modified imaging algorithm have been developed to handle the non-uniformly sampled echo data. Simulations are performed to validate the efficiency of the proposed technique and the associated imaging algorithm.

TI  - Outcomes after Mastectomy and Lumpectomy in Octogenarians and Nonagenarians with Early-Stage Breast Cancer
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - Prospective studies have shown equal outcomes after mastectomy or breast conservation in patients with invasive breast cancer; however, many of these studies excluded elderly patients. We identified patients in their eighties and nineties with clinical stage 0 to II breast cancer undergoing mastectomy or lumpectomy with or without radiation from the prospective sentinel lymph node database atWake Forest Baptist Health and analyzed their treatment and survival. Of 92 patients, 24 (26.1%) underwent mastectomy, 22 (23.9%) lumpectomy with radiation, and 46 (50.0%) lumpectomy alone. Significant differences were noted in tumor size (P = 0.018), nodal status (P = 0.013), and stage (P = 0.011) between the groups. Only 7.6 per cent of patients had chemotherapy, whereas 51.1 per cent took antiestrogen therapy. Recurrence occurred in 11 patients. In univariate analysis, overall survival did not differ by surgery. Age was the only factor that increased risk of death (HR = 1.19, P = 0.028). In this age group, neither tumor factors nor the type of local treatment significantly influenced overall survival. Octogenarians and nonagenarians with early-stage breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving surgery with or without radiation have equivalent survival to patients having a mastectomy.

TI  - Study on Regional Variations of Aerosol Loading Using Long Term Satellite Data Over Indian Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based measurements of aerosols are one of the most effective ways to understand the role of aerosols in climate in terms of spatial and temporal variability. In the present study, we attempted to analyse spatial and temporal variations of satellite derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) over Indian region using moderate resolution imaging spectrometer over a period of 2001-2011. Due to its vast spatial extent, Indian region and adjacent oceanic regions are divided into different zones for analysis. The land mass is sub divided into five different zones such as Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP), Indian mainland, North Eastern India (NE), South India-1 (SI-1), South India-2 (SI-2). Oceanic areas are divided into Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. Arabian Sea is further divided as three zones viz. Northern AS (NAS), Central AS (CAS) and Eastern AS (EAS) zones. Bay of Bengal is divided as North BoB (NBoB), West BoB (WBoB), Central BoB (CBoB), and East BoB (EBoB). The study revealed that among all the land regions, IGP showed the highest peak AOD value (0.52 +/- 0.17) while SI-2 showed the lower values of AOD in all the months compared to all India average. The maximum AOD is observed during premonsoon season for all regions. During the winter, average AOD levels were substantially lower than the summer averages. Peak of aerosol loading (0.35 +/- 0.159) is observed in March over NE region, whereas in all other regions, peak is observed during May. Frequency distribution of long term AOD (< 0.2, 0.3-0.5, > 0.5) shows a shift of frequency distribution of AOD from < 0.3 to 0.3-0.5 during the study period in all regions except IGP. In IGP shift of frequency of AOD values occurs from 0.3-0.5 to > 0.5. Oceanic areas also shows seasonal variation of AOD. Over Arabian Sea, high AOD values with greater variations were observed in summer monsoon season while in Bay of Bengal it is observed during winter monsoon. This is due to the high wind speed prevailing in Arabian Sea during monsoon season which results in production of more sea salt aerosol. Highest AOD values are observed over NAS during monsoon season and over NBOB during winter season. Lowest AOD values with its lower variations observed in both the central region of Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal.

TI  - Spread of <i>Dermacentor reticulatus</i> is associated with the loss of forest area
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in tick distribution and abundance are among the main drivers of the (re)emergence of transmitted pathogens. We aimed to uncover the reasons of the reported spread of Dermacentor reticulatus in Poland using a variety of proxies of environmental features, ground-measured temperature and remotely-sensed data of temperature and vegetation. Ground-measured temperature was recorded in 2013-2014, in sites where D. reticulatus presence (n = 16) or absence (n = 16) was confirmed. We specifically aimed to test whether changes in phenology of vegetation and the length of the growing season were correlated with field-derived data regarding the presence/absence of D. reticulatus. We also used categorical descriptions of the habitat to capture the vegetation patterns that might delineate the distribution of the tick. We demonstrated that temperature, phenology of vegetation and length of growing season have no correlation with the occurrence of D. reticulatus in Poland. There is, however, a clear association between the trends of the loss of forests and the presence of the tick. This parameter was two times higher at sites colonized by D. reticulatus in comparison to the sites where the population of the tick is not yet established. A spatial analysis demonstrated that the preferred territories for D. reticulatus are those of a highly fragmented landscape within a large patch of homogeneous vegetation, in the vicinity of permanent water courses or reservoirs.

TI  - Assessment of using recombinant <i>Ixodes ricinus</i> AV422 saliva protein for confirmation of tick bites in hunting dogs as naturally infested hosts
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the recorded spreading of ticks in past years, a higher incidence of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) can be expected in the future in endemic areas, but can also pose an emerging public health concern in areas where they have not yet been recognized. Assessment of the exposure of vulnerable hosts to ticks would be a very helpful tool for TBD epidemiological studies, as well as for their proper managing. To confirm previous tick bites, the method of choice is detection of antibodies in host serum as markers developed against injected tick saliva proteins during feeding. We recently showed that the recombinant form of Ixodes ricinus AV422 saliva protein (rIrAV422) can serve for detection of markers in experimentally infested rats. Here we examine whether it can be used in the same manner in naturally exposed hosts. We chose hunting dogs as good sentinel animals. The study group consisted of 15 dogs that varied in breed, age, sex, previous tick infestation history and repellent treatment. Western blot analysis with rIrAV422 as an antigen confirmed the presence of tick bite markers in all analysed dogs. For some of the dogs, their previous tick infestation history was unclear, which emphasizes the usefulness of rIrAV422 for revealing it. Since hunting dogs are naturally infested with different ticks, the potential of rIrAV422 in assessment of general exposure to ticks is highlighted. Use of rIrAV422 can also be helpful in veterinary practice and research as a tool for validation of the efficiency of tick repellent products.

TI  - Land degradation analysis of mine-impacted zone of Kolubara in Serbia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the effect of land-use changes on land degradation by utilization of remote sensing methods and the Gavrilovic erosion potential method, due to surface mining activities in the period 2001-2011. Studied area includes the zone of influence of the Rudarski basen Kolubara, which covers the exploitation area of the Kolubara coal basin in the Republic of Serbia. The analysis is based on the processing of Landsat 5 satellite images from 2001 and 2011. In the analysis of satellite images, the supervised classification method was used. The results suggest that the observed spatial-temporal area is exposed to erosion as a result of land-use changes. Preliminary conclusion is that the dominant anthropogenic factor, responsible for changes in land use, is pronounced through the mining activity, industrialization, construction as well as agricultural activities. Very small changes in land use that occurred in the period 2001-2010 have led to relatively small amount of change from the aspect of land degradation. Also, due to the planned exploitation of the mine which included into account the sustainability of ecosystems, primarily through appropriate conservation measures, RB Kolubara is not in danger of a possible erosion processes that could undermine the stability of the basin.

TI  - Developing the Science Product Algorithm Testbed for Chinese Next-Generation Geostationary Meteorological Satellites: Fengyun-4 Series
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-4A (FY-4A), the first of the Chinese next-generation geostationary meteorological satellites, launched in 2016, offers several advances over the FY-2: more spectral bands, faster imaging, and infrared hyperspectral measurements. To support the major objective of developing the prototypes of FY-4 science algorithms, two science product algorithm testbeds for imagers and sounders have been developed by the scientists in the FY-4 Algorithm Working Group (AWG). Both testbeds, written in FORTRAN and C programming languages for Linux or UNIX systems, have been tested successfully by using Intel/g compilers. Some important FY-4 science products, including cloud mask, cloud properties, and temperature profiles, have been retrieved successfully through using a proxy imager, Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), and sounder data, obtained from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder, thus demonstrating their robustness. In addition, in early 2016, the FY-4 AWG was developed based on the imager testbed-a near real-time processing system for Himawari-8/AHI data for use by Chinese weather forecasters. Consequently, robust and flexible science product algorithm testbeds have provided essential and productive tools for popularizing FY-4 data and developing substantial improvements in FY-4 products.

TI  - Managing Groin Wounds after Infrainguinal Vascular Procedures: Examining the Reoperative Events and Complication Profile of Muscle Flap Reconstruction
T2  - ANNALS OF VASCULAR SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The literature has been void of large outcome studies detailing the efficacy and complication profile of muscle flap reconstruction of complex groin wounds. Furthermore, a first-line choice for muscle flap selection remains unclear. The aim of this study is 2-fold: (1) to examine the complication profile and associated risk factors following muscle flap coverage and (2) to provide a compared efficacy analysis of the sartorius muscle flap (SMF) versus the rectus femoris flap (RFF) in the treatment of wounds following an infrainguinal vascular procedure.Methods: A retrospective review of records was performed on all patients undergoing complex groin wound reconstruction from January 2005 to September 2014.Results: A total of 201 flaps were performed on 184 patients. There were no sentinel bleeding events through the course of graft salvage or perioperative morbidity beyond local wound complications. Coronary artery disease (P = 0.049), dyslipidemia (P < 0.001), diabetes (P = 0.047), and history of multiple prior infrainguinal procedures (P = 0.029) were associated with increased complications following groin wound reconstruction. There was no statistically significant difference in complications in comparing the RFF versus the SMF (27.9% vs. 38.9% respectively; P = 0.109). There was no significant difference in the rates of graft salvage in comparing the RFF versus the SMF (21.6% vs. 16.1%, respectively; P = 0.459).Conclusions: Muscle flap coverage can be safely employed for vascular graft salvage. Medical comorbidities and multiple prior infrainguinal procedures are predictive of perioperative complications. The SMF and RFF demonstrated equivocal rates of complications and graft salvage. Given that the RFF risks increased functional morbidity and necessitates a second donor site, the SMF may be considered as an effective first-line approach for reconstruction of complex groin wounds.

TI  - Novel Decomposition Scheme for Characterizing Urban Air Quality with MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban air pollution is one of the most widespread global sustainability problems. Previous research has studied growth or fall of particulate matter (PM) levels using on-ground monitoring stations in urban regions. However, studying this worldwide is difficult because most cities do not have sufficient infrastructure to monitor air quality. Thus, satellite data is increasingly being employed to solve this limitation. In this paper, we use 16 years (2001-2016) of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (a) datasets, retrieved from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensors on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Terra satellite to study air quality over 60 locations globally. We propose a novel technique, called AirRGB decomposition, to characterize urban air quality by decomposing AOD and a retrievals into 'components' of three distinct scenarios. In the AirRGB decomposition method, using AOD and a dataset three scenarios were investigated: 'R'-high a and high AOD, 'G'-high a and low AOD, and 'B'-low a and low AOD values. These scenarios were mapped and quantified over a triangular red, green and blue color scale. This visualization easily segregates regions having a high concentration of industrial aerosol from only natural aerosols. Our analysis indicates that a sharp divide exists between North American and European cities and Asian cities in terms of baseline pollution and slopes of R and G trends. We found that while pollution in cities in China has started to decrease (e.g., since 2011 for Beijing), it continues to increase in South Asia and Southeast Asia. e.g., R offset of Beijing and New Delhi was 54.98 and 50.43 respectively but R slope was 0.04 and 0.08 respectively. High offset (>= 45) and slope (>= 0.025) of B for New York, Tokyo, Sydney and Sao Paolo shows that they have clean air, which is still getting better.

TI  - Impact of bias-corrected reanalysis-derived lateral boundary conditions on WRF simulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lateral and lower boundary conditions derived from a suitable global reanalysis data set form the basis for deriving a dynamically consistent finer resolution downscaled product for climate and hydrological assessment studies. A problem with this, however, is that systematic biases have been noted to be present in the global reanalysis data sets that form these boundaries, biases which can be carried into the downscaled simulations thereby reducing their accuracy or efficacy. In this work, three Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model downscaling experiments are undertaken to investigate the impact of bias correcting European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecasting Reanalysis ERA-Interim (ERA-I) atmospheric temperature and relative humidity using Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) satellite data. The downscaling is performed over a domain centered over southern Africa between the years 2003 and 2012. The sample mean and the mean as well as standard deviation at each grid cell for each variable are used for bias correction. The resultant WRF simulations of near-surface temperature and precipitation are evaluated seasonally and annually against global gridded observational data sets and compared with ERA-I reanalysis driving field. The study reveals inconsistencies between the impact of the bias correction prior to downscaling and the resultant model simulations after downscaling. Mean and standard deviation bias-corrected WRF simulations are, however, found to be marginally better than mean only bias-corrected WRF simulations and raw ERA-I reanalysis-driven WRF simulations. Performances, however, differ when assessing different attributes in the downscaled field. This raises questions about the efficacy of the correction procedures adopted.

TI  - MGB-IPH model for hydrological and hydraulic simulation of large floodplain river systems coupled with open source GIS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale hydrological models are useful tools for water resources studies, however, river network flow routing is generally represented using simplified methods, which may lead to simulation errors in flat regions. We present recent improvements to the large-scale hydrological model MGB-IPH to improve its capability of simulating large river basins with extensive floodplains. We also describe the coupling of MGB-IPH to an open source GIS and a large set of developed pre-processing tools with a user-friendly interface for remote sensing data preparation and output visualization. The new features implemented are demonstrated applying the model to the whole Araguaia river basin (380,000 km(2)). Results are compared to the previous MGB-IPH routing method, observed flow and water level data and remote sensing imagery, showing improvement in the representation of floodplain inundation dynamics. The test case also shows that the proposed model software framework amplifies possibilities of large-scale simulation of ungauged basins. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The goal of regional treatments in breast cancer should be to eradicate any disease within lymph nodes, avoid regional recurrences, minimize the risk of distant metastases, and improve survival. In addition, regional treatments should focus on reducing potential morbidities and optimizing the long-term quality of life of breast cancer survivors. While data from recent surgical and radiation trials have helped clarify many issues regarding regional treatment, there still remains controversy as to the optimal approach for patients with "intermediate risk" disease. Two large radiation oncology studies (MA.20 and EORTC2292-10925) evaluated whether more extensive lymphatic treatment benefited patients with higher-risk lymph node-negative, or lower risk lymph node-positive disease. A meta-analysis of these two studies suggested that the addition of regional nodal irradiation (RNI) to the level III axillary, supraclavicular and upper internal mammary lymph nodes conferred an improvement in disease free survival and distant metastasis free survival as well as a 1-2% overall survival advantage. However, other studies have suggested that many patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes who are treated with breast conservation including breast irradiation may safely avoid the morbidity and costs of further axillary treatment (whether surgical or radiotherapy-based). In general, patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes or high-risk, node negative stage II breast cancer represent a diverse population who require individualized, rather than group-based, risk assessment when considering RNI. This article will propose a strategic methodology to assess the modern day breast cancer patient's need for RNI in the setting of changing surgical, radiation, and systemic therapies.

TI  - Near-infrared fluorescence with indocyanine green for diagnostics in urology: initial experience.
T2  - Urologia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green is used in urology for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes and identification of prostate margins in radical prostatectomy for delineation of resection zone and selective clamping of vessels in partial nephrectomy; for identification and evaluation of length of ureteral strictures; for assessment of perfusion and viability of anastomoses during reconstructive stage of cystectomy. Safety of this technique is proven, while its diagnostic value and usefulness is still controversial.METHODS: This pilot study of using the SPY Elite Fluorescence Imaging System for diagnostics was performed in the I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University. Ten patients were enrolled: four patients underwent retropubic RP and lymph node dissection, five patients underwent partial nephrectomy, and one patient underwent ureteroplasty. Fluorophore was injected transrectally with TRUS guidance during RP in order to assess the lymph nodes. During partial nephrectomy, the compound was injected intravenously to differentiate the tumor from parenchyma by its blood supply. During ureteroplasty, the indocyanine green solution was injected into the renal pelvis to dye the ureter and locate the stricture.RESULTS: Sensitivity of this technique for visualization of sentinel lymph nodes was 100%, and specificity was 73.3%. In patients who underwent partial nephrectomy, all lesions were malignant and hypofluorescent when compared with healthy parenchyma. SPY allowed us to determine the location and extension of the stricture during ureteroplasty. No hypersensitivity reactions or complications were observed during injection of the compound.

AB  - In the setting of increased awareness regarding the need to address potential overtreatment in the management of breast cancer patients with favorable-prognosis disease, this article reviews three relevant instances in which the extent of surgery has been safely decreased: margin width in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ; axillary management in clinically node-negative women undergoing primary breast-conserving surgery; and the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by sentinel node biopsy for patients presenting with node-positive breast cancer. The management of the axillary nodes over the past decade highlights the potential to de-escalate surgery in the era of multimodality therapy. Similar opportunities exist for the use of radiotherapy. To fully realize the potential of de-escalating surgery, new communication strategies must be developed to convince patients that bigger is not necessarily better. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Quality of Life Following Sentinel Node Biopsy for Primary Cutaneous Melanoma: Health Economic Implications
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is commonly performed in contemporary melanoma management, however there is a paucity of long-term quality of life (QoL) estimates required for economic evaluation of this treatment.Methods. A single-center, prospective, cross-sectional study of adults with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I/II/IIIA melanoma of the limbs, trunk, or neck who had undergone wide excision and SNB, but not complete regional node dissection, was undertaken. Limb volume was measured using perometry, with lymphedema defined as a >= 10% volume increase in the ipsilateral limb compared with the contralateral limb. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) questionnaire measured QoL. Associations between patient and treatment characteristics were assessed using linear regression.Result. Among 694 patients (median time from SNB of 37 months), 14 (2%) had objectively measured lymphedema (i.e. an increase in limb volume of >= 10%). Of 687 stage I/II patients with complete QoL data, the mean weighted QoL was 0.745 (standard deviation 0.04) on a 0-1 scale (i.e. death to full health). In multivariable analysis, weighted QoL was 0.0004 higher for each year of increasing age (p = 0.001); 0.011 lower for females (p = 0.001), 0.018 lower following post-SNB limb trauma (p = 0.002); 0.252 lower for patients who perceived a large increase in limb size (p = 0.015); and 0.027 lower with self-reported difficulty in walking, running, or climbing stairs (p = 0.043).Conclusions. Our data suggest that very few patients treated at our institution had lymphedema in the long-term following SNB, with weighted QoL strongly associated with perceived rather than actual changes in limb size.

TI  - An Accuracy Assessment of Derived Digital Elevation Models from Terrestrial Laser Scanning in a Sub-Tropical Forested Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest structure attributes produced from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) rely on normalisation of the point cloud values from sensor coordinates to height above ground. One method to do this is through the derivation of an accurate and repeatable digital elevation model (DEM) from the TLS point cloud that is used to adjust the height. The primary aim of this paper was to test a number of TLS scan configurations, filtering options and output DEM grid resolutions (from 0.02 m to 1.0 m) to define a best practice method for DEM generation in sub-tropical forest environments. The generated DEMs were compared to both total station (TS) spot heights and a 1-m DEM generated from airborne laser scanning (ALS) to assess accuracy. The comparison to TS spot heights found that a DEM produced using the minimum elevation (minimum Z value) from a point cloud derived from a single scan had mean errors > 1 m for DEM grid resolutions < 0.2 m at a 25-m plot radius. At a 1-m grid resolution, the mean error was 0.19 m. The addition of a filtering approach that combined a median filter with a progressive morphological filter and a global percentile filter was able to reduce mean error of the 0.02-m grid resolution DEM to 0.31 m at a 25-m plot radius using all returns. Using multiple scan positions to derive the DEM reduced the mean error for all DEM methods. Our results suggest that a simple minimum Z filtering DEM method using a single scan at the grid resolution of 1 m can produce mean errors < 0.2 m, but for a small grid resolution, such as 0.02 m, a more complex filtering approach and multiple scan positions are required to reduced mean errors. The additional validation data provided by the 1-m ALS DEM showed that when using the combined filtering method on a point cloud derived from a single scan at the plot centre, errors between 0.1 and 0.5 m occurred in the TLS DEM for all tested grid resolutions at a plot radius of 25 m. These findings present a protocol for DEM production from TLS data at a range of grid resolutions and provide an overview of factors affecting DEMs produced from single and multiple TLS scan positions.

TI  - Multiobjective Genetic Optimization of Terrain-Independent RFMs for VHSR Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) biases and over-fitting phenomenon are two major issues in terrain-independent rational function models. These problems degrade the accuracy of extracted spatial information from very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite images. This study particularly focused on overcoming the over-fitting problem through an optimal term selection approach. To this end, multiobjective genetic algorithm was used in order to optimize three effective objective functions: the RMSE of ground control points (GCPs), the number, and the distribution of both RPCs and GCPs. Finally, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution, as an efficient multicriteria decision-making method, was applied to select the best solution, i.e., the optimum terms of RPCs, through the ranking of solutions in the optimum set. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by using three VHSR images acquired by GeoEye-1, Worldview-3, and Pleiades satellite sensors. Experimental results show that subpixel accuracy can be nearly achieved in all data sets, when over-fitting problem is addressed. The optimal selected terms leaded to a significant improvement compared to the original RPCs. Indeed, our method, which is independent of GCPs distribution, not only requires a small number of GCPs, but also leads to a 30% to 75% improvement when compared to the original RPCs. This improvement in VHSR images, usually makes no more need to remove the RPCs biases.

TI  - Estimating Daily Reference Evapotranspiration in a Semi-Arid Region Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating daily evapotranspiration is challenging when ground observation data are not available or scarce. Remote sensing can be used to estimate the meteorological data necessary for calculating reference evapotranspiration ETo. Here, we assessed the accuracy of daily ETo estimates derived from remote sensing (ETo-RS) compared with those derived from four ground-based stations (ETo-G) in Kurdistan (Iraq) over the period 2010-2014. Near surface air temperature, relative humidity and cloud cover fraction were derived from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder/Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AIRS/AMSU), and wind speed at 10 m height from MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application). Four methods were used to estimate ETo: Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Jensen-Haise (JH), McGuinness-Bordne (MB) and the FAO Penman Monteith equation (PM). ETo-G (PM) was adopted as the main benchmark. HS underestimated ETo by 2%-3% (R-2 = 0.86 to 0.90; RMSE = 0.95 to 1.2 mm day 1 at different stations). JH and MB overestimated ETo by 8% to 40% (R-2 = 0.85 to 0.92; RMSE from 1.18 to 2.18 mm day(-1)). The annual average values of ETo estimated using RS data and ground-based data were similar to one another reflecting low bias in daily estimates. They ranged between 1153 and 1893 mm year(-1) for ETo-G and between 1176 and 1859 mm year 1 for ETo-RS for the different stations. Our results suggest that ETo-RS (HS) can yield accurate and unbiased ETo estimates for semi-arid regions which can be usefully employed in water resources management.

TI  - Sea State Observation through a Three-Antenna Hybrid XT/AT InSAR Configuration: A Preliminary Study Based on the InSAeS4 Airborne System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we investigate the sea surface monitoring capabilities of a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system equipped with a three-antenna hybrid Across Track (XT)/Along Track (AT) inteferometric configuration. To do this, we focus on the X-Band airborne InSAeS4 SAR system. Moreover, we propose a simple but effective methodology that allows simultaneous retrieval of the sea surface height and velocity by means of a straightforward, easy-to-implement, linear inversion procedure, which is very general and can be implemented with any system equipped with a three-antenna hybrid XT/AT Interferometric SAR (InSAR) configuration. In our case, we present an experiment carried out in January 2013 in South Italy over the coastline stretch of the Campania region including the Volturno River outlet. In this regard, we highlight that in situ measurements of the retrieved sea surface height and velocity at the time of the airborne mission are unfortunately not available. Notwithstanding, the obtained results show some interesting evidence that the estimated quantities are physically sound. This, on the one side, provides a preliminary validation of the effectiveness of the overall presented methodology and, on the other side, highlights the potentialities of the three-antenna hybrid XT/AT InSAR configuration of the InSAeS4 system for sea state monitoring.

TI  - Impact of Time Between Diagnosis and SLNB on Outcomes in Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypothetically, delay between melanoma diagnosis and SLNB could affect outcomes, either adversely by allowing growth and dissemination of metastases, or beneficially by allowing development of an anti-melanoma immune response. Available data are conflicting about the effect of SLNB delay on patient survival. Our objective was to determine whether delay between initial diagnosis and SLNB affects outcomes in patients with cutaneous melanoma.STUDY DESIGN: We performed query and analysis of a large prospectively maintained database of patients with primary cutaneous melanomas undergoing SLNB. An independent dataset from MSLT-1 (Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial-1) was used for validation. Primary outcomes included disease-free survival and melanoma-specific survival.RESULTS: Early and delayed SLNB were defined as less than 30 and 30 or more days from initial diagnosis, respectively. There were 2,483 patients that met inclusion criteria. Positive sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 17.4% (n = 432). Among all patients, 42% had SLNB 30 or more days after diagnosis and 37% of positive sentinel lymph nodes were at 30 or more days. No differences in sex, anatomic site, or histopathologic features were identified between the 2 groups. There was no difference in melanoma-specific survival or diseasefree survival between those undergoing early or delayed SLNB. Examination of MSLT-1 trial data similarly demonstrated no difference in survival outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: This, the largest study on this subject to date, found no adverse impact on long-term clinical outcomes of patients due to delay of SLNB beyond 30 days. The MSLT-1 data confirm this result. Patients can be reassured that if the operation is performed 30 or more days after diagnosis, it will not cause harm.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation of Turbidity Based on Landsat 8 OLI in Cam Ranh Bay and Thuy Trieu Lagoon, Vietnam
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, seagrass beds in Cam Ranh Bay and Thuy Trieu Lagoon have declined from 800 to 550 hectares, resulting insignificantly reducing the number of fish catch. This phenomenon is due to the effect of the degradation of water environment. Turbidity is one of the most important water quality parameters directly related to underwater light penetration which affects the primary productivity. This study aims to investigate spatiotemporal variation of turbidity in the waters with major factors affecting its patterns using remote sensing data. An algorithm for turbidity retrieval was developed based on the correlation between in situ measurements and a red band of Landsat 8 OLI with R-2 = 0.84 (p < 0.05). Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model was used to compute bed shear stress, a major factor affecting turbidity in shallow waters. In addition, the relationships between turbidity and rainfall, and bed shear stress induced by wind were analyzed. It was found that: (1) In the dry season, turbidity was low at the middle of the bay while it was high in shallow waters nearby coastlines. Resuspension of bed sediment was a major factor controlling turbidity during time with no rainfall. (2) In the rainy season or for a short time after rainfall in the dry season, turbidity was high due to a large amount of runoff entering into the study area.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Biomass Patterns across Northeast China Based on Allometric Scale Relationship
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops a modeling framework for utilizing the large footprint LiDAR waveform data from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard NASA's Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MODIS) imagery, meteorological data, and forest measurements for monitoring stocks of total biomass (including aboveground biomass and root biomass). The forest tree height models were separately used according to the artificial neural network (ANN) and the allometric scaling and resource limitation (ASRL) tree height models which can both combine the climate data and satellite data to predict forest tree heights. Based on the allometric approach, the forest aboveground biomass model was developed from the field measured aboveground biomass data and the tree heights derived from two tree height models. Then, the root biomass should scale with the aboveground biomass. To investigate whether this approach is efficient for estimating forest total biomass, we used Northeast China as the object of study. Our results generally proved that the method proposed in this study could be meaningful for forest total biomass estimation (R-2 = 0.699, RMSE = 55.86).

TI  - Detection and accuracy of landslide movement by InSAR analysis using PALSAR-2 data
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis is a radar technique for generating large-area maps of ground deformation using differences in the phase of microwaves returning to a satellite. In recent years, high-resolution SAR sensors have been developed that enable small-scale slope deformation to be detected, such as the partial block movement of a landslide. The L-band SAR (PALSAR-2) is mounted on Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2), which was launched on 24 Mar. 2014. Its main improvements compared with ALOS are enhanced resolution of as high as 3 m with a high-frequency recurrence period (14 days). Owing to its high resolution and the use of the L-band, PALSAR-2 can obtain reflective data passing through a tree canopy surface, unlike the other synthetic aperture radars. Therefore, the coherence of InSAR in mountainous forest areas is less likely to decrease, making it advantageous for the extraction of slope movement. In this study, to verify the accuracy of InSAR analysis using PALSAR-2 data, we compared the results of InSAR analysis and the measurement of the displacement in a landslide by global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observation. It was found that the average difference between the displacements obtained by InSAR analysis and the field measurements by GNSS was only 15.1 mm in the slant range direction, indicating the high accuracy of InSAR analysis. Many of the areas detected by InSAR analysis corresponded to the locations of surface changes due to landslide activity. Additionally, in the areas detected by InSAR analysis using multiple datasets, the ground changes due to landslide movement were confirmed by site investigation.

TI  - Polychlorinated Biphenyl-Related Alterations of the Expression of Essential Genes in Harbour Seals (<i>Phoca vitulina</i>) from Coastal Sites in Canada and the United States
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As long-lived marine mammals found throughout the temperate coastal waters of the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) have become an invaluable sentinel of food-web contamination. Their relatively high trophic position predisposes harbour seals to the accumulation of harmful levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). We obtained skin/blubber biopsy samples from live-captured young harbour seals from various sites in the northeastern Pacific (British Columbia, Canada, and Washington State, USA) as well as the northwestern Atlantic (Newfoundland and Quebec, Canada). We developed harbour seal-specific primers to investigate the potential impact of POP exposure on the expression of eight important genes. We found correlations between the blubber mRNA levels of three of our eight target genes and the dominant persistent organic pollutant in seals [polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)] including estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1: r(2) = 0.12, p = 0.038), thyroid hormone receptor alpha (Thra: r(2) = 0.16; p = 0.028), and glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1: r(2) = 0.12; p = 0.049). Age, sex, weight, and length were not confounding factors on the expression of genes. Although the population-level consequences are unclear, our results suggest that PCBs are associated with alterations of the expression of genes responsible for aspects of metabolism, growth and development, and immune function. Collectively, these results provide additional support for the use of harbour seals as indicators of coastal food-web contamination.

TI  - European Starlings (<i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>) As Sentinels of Urban Air Pollution: A Comprehensive Approach from Noninvasive to Post Mortem Investigation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban, traffic-related air pollution remains a concern to healthcare and environmental professionals, with mounting evidence connecting diverse disease conditions with exposure. Wildlife species such as European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) cohabit urban neighborhoods and may serve as sentinels for these contaminants. In this novel approach, we use passive, personal-type air samplers to provide site-specific measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes, or BTEX), and account for the effects of confounding environmental factors when teasing out the responses to exposure. This study examines biomarkers of exposure to predominately traffic-related, urban air contaminants in European starlings, including morphometric measurements, immunotoxicology, oxidative stress and hepatic detoxification, and analyses responses in the context of multi layered factors including year, hatch date, weather and location, confirming that this experimental approach and the selected health indicators can be used for contaminants. comparing locations with different levels of contaminants.

TI  - Cross-Calibration between ASTER and MODIS Visible to Near-Infrared Bands for Improvement of ASTER Radiometric Calibration
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric cross-calibration between the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and the Terra-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been partially used to derive the ASTER radiometric calibration coefficient (RCC) curve as a function of date on visible to near-infrared bands. However, cross-calibration is not sufficiently accurate, since the effects of the differences in the sensor's spectral and spatial responses are not fully mitigated. The present study attempts to evaluate radiometric consistency across two sensors using an improved cross-calibration algorithm to address the spectral and spatial effects and derive cross-calibration-based RCCs, which increases the ASTER calibration accuracy. Overall, radiances measured with ASTER bands 1 and 2 are on averages 3.9% and 3.6% greater than the ones measured on the same scene with their MODIS counterparts and ASTER band 3N (nadir) is 0.6% smaller than its MODIS counterpart in current radiance/reflectance products. The percentage root mean squared errors (%RMSEs) between the radiances of two sensors are 3.7, 4.2, and 2.3 for ASTER band 1, 2, and 3N, respectively, which are slightly greater or smaller than the required ASTER radiometric calibration accuracy (4%). The uncertainty of the cross-calibration is analyzed by elaborating the error budget table to evaluate the International System of Units (SI)-traceability of the results. The use of the derived RCCs will allow further reduction of errors in ASTER radiometric calibration and subsequently improve interoperability across sensors for synergistic applications.

TI  - New method of indocyanine green fluorescence sentinel node mapping for early gastric cancer.
T2  - Annals of medicine and surgery (2012)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study describes the retrospective feasibility study of ICG fluorescence SN mapping in back-table for early gastric cancer using PINPOINT.METHOD: SN mapping were performed as following; the day before surgery, 0.5ml ICG was injected endoscopically in four quadrants of the submucosa surrounding the gastric cancer using an endoscopic puncture. Intraoperatively, the gastrocolic ligament was divided to visualize all possible directions of lymphatic flow from the stomach. PINPOINT (NOVADAQ, Canada) was used to illuminate regional lymph nodes from the serosal side. Positive staining was confirmed by at least 3 surgeons and an endoscopist during surgery (Figure1). Lymph node dissection and gastrectomy were performed according to the criteria of gastric cancer treatment guidelines of JGCA.RESULT: All 6 patients had gastrectomy with laparoscopic approach. ICG positive lymphatic flow and lymph nodes were able to be observed in all the patients. Final pathological diagnosis was all StageI and curative resection. All the patients had ICG positive lymphatic area in left gastric artery (LGA) area. Two patients with tumor located in L area had ICG positive flow to right gastroepipoloic artery (RGEA) area. The mean of ICG positive lymph nodes was 8.6. One patient had a metastatic lymph node in station No.4, which was positive for ICG.CONCLUSION: Our method made identification of ICG positive lymph nodes easy in SN mapping in back-table under room light. Although further accumulation and analysis are necessary, we may be able to apply this method for intraoperative SN mapping of laparoscopic gastric cancer surgey.

TI  - Automated Generation of Lakes and Reservoirs Water Elevation Changes From Satellite Radar Altimetry
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited access to in-situ water level data for lakes and reservoirs have been a major setback for regional and global studies of reservoirs, surface water storage changes, and monitoring the hydrologic cycle. Processing satellite radar altimetry data over inland water bodies on a large scale has been a cumbersome task primarily due to the removal of contaminated measurements as a result of surrounding land. In this study, we proposed a new algorithm to automatically generate time series from raw satellite radar altimetry data without user intervention. With this method, users with a little knowledge on the field can now independently process radar altimetry for diverse applications. The method is based on K-means clustering, interquartile range, and statistical analysis of the dataset for outlier detection. Jason-2 and Envisat radar altimetry data were used to demonstrate the capability of this algorithm. A total of 37 satellite crossings over 30 lakes and reservoirs located in the U.S., Brazil, and Nigeria were used based on the availability of in-situ data. We compared the results against in-situ data and root-mean-square error values ranged from 0.09 to 1.20 m. We also confirmed the potential of this algorithm over rivers and wetlands using the southern Congo River and Everglades wetlands in Florida, respectively. Finally, the different retracking algorithms in Envisat; Ice-1, Ice-2, Ocean, and Sea-Ice were compared using the proposed algorithm. Ice-1 performed best for generating water level time series for in-land water bodies and the result is consistent with previous studies.

TI  - Long-term results of ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology in conjunction with sentinel node biopsy support step-wise approach in melanoma
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: US-FNAC is a common diagnostic tool in the work-up of many cancers. Results in melanoma were initially poor (sensitivity 20-40%). Introduction of the Berlin Morphology criteria has shown potential improvement up to 65-80% in selected patients.Aim: This cohort study evaluates the long-term survival outcome of melanoma patients' undergoing Ultrasound (US) guided Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) prior to sentinel node biopsy (SNB) or direct lymphadenectomy.Methods: Between 2001 and 2010 over 1000 consecutive melanoma patients prospectively underwent targeted US-FNAC prior to SNB. The Berlin US morphology criteria: peripheral perfusion (PP), loss of central echoes (LCE) and balloon shape (BS) were registered. FNAC was performed if any factor was present. All patients underwent SNB or lymphadenectomy in case of positive FNAC.Results: Median follow-up was 61 months (IQR 40-95). SN positivity rate was 21%. Survival analyses demonstrated that patients with positive US-FNAC had poor survival. After adjustment for SN status and other known prognostic features, patients with positive US-FNAC (hazard ratio (HR) 1.80, 95% CI 1.10-2.96) had worse survival than patients with normal US (reference). Patients with suspicious US and negative FNAC (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71-1.78) had survival comparable to patients with normal US.Conclusions: The long-term US-FNAC results support this step-wise approach to melanoma patients. Patients with positive US-FNAC have a poor survival and can be spared a SNB. Patients with suspicious US and negative FNAC should undergo SNB to detect microscopic occult disease. Completely US-FNAC negative patients might only require follow-up and no SN staging at all.

TI  - Submersed Aquatic Vegetation in Chesapeake Bay: Sentinel Species in a Changing World
T2  - BIOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Chesapeake Bay has undergone profound changes since European settlement. Increases in human and livestock populations, associated changes in land use, increases in nutrient loadings, shoreline armoring, and depletion of fish stocks have altered the important habitats within the Bay. Submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) is a critical foundational habitat and provides numerous benefits and services to society. In Chesapeake Bay, SAV species are also indicators of environmental change because of their sensitivity to water quality and shoreline development. As such, SAV has been deeply integrated into regional regulations and annual assessments of management outcomes, restoration efforts, the scientific literature, and popular media coverage. Even so, SAV in Chesapeake Bay faces many historical and emerging challenges. The future of Chesapeake Bay is indicated by and contingent on the success of SAV. Its persistence will require continued action, coupled with new practices, to promote a healthy and sustainable ecosystem.

TI  - Potential Effects of Projected Decrease in Annual Rainfall on Spatial Distribution of High Andean Wetlands in Southern Peru
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - High in the Central Andes, wetlands important to people and wildlife occur as medium to small patches within vast montane grasslands. Determining the effects of projected climate change on these high Andean wetlands is hindered by the lack of fine-scale environmental data. We used remote sensing data to develop an estimate of approximately 2.5% for wetland habitat in the study region. Assessing the potential effects of climate change relied on two assumptions. First, mean annual rainfall is an essential variable in the occurrence of wetlands (R-2 = 0.82, p < 0.01) within the semi-arid climate of the high Andes. Second, climate change projections indicate a decrease in mean annual rainfall within the study region. In our linear regression model the projected decrease in annual rainfall resulted in a total wetland loss for watersheds within most semi-arid parts of the study region. Here, we provide quantitative data for Andean wetlands to inform conservation and land use decisions. Our study results also suggest that conservation efforts should focus on a more integrative approach including smaller wetlands at the watershed level as well as regions outside protected areas.

TI  - Carbon Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in a Forest Reserve in Venezuela between 1990 and 2015
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents for the first time in Venezuela a joint analysis of deforestation and forest degradation processes, including its effects on carbon emissions. The Caparo Forest Reserve, located in the Western Plains ecoregion, in one of the national hot spots of deforestation, served as a case study using three different periods: 1990-2000, 2000-2010 and 2010-2015. In the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) framework, the Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was followed. These guidelines combine the activity data for the estimation of deforestation and degradation rates, in this case using open access Landsat imagery in conjunction with the TerraAmazon system with the emission factors, and these based on aboveground biomass (AGB) estimations using field data from permanent plots monitored during the study period. Deforestation was responsible of a net loss of 53,461 ha, while close to 3667 ha were classified as degraded forests during the 1990-2000 decade (4.9% annual deforestation rate). An estimated area of 36,447 ha and 515 ha between 2000 and 2010 was affected by both processes (4.3% annual forest loss), and 8111 ha and 737 ha between 2010 and 2015 (3.2% per year). These processes were responsible for an estimated equivalent in carbon emissions of 2.21 +/- 0.32 (SEM-Standard Error of the Mean) Mt CO2 year(-1) (1990-2000), 1.56 +/- 0.19 Mt CO(2)per year between 2000 and 2010, while 0.80 +/- 0.11 Mt CO2 year(-1) during the 2010-2015 period. Between 92.9% and 98.63% (mean 94.9%) of these emissions came from deforestation, and between 1.37% and 7.79% (mean 5.1%) from forest degradation. Using available data, at national scale, deforestation and forest degradation in Caparo represented, on average, 0.49% of the total CO2 emissions and about 1.79% of land use change related emissions for the same period in Venezuela. Finally, we briefly outline a set of elements so these results can serve as a baseline for the potential establishment of a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) strategy in the area.

AB  - Aspects of riverbed evolution including bank erosion in the Ural River basin have been considered in this paper. The natural morphodynamic types of riverbeds have been described. The spatial features of their genesis have been characterized within the Ural River basin. To study the riverbed processes, decoding of remote sensing data of the water surface has been used. The risks for the infrastructure facilities and for the residential districts have been analyzed in terms of the bank erosion in the Ural River basin. The issues concerning the border between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan due to riverbed reconfiguration of the Ural River have been outlined. Maps of the development of bank erosion in the Ural River basin have been created. A way to solve the problem of riverbed evolution along the border area has been proposed by organizing an Intergovernmental Specially Protected Natural Zone.

TI  - Impact Analysis of Climate Change on Snow over a Complex Mountainous Region Using Weather Research and Forecast Model (WRF) Simulation and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Data (MODIS)-Terra Fractional Snow Cover Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has a complex effect on snow at the regional scale. The change in snow patterns under climate change remains unknown for certain regions. Here, we used high spatiotemporal resolution snow-related variables simulated by a weather research and forecast model (WRF) including snowfall, snow water equivalent and snow depth along with fractional snow cover (FSC) data extracted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Data (MODIS)-Terra to evaluate the effects of climate change on snow over the Heihe River Basin (HRB), a typical inland river basin in arid northwestern China from 2000 to 2013. We utilized Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis and Mann-Kendall/Theil-Sen trend analysis to evaluate the results. The results are as follows: (1) FSC, snow water equivalent, and snow depth across the entire HRB region decreased, especially at elevations over 4500 m; however, snowfall increased at mid-altitude ranges in the upstream area of the HRB. (2) Total snowfall also increased in the upstream area of the HRB; however, the number of snowfall days decreased. Therefore, the number of extreme snow events in the upstream area of the HRB may have increased. (3) Snowfall over the downstream area of the HRB decreased. Thus, ground stations, WRF simulations and remote sensing products can be used to effectively explore the effect of climate change on snow at the watershed scale.

TI  - Connecting geomorphology to dust emission through high-resolution mapping of global land cover and sediment supply
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A key challenge in modeling dust emissions is to represent the location and strength of dust sources. One critical aspect of dust sources that is not well understood and thus not represented in dust models is their geomorphology. In this work, we investigate the geomorphology of global dust sources by developing two high-resolution (similar to 500 m), seamless, global maps. First is a land surface map in which landforms are classified into different categories based on geomorphology using an image classification technique. The land surface map shows the distribution of landforms in dust source regions and is useful in defining the boundaries of different dust sources in dust models. Second is the sediment supply map developed by combining the upstream drainage area with the visible reflectance retrieved by the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This map, due to the inclusion of surface reflectance, highlights dust sources such as playa/sabkha and sand dunes and anthropogenic dust sources such as agricultural areas, that may not be captured by the commonly used elevation-based erodibility maps. We establish the connection between geomorphology and dust emission by comparing the sediment supply map with the land surface map and dust frequency map, qualitatively and quantitatively. We show that the sediment supply is linked to the land surface type and that playa/sabkha corresponds to the greatest inferred sediment supply. The sediment supply map is largely consistent with the land surface map and correlates well with the frequency of occurrence map derived from high-resolution MODIS level-2 aerosol optical depth (AOD) data.

TI  - Practical Considerations before Installing Ground-Based Geodetic Infrastructure for Integrated InSAR and cGNSS Monitoring of Vertical Land Motion
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuously operating Global Navigation Satellite Systems (cGNSS) can be used to convert relative values of vertical land motion (VLM) derived from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to absolute values in a global or regional reference frame. Artificial trihedral corner reflectors (CRs) provide high-intensity and temporally stable reflections in SAR time series imagery, more so than naturally occurring permanent scatterers. Therefore, it is logical to co-locate CRs with cGNSS as ground-based geodetic infrastructure for the integrated monitoring of VLM. We describe the practical considerations for such co-locations using four case-study examples from Perth, Australia. After basic initial considerations such as land access, sky visibility and security, temporary test deployments of co-located CRs with cGNSS should be analysed together to determine site suitability. Signal to clutter ratios from SAR imagery are used to determine potential sites for placement of the CR. A significant concern is whether the co-location of a deliberately designed reflecting object generates unwanted multipath (reflected signals) in the cGNSS data. To mitigate against this, we located CRs >30 m from the cGNSS with no inter-visibility. Daily RMS values of the zero-difference ionosphere-free carrier-phase residuals, and ellipsoidal heights from static precise point positioning GNSS processing at each co-located site were then used to ascertain that the CR did not generate unwanted cGNSS multipath. These steps form a set of recommendations for the installation of such geodetic ground-infrastructure, which may be of use to others wishing to establish integrated InSAR-cGNSS monitoring of VLM elsewhere.

TI  - Automatic Cloud and Shadow Detection in Optical Satellite Imagery Without Using Thermal Bands-Application to Suomi NPP VIIRS Images over Fennoscandia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In land monitoring applications, clouds and shadows are considered noise that should be removed as automatically and quickly as possible, before further analysis. This paper presents a method to detect clouds and shadows in Suomi NPP satellite's VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) satellite images. The proposed cloud and shadow detection method has two distinct features when compared to many other methods. First, the method does not use the thermal bands and can thus be applied to other sensors which do not contain thermal channels, such as Sentinel-2 data. Secondly, the method uses the ratio between blue and green reflectance to detect shadows. Seven hundred and forty-seven VIIRS images over Fennoscandia from August 2014 to April 2016 were processed to train and develop the method. Twenty four points from every tenth of the images were used in accuracy assessment. These 1752 points were interpreted visually to cloud, cloud shadow and clear classes, then compared to the output of the cloud and shadow detection. The comparison on VIIRS images showed 94.2% correct detection rates and 11.1% false alarms for clouds, and respectively 36.1% and 82.7% for shadows. The results on cloud detection were similar to state-of-the-art methods. Shadows showed correctly on the northern edge of the clouds, but many shadows were wrongly assigned to other classes in some cases (e.g., to water class on lake and forest boundary, or with shadows over cloud). This may be due to the low spatial resolution of VIIRS images, where shadows are only a few pixels wide and contain lots of mixed pixels.

TI  - Near-Real-Time Monitoring of Insect Defoliation Using Landsat Time Series
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduced insects and pathogens impact millions of acres of forested land in the United States each year, and large-scale monitoring efforts are essential for tracking the spread of outbreaks and quantifying the extent of damage. However, monitoring the impacts of defoliating insects presents a significant challenge due to the ephemeral nature of defoliation events. Using the 2016 gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) outbreak in Southern New England as a case study, we present a new approach for near-real-time defoliation monitoring using synthetic images produced from Landsat time series. By comparing predicted and observed images, we assessed changes in vegetation condition multiple times over the course of an outbreak. Initial measures can be made as imagery becomes available, and season-integrated products provide a wall-to-wall assessment of potential defoliation at 30 m resolution. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons suggest our Landsat Time Series (LTS) products improve identification of defoliation events relative to existing products and provide a repeatable metric of change in condition. Our synthetic-image approach is an important step toward using the full temporal potential of the Landsat archive for operational monitoring of forest health over large extents, and provides an important new tool for understanding spatial and temporal dynamics of insect defoliators.

TI  - Fire and plant diversity at the global scale
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Understanding the drivers of global diversity has challenged ecologists for decades. Drivers related to the environment, productivity and heterogeneity are considered primary factors, whereas disturbance has received less attention. Given that fire is a global factor that has been affecting many regions around the world over geological time scales, we hypothesize that the fire regime should explain a significant proportion of global coarse-scale plant diversity.Location: All terrestrial ecosystems, excluding Antarctica.Time period: Data collected throughout the late 20th and early 21st century.Taxa: Seed plants (=spermatophytes=phanerogamae).Methods: We used available global plant diversity information at the ecoregion scale and compiled productivity, heterogeneity and fire information for each ecoregion using 15 years of remotely sensed data. We regressed plant diversity against environmental variables; thereafter, we tested whether fire activity still explained a significant proportion of the variance.Results: Ecoregional plant diversity was positively related to both productivity (R-2 = .30) and fire activity (R-2 =.38). Once productivity and other environmental variables were in the model (R-2 =.50), fire regime still explained a significant proportion of the variability in plant diversity (overall model, R-2 =.71). The results suggest that fire drives temporal and spatial variability in many ecosystems, providing opportunities for a diversity of plants.Main conclusions: Fire regime is a primary factor explaining plant diversity around the globe, even after accounting for productivity. Fires delay competitive exclusion, increase landscape heterogeneity and generate new niches; thus, they provide opportunities for a large variety of species. Consequently, fire regime should be considered in order to understand global ecosystem distribution and diversity.

TI  - Imidacloprid seed treatments affect individual ant behavior and community structure but not egg predation, pest abundance or soybean yield
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDNeonicotinoid seed treatments are under scrutiny because of their variable efficacy against crop pests and for their potential negative impacts on non-target organisms. Ants provide important biocontrol services in agroecosystems and can be indicators of ecosystem health. This study tested for effects of exposure to imidacloprid plus fungicide or fungicide-treated seeds on individual ant survival, locomotion and foraging capabilities and on field ant community structure, pest abundance, ant predation and yield.RESULTSCohorts of ants exposed to either type of treated seed had impaired locomotion and a higher incidence of morbidity and mortality but no loss of foraging capacity. In the field, we saw no difference in ant species richness, regardless of seed treatment. Blocks with imidacloprid did have higher species evenness and diversity, probably owing to variable effects of the insecticide on different ant species, particularly Tetramorium caespitum. Ant predation on sentinel eggs, pest abundance and soybean growth and yield were similar in the two treatments.CONCLUSIONBoth seed treatments had lethal and sublethal effects on ant individuals, and the influence of imidacloprid seed coating in the field was manifested in altered ant community composition. Those effects, however, were not strong enough to affect egg predation, pest abundance or soybean yield in field blocks. (c) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

TI  - Engaging Diverse Men: An Intersectional Analysis of Men's Pathways to Antiviolence Activism
T2  - GENDER & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the demonstrated utility of intersectionality, research on men allied with women's rights movements has largely focused on white, heterosexual, middle-class, young men. This study illustrates the importance of attending to men's intersecting identities by evaluating the applicability of existing knowledge about men's engagement pathways to the predominantly African American members of a Muslim men's anti-domestic violence group and a gay/queer men's gender justice group. Findings from a year-long qualitative study highlight how these men's experiences differ from those in the literature. While the Muslim men's experiences add dimension to the existing knowledgeespecially regarding age and parenthood, online interactions, and formal learning opportunitiesthe gay/queer men's experiences are not accurately represented within it. Their pathways begin earlier, do not rely on women's input, do not create a shift in gendered worldview, and lack a pathway narrative because they connect to gender justice through their own intersecting identities and experiences. This suggests that a marginalized identity is not in itself sufficient to alter engagement pathways; the particular type of marginalization matters.

TI  - A New Damage Assessment Method by Means of Neural Network and Multi-Sensor Satellite Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a valuable and well-established inversion technique for the estimation of geophysical parameters from satellite images. After training, ANNs are able to generate very fast products for several types of applications. Satellite remote sensing is an efficient way to detect and map strong earthquake damage for contributing to post-disaster activities during emergency phases. This work aims at presenting an application of the ANN inversion technique addressed to the evaluation of building collapse ratio (CR), defined as the number of collapsed buildings with respect to the total number of buildings in a city block, by employing optical and SAR satellite data. This is done in order to directly relate changes in images with damage that has occurred during strong earthquakes. Furthermore, once they have been trained, neural networks can be used rapidly at application stage. The goal was to obtain a general tool suitable for re-use in different scenarios. An ANN has been implemented in order to emulate a regression model and to estimate the CR as a continuous function. The adopted ANN has been trained using some features obtained from optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, as inputs, and the corresponding values of collapse ratio obtained from the survey of the 2010 M7 Haiti Earthquake, i.e., as target output. As regards the optical data, we selected three change parameters: the Normalized Difference Index (NDI), the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), and Mutual Information (MI). Concerning the SAR images, the Intensity Correlation Difference (ICD) and the KLD parameters have been considered. Exploiting an object-oriented approach, a segmentation of the study area into several regions has been performed. In particular, damage maps have been generated by considering a set of polygons (in which satellite parameters have been calculated) extracted from the open source Open Street Map (OSM) geo-database. The trained ANN has been proposed for the M6.0 Amatrice earthquake that occurred on 24 August 2016, in central Italy, by using the features extracted from Sentinel-2 and COSMO-SkyMed images as input. The results show that the ANN is able to retrieve a building collapse ratio with good accuracy. In particular, the fusion approach modelled the collapse ratio characterized by high values of CR (more than 0.5) over the historical center that agrees with observed damages. Since the technique is independent from different typologies of input data (i.e., for radiometric or spatial resolution characteristics), the study demonstrated the strength of the proposed approach for estimating damaged areas and its importance in near real time monitoring activities, owing to its fast application.

TI  - Reducing classification error of grassland overgrowth by combing low-density lidar acquisitions and optical remote sensing data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping structural changes in vegetation dynamics has, for a long time, been carried out using satellite images, orthophotos and, more recently, airborne lidar acquisitions. Lidar has established its position as providing accurate material for structure-based analyses but its limited availability, relatively short history, and lack of spectral information, however, are generally impeding the use of lidar data for change detection purposes. A potential solution in respect of detecting both contemporary vegetation structures and their previous trajectories is to combine lidar acquisitions with optical remote sensing data, which can substantially extend the coverage, span and spectral range needed for vegetation mapping. In this study, we tested the simultaneous use of a single low-density lidar data set, a series of Landsat satellite frames and two high-resolution orthophotos to detect vegetation succession related to grassland overgrowth, i.e. encroachment of woody plants into semi-natural grasslands. We built several alternative Random Forest models with different sets of variables and tested the applicability of respective data sources for change detection purposes, aiming at distinguishing unchanged grassland and woodland areas from overgrown grasslands. Our results show that while lidar alone provides a solid basis for indicating structural differences between grassland and woodland vegetation, and orthophoto-generated variables alone are better in detecting successional changes, their combination works considerably better than its respective parts. More specifically, a model combining all the used data sets reduces the total error from 17.0% to 11.0% and omission error of detecting overgrown grasslands from 56.9% to 31.2%, when compared to model constructed solely based on lidar data. This pinpoints the efficiency of the approach where lidar-generated structural metrics are combined with optical and multitemporal observations, providing a workable framework to identify structurally oriented and dynamically organized landscape phenomena, such as grassland overgrowth.

T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To evaluate the outcome and the role of adjuvant treatment in the management of patients with endometrial cancer and isolated tumor cells (ITCs) identified by SLN mapping.Methods. This single center study identified all patients undergoing hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, lymphadenectomy and SLN mapping for endometrial cancer between November 2010 and December 2015. Data was prospectively collected. Progression-free survival was analyzed according to the Kaplan -Meier method and compared using the log-rank test.Results. A total of 519 patients were included. Overall, 85 patients (16.4%) were found to have SLN metastases of which 43 (51%) were macrometastasis, 11 (13%) micrometastasis (MM) and 31 (36%) ITC. Eleven (35%) of patients with ITCs received adjuvant chemotherapy +/- whole pelvic radiation therapy (WPRT), 10 (32%) received WPRT, and 10 (32%) received either no adjuvant treatment or vault brachytherapy (VBT) only. ITC patients received significantly less chemotherapy (p = 0.0001) and WPRT (p = 0.007) compared to patients with macrometastasis. Of note, ITC were not considered node positive in our study. With a median follow-up of 29 months (range: 0-67), the progression free survival (PFS) at 3-years for the ITC patients was 95.5%, similar to node negative (87.6%) and micrometastasis patients (85.5%), but statistically better than patients with macrometastasis (58.5%) (p = 0.0012). Only 1/31 patient with ITC recurred (IB, 7 cm carcinosarcoma) despite adjuvant treatments. None of the ITC patients with endometrioid histology recurred (0/28) and none of the ITC patients who did not receive adjuvant treatment or VBT recurred (0/10).Conclusions. Patients with endometrial cancer found to have SLN ITCs have an excellent outcome. The use of adjuvant treatment should be tailored to uterine factors and histology and not solely based on the presence of ITCs. Patients with ITCs and otherwise low-risk uterine disease probably derive little benefit from receiving additional treatments. More studies are needed to confirm our results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

T2  - Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This work was launched to explore the effect of habitat and growth year on the secondary metabolites contents of cultivated Polygala tenuifolia. The samples of cultivated P. tenuifolia were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography(UPLC)-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry(Q-TOF MS), and the obtained data were analyzed using multiple statistical analysis and cluster analysis. The results showed that compared with growth year, habitat is a main influencing factor which affected the secondary metabolites contents of P. tenuifolia. The contents of sucrose esters and oligosacchride multi-esters are greatly dependent on the habitat (the sample-AG with high levels of components of tenuifoliside B and tenuifoliside C, and the sample-FY with high levels of 3,6'-disinapoyl sucrose, tenuifoliose S, tenuifoliose L, and tenuifoliose V). There is no obvious effect of habitat and growth year on xanthone. The contents of triterpene saponins are greatly dependent on the growth year, and the content of parts of triterpene saponins increased as time goes on.The result indicated that the effect of habitat and growth year on different types of secondary metabolites is not completely equivalent. This study will contribute to the breeding of P. tenuifolia and amendment of current commodity criteria.

TI  - A Hierarchical Extension of General Four-Component Scattering Power Decomposition
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The overestimation of volume scattering (OVS) is an intrinsic drawback in model-based polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) target decomposition. It severely impacts the accuracy measurement of scattering power and leads to scattering mechanism ambiguity. In this paper, a hierarchical extended general four-component scattering power decomposition method (G4U) is presented. The conventional G4U is first proposed by Singh et al. and it has advantages in full use of information and volume scattering characterization. However, the OVS still exists in the G4U and it causes a scattering mechanism ambiguity in some oriented urban areas. In the proposed method, matrix rotations by the orientation angle and the helix angle are applied. Afterwards, the transformed coherency matrix is applied to the four-component decomposition scheme with two refined models. Moreover, the branch condition applied in the G4U is substituted by the ratio of correlation coefficient (RCC), which is used as a criterion for hierarchically implementing the decomposition. The performance of this approach is demonstrated and evaluated with the Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR), Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), Radarsat-2, and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) fully polarimetric data over different test sites. Comparison studies are carried out and demonstrated that the proposed method exhibits promising improvements in the OVS and scattering mechanism characterization.

TI  - Empirically Derived Sensitivity of Vegetation to Climate across Global Gradients of Temperature and Precipitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural composition of terrestrial ecosystems can be shaped by climate to take advantage of local environmental conditions. Ecosystem functioning (e.g., interaction between photosynthesis and temperature) can also acclimate to different climatological states. The combination of these two factors thus determines ecological-climate interactions. A global empirical map of the sensitivity of vegetation to climate is derived using the response of satellite-observed greenness to interannual variations in temperature and precipitation. Mechanisms constraining ecosystem functioning are inferred by analyzing how the sensitivity of vegetation to climate varies across climate space. Analysis yields empirical evidence for multiple physical and biological mediators of the sensitivity of vegetation to climate at large spatial scales. In hot and wet locations, vegetation is greener in warmer years despite temperatures likely exceeding thermally optimum conditions. However, sunlight generally increases during warmer years, suggesting that the increased stress from higher atmospheric water demand is offset by higher rates of photosynthesis. The sensitivity of vegetation transitions in sign (greener when warmer or drier to greener when cooler or wetter) along an emergent line in climate space with a slope of about 59 mm yr(-1) degrees C-1, twice as steep as contours of aridity. The mismatch between these slopes is evidence at a global scale of the limitation of both water supply due to inefficiencies in plant access to rainfall and plant physiological responses to atmospheric water demand. This empirical pattern can provide a functional constraint for process-based models, helping to improve predictions of the global-scale response of vegetation to a changing climate.

TI  - Estimating the beyond-shoot foliage clumping at two contrasting points in the growing season using a variety of field-based methods
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The clumping index is a measure describing the spatial aggregation of foliage elements and has an important effect on radiation transfer in canopies. Quantifying the clumping index from field-based measurements has shown to be complicated, as values presented in literature vary substantially between methods. The goal of this work was to improve on previous comparison of beyond-shoot clumping quantification methods over Jarvselja RAMI test sites by including additional methods as well as emphasizing the temporal variability of the clumping index by including two phenologically contrasting moments in the growing season. We show that while apparent clumping, digital cover photography-based methods and clumping from gap size distribution coincide well, they result in the maximum clumping value that should be considered in any case, whereas logarithmically based methods might provide more accurate estimates of clumping. The results are of great importance for the correct assessment of foliage clumping from space, as well as for current attempts to assess clumping using airborne and terrestrial laser scanning.

TI  - Comparison of Fusion Techniques for Very High Resolution Data for Extraction of Urban Land-Cover
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims in presenting a thorough comparison of performance of pan sharpening techniques, belonging to spatial, spectral, scale-space and spatial-frequency domain, for Very High Resolution Satellite Data. With the availability of new Very High Resolution sensors, especially, World View-2 sensor, which provides data at sub-meter level, the need for fusion of Panchromatic (PAN) and Multispectral (MS) images has to be further investigated. Pan-sharpening techniques namely, Hue-Saturation-Intensity, Brovey Transform, Principal Components Analysis, Discrete Wavelet Transform, Stationary Wavelet Transform, Non Sub-sampled contourlet Transform and Pseudo Wigner Distribution (PWD) fusion method have been selected for the fusion of PAN and MS images of World View-2 sensor. Further, the comparison of performance of each of the techniques have been carried out by using various evaluation indicators, such as, Root Mean Square Error, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Correlation Coefficient, Universal Image Quality Index. It is found that PWD based fusion technique gives good result with a good trade-off between the preservation of spectral information and enhancement of spatial resolution.

TI  - Does BMI affect the detection of sentinel lymph nodes with indocyanine green in early breast cancer patients?
T2  - EUROPEAN SURGERY-ACTA CHIRURGICA AUSTRIACA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) has proved to be a useful and safe method for axillary staging in the surgical management of early breast cancer. Sentinel node (SN) detection rates with blue dye (patent blue) and radioisotopes (99m-Tc), either alone or particularly in combination, are high (95% to 100%). Even better detection rates were reported with fluorescent dyes like indocyanine green (ICG). This study was designed to show whether sentinel node detection and mapping of lymphatics with ICG might depend on the body mass index (BMI).Methods Between February 2014 and April 2015, SNB with blue dye, 99m-Tc, and ICG navigation was conducted for 100 consecutive procedures in patients scheduled for surgery of early breast cancer. ICG injection, lymphatic mapping with the Photodynamic Eye (PDE; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), and identification of the sentinel nodes with blue dye and ICG were followed by a final search for more lymph nodes with a gamma probe. Data were collected prospectively.Results In all patients, up to six sentinel nodes (mean 2.49) were detected. No statistical correlation was found between the BMI and the identification of lymphatics or the detection of lymph nodes with ICG. Lymphatics were successfully identified preoperatively in no more than 79 cases. In 6 patients, a gamma probe was needed for detection. Adverse events or allergic reactions were absent throughout.Conclusions SN detection and lymphatic mapping with ICG were not related to the BMI. Pending answers to as yet unsolved questions, the combined use of blue dye and 99m-Tc imaging should, however, be continued.

TI  - Quantification of heat shock protein 70 and acetylcholinesterase over a time course suggests environmental adaptation in a foundational molluscan species
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Waterways in urban areas often act as repositories for sewage, industrial waste, and environmental contaminants. In response, inhabitants of these watersheds undergo physiological adaptations specific to their respective environments. Effects of these stressors can be assayed by quantification of various well-documented biomarkers in sentinel species such as the Atlantic Ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa, a native to the Bronx River Estuary, Bronx, NY, USA. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is a universally expressed biomarker for an array of environmental stressors including toxins and low dissolved oxygen. To better understand the mechanisms by which organisms tolerate their contaminated environments, we monitored the constitutive and heat shock induced levels of two proteins: Hsp70 and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in natural populations of G. demissa from differentially impacted sites: the Bronx River and Greenwich Cove estuaries. We show that G. demissa from the Bronx River exhibits a higher level of constitutive Hsp70, and launches a more rapid and robust heat shock response than does its Greenwich Cove counterpart. In addition, AChE levels are recovered more quickly in Bronx River mussels. Based on response pattern investigations from heat stress as well as constitutive expression, we suggest that the Hsp70/AChE chaperone/client relationship exemplifies the unique adaptive mechanisms utilised by organisms in order to tolerate environmentally impacted habitats. Results from this study offer important insights from an ecological perspective into the molecular and cellular basis of stress response and provide valuable information regarding adaptation to the increased demands of challenging environments.

TI  - Modeling the Global Solar Radiation Under Cloudy Sky Using Meteosat Second Generation High Resolution Visible Raw Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an improved model for mapping both hourly and daily values of the global radiation reaching the earth's surface from satellite data over Algeria. An empirical model with a large spectral band using Linke atmospheric turbidity was chosen to modeling the clear-sky global radiation. The extinction of the solar radiation (absorption plus scattering) is described by an exponential decay function of the cloud albedo and cloud index. To compute these two parameter, we resolve the sun-pixel-satellite radiative model equation using the following hypothesizes. The first one supposes the total transmittance of the atmospheric in the pixel-satellite direction as the ratio of the direct radiation in real sky to the same quantity in case of a very clean sky. The second one estimates that the noise energy reflected back towards the radiometer by molecules of gases in the upper levels of the atmosphere represents about 5 % of the energy measured by the radiometer. The model performance was validated for five radiometric stations across the country for three selected months in 2013 and satisfactory results were obtained and discussed.

TI  - Estimation of Above Ground Biomass Using Texture Metrics Derived from IRS Cartosat-1 Panchromatic Data in Evergreen Forests of Western Ghats, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of above ground forest biomass (AGB) is essential in carbon modelling studies to provide mitigation strategies as demonstrated by reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Several researchers have demonstrated the use of remote sensing data in spatial AGB estimation, in terms of spectral and radar backscatter based approaches at a landscape scale with several known limitations. However, these methods lacked the predictive ability at high biomass ranges due to saturation. The current study addresses the problem of saturation at high biomass ranges using canopy textural metric from high resolution optical data. Fourier transform based textural ordination (FOTO) technique, which involves deriving radial spectrum information via 2D fast Fourier transform and ordination through principal component analysis was used for characterizing the textural properties of forest canopies. In the current study, plot level estimated AGB from 15 (1 ha) plots was used to relate with texture derived information from very high resolution datasets (viz., IKONOS and Cartosat-1). In addition to the estimation of high biomass ranges, one of the prime objective of the current study is to understand the effects of spatial resolution on deriving textural-AGB relationship from 2.5 m IRS Cartosat data (Cartosat-A, viewing angle = -5A degrees) to that of IKONOS imagery with near nadir view. Further, since texture is impacted by several illumination geometry issues, the effect of viewing geometry on the relationship was evaluated using Cartosat-F (Viewing angle = 26A degrees) imagery. The results show that the FOTO method using stereo Cartosat (A and F) images at 2.5 m resolution are able to perform well in characterizing high AGB values since the texture-biomass relationship is only subjected to 18 % relative error to that of 15 % in case of IKONOS and could aid in reduction of uncertainty in AGB estimation at a large landscape levels.

TI  - Object-Based Metrics for Forecast Verification of Convective Development with Geostationary Satellite Data
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Object-based metrics are adapted and applied to geostationary satellite observations with the evaluation of cloud forecasts in convective situations as the goal. Forecasts of the convection-permitting German-focused Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO-DE) numerical model are transformed into synthetic observations using the RTTOV radiative transfer model, and contrasted with the corresponding real observations. Threshold-based segmentation techniques are applied to the fields for object identification. The statistical properties of the traditional measures cold cloud cover and average brightness temperature amplitude are contrasted to object-based metrics of spatial aggregation and object structure. Based on 59 case days from the summer half-years between 2012 and 2014, a variance decomposition technique is applied to the time series of the metrics to identify deficits in day-to-day, diurnal, and weather-regime-related variability of cold cloud characteristics in the forecasts. Furthermore, sensitivities of the considered metrics are discussed, which result from uncertainties in the satellite forward operator and from the choice of parameters in the object identification techniques.

TI  - Dynamic conservation for migratory species
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In an era of unprecedented and rapid global change, dynamic conservation strategies that tailor the delivery of habitat to when and where it is most needed can be critical for the persistence of species, especially those with diverse and dispersed habitat requirements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such a strategy for migratory waterbirds. We analyzed citizen science and satellite data to develop predictive models of bird populations and the availability of wetlands, which we used to determine temporal and spatial gaps in habitat during a vital stage of the annual migration. We then filled those gaps using a reverse auction marketplace to incent qualifying landowners to create temporary wetlands on their properties. This approach is a cost-effective way of adaptively meeting habitat needs for migratory species, optimizes conservation outcomes relative to investment, and can be applied broadly to other conservation challenges.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in cutaneous melanoma
T2  - GIORNALE ITALIANO DI DERMATOLOGIA E VENEREOLOGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - The management of melanoma is constantly evolving. New therapies and surgical advances have changed the landscape over the last years. Since being introduced by Dr Donald Morton, the role of sentinel lymph node has been debated. In many melanoma centers, sentinel node biopsy is not a standard of care for melanoma above 1 mm in thickness. The results of the MSLTLT-II Trial are not available for a while and in the meantime, this procedure is offered as a prognostic indicator as it has been shown to be very useful for assessing risk of relapse. The biology of lymph node spread in melanoma is a complex field and there are many factors which influence it such as age, melanoma body site, thickness but other factors such as regression, ulceration and gender need further evaluation. In this review, we address the clinical value of sentinel lymph node biopsy and how its indication has changed over the years especially recently with the setup of many adjuvant trials which are offered to stage 3 melanomas.

TI  - MONITORING OF SMALL HIVE BEETLE (<i>AETHINA TUMIDA</i> MURRAY) IN CALABRIA (ITALY) FROM 2014 TO 2016: PRACTICAL IDENTIFICATION METHODS
T2  - JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Small Hive Beetle (SHB), Aethina tumida, is an invasive pest of honey bee colonies that causes significant damage to the beekeeping sector. SHB was detected in southern Italy (EU) in 2014 and despite adopted eradication measures, is still present there. After three years of observations of SHB in Calabria (2014-2016), we provide here some practical tips for improving control measures. A new time-saving colony examination method, including the use of an internal divider reduced the time needed for hive inspections by 31.86 % on average. Prioritizating the inspection of pollen and honey combs rather than brood combs is advised. Sentinel apiaries with no more than five colonies without supers are suggested for each beekeeping location in order to attract and to monitor the early appearance of SHB. The use of these methods will enable early detection and prompt control measures application before this destructive pest can spread in the region.

TI  - A Dynamic Landsat Derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Product for the Conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite derived vegetation indices (VIs) are broadly used in ecological research, ecosystem modeling, and land surface monitoring. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), perhaps the most utilized VI, has countless applications across ecology, forestry, agriculture, wildlife, biodiversity, and other disciplines. Calculating satellite derived NDVI is not always straight-forward, however, as satellite remote sensing datasets are inherently noisy due to cloud and atmospheric contamination, data processing failures, and instrument malfunction. Readily available NDVI products that account for these complexities are generally at coarse resolution; high resolution NDVI datasets are not conveniently accessible and developing them often presents numerous technical and methodological challenges. We address this deficiency by producing a Landsat derived, high resolution (30 m), long-term (30+ years) NDVI dataset for the conterminous United States. We use Google Earth Engine, a planetary-scale cloud-based geospatial analysis platform, for processing the Landsat data and distributing the final dataset. We use a climatology driven approach to fill missing data and validate the dataset with established remote sensing products at multiple scales. We provide access to the composites through a simple web application, allowing users to customize key parameters appropriate for their application, question, and region of interest.

TI  - Advantage of multispectral imaging with sub-centimeter resolution in precision agriculture: generalization of training for supervised classification
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays it is known how to resolve many questions through satellite imagery such as Landsat 8 and the like, both from the theoretical point of view, i.e. research, as well as from the practical standpoint, e.g. commercial applications. This study evaluated the possibility of generalizing the training for supervised classification of multispectral images with sub-centimeter resolution. Images were taken under uncontrolled conditions of lighting and sun-target-sensor geometry and in the presence of normal interference in the agricultural environment. The images were obtained by the DuncanTech MS3100 camera (Auburn, CA, USA), a multispectral camera (green, red and near infra-red) mounted on a mobile ground platform and transformed into reflectance. For each element present (leaves, stems, spikes, soil, shadows, spectral references and sampling implements), a representative area was delimited in each image. These regions of interest were used, first, to quantify the separability of the classes. The next step was to define groups for cross-validation within these regions of interest; ten-folds were defined randomly with the constraint of a uniform distribution of classes. These folds were used in training and evaluation of the supervised classification using spectral angle mapper, maximum likelihood and decision trees. Spectral angle mapper correctly classified 49.2 % of cases, the maximum likelihood achieved a success rate of 86.8 % and the decision tree correctly classified 99.5 % of the spectral signatures. These results prove that multispectral images taken under uncontrolled conditions can be successfully classified by a generalized model that takes advantage of the higher spatial resolution. This opens a new line in which those pixels that do not correspond to vegetation, which bias the estimates of the crop parameters and complicate the recognition of objects, could be automatically masked.

TI  - Use of Remote Sensing and Geospatial Technique for Pre-feasibility Analysis of Rural Water Pipeline Grids
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The article outlines a procedure of pre-feasibility analysis of planned rural water supply pipeline grids in India. Usually, these type of pre feasibility studies prior to actual implementation, is carried out based on ground surveys and is time consuming. In this work, we use thematic spatial data, such as geomorphology and landuse-landcover along with digital elevation model (DEM) to carry out the pre-feasibility assessment of proposed pipeline grids. DEM generated from CartoSat-1 stereo data has been used to understand the possible topographic hindrances along the planned pipeline route and optimise the same. Further, topographic data also indicates the possible routes of gravity assisted flow. The geomorphology thematic data interpreted from Resourcesat-1 LISS III imagery is used to identify possible geomorphologic hindrances along the pipeline route. Similarly, landuse-landcover information derived from Resourcesat-2 LISS III images, was used to assess the land use/cover impact of the planed pipeline corridor. This has been demonstrated, in the current article using a hypothetical pipeline route. The activity can be carried in a specially designed geo-spatial interface in NRSC/ISRO Bhuvan geoportal. This type of assessment can prove to be time saving and cost effective at a pre-feasibility stage.

TI  - Monitoring Land Subsidence in a Rural Area Using a Combination of ADInSAR and Polarimetric Coherence Optimization
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates a combination of advanced differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (ADInSAR) with different coherence optimization methods. After the launch of satellites with polarimetry capabilities, differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) is feasible to generate polarimetric DInSAR to enhance pixel phase quality and increase coherent pixel (CP) density. The first method proposed in this paper, modified coherence set-based polarimetry optimization (MCPO), is a modification of a known single-baseline coherence optimization method to optimize coherence of all interferograms simultaneously. The second method, coherence-set based polarimetry optimization (CPO), was presented by Neumann et al., and is an existing revision of the single-baseline coherence optimization technique. The final method, exhaustive search polarimetry optimization, is a search-based approach to find the optimized scattering mechanism introduced by Navarro-Sanchez et al. The case study is the Tehran basin located in the North of Iran, which suffers from a high-rate of land subsidence and is covered by agricultural fields. Usually such an area would significantly decorrelate but applying polarimetric ADInSAR allows us to obtain a more CP coverage. A set of dual polarization TerraSAR-X images with 9 x 9 and 15 x 15 as multilook factors were used within the polarimetric ADInSAR procedure. All three coherence optimization methods with two different multilook factors are shown to have increased the density and phase quality of CPs. Moreover, the estimated deformation rates were evaluated using available levelling measurements. MCPO, which is presented in this paper, works more successful than CPO in terms of CPs density, phase quality and deformation accuracy.

TI  - Sediment plume model-a comparison between use of measured turbidity data and satellite images for model calibration
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we built a two-dimensional sediment transport model of Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan, Canada. It was calibrated by using measured turbidity data from stations along the reservoir and satellite images based on a flood event in 2013. In June 2013, there was heavy rainfall for two consecutive days on the frozen and snow-covered ground in the higher elevations of western Alberta, Canada. The runoff from the rainfall and the melted snow caused one of the largest recorded inflows to the headwaters of the South Saskatchewan River and Lake Diefenbaker downstream. An estimated discharge peak of over 5200 m(3)/s arrived at the reservoir inlet with a thick sediment front within a few days. The sediment plume moved quickly through the entire reservoir and remained visible from satellite images for over 2 weeks along most of the reservoir, leading to concerns regarding water quality. The aims of this study are to compare, quantitatively and qualitatively, the efficacy of using turbidity data and satellite images for sediment transport model calibration and to determine how accurately a sediment transport model can simulate sediment transport based on each of them. Both turbidity data and satellite images were very useful for calibrating the sediment transport model quantitatively and qualitatively. Model predictions and turbidity measurements show that the flood water and suspended sediments entered upstream fairly well mixed and moved downstream as overflow with a sharp gradient at the plume front. The model results suggest that the settling and resuspension rates of sediment are directly proportional to flow characteristics and that the use of constant coefficients leads to model underestimation or overestimation unless more data on sediment formation become available. Hence, this study reiterates the significance of the availability of data on sediment distribution and characteristics for building a robust and reliable sediment transport model.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping using SPECT/CT and gamma probe in endometrial cancer: an analysis of parameters affecting detection rate
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose SPECT/CT after pericervical injection of technetium-99 m-nanocolloid was shown to be suitable for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in endometrial cancer (EC). The aim of this study was to analyze factors affecting successful SLN detection by means of SPECT/CT such as imaging findings, patient characteristics and tumor biology in a large cohort of patients.Methods One hundred and forty-five consecutive patients suffering from EC who received pre-surgical SLN mapping at our institution between 2011 and 2016 were included in this analysis. SPECT/CT data of abdomen and pelvis (mean 4: 20 +/- 1: 20 h p.i.) were acquired after pericervical injection of technetium-99 m-nanocolloid (mean 230 +/- 45 MBq) in all patients. Surgical staging was performed on the day after. Acquisition parameters, patient characteristics, SPECT/CT findings as well as histopathological results were collected.Results A total of 282 SLNs were identified by means of SPECT/CT. Overall, preoperative and intraoperative SLN detection rates were 86%, 76% and 74% respectively. The most important factor associated with failure to detect SLNs was the presence of high bone marrow on SPECT/CT (p = 0.005). Peritoneal/abdominal radioactivity was also associated with missed SLN detection in SPECT/CT (p = 0.02). However, the presence of liver/spleen uptake on its own was not predictive for detection failure. Low numbers of detected SLNs in SPECT/CT were slightly related with older age and lower injected activity. No significant influence was found for the parameters of tumor histology and stage, lymph node involvement and the time gap between injection and imaging.Conclusions Venous drainage as indicated by bone marrow uptake is the most important factor associated with scintigraphic SLN detection failure. Moreover, high peritoneal and abdominal activity was also associated with detection failure. Thus, meticulous application of the radiotracer is crucial in EC.

TI  - Recent Patterns in Climate, Vegetation, and Forest Water Use in California Montane Watersheds
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - California has recently experienced one of the worst droughts on record, negatively impacting forest ecosystems across the state. As a major source of the region's water supply, it is important to evaluate the vegetation and water balance response of these montane forested watersheds to climate variability across the range of rain-to snow-dominated precipitation regimes. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) were used to capture the hydrologic drought signal, and MODIS vegetation indices (i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index and the enhanced vegetation index) were used to evaluate the vegetation and evapotranspiration response in three headwater catchments. The study catchments comprised a low elevation rain-dominated site (Caspar Creek) on the northern California coast, a mid-elevation site with a mix of rain and snow (Providence Creek) in the California Sierra Nevada, and a high elevation snow-dominated site (Bull Creek) in the Sierra Nevada. Lowest SPI values occurred in the third drought year of 2014 for all sites. Lowest SRI was in 2014 for Caspar, but in 2015 for Providence and Bull, reflecting differences in snowpack-delayed runoff and subsurface storage capacity between the lower and higher elevation watersheds. The most accurate water balance closure using evapotranspiration estimates from vegetation indices was within 10% of measured precipitation at snow-dominated Bull. The rain-dominated Caspar watershed had the highest vegetation index values and annual evapotranspiration, with the lowest variability over the previous 13 years (2004-2016). Vegetation index values and annual evapotranspiration decreased with increasing elevation and snow contribution to precipitation. Both snow-influenced Sierra Nevada watersheds showed elevated vegetation and evapotranspiration responses to interannual climate variability. There remains a need for institutional support to expand long-term observations in remote forested mountain watersheds to monitor and research these changing and extreme environmental conditions in source watershed regions.

TI  - Evaluation of image fusion methods using PALSAR, RADARSAT-1 and SPOT images for land use/land cover classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aimed to explore the fusion of multispectral optical SPOT data with microwave L-band ALOS PALSAR and C-band RADARSAT-1 data for a detailed land use/cover mapping to find out the individual contributions of different wavelengths. Many fusion approaches have been implemented and analyzed for various applications using different remote sensing images. However, the fusion methods have conflict in the context of land use/cover (LULC) mapping using optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images together. In this research two SAR images ALOS PALSAR and RADARSAT-1 were fused with SPOT data. Although, both SAR data were gathered in same polarization, and had same ground resolution, they differ in wavelengths. As different data fusion methods, intensity hue saturation (IHS), principal component analysis, discrete wavelet transformation, high pass frequency (HPF), and Ehlers, were performed and compared. For the quality analyses, visual interpretation was applied as a qualitative analysis, and spectral quality metrics of the fused images, such as correlation coefficient (CC) and universal image quality index (UIQI) were applied as a quantitative analysis. Furthermore, multispectral SPOT image and SAR fused images were classified with Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) method for the evaluation of their efficiencies. Ehlers gave the best score in the quality analysis and for the accuracy of LULC on LULC mapping of PALSAR and RADARSAT images. The results showed that the HPF method is in the second place with an increased thematic mapping accuracy. IHS had the worse results in all analyses. Overall, it is indicated that Ehlers method is a powerful technique to improve the LULC classification.

AB  - Background Surveillance after radiochemotherapy of anal carcinoma (ACa) with curative intent is recommended in guidelines, but data regarding the effectiveness of followup are lacking. We aimed to assess the performance of an ACa surveillance program in a real-life setting.Methods We retrospectively summarized clinical history, physical findings, and follow-up investigations (endoanal ultrasound, endoscopy, CT scan) obtained during 42 months (+/- 27 months) from 80 patients after radiochemotherapy of ACa.Results In 7/80 cases (8.8%) an incomplete response to therapy was identified at or before the 6-month time point after the end of treatment; 4 of the 7 cases were identified during scheduled follow-up. In 6 cases (7.5%), recurrent disease was found after the 6-month time point. Recurrence was systemic in 5 cases and local/inguinal in 1 case. In 3 of the 6 cases (50%), recurrence was identified during scheduled follow-up. In one asymptomatic patient, a single liver metastasis was detected during scheduled follow-up and the patient remains free of disease 19 months after surgery. Surveillance resulted in a high rate of false-positive findings (70 findings in 604 investigations), of which only 14 could be confirmed.Conclusion Scheduled follow-up after treatment of ACa detected recurrent disease at systemic sites, enabling potentially curative treatment in a single case. Effectiveness of abdominal imaging during follow-up after ACa treatment should be tested in a prospective trial.

TI  - The influence of forest cover on landslide occurrence explored with spatio-temporal information
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal landslide inventories in widely forested landscapes are scarce and further studies are required to face the challenges of producing reliable inventories in woodland areas. An elaboration of valuable empirical relationships between shallow landslides and forest cover based on recent remote sensing data alone is often hampered due to constant land cover changes, differing ages of landslides within a landslide inventory and the fact that usage of different data sets for mapping might lead to various systematic mapping biases. Within this study, we attempted to overcome these difficulties in order to explore the effect of forest cover on shallow landslide occurrences. Thus, forest dynamics were examined on the basis of 9 orthophoto series from 1950s to 2015, distinguishing 3 forest classes, based on the wood type. These classes were furthermore distinguished in 12 subclasses, considering stand density and age. A multi-temporal landslide inventory was compiled for the same period based on the aerial photography, 2 airborne LiDAR imageries, 8 field surveys and archive data. We derived topographical parameters (slope, topographical positioning index and convergency index) from the digital elevation model for areal correction and accounting for topographical confounders within a logistic regression model. Empirical relationships were assessed by means of (a) areal changes of forests and logged areas, (b) spatio-temporal distribution of shallow translational landslides, (c) frequency ratios and (d) logistic regression analysis. The findings revealed that forests increased by 16.2% from 1950s to 2015. 311 landslides of 351 in total that where mapped in total could be assigned to the observed time series and were considered for our analyses. Frequency ratios and odds ratios indicated a stabilising effect of all forest classes on landslide occurrences. Odds ratios observed for the models based on aggregated data sets (3 forest classes) indicated provided evidence that forest was constantly estimated to be less prone to slope failure than their non-forested counterparts. The chances for forest classes to be affected by shallow landslides were estimated to be considerably lower whenever topographic predictors were as well included in the model. A detailed inspection of the statistical results suggests that the obtained empirical relationships should be interpreted with care. Challenges in the mapping procedures of forests and landslides, implications of the applied methods and potential pitfalls are discussed.

TI  - Adapting a Natura 2000 field guideline for a remote sensing-based assessment of heathland conservation status
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can be a valuable tool for supporting nature conservation monitoring systems. However, for many areas of conservation interest, there is still a considerable gap between field-based operational monitoring guidelines and the current remote sensing-based approaches. This hampers application in practice of the latter. Here, we propose a remote sensing approach for mapping the conservation status of Calluna-dominated Natura 2000 dwarf shrub habitats that is closely related to field mapping schemes. We transferred the evaluation criteria of the field guidelines to three related variables that can be captured by remote sensing: (1) coverage of the key species, (2) stand structural diversity, and (3) co-occurring species. Continuous information on these variables was obtained by regressing ground reference data from field surveys and UAV flights against airborne hyperspectral imagery. Merging the three resulting quality layers in an RGB representation allowed for illustrating the habitat quality in a continuous way. User-defined thresholds can be applied to this stack of quality layers to derive an overall assessment of habitat quality in terms of nature conservation, i.e. the conservation status.In our study, we found good accordance of the remotely sensed data with field-based information for the three variables key species, stand structural diversity and co-occurring vegetation (R-2 of 0.79, 0.69, and 0.71, respectively) and it was possible to derive meaningful habitat quality maps. The conservation status could be derived with an accuracy of 65%. In interpreting these results it should be considered that the remote sensing based layers are independent estimates of habitat quality in their own right and not a mere replacement of the criteria used in the field guidelines. The approach is thought to be transferable to similar regions with minor adaptions.Our results refer to Calluna heathland which we consider a comparably easy target for remote sensing. Hence, the transfer of field guidelines to remote sensing indicators was rather successful in this case but needs further evaluation for other habitats.

TI  - Improved Sea Surface Height From Satellite Altimetry in Coastal Zones: A Case Study in Southern Patagonia
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution 20-Hz Jason-2 satellite altimetry data obtained from crossing tracks numbered 52 and 189 in San Matias Gulf, Argentina, are compared with a 22-month-long time series of sea level measured by a bottom pressure recorder. It was deployed 1.3 km from the nominal intersection of the two tracks and 0.9 km from the coast. Results show that by improving retracking and tidalmodeling, satellite altimetry data become more accurate close to the coast. Indeed, a larger number of reliable data are obtained up to 1.6 km from the coast when satellite data are retracked using adaptive leading edge subwaveform retracker (ALES) rather than using the classic Brown model. The tidal model that showed the lowest root sum square (RSS) of the difference between the in situ and the modeled tidal amplitude and phase is TPXO8 (RSS 4.8 cm). Yet, the lowest difference from in situ tidal constituents is obtained by harmonic analysis of the available 23-year-long 1-Hz altimetry dataset (RSS 4.1 cm), highlighting the potential of altimetry data to compute tides. Considering ALES retracking and TPXO8 tidal correction for the 20-Hz Jason-2 data, we finally show that it is possible to retrieve 70% more data and to improve correlation with in situ measurements from 0.79 to 0.95. The sea level anomaly obtained this way has a root mean square difference from in situ data of only 13 cm as close as 4 km from the coast. Overall, the analysis performed indicates that satellite altimetry data can be greatly improved, even in complex macrotidal coastal regions.

TI  - Remote sensing of forest insect disturbances: Current state and future directions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Insect disturbance are important agents of change in forest ecosystems around the globe, yet their spatial and temporal distribution and dynamics are not well understood. Remote sensing has gained much attention in mapping and understanding insect outbreak dynamics. Consequently, we here review the current literature on the remote sensing of insect disturbances. We suggest to group studies into three insect types: bark beetles, broadleaved defoliators, and coniferous defoliators. By so doing, we systematically compare the sensors and methods used for mapping insect disturbances within and across insect types. Results suggest that there are substantial differences between methods used for mapping bark beetles and defoliators, and between methods used for mapping broadleaved and coniferous defoliators. Following from this, we highlight approaches that are particularly suited for each insect type. Finally, we conclude by highlighting future research directions for remote sensing of insect disturbances. In particular, we suggest to: 1) Separate insect disturbances from other agents; 2) Extend the spatial and temporal domain of analysis; 3) Make use of dense time series; 4) Operationalize near-real time monitoring of insect disturbances; 5) Identify insect disturbances in the context of coupled human-natural systems; and 6) Improve reference data for assessing insect disturbances. Since the remote sensing of insect disturbances has gained much interest beyond the remote sensing community recently, the future developments identified here will help integrating remote sensing products into operational forest management. Furthermore, an improved spatiotemporal quantification of insect disturbances will support an inclusion of these processes into regional to global ecosystem models.

TI  - Using Landsat time series for characterizing forest disturbance dynamics in the coupled human and natural systems of Central Europe
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is a key information source for improving the spatiotemporal understanding of forest ecosystem dynamics. Yet, the mapping and attribution of forest change remains challenging, particularly in areas where a number of interacting disturbance agents simultaneously affect forest development. The forest ecosystems of Central Europe are coupled human and natural systems, with natural and human disturbances affecting forests both individually and in combination. To better understand the complex forest disturbance dynamics in such systems, we utilize 32-year Landsat time series to map forest disturbances in five sites across Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia. All sites consisted of a National Park and the surrounding forests, reflecting three management zones of different levels of human influence (managed, protected, strictly protected). This allowed for a comparison of spectral, temporal, and spatial disturbance patterns across a gradient from natural to coupled human and natural disturbances. Disturbance maps achieved overall accuracies ranging from 81% to 93%. Disturbance patches were generally small, with 95% of the disturbances being smaller than 10 ha. Disturbance rates ranged from 0.29% yr(-1) to 0.95% yr(-1), and differed substantially among management zones and study sites. Natural disturbances in strictly protected areas were longer in duration (median of 8 years) and slightly less variable in magnitude compared to human-dominated disturbances in managed forests (median duration of 1 year). However, temporal dynamics between natural and human-dominated disturbances showed strong synchrony, suggesting that disturbance peaks are driven by natural events affecting managed and unmanaged areas simultaneously. Our study demonstrates the potential of remote sensing for mapping forest disturbances in coupled human and natural systems, such as the forests of Central Europe. Yet, we also highlight the complexity of such systems in terms of agent attribution, as many natural disturbances are modified by management responding to them outside protected areas.

TI  - Improved Characterization of Forest Transmissivity Within the L-MEB Model Using Multisensor SAR Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter proposes a novel way to assimilate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (L-MEB) model to enhance model performance over forested areas. L-and C-band satellite SAR data are used in order to characterize the forest transmissivity within the emission model, instead of the optical satellite imagery-based leaf area index (LAI) parameter. Examination of several combinations of satellite SAR data as a substitute for LAI within the L-MEB model showed that when ALOS PALSAR (L-band) and multitemporal composite Sentinel-1 (C-band) data are applied, an improved agreement was achieved between the measured and simulated brightness temperatures (TBs) over forests. The root mean squared difference between modeled and measured TBs was reduced from 6.1 to 4.7 K with single PALSAR scene-based transmissivity correction and down to 4.1 K with multitemporal Sentinel-1 composite-based transmissivity correction. Suitability of single Sentinel-1 scenes varied based on seasonal and weather conditions. Overall, this indicates the potential of an SAR-based estimation of forest volume transmissivity and opens a possible way of fruitful active-passive microwave satellite data integration.

TI  - Assessing and mapping the severity of soil erosion using the 30-m Landsat multispectral satellite data in the former South African homelands of Transkei
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is increasingly recognised as the principal cause of land degradation, loss of agricultural land area and siltation of surrounding water waterbodies. Accurate and up-to-date soil erosion mapping is key in understanding its severity if these negative impacts are to be minimised and affected areas rehabilitated. The aim of this work was to map the severity of soil erosion, based on the 30-m Landsat series multispectral satellite data in the former South African homelands of Transkei between the year 1994 and 2010. Further, the study assessed if the observed soil erosion trends and morphology that existed in this area could be explained by biophysical factors (i.e. slope, stream erosivity, topographic wetness index) retrieved from the 30-m ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The results of this study indicate that the Transkei region experiences varying erosion levels from moderate to very severe. The large portion of the land area under the former homelands was largely affected by rill erosion with approximately 74% occurring in the year 1984 and 54% in 2010. The results also revealed specific thresholds of soil erosion drivers. These include steeper areas (>= 30 degrees), high stream power index greater than 2.0 (stream erosivity), relatively lower vegetation cover (<= 15%) and low topographic wetness index (<= 5%). The results of this work demonstrate the severity of soil erosion in the Southern African former homelands of Transkei for the year 1984 and 2010. Additionally, this work has demonstrated the significance of the 30-m Landsat multispectral sensor in examining soil erosion occurrence at a regional scale where in-depth field work still remains a challenging task.

T2  - SAINS MALAYSIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Determination of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) distribution in the coastal waters is important to understand the coastal environmental conditions. This study was conducted to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of Chl-a along coastal waters of east Peninsular Malaysia and factors influencing its variability using Chl-a data derived from Aqua MODIS satellite (1 km spatial resolution) from January 2006 to December 2012. Chl-a variability was described using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. In-situ data (temperature, salinity, density and nitrate) and rainfall data from the Department of Meteorology were analyzed using spatial interpolation to determine factors influencing the distribution of Chl-a. The seasonal progressions of Chl-a showed high value during northeast monsoon along the coast. This variability was described by four modes of the EOF analysis. The first mode (72.08% of total variance) indicated seasonal cycle with high variability along the coast. Second mode (17.03% of variance) explained the northeast monsoon with high variability from river mouth to the south. Third mode (2.39% of variance) indicated variability during southwest monsoon along the coast and much higher to the south. Mode 4 (1.93% of variance) explained the inter-monsoon period observed along the northern and southern coastline. Concentration and distribution of Chl-a were related to availability of nutrient influenced by rainfall. The thermohaline front was also observed to play an important role in accumulation of phytoplankton biomass during northeast and southwest monsoon.

TI  - Bridging the gap between cyclone wind and wave by C-band SAR measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Active microwave remote sensing of hurricane-strength wind is a challenging task due to the saturation of col-polarization backscattering signal under such condition. Here we take advantage of the fact that wind sea wave growth does not saturate at high wind and the intrinsic relationship among wind-wave triplets (sea surface wind speed, significant wave height, and peak wave period) within a tropical storm to derive the wind speed. Three Sentinel-1 (S-1) and nine RADARSAT-2 (R-2) C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired between 20 and 40 m/s winds are collected in this study. The S-1 and R-2 SAR-derived winds are compared with those measured by coincident National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) and simulated by Symmetric Hurricane Estimates for Wind (SHEW) model. Validations against SFMR winds for S-1 show Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) of 1.7 m/s with a 0.2 m/s bias at the left side of cyclone centers and RMSE of 2.9 m/s RMSE with a 0.56 bias at the backside of cyclone centers. R-2 SAR-derived winds against SHEW model results show a RMSE of 2.4 m/s with a 0.3 m/s bias and 2.6 m/s with a 0.35 m/s bias at the right side and the left side of cyclone centers, while the RMSE is 3.9 m/s with a 0.1 m/s bias at the backside of cyclone centers. The wave-information-based wind retrieval method works well at the left side and right side, but less accurately at the backside of a tropical storm when wind wave and swell are mixed.

TI  - Preliminary Assessment of Wind and Wave Retrieval from Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) launched by the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) has operated at C-band since September 2016. To date, we have collected 16/42 images in vertical-vertical (VV)/horizontal-horizontal (HH) polarization, covering the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy measurements of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) around U.S. western coastal waters. Wind speeds from NDBC in situ buoys are up to 15 m/s and buoy-measured significant wave height (SWH) has ranged from 0.5 m to 3 m. In this study, winds were retrieved using the geophysical model function (GMF) together with the polarization ratio (PR) model and waves were retrieved using a new empirical algorithm based on SAR cutoff wavelength in satellite flight direction, herein called CSAR_ WAVE. Validation against buoy measurements shows a 1.4/1.9 m/s root mean square error (RMSE) of wind speed and a 24/23% scatter index (SI) of SWH for VV/HH polarization. In addition, wind and wave retrieval results from 166 GF-3 images were compared with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) re-analysis winds, as well as the SWH from the WaveWatch-III model, respectively. Comparisons show a 2.0 m/s RMSE for wind speed with a 36% SI of SWH for VV-polarization and a 2.2 m/s RMSE for wind speed with a 37% SI of SWH for HH-polarization. Our work gives a preliminary assessment of the wind and wave retrieval results from GF-3 SAR images for the first time and will provide guidance for marine applications of GF-3 SAR.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variations in plantation forests' disturbance and recovery of northern Guangdong Province using yearly Landsat time series observations (1986-2015)
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbance plays a vital role in modulating carbon storage, biodiversity and climate change. Yearly Landsat imagery from 1986 to 2015 of a typical plantation region in the northern Guangdong province of southern China was used as a case study. A Landsat time series stack (LTSS) was fed to the vegetation change tracker model (VCT) to map long-term changes in plantation forests' disturbance and recovery, followed by an intensive validation and a continuous 27-yr change analysis on disturbance locations, magnitudes and rates of plantations' disturbance and recovery. And the validation results of the disturbance year maps derived from five randomly identified sample plots with 25 km(2) located at the four corners and the center of the scene showed the majority of the spatial agreement measures ranged from 60% to 83%. A confusion matrix summary of the accuracy measures for all four validation sites in Fogang County showed that the disturbance year maps had an overall accuracy estimate of 71.70%. Forest disturbance rates' change trend was characterized by a decline first, followed by an increase, then giving way to a decline again. An undulated and gentle decreasing trend of disturbance rates from the highest value of 3.95% to the lowest value of 0.76% occurred between 1988 and 2001, disturbance rate of 4.51% in 1994 was a notable anomaly, while after 2001 there was a sharp ascending change, forest disturbance rate spiked in 2007 (5.84%). After that, there was a significant decreasing trend up to the lowest value of 1.96% in 2011 and a slight ascending trend from 2011 to 2015 (2.59%). Two obvious spikes in post-disturbance recovery rates occurred in 1995 (0.26%) and 2008 (0.41%). Overall, forest recovery rates were lower than forest disturbance rates. Moreover, forest disturbance and recovery detection based on VCT and the Landsat-based detections of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr) algorithms in Fogang County have been conducted, with LandTrendr finding mostly much more disturbance than VCT. Overall, disturbances and recoveries in northern Guangdong were triggered mostly by timber needs, policies and decisions of the local governments. This study highlights that a better understanding about plantations' changes would provide a critical foundation for local forest management decisions in the southern China.

TI  - Sea ice extent retrieval with HY-2A scatterometer data and its assessment
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A sea ice extent retrieval algorithm over the polar area based on scatterometer data of 14Y-2A satellite has been established. Four parameters are used for distinguishing between sea ice and ocean with Fisher's linear discriminant analysis method. The method is used to generate polar sea ice extent maps of the Arctic and Antarctic regions of the full 2013-2014 from the scatterometer aboard HY-2A (HY-2A-SCAT) backscatter data. The time series of the ice mapped imagery shows ice edge evolution and indicates a similar seasonal change trend with total ice area from DMSP-F17 Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) sea ice concentration data. For both hemispheres, the HY-2A-SCAT extent correlates very well with SSMIS 15% extent for the whole year period. Compared with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, the HY-2A-SCAT ice extent shows good correlation with the Sentinel-1 SAR ice edge. Over some ice edge area, the difference is very evident because sea ice edges can be very dynamic and move several kilometers in a single day.

TI  - Slowdown of sea surface height rises in the Nordic seas and related mechanisms
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A slowdown of sea surface height (SSH) rise occurred in the Nordic (GIN) seas around 2004. In this study, SSH satellite data and constructed steric height data for the decades before and after 2004 (i.e., May 1994 to April 2014) were used for comparative analysis. The findings indicate that the rate of slowdown of SSH rises in the GIN seas (3.0 mm/a) far exceeded that of the global mean (0.6 mm/a). In particular, the mean steric height of the GIN seas increased at a rate of 4.5 mm/a and then decreased at a slower pace. This was the main factor responsible for the stagnation of the SSH rises, while the mass factor only increased slightly. The Norwegian Sea particularly experienced the most prominent slowdown in SSH rises, mainly due to decreased warming of the 0-600 m layer. The controlling factors of this decreased warming were cessation in the increase of volume of the Atlantic inflow and stagnation of warming of the inflow. However, variations in air-sea thermal flux were not a major factor. In the recent two decades, mean halosteric components of the GIN seas decreased steadily and remained at a rate of 2 mm/a or more because of increased flow and salinity of the Atlantic inflow during the first decade, and reduction in freshwater inputs from the Arctic Ocean in the second decade.

TI  - Four decades of the morphological dynamics of the lakes in the Jianghan Plain using Landsat observations
T2  - WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Using four decades of Landsat observations between 1978 and 2014, we documented and studied the long-term dynamics of the inundation conditions in the Jianghan Plain, Central China. Three morphological factors, including inundation areas, perimeters and shoreline developments (SDs), of the 51 selected lakes were calculated. Significant long-term morphological changes were found in lakes in the Jianghan Plain. The total area dramatically increased from 838.0 km(2) in 1978 to 1200.8 km(2) in 1989, and an overall decreasing trend was observed in the later period. The changing patterns of the perimeters and SDs were different from the inundation areas, especially for the largest lake in this area (Honghu). The inconsistent changes between the inundation area and the other two morphological parameters were likely caused by increasing human activities. This study demonstrated the importance of remote sensing in obtaining multi-decadal lake changes in terms of both the inundation area and the morphological complexity.

TI  - Identification of sentinel lymph nodes by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography with Sonazoid in patients with breast cancer: a feasibility study in three hospitals
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the feasibility of periareolar injection of the contrast agent Sonazoid (SNZ) followed by ultrasonography (US) for the identification of sentinel lymph node (SLN) in breast cancer patients with clinically negative node. Patients (n = 100) with T1-2N0M0 breast cancer received a periareolar injection of SNZ followed by US to identify contrast-enhanced SLN. Each contrast-enhanced SLN underwent fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) followed by SLN biopsy with a conventional method using blue dye and/or radiocolloid (B/R). In almost all cases, contrast-enhanced lymphatic vessels were clearly visualized by US soon after the periareolar injection of SNZ and the SLNs were easily identified with an identification rate of 98% (98/100) for SNZ and 100% (100/100) for B/R. The number of SLNs identified by SNZ (SNZ-SLN) (mean per patient, 1.52) was significantly lower than that identified by B/R (B/R-SLN) (2.19) (P < 0.0001). Twenty-five patients with positive SLNs had at least one positive SNZ-SLN. On a node-by-node basis, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FNAC for SNZ-SLNs (n = 149) were 33.3%, 99.2%, and 85.9%, respectively. Identification of SLN by periareolar injection of SNZ is a technically simple method with an identification rate as high as 98%. SNZ-SLN thus seems to be a good target for FNAC, but sensitivity of FNAC for SNZ-SLNs needs to be improved.

TI  - New decision-making processes for the pricing of health technologies in Japan: The FY 2016/2017 pilot phase for the introduction of economic evaluations
T2  - HEALTH POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic evaluation is used for decision-making processes in healthcare technologies in many developed countries. In Japan, no health economic data have been requested for drugs, medical devices, and interventions till date. However, economic evaluation is gradually gaining importance, and a trial implementation of the cost-effectiveness evaluation of drugs and medical devices has begun. Discussions on economic evaluation began in May 2012 within a newly established sub-committee of the Chuikyo, referred to as the Special Committee on Cost Effectiveness.After four years of discussions, this committee determined that during the trial implementation, the results of the cost-effectiveness evaluation would be used for the re-pricing of drugs and medical devices at the end of fiscal year (FY) 2017. Chuikyo selected 13 products (7 drugs and 6 medical devices) as targets for this evaluation. These products will be evaluated until the end of FY 2017 based on the following process: manufacturers will submit the data of economic evaluation; the National Institute of Public Health will coordinate the review process; academic groups will perform the actual review of the submitted data, and the expert committee will appraise these data. This represents the first step to introducing cost-effectiveness analysis in the Japanese healthcare system. We believe that these efforts will contribute to the efficiency and sustainability of the Japanese healthcare system. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Using remotely sensed data sets of rainfall and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) over Indian land and adjacent oceanic regions and sea surface temperature (SST) over adjacent oceanic regions; we examine the major characteristics of the intra-seasonal oscillations of Indian summer monsoon (ISM) during the flood and drought years. Intra-seasonal oscillations of rain, OLR and SST corresponding to 30-60 days transpires to contribute more to the infra-seasonal variability over the Arabian Sea, whereas 10-20 days' mode is found to be more dominating over the Bay of Bengal during the drought years. Therefore, suggesting that both of the Seas surrounding the Indian land region respond in a different way to the below normal rainfall conditions of Indian land region. Another important finding of the present work is that during the drought years, 30-60 days intra-seasonal oscillations of SST over both of the seas follow the intra-seasonal oscillations of rain at 30-60 days' time scale over central India approximately after 26 days. Conversely in the flood years, intra-seasonal oscillations of SST at 30-60 days over the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal lead the intra-seasonal oscillations of rain over central India by 6 days. Present analysis also reveals that the intra-seasonal variability of ISM at two different time-scales (10-20 and 3060 days) possess different spatio-temporal characteristics during the contrasting monsoon conditions over the oceanic regions; therefore it is advisable to study the two modes individually for understanding the underlying physical mechanism. Results presented in this paper may be useful for improved ISM prediction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Geostatistical Methods for Filling Gaps in Level-3 Monthly-Mean Aerosol Optical Depth Data from Multi-Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrieved from satellite remote sensing measurements such as from MISR and MODIS, both onboard the Terra platform, are widely used for studying regional and global patterns of aerosol loading. Aerosol products from these sensors are also used for analyzing feedbacks and relationship between aerosols and climatic variables including clouds, precipitation, and radiation fluxes. Several statistical techniques leading to the understanding of such relationships, including empirical orthogonal function and temporal trend extraction methods, require spatially complete AOD data records. Inherent to remote sensing of aerosols, cloud cover significantly affects aerosol retrievals and results in missing data across the AOD products. This paper demonstrates widely-used geostatistical techniques, such as Co-Kriging (CK) and Regression Kriging (RK), for spatially-filling missing data in the MISR AOD product for the period 2001-2013. Among the unique characteristics of this data-filling algorithm is that it utilizes additional AOD information obtained from MODIS. The mean accuracy of the predicted MISR AOD using CK method is estimated to be 0.05, globally. The gap-filled MISR AOD data are also compared with 131 ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations, located around the world. It is found that Root Mean Squared Error of the gap-filled AOD dataset and the original MISR AOD product with respect to AERONET data are 0.143. The gap-filled AOD dataset can be used in applications where the presence of missing values is undesirable such as for global/regional aerosol variability and trend analysis.

TI  - Arctic Sea Ice Characterization Using RISAT-1 Compact-Pol SAR Imagery and Feature Evaluation: A Case Study Over Northeast Greenland
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetry has become a valuable tool in space-borne SAR-based sea ice analysis. The two major objectives in SAR-based remote sensing of sea ice are, on the one hand, to have a large coverage and, on the other hand, to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible in order to characterize sea ice. Single-polarimetric acquisitions of existing sensors offer a wide coverage on the ground, whereas dual polarimetric or even better fully polarimetric data offer a higher information content, which allows for a more reliable automated sea ice analysis at a cost of smaller swath. In order to reconcile the advantages of fully polarimetric acquisitions with the higher ground coverage of acquisitions with fewer polarimetric channels, hybrid/compact polarimetric acquisitions offer an excellent tradeoff between the mentioned objectives. With the advent of the RISAT-1 satellite platform, we are able to explore the potential of compact dual pol acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification. Our algorithmic approach for an automated sea ice classification consist of two steps. In the first step, we perform a feature extraction followed by a feature evaluation procedure. The resulting feature vectors are then ingested into a trained artificial neural network classifier to arrive at a pixel-wise supervised classification. We present a comprehensive polarimetric feature analysis and classification results on a dataset acquired off the eastern Greenland coast, along with comparisons of results obtained from near-coincident (spatially and temporally) C-band fully polarimetric imagery acquired by RADARSAT-2.

TI  - Smoke haze over the European part of Russia in the summer of 2016: A link to wildfires in Siberia and atmospheric circulation anomalies
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mechanism of smoke haze formation over the European part of Russia (EPR) in the summer of 2016 is analyzed using satellite measurements, ground-based observations, reanalysis data, and trajectory modeling. The analysis reveals that smoke in the atmosphere over EPR with the aerosol optical depth increase up to 3 was caused by the long-range transport of combustion products from Siberian wildfires. The increase in the concentration of smoke aerosol in the atmosphere over EPR was accompanied by the increase in the concentration of carbon monoxide in the air. The long-range atmospheric transport of the products of pyrogenic emission from east to west for a distance up to 5000 km with the speed of 5-6 m/s predominantly occurred in the lower troposphere. The peculiarities of tropospheric circutation over Northern Eurasia in July 2016 are identified which were responsible for the transport of combustion products in the troposphere for thousands of kilometers in the direction opposite to the westerlies that prevail in the mid-latitudes.

TI  - Prognostic implications of occult nodal tumour cells in stage I and II colon cancer The correlation between micrometastasis and disease recurrence
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Occult nodal tumour cells should be categorised as micrometastasis (MMs) and isolated tumour cells (ITCs). A recent meta analysis demonstrated that MMs, but not ITCs, are prognostic for disease recurrence in patients with stage I/II colon cancer.Aims & methods: The objective of this retrospective multicenter study was to correlate MMs and ITCs to characteristics of the primary tumour, and to determine their prognostic value in patients with stage I/II colon cancer.Results: One hundred ninety two patients were included in the study with a median follow up of 46 month (IQR 33-81 months). MMs were found in eight patients (4.2%), ITCs in 37 (19.3%) and occult tumour cells were absent in 147 patients (76.6%). Between these groups, tumour differentiation and venous or lymphatic invasion was equally distributed. Advanced stage (pT3/pT4) was found in 66.0% of patients without occult tumour cells (97/147), 72.9% of patients with ITCs (27/37), and 100% in patients with MMs (8/8), although this was a nonsignificant trend. Patients with MMs showed a significantly reduced 3 year-disease free survival compared to patients with ITCs or patients without occult tumour cells (75.0% versus 88.0% and 94.8%, respectively, p = 0.005). When adjusted for T-stage, MMs independently predicted recurrence of cancer (OR 7.6 95% CI 1.5-37.4, p = 0.012).Conclusion: In this study, the incidence of MMs and ITCs in patients with stage I/II colon cancer was 4.2% and 19.3%, respectively. ATMs were associated with an reduced 3 year disease free survival rate, but ITCs were not.

TI  - Intercomparison between CMIP5 model and MODIS satellite-retrieved data of aerosol optical depth, cloud fraction, and cloud-aerosol interactions
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols are a critical component of the Earth's atmosphere and can affect the climate of the Earth through their interactions with solar radiation and clouds. Cloud fraction (CF) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used with analogous cloud and aerosol properties from Historical Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) model runs that explicitly include anthropogenic aerosols and parameterized cloud-aerosol interactions. The models underestimate AOD by approximately 15% and underestimate CF by approximately 10% overall on a global scale. A regional analysis is then used to evaluate model performance in two regions with known biomass burning activity and absorbing aerosol (South America (SAM) and South Africa (SAF)). In SAM, the models overestimate AOD by 4.8% and underestimate CF by 14%. In SAF, the models underestimate AOD by 35% and overestimate CF by 13.4%. Average annual cycles show that the monthly timing of AOD peaks closely match satellite data in both SAM and SAF for all except the Community Atmosphere Model 5 and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) models. Monthly timing of CF peaks closely match for all models (except GFDL) for SAM and SAF. Sorting monthly averaged 2 degrees x 2.5 degrees model or MODIS CF as a function of AOD does not result in the previously observed "boomerang"-shaped CF versus AOD relationship characteristic of regions with absorbing aerosols from biomass burning. Cloud-aerosol interactions, as observed using daily (or higher) temporal resolution data, are not reproducible at the spatial or temporal resolution provided by the CMIP5 models.Plain Language Summary Aerosols, or suspended particles, are a critical component of the Earth's atmosphere and can affect the climate of the Earth through their interactions with solar radiation and clouds. To understand how aerosols impact clouds, measurements are made from space on satellites and simulated using global climate models. Here we compare the results of several global climate models that include explicit simulations of aerosol-cloud interactions with observations from satellites over the same time period (2000-2005). Seasonally, we find that the global climate models both underestimate and overestimate aerosols and clouds over different regions of the Earth. Looking at individual months, the models do a better job of estimating what months there should be more or less aerosols and aerosols. To further investigate how well models simulate the space-based measurements, we look at two regions (South America and South Africa) that are dominated by smoke aerosols. Using both the satellite and model data, we compared these regions and found that the models, which give information on a monthly time scale, are not detailed enough in time to see relationships that are usually seen on a daily time scale from space. Overall, for aerosol-cloud interactions to be simulated realistically models need to improve.

TI  - A prospective validation study of sentinel lymph node mapping for high-risk endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping continues to evolve in the surgical staging of endometrial cancer (EC). The purpose of this trial was to identify the sensitivity, false negative rate (FNR) and FN predictive value (FNPV) of SLN compared to complete pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy (LAD) in women with high-risk EC.Methods. Women with high-risk EC (grade 3, serous, clear cell, carcinosarcoma) were enrolled in this prospective surgical trial. All patients underwent preoperative PET/CT and intraoperative SLN biopsy followed by LAD. Patients with peritoneal disease on imaging or at the time of surgery were excluded. Patients were evaluable if SLN was attempted and complete LAD was performed.Results. 123 patients were enrolled between 4/13 and 5/16; 101 were evaluable. At least 1 SLN was identified in 89% (90); bilateral detection 58%, unilateral pelvic 40%, para-aortic only 2%. Indocyanine green was used in 61%, blue dye in 28%, and blue dye and technetium in 11%. Twenty-three pts. (23%) had >= 1 positive node. In 20/23, >= 1 SLN was identified and in 19/20 the SLN was positive. Only 1 patient had bilateral negative SLN and positive non-SLNs on final pathology. Overall, sensitivity of SLN was 95% (19/20), FNR was 5% (1/20) and FNPV was 1.4% (1/71). If side-specific LAD was performed when a SLN was not detected, the FNR decreased to 4.3% (1/23).Conclusion. This prospective trial demonstrated that SLN biopsy plus side -specific LAD, when SLN is not detected, is a reasonable alternative to a complete LAD in high-risk endometrial cancer.

TI  - Predictive Value of <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG PET/CT for Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Invasive Ductal Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. This study assessed whether primary tumor maximum standardized uptake value (pSUV(max)) measured by F-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (F-18-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) could improve the prediction of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis in invasive ductal breast cancer (IDC).Methods. In this study, 128 IDC patients who underwent pretreatment F-18-FDG PET/CT and surgical resection of primary tumor with sentinel lymph node biopsy, ALN dissection, or both were analyzed. All the patients were classified as five molecular subtypes. The optimal cutoff values of pSUVmax for all the patients and each molecular subtype for the prediction of ALN metastasis were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Furthermore, the prognostic accuracy of ALN metastasis was assessed using c-statistics.Results. The findings showed ALN metastasis in 52 patients (40.6%). The F-18-FDG PET/CT procedure had a sensitivity of 48.1% and a specificity of 94.7% for ALN metastasis. In the ROC analysis of pSUVmax for ALN metastasis, the optimal cutoff value was 3.9 for all the patients, 2.8 for the luminal A subtype, 3.3 for the luminal B (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative) subtype, 5.3 for the luminal B (HER2-positive) subtype, 12.7 for the HER2-positive subtype, and 11.5 for the triple-negative subtype. A predictive ALN metastasis model using nodal F-18-FDG uptake finding gave a c-statistic of 0.714, and a model combination of nodal F-18-FDG uptake finding with pSUV(max) of all the patients gave a c-statistic of 0.736 (P = 0.3926). However, the combination of nodal the F-18-FDG uptake finding with the pSUV(max) of each molecular subtype gave a c-statistic of 0.791 (P = 0.0047).Conclusions. Combining the pSUV(max) of each molecular subtype with the nodal F-18-FDG uptake finding can improve the prediction of ALN metastasis in IDC.

TI  - Ocean Oil Spill Classification with RADARSAT-2 SAR Based on an Optimized Wavelet Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill accidents from ship or oil platform cause damage to marine and coastal environment and ecosystems. To monitor such spill events from space, fully polarimetric (Pol-SAR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been greatly used in improving oil spill observation. Aiming to promote ocean oil spill classification accuracy, we developed a new oil spill identification method by combining multiple fully polarimetric SAR features data with an optimized wavelet neural network classifier (WNN). Two sets of RADARSAT-2 fully polarimetric SAR data are applied to test the validity of the developed method. The experimental results show that: (1) the convergence ability of optimized WNN can be enhanced, improving overall classification accuracy of ocean oil spill, in comparison to the classification results based on a common un-optimized WNN classifier; and (2) the joint use of the multiple fully Pol-SAR features as the inputs of the classifier can achieve better classification result than that only with single fully Pol-SAR feature. The developed method can improve classification accuracy by 4.96% and 7.75%, compared with the classification results with un-optimized WNN and only with one single fully polarimetric SAR feature. The classification overall accuracy based on the proposed approach can reach 97.67%. Experimental results have proven that the proposed approach is effective and applicable to classify the ocean oil spill.

TI  - Estimation of Land Surface Temperature Using FengYun-2E (FY-2E) Data: A Case Study of the Source Area of the Yellow River
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable used for studies of water cycles and energy budgets of land-atmosphere interfaces. This study addresses the theory of LST retrieval from data acquired by the Chinese operational geostationary meteorological satellite FengYun-2E (FY-2E) in two thermal infrared channels (IR1: 10.29-11.45 mu m and IR2: 11.59-12.79 mu m) using a generalized split-window algorithm. Specifically, land surface emissivity (LSE) in the two thermal infrared channels is estimated from the LSE in channels 31 and 32 of the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) product. In addition, an eight-day composition MODIS LSE product (MOD11A2) and the daily MODIS LSE product (MOD11A1) are used in the algorithm to estimate FY-2E emissivities. The results indicate that the LST derived from MOD11A1 is more accurate and, therefore, more appropriate for daily cloud-free LST estimation. Finally, the estimated LST was validated using the MODIS LST product for the heterogeneous source area of the Yellow River. The results show a significant correlation between the two datasets, with a correlation coefficient (R) varying from 0.60 to 0.94 and a root mean square error ranging from 1.89 to 3.71 K. Moreover, the estimated LST agrees well with ground-measured soil temperatures, with an R of 0.98.

TI  - Evaluating Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Data to Map Sucessional Forest Stages in a Subtropical Forest in Southern Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies designed to discriminate different successional forest stages play a strategic role in forest management, forest policy and environmental conservation in tropical environments. The discrimination of different successional forest stages is still a challenge due to the spectral similarity among the concerned classes. Considering this, the objective of this paper was to investigate the performance of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data for discriminating different successional forest stages of a patch located in a subtropical portion of the Atlantic Rain Forest in Southern Brazil with the aid of two machine learning algorithms and relying on the use of spectral reflectance data selected over two seasons and attributes thereof derived. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used as classifiers with different subsets of predictor variables (multitemporal spectral reflectance, textural metrics and vegetation indices). All the experiments reached satisfactory results, with Kappa indices varying between 0.9, with Landsat-8 spectral reflectance alone and the SVM algorithm, and 0.98, with Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance alone also associated with the SVM algorithm. The Landsat-8 data had a significant increase in accuracy with the inclusion of other predictor variables in the classification process besides the pure spectral reflectance bands. The classification methods SVM and RF had similar performances in general. As to the RF method, the texture mean of the red-edge and SWIR bands were considered the most important ranked attributes for the classification of Sentinel-2 data, while attributes resulting from multitemporal bands, textural metrics of SWIR bands and vegetation indices were the most important ones in the Landsat-8 data classification.

TI  - An Evidence-Based Approach to Reducing Cardiac Telemetry Alarm Fatigue
T2  - WORLDVIEWS ON EVIDENCE-BASED NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: It is estimated that between 80% and 99% of alarms in the clinical areas are in actionable alarms (Gross, Dahl, & Nielson). Alarm management is one of the Joint Commission's National Patient Safety Goals (2014) because sentinel events have directly been linked to the devices generating these alarms.Purpose: At an acute care facility in Boston, a multidisciplinary team consisting of Nursing, Biomedical Engineers, Patient Safety and Providers was formed to conduct a pilot study on the state of telemetry alarms on a surgical floor.Methods: An evidence-based approach was taken utilizing Philips Real-time data exporter alarms tracking software to capture all telemetry alarms during a 43-day time span. Likewise, noise meters were placed near telemetry alarm speakers to track decibel levels within the aforementioned timeframe for 21 days. Analysis of the data showed that clinically insignificant Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVC) alarms accounted for more than 40% of all alarms in the unit within the time span, while also contributing to an average noise level of 58.49 dB. In response to the data, the interdisciplinary team approved to permanently default the settings for PAIR PVC, MULTIFORM PVC, and RUN PVC alarms to off.Results: The results showed a 54% decrease in the rate of alarms per bed per day, and an average noise reduction of 2.3 dB between the two selected noise measurement areas.Linking Evidence to Action: Organizing a multidisciplinary team provides an effective framework toward analyzing and addressing cardiac telemetry alarm fatigue. Looking at quantitative datasets for clinical care areas through various lenses helps identify opportunities for improvement in regards to highlighting alarms that are not actionable. Pilot changes to alarm parameters can be tested for their environmental impact in the care area.

Hence, in this study, indirect ET estimation methods, such as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite-based remote-sensing techniques and the water-budget approach built into the semidistributed variable infiltration capacity (VIC-3L) land-surface model are evaluated using the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation approach suggested in the literature together with a crop coefficient approach. To answer the research question of whether regional or local controls of a river basin with tropical monsoon-type climatology affect the accuracy of the VIC and MODIS-based ET estimates, these methodologies are applied in the Kangsabati River Basin in eastern India at 25 x 25 km resolutions attributed with dominant paddy land uses. The results reveal that the VIC-estimated ET values are reasonably matched with the PM-based ET estimates with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 54.14-71.94%; however, the corresponding MODIS-ET values are highly underestimated with a periodic shift that may be attributed to the cloud cover and leaf shadowing effects. To enhance the field applicability of the satellite-based MODIS-ET products, these estimates are standardized by using a genetic-algorithm-based transformation that improves the NSE from -390.83 to 99.57%. Hence, this study reveals that there is the need of a regional-scale standardization of the MODIS-ET products using the PM or lysimeter data or possible modification of the MOD16A2 algorithm built-into the MODIS for generalization. Conversely, the satisfactory grid-scale ET estimates by the VIC model show that this model could be reliably used for the world's river basins; however, at smaller temporal scales, the estimates could be slightly inconsistent.

TI  - The role of topography and the north Indian monsoon on mean monthly climate interpolation within the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial climate datasets currently available for Bhutan are limited by weather station data availability, spatial resolution or interpolation methodology. This article presents new datasets for monthly maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation and vapour pressure climate normals interpolated for the 1986-2015 reference period using trivariate smoothing splines. The inclusion of standardized day time Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) values as partial spline dependencies reduced cross validated root mean square error (RMSE) for maximum temperature by up to 16.0% and was most effective between March and September. Using both a topographic index of relative elevation and standardized night time MODIS LST values as partial spline dependencies reduced monthly mean minimum temperature RMSE by up to 23.4%. Neither variable was effective for minimum temperature interpolation between June and September. High humidity, extensive cloud cover and heavy precipitation occur during these months, which are likely to suppress the formation of temperature inversions that typically form under clear, calm conditions. These new temperature and precipitation surfaces show distinct differences from the WorldClim and CRU CL 2.0 datasets, which do not use weather stations within Bhutan for calibration. New precipitation surfaces better describe the heavy rainfall experienced in the southern foothills while retaining the effect of orography throughout the central valleys and ranges. The development of vapour pressure surfaces also allow for the calculation of ecologically important variables such as vapour pressure deficit, and may also be useful for solar radiation modelling in the region. The different datasets presented in this article will facilitate ecological and agricultural research in Bhutan and provide high quality surfaces needed for future climate change scenarios.

TI  - Melanoma patient imaging in the era of effective systemic therapies
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Imaging plays a critical role in the current multi-disciplinary management of patients with melanoma. It is used for primary disease staging, surgical planning, and surveillance in high-risk patients, and for monitoring the effects of systemic or loco -regional therapies. Several different imaging modalities have been utilised in the past. Contemporary imaging practises vary geographically depending on clinical guidelines, physician preferences, availability and cost.Targeted therapies and immunotherapies have revolutionised the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma over the last few years. With this have come new patterns of disease that were not observed after conventional therapies, and new criteria to assess therapeutic responses. In this article we review the role of imaging for patients with melanoma in the era of effective systemic therapies and discuss likely future developments.

TI  - Histopathologic review of negative sentinel lymph node biopsies in thin melanomas: an argument for the routine use of immunohistochemistry
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is performed for some thin melanomas in the presence of concerning histopathological features. There are no defined standards for how sentinel nodes should be processed to detect microscopic metastases. We compared our method of serially sectioning nodes at 2-3mm intervals and performing one hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slide versus multiple H&E levels and utilizing immunohistochemistry (IHC). This was a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database identified patients with thin melanomas treated with wide local excision and SLNB between 1995 and 2010. Two patients had positive nodes. Out of 95 patients with negative SLNBs, 48 (49 nodes) patients were evaluable. Additional sections of each SLNB tissue block were stained with H&E (x2), Melan-A (x2) and HMB45 (x2), and reviewed by two pathologists. Additional histopathological sections showed that 1/49 (2.0%) nodes originally called negative had evidence of metastasis, which was evident both on additional H&E levels and by IHC; 3/49 (6.1%) nodes had benign nodal rests. All other nodes (45/49, 91.8%) were negative by H&E and IHC for metastatic disease. This study supports previous work suggesting the value of IHC in detecting micrometastases in melanoma sentinel nodes. Especially for thin melanomas where metastases are uncommon, but where detection of the metastasis upstages considerably from stage IA to IIIA, evaluation of nodes may be enhanced by combining breadloafing at 2-3mm intervals with multiple H&E sections and IHC analysis.

TI  - An analysis on the influence of spatial scales on sensible heat fluxes in the north Tibetan Plateau based on Eddy covariance and large aperture scintillometer data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of spatial scales on surface fluxes is an interesting but not fully investigated question. This paper presents an analysis on the influence of spatial scales on surface fluxes in the north Tibetan Plateau based on eddy covariance (EC) and large aperture scintillometer (LAS) data at site Nagqu/BJ, combined with the land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The analysis shows that sensible heat fluxes calculated with LAS data (H_LAS) agree reasonably well with sensible heat fluxes calculated with EC data (H_EC) in the rain and dry seasons. The difference in their footprints due to the wind direction is an important reason for the differences in H_EC and H_LAS. The H_LAS are statistically more consistent with H_EC when their footprints overlap than when their footprints do not. A detailed analysis on H_EC and H_LAS changes with net radiation and wind direction in rain and dry season indicates that the spatial heterogeneity in net radiation created by clouds contributes greatly to the differences in H_EC and H_LAS in short-term variations. A significant relationship between the difference in footprint-weighted averages of LST and difference in H_EC and H_LAS suggests that the spatial heterogeneity in LST at two spatial scales is a reason for the differences in H_EC and H_LAS and that LST has a positive correlation with the differences in H_EC and H_LAS. A significant relationship between the footprint-weighted averages of NDVI and the ratio of sensible heat fluxes at two spatial scales to net radiation (H/Rn) in the rain season supports the analysis that the spatial heterogeneity in canopy at two spatial scales is another reason for differences in H_EC and H_LAS and that canopy has a negative correlation with (H/Rn). An analysis on the influence of the difference in aerodynamic roughness lengths at two spatial scales on sensible heat fluxes shows that the influence is greater in the dry season and smaller in the rain season because the ratio of z(0m)_(LAS) to z(0m)_(EC) is big in the dry season and is close to 1.0 in the rain season. This study on spatial scales on surface fluxes in the Tibetan Plateau will be helpful in analyzing and understanding its influence on climate.

TI  - Spatio-temporal distribution of localized aerosol loading in China: A satellite view
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, haze pollution and high concentrations of particulate matter frequently occur in many mega cities of China, which has seriously impacted the regional air quality, and further caused harm to human health. Although satellite observation provides a convenient way to evaluate air quality in space and time, satellite measurements do not separate between natural and anthropogenic aerosols. To discriminate anthropogenic aerosol contribution from satellite observations, we proposed the concept of Local Aerosol Optical Depth (LAOD) to describe the localized aerosol loading. A comparative analysis was performed between seasonal/monthly Mean AOD (MAOD), LAOD and ground measured PM2.5/PM10. The comparison results show that LAOD has better linear relationship with PM2.5/PM10 than MAOD in central and eastern China with persistent localized aerosol emissions. Based on the MODIS Deep Blue AOD dataset from 2001 to 2015, we analyzed the spatio-temporal distribution of LAOD over China. Spatially, high LAODs are mainly distributed in Sichuan basin, North China Plain, and central China; temporally, LAOD over China presents an upward trend (+0.003 year(-1)) during 2001-2007 and a weak downward (-0.002 year(-1)) trend from 2008 to 2015. LAOD was also found to be highly correlated with haze frequency over most areas of central and eastern China, especially in North China Plain with a correlation coefficient of 0.87 (P < 0.01). It demonstrates the significant impact of local anthropogenic aerosol emission on regional haze pollution in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Reconstructing daily clear-sky land surface temperature for cloudy regions from MODIS data
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a critical parameter in environmental studies and resource management. The MODIS LST data product has been widely used in various studies, such as drought monitoring, evapotranspiration mapping, soil moisture estimation and forest fire detection. However, cloud contamination affects thermal band observations and will lead to inconsistent LST results. In this study, we present a new Remotely Sensed DAily land Surface Temperature reconstruction (RSDAST) model that recovers clear sky LST for pixels covered by cloud using only clear-sky neighboring pixels from nearby dates. The reconstructed LST was validated using the original LST pixels. Model shows high accuracy for reconstructing one masked pixel with R-2 of 0.995, bias of -0.02 K and RMSE of 0.51 K. Extended spatial reconstruction results show a better accuracy for flat areas with R-2 of 0.72-0.89, bias of -0.02-0.21 K, and RMSE of 0.92-1.16 K, and for mountain areas with R-2 of 0.81-0.89, bias of 0.35-1.52 K, and RMSE of 1.42-2.24 K. The reconstructed areas show spatial and temporal patterns that are consistent with the clear neighbor areas. In the reconstructed LST and NDVI triangle feature space which is controlled by soil moisture, LST values distributed reasonably and correspond well to the real soil moisture conditions. Our approach shows great potential for reconstructing clear sky LST. under cloudy conditions and provides consistent daily LST which are critical for daily drought monitoring.

TI  - High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data Classification over Urban Areas Using Random Forest Ensemble and Fully Connected Conditional Random Field
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As an intermediate step between raw remote sensing data and digital maps, remote sensing data classification has been a challenging and long-standing problem in the remote sensing research community. In this work, an automated and effective supervised classification framework is presented for classifying high-resolution remote sensing data. Specifically, the presented method proceeds in three main stages: feature extraction, classification, and classified result refinement. In the feature extraction stage, both multispectral images and 3D geometry data are used, which utilizes the complementary information from multisource data. In the classification stage, to tackle the problems associated with too many training samples and take full advantage of the information in the large-scale dataset, a random forest (RF) ensemble learning strategy is proposed by combining several RF classifiers together. Finally, an improved fully connected conditional random field (FCCRF) graph model is employed to derive the contextual information to refine the classification results. Experiments on the ISPRS Semantic Labeling Contest dataset show that the presented 3-stage method achieves 86.9% overall accuracy, which is a new state-of-the-art non-CNN (convolutional neural networks)-based classification method.

TI  - Green Colored Lenses: Worldviews and Motivated Reasoning in the Case of Local Water Scarcity
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies linking local issue severity to public opinion often treat the effect as homogeneous, suggesting a straightforward relationship between issue exposure and policy opinions. It is more likely that individuals perceive local issues in conditional ways. We advance a theory of motivated reasoning whereby worldviews act as a lens through which individuals interpret the world around them. When the observed environment conforms to individuals' prior beliefs, they will be even more likely to perceive risk and call for policy action. When the information presented to them is incongruent with their worldview, increasing issue severity will have a minimal effect. We test our theory by combining an indicator of water scarcity with data from two nationally representative, probability-based panel surveys about water issues in the United States. Analyzing interactive models predicting risk perception and policy preferences, we find that water scarcity drives individuals with opposing environmental worldviews even further apart.

TI  - Specular Reflection Effects Elimination in Terrestrial Laser Scanning Intensity Data Using Phong Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity value recorded by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) systems is significantly influenced by the incidence angle. The incidence angle effect is an object property, which is mainly related to target scattering properties, surface structures, and even some instrumental effects. Most existing models focus on diffuse reflections of rough surfaces and ignore specular reflections, despite that both reflections simultaneously exist in all natural surfaces. Due to the coincidence of the emitter and receiver in TLS, specular reflections can be ignored at large incidence angles. On the contrary, at small incidence angles, TLS detectors can receive a portion of specular reflections. The received specular reflections can trigger highlight phenomenon (hot-spot effects) in the intensity data of the scanned targets, particularly those with a relatively smooth or highly-reflective surface. In this study, a new method that takes diffuse and specular reflections, as well as the instrumental effects into consideration, is proposed to eliminate the specular reflection effects in TLS intensity data. Diffuse reflections and instrumental effects are modeled by a polynomial based on Lambertian reference targets, whereas specular reflections are modeled by the Phong model. The proposed method is tested and validated on different targets scanned by the Faro Focus3D 120 terrestrial scanner. Results imply that the coefficient of variation of the intensity data from a homogeneous surface is reduced by approximately 38% when specular reflections are considered. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method exhibits good feasibility and high accuracy in eliminating the specular reflection effects for intensity image interpretation and 3D point cloud representation by intensity.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance: from global agenda to national strategic plan, Thailand
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Problem In Thailand, antimicrobial resistance has formed a small component of national drug policies and strategies on emerging infectious diseases. However, poor coordination and a lack of national goals and monitoring and evaluation platforms have reduced the effectiveness of the corresponding national actions.Approach On the basis of local evidence and with the strong participation of relevant stakeholders, the first national strategic plan on antimicrobial resistance has been developed in Thailand.Local setting Before the development of the plan, ineffective coordination meant that antimicrobial resistance profiles produced at sentinel hospitals were not used effectively for clinical decision-making. There was no integrated system for the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, no system for monitoring consumption of antimicrobial drugs by humans, livestock and pets and little public awareness of antimicrobial resistance.Relevant changes In August 2016, the Thai government endorsed a national strategic plan on antimicrobial resistance that comprised six strategic actions and five targets. A national steering committee guides the plan's implementation and a module to assess the prevalence of household antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance awareness has been embedded into the biennial national health survey. A national system for the surveillance of antimicrobial consumption has also been initiated.Lessons learnt Strong political commitment, national ownership and adequate multisectoral institutional capacities will be essential for the effective implementation of the national plan. A robust monitoring and evaluation platform now contributes to evidence-based interventions. An integrated system for the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance still needs to be established.

TI  - How Do Aerosol Properties Affect the Temporal Variation of MODIS AOD Bias in Eastern China?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid changes of aerosol sources in eastern China during recent decades could bring considerable uncertainties for satellite retrieval algorithms that assume little spatiotemporal variation in aerosol single scattering properties (such as single scattering albedo (SSA) and the size distribution for fine-mode and coarse mode aerosols) in East Asia. Here, using ground-based observations in six AERONET sites, we characterize typical aerosol optical properties (including their spatiotemporal variation) in eastern China, and evaluate their impacts on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 aerosol retrieval bias. Both the SSA and fine-mode particle sizes increase from northern to southern China in winter, reflecting the effect of relative humidity on particle size. The SSA is similar to 0.95 in summer regardless of the AEROENT stations in eastern China, but decreases to 0.85 in polluted winter in northern China. The dominance of larger and highly scattering fine-mode particles in summer also leads to the weakest phase function in the backscattering direction. By focusing on the analysis of high aerosol optical depth (AOD) (>0.4) conditions, we find that the overestimation of the AOD in Dark Target (DT) retrieval is prevalent throughout the whole year, with the bias decreasing from northern China, characterized by a mixture of fine and coarse (dust) particles, to southern China, which is dominated by fine particles. In contrast, Deep Blue (DB) retrieval tends to overestimate the AOD only in fall and winter, and underestimates it in spring and summer. While the retrievals from both the DT and DB algorithms show a reasonable estimation of the fine-mode fraction of AOD, the retrieval bias cannot be attributed to the bias in the prescribed SSA alone, and is more due to the bias in the prescribed scattering phase function (or aerosol size distribution) in both algorithms. In addition, a large yearly change in aerosol single scattering properties leads to correspondingly obvious variations in the time series of MODIS AOD bias. Our results reveal that the aerosol single scattering properties in the MODIS algorithm are insufficient to describe a large variation of aerosol properties in eastern China (especially change of particle size), and can be further improved by using newer AERONET data.

TI  - Trends and perspectives of space-borne SAR remote sensing for archaeological landscape and cultural heritage applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper provides an overview of the opportunities that image analysts, archaeologists and conservation scientists currently have to use space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for prospection of cultural landscapes and investigation of environmental, land surface and anthropogenic processes that can alter the condition of heritage assets. The benefits of the recent developments in SAR satellite sensors towards higher resolution (up to less than 1 m) and shorter revisiting times (up to a few days) are discussed in relation to established techniques using the two key SAR parameters - amplitude and phase. Selected case studies from Middle East to South America illustrate how SAR can be effectively used to detect subtle archaeological features in modern landscapes, monitor historic sites and assess damage in areas of conflict. These examples form the basis to highlight the current trends in archaeological remote sensing based on space-borne SAR data in the era of the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 constellation and on-demand high resolution space missions such as TerraSAR-X.

TI  - Regional-Scale High Spatial Resolution Mapping of Aboveground Net Primary Productivity (ANPP) from Field Survey and Landsat Data: A Case Study for the Country of Wales
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an alternative approach for high spatial resolution vegetation productivity mapping at a regional scale, using a combination of Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery and widely distributed ground-based Above-ground Net Primary Production (ANPP) estimates. Our method searches through all available single-date NDVI imagery to identify the images which give the best NDVI-ANPP relationship. The derived relationships are then used to predict ANPP values outside of field survey plots. This approach enables the use of the high spatial resolution (30 m) Landsat 8 sensor, despite its low revisit frequency that is further reduced by cloud cover. This is one of few studies to investigate the NDVI-ANPP relationship across a wide range of temperate habitats and strong relationships were observed (R-2 = 0.706), which increased when only grasslands were considered (R-2 = 0.833). The strongest NDVI-ANPP relationships occurred during the spring "green-up" period. A reserved subset of 20% of ground-based ANPP estimates was used for validation and results showed that our method was able to estimate ANPP with a RMSE of 15-21%. This work is important because we demonstrate a general methodological framework for mapping of ANPP from local to regional scales, with the potential to be applied to any temperate ecosystems with a pronounced green up period. Our approach allows spatial extrapolation outside of field survey plots to produce a continuous surface product, useful for capturing spatial patterns and representing small-scale heterogeneity, and well-suited for modelling applications. The data requirements for implementing this approach are also discussed.

TI  - A geospatial decision support system for supporting quality viticulture at the landscape scale
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The world of viticulture connected to wine making has become a very important activity in many inland areas permitting both the generation of important income and the sustaining of agriculture systems.Recent progress in both crop modeling and Decision Support Systems (DSS) applied to viticulture promises important changes that combine both high quality production and environmental sustainability. However, most of this progress is only addressed at the farm level and does not challenge the viticulture landscape, which is a key issue when facing DOC, DOCG areas, wine growers' cooperatives and consortiums and strategic viticulture planning.Thus, this paper aims to demonstrate that a new type of DSS, which is developed on a Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure (GCI) platform, may provide an important web-based operational tool for high quality viticulture as it connects farm and landscape levels better.The GCI platform supports acquisition, management, processing of both static and dynamic data (e.g. pedological, daily climatic, and vineyard distribution), data visualization, and on-the-fly computer applications in order to perform simulation modeling (e.g. grapevine water stress, evaluation of ecosystem services, etc.). These are all potentially accessible via the Web.This is possible thanks to the implementation of a set of modeling clusters that is strongly rooted in soil-plant-atmosphere and physically based simulation modeling.The DSS tool, applied to an area of 20,000 ha in Southern Italy, is designed to address viticulture planning and management by providing operational support for farmers, farmer associations and decision makers involved in the viticulture landscape.Output of the system includes viticulture planning and management scenario analysis, maps and evaluation of potential and current plant water stress.The tool will also be demonstrated through a short selection of practical case studies.

TI  - Central pathology review with two-stage quality assurance for pathological response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the ARTemis Trial
T2  - MODERN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The ARTemis Trial tested standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab in the treatment of HER2-negative early breast cancer. We compare data from central pathology review with report review and also the reporting behavior of the two central pathologists. Eight hundred women with HER2-negative early invasive breast cancer were recruited. Response to chemotherapy was assessed from local pathology reports for pathological complete response in breast and axillary lymph nodes. Sections from the original core biopsy and surgical excision were centrally reviewed by one of two trial pathologists blinded to the local pathology reports. Pathologists recorded response to chemotherapy descriptively and also calculated residual cancer burden. 10% of cases were double-reported to compare the central pathologists' reporting behavior. Full sample retrieval was obtained for 681 of the 781 patients (87%) who underwent surgery within the trial and were evaluable for pathological complete response. Four hundred and eighty-three (71%) were assessed by JSJT, and 198 (29%) were assessed by EP. Residual cancer burden calculations were possible in 587/681 (86%) of the centrally reviewed patients, as 94/681 (14%) had positive sentinel nodes removed before neoadjuvant chemotherapy invalidating residual cancer burden scoring. Good concordance was found between the two pathologists for residual cancer burden classes within the 65-patient quality assurance exercise (kappa 0.63 (95% CI: 0.57-0.69)). Similar results were obtained for the between-treatment arm comparison both from the report review and the central pathology review. For pathological complete response, report review was as good as central pathology review but for minimal residual disease, report review overestimated the extent of residual disease. In the ARTemis Trial central pathology review added little in the determination of pathological complete response but had a role in evaluating low levels of residual disease. Calculation of residual cancer burden was a simple and reproducible method of quantifying response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy as demonstrated by performance comparison of the two pathologists.

TI  - Detection and Estimation of Along-Track Attitude Jitter From Ziyuan-3 Three-Line-Array Images Based on Back-Projection Residuals
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution satellite images (HRSIs) obtained from linear array charge-coupled device sensors always suffer from geometric instability in the presence of attitude jitter. Therefore, detection and compensation of spacecraft attitude jitter in both the cross-track and along-track directions are crucial to improve the geometric accuracy of HRSIs. A number of reports have been made on the detection and estimation of cross-track attitude jitter. However, the detection of the attitude jitter in the along-track direction is more complicated due to the impact of topographic change. This paper presents a novel approach to achieve accurate estimation of the along-track attitude jitter by eliminating the influence of topographic information based on the back-projection residuals of three-line-array (TLA) images. The principle of detection and estimation of along-track attitude jitter is described, and the proposed approach consists of three main components as follows: 1) dense image matching of the TLA images using a comprehensive matching strategy; 2) detection of the back-projection residuals in the line direction caused by attitude jitter; and 3) estimation of the along-track attitude jitter from the back-projection residuals using a genetic algorithm. Experiments were conducted using China's Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) TLA images, and the experimental results reveal that the frequency of the attitude jitter in the along-track direction ranges between 0.6 and 0.7 Hz, which is consistent with the frequency in the cross-track direction observed in our previous study. In addition, a comparison of the results of the proposed approach with those from direct attitude observations shows good consistency, with as little as 0.1-pixel disparity, which demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the geometric accuracy is further improved from a pixel level to a subpixel level and the periodic trend is removed with the compensation of the estimated attitude jitter in addition to the conventional affine compensation, which validates the potential of the proposed approach for geometric accuracy improvement with ZY-3 TLA images.

TI  - Informed consent utilizing satellite imagery in forestry carbon trading with North Korea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Informed consent can assist in mitigating investment risks associated with forestry carbon trading in North Korea by supporting corporate responsibility. Scientific developments for collecting information necessary to informed consent far outpace the development of inter-Korean regulatory frameworks. This paper seeks to identify how the intersection of legal and technological disciplines can foster informed consent, through the responsible application of satellite data. The permanent record of standard satellite remote-sensing systems demonstrates its capability of presenting area-wide visual evidence of forest conditions. Such data are essential to initiating informed consent, establishing a carbon stock baseline, detecting and quantifying rates of land-cover change, and quantifying above-ground biomass stocks as specified in the Kyoto Protocol. This research could be a valuable reference for utilizing the capabilities of satellites with informed consent obligations in North Korea by suggesting the provision of realistic informed consent mechanisms.

M3  - Article

CP  - 15th St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference - Primary Therapy of Early Breast Cancer-Evidence, Controversies, Consensus
CL  - Vienna, AUSTRIA
AB  - Intraoperative assessment of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) has the advantage of allowing breast cancer patients with tumor-positive SLNs to avoid a second surgery by immediately proceeding to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). However, there are several reasons why the use of intraoperative assessment should be questioned. Whereas ALND was traditionally advised for all breast cancer patients with tumor-positive lymph nodes for axillary staging and locoregional control, more recent studies have demonstrated safety of omitting ALND in a substantial number of patients.In addition, there are concerns about the accuracy of intraoperative assessment methods including frozen section analysis, touch preparation cytology and one-step nucleic acid amplification. Moreover, intraoperative assessment of SLNs denies patients the opportunity to contribute to their treatment planning. In our opinion, intraoperative assessment of axillary lymph nodes should be reserved for patients who still have a strict indication for ALND. Patients with clinical node negative disease (cN0) and one or two positive SLNs can be safely treated with breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy. There has been more controversy for cN0 patients who are treated with mastectomy since radiotherapy is not routinely administered in these patients. However, there is increasing evidence that ALND may be omitted in patients undergoing mastectomy who have a low tumor-burden in their SLNs. Therefore, we defend the position that in cN0 patients undergoing mastectomy, SLNB should be performed and full pathologic evaluation of the SLN should be awaited. In cN0 patients undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) intraoperative assessment of SLNs can be omitted since ALND will not provide therapeutic benefit. It is being hypothesized that patients with limited axillary disease prior to NST who remain node-positive after NST could be treated safely with axillary radiotherapy instead of ALND. In these patients, omitting intraoperative assessment might be a reasonable option. In patients with extensive nodal disease prior to NST intraoperative assessment of axillary lymph nodes should be performed. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy for prostate cancer: report from a consensus panel meeting
T2  - BJU INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo explore the evidence and knowledge gaps in sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in prostate cancer through a consensus panel of experts.MethodsA two-round Delphi survey among experts was followed by a consensus panel meeting of 16 experts in February 2016. Agreement voting was performed using the research and development project/University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness Methodology on 150 statements in nine domains. The disagreement index based on the interpercentile range, adjusted for symmetry score, was used to assess consensus and non-consensus among panel members.ResultsConsensus was obtained on 91 of 150 statements (61%). The main outcomes were: (1) the results from an extended lymph node dissection (eLND) are still considered the 'gold standard', and sentinel node (SN) detection should be combined with eLND, at least in patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer; (2) the role of SN detection in low-risk prostate cancer is unclear; and (3) future studies should contain oncological endpoints as number of positive nodes outside the eLND template, false-negative and false-positive SN procedures, and recurrence-free survival. A high rate of consensus was obtained regarding outcome measures of future clinical trials on SNB (89%). Consensus on tracer technology was only obtained in 47% of statements, reflecting a need for further research and standardization in this area. The low-level evidence in the available literature and the composition of mainly SNB users in the panel constitute the major limitations of the study.ConclusionsConsensus on a majority of elementary statements on SN detection in prostate cancer was obtained.; therefore, the results from this consensus report will provide a basis for the design of further studies in the field. A group of experts identified evidence and knowledge gaps on SN detection in prostate cancer and its application in daily practice. Information from the consensus statements can be used to direct further studies.

TI  - A Novel Less-invasive Approach for Axillary Staging After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With Axillary Node-positive Breast Cancer by Combining Radioactive Iodine Seed Localization in the Axilla With the Sentinel Node Procedure (RISAS): A Dutch Prospective Multicenter Validation Study
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 1 of 3 patients with initial lymph node-positive (cN(+)) breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) results in an axillary pathologic complete response (ax-pCR). This urges the need for a less-invasive axillary staging method. Recently introduced less-invasive procedures have been insufficient in accurately identifying ax-pCR. Therefore, we propose a novel less-invasive axillary staging procedure: the Radioactive Iodine Seed localization in the Axilla with the Sentinel node procedure (RISAS), a combination of the procedure of marking axillary lymph nodes with radioactive iodine seeds (MARI) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Patients and Methods: In the present open single-arm multicenter validation study, 225 cN(+) (biopsy-proven) patients will undergo the RISAS procedure, in which a positive lymph node is marked by an iodine-125 seed before NAC. After NAC completion, this iodine-125 seed-marked lymph node is removed, together with any additional sentinel lymph nodes. The RISAS procedure is subsequently followed by completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The RISAS lymph nodes will be compared with the lymph nodes from the completion ALND specimen. The primary endpoint is accuracy of the RISAS procedure. The identification rate, false-negative rate, negative predictive value, and possible concordance between the MARI and SLNB will be reported. Conclusion: The present prospective multicenter RISAS trial will enable us to validate the combination of MARI and SLNB for assessing the axillary response to NAC in cN(+) patients. If RISAS proves to be an accurate axillary staging procedure, ALND could safely be abandoned in the case of ax-pCR confirmed using the RISAS procedure.

TI  - Biocompatible astaxanthin as novel contrast agent for biomedical imaging
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a hybrid imaging modality with high resolution and sensitivity that can be beneficial for cancer staging. Due to insufficient endogenous photoacoustic (PA) contrast, the development of exogenous agents is critical in targeting cancerous tumors. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of marine-oriented material, astaxanthin, as a biocompatible PA contrast agent. Both silicon tubing phantoms and ex vivo bladder tissues are tested at various concentrations (up to 5 mg/ml) of astaxanthin to quantitatively explore variations in PA responses. A Q-switched Nd : YAG laser (lambda = 532 nm) in conjunction with a 5 MHz ultrasound transducer is employed to generate and acquire PA signals from the samples. The phantom results presented that the PA signal amplitudes increase linearly with the astaxanthin concentrations (threshold detection = 0.31 mg/ml). The tissue injected with astaxanthin yields up to 16-fold higher PA signals, compared with that with saline. Due to distribution of the injected astaxanthin, PAI can image the margin of astaxanthin boles as well as quantify their volume in 3D reconstruction. Further investigations on selective tumor targeting are required to validate astaxanthin as a potential biocompatible contrast agent for PAI-assisted bladder cancer detection.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Poor Adherence to National Clinical Management Guidelines: A Population-Based, Cross-Sectional Study of the Surgical Management of Melanoma in New South Wales, Australia
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Standardization of the clinical management of melanoma through the formulation of national guidelines, based on interpretation of the existing evidence and consensus expert opinion, seeks to improve quality of care; however, adherence to national guidelines has not been well studied.Methods. A population-based, cross-sectional study of the clinical management of all patients with newly notified primary melanomas in the state of New South Wales, Australia, during 2006/2007 was conducted using cancer registry identification and questionnaires completed by treating physicians.Results. Surgical margin guidelines were adhered to in 35% of cases; 45% were over treated and 21% were undertreated. Factors independently associated with non-concordance on multivariate analysis were lower Breslow thickness, lower socio-economic status of the physician's practice location, older physician age, lower physician caseload, and physicians who biopsied the lesion and then referred for definitive management. Complications were not related to over- or under-treatment on multivariate analysis (p = 0.72). Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 17% of patients with invasive melanoma, with the main determinant for selection being a Breslow thickness > 0.75 mm.Conclusions. The low level of concordance with national guidelines for surgical management of melanoma resulted in overtreatment of many patients. However, a fifth of patients were undertreated, which is likely to have resulted in increased locoregional recurrence rates. The better concordance achieved by physicians treating > 30 melanomas per year suggests that a minimum caseload threshold for physicians treating melanoma patients would be desirable. High guideline concordance will ensure patients receive optimal care and minimize morbidity and health service costs.

TI  - Effects of Highly Polluted Environment on Sperm Telomere Length: A Pilot Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - High environmental pressure may impair male fertility by affecting sperm quality, but the real effect remains controversial. Herein, we assessed the influence of environmental exposure on telomere length (TL) in both leukocytes (LTL) and sperm cells (STL). A pilot biomonitoring study was conducted in 112 clinically healthy, normospermic men living in various areas of Campania region (South of Italy) with high (n = 57, High Group) or low (n = 55, Low Group) environmental pressure. TL analysis was assessed by quantitative real time-PCR. STL was not significantly correlated with either age (p = 0.6) or LTL (p = 0.7), but was significantly longer in the High Group compared with the Low Group (p = 0.04). No significant difference was observed between leukocyte TL in the High or Low Group. Our results showed that male residents in areas with high environment exposure had a significant increase in STL. This finding supports the view that the human semen is a sentinel biomarker of environmental exposure.

TI  - Glacier monitoring and glacier-climate interactions in the tropical Andes: A review
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - In this review, we summarized the evolution of glacier monitoring in the tropical Andes during the last few decades, particularly after the development of remote sensing and photogrammetry. Advantages and limitations of glacier mapping, applied so far, in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia are discussed in detail. Glacier parameters such as the equilibrium line altitude, snowline and mass balance were given special attention in understanding the complex cryosphere-climate interactions, particularly using remote sensing techniques. Glaciers in the inner and the outer tropics were considered separately based on the precipitation and temperature conditions within a new framework. The applicability of various methods to use glacier records to understand and reconstruct the tropical Andean climate between the Last Glacial Maximum (11,700 years ago) and the present is also explored in this paper. Results from various studies published recently were analyzed and we tried to understand the differences in the magnitudes of glacier responses towards the climatic perturbations in the inner tropics and the outer tropics. Inner tropical glaciers, particularly those in Venezuela and Colombia near the January Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), are more vulnerable to increase in temperature. Surface energy balance experiments show that outer tropical glaciers respond to precipitation variability very rapidly in comparison with the temperature variability, particularly when moving towards the subtropics. We also analyzed the gradients in glacier response to climate change from the Pacific coast towards the Amazon Basin as well as with the elevation. Based on the current trends synthesised from recent studies, it is hypothesized that the glaciers in the inner tropics and the southern wet outer tropics will disappear first as a response to global warming whereas glaciers in the northern wet outer tropics and dry outer tropics show resistance to warming trends due to the occurrence of cold phases of El Nido-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) together. Mountain glaciers in Ecuador show less retreat in response to the warming trend, probably due to high altitudes (above 5750 m), in comparison to glaciers in Colombia and Venezuela. However, elevation-dependent warming (EDW) is a major concern in the tropical Andes. In a nutshell, smaller glaciers at lower altitudes in the inner tropics and the southern wet outer tropics near the Amazon Basin are disappearing faster than other glaciers in the tropical Andes.

TI  - What to Do with Non-visualized Sentinel Nodes? A Dutch Nationwide Survey Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. International guidelines differ regarding their recommendations on axillary treatment of patients with non-visualized sentinel lymph nodes (non-vSLN). Therefore, we distributed a survey among Dutch oncological surgeons to determine their routine practice and opinion regarding axillary treatment in case of a non-vSLN, with the emphasis on whether these practices and opinions have changed since publication of the Z0011 trial.Methods. A Dutch nationwide survey containing 10 questions regarding clinical routine during the sentinel node procedure and axillary treatment of non-vSLN patients was distributed among 510 oncological surgeons.Results. The survey was completed by 122 (24%) oncological surgeons, of whom 116 (95%) were registered as specialized breast surgeons. These surgeons had, on average, 13 years of experience. The majority of respondents used both lymphoscintigraphy and Patent Blue during the sentinel node procedure, and 39% estimated the prevalence of a non-vSLN to be 1-2%. Most surgeons are currently more reserved when considering whether to perform an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) than prior to publication of the Z0011 trial (15 vs. 80%, respectively). Sixty percent base their decision on various clinicopathological characteristics. Twenty-three respondents (20%) opted for an alternative axillary treatment.Conclusion. This study shows that, in daily practice, most specialized breast surgeons think that a non-vSLN is rare. If so, most currently opt not to perform an ALND, whereas a small proportion consider an alternative axillary treatment. These decisions differ than in the period prior to the Z0011 trial. More research is needed to provide optimal treatment recommendations in case of a non-vSLN.

TI  - Describing semigroups with defining relations of the form <i>xy</i> = <i>yz</i> and <i>yx</i> = <i>zy</i> and connections with knot theory
T2  - SEMIGROUP FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce a knot semigroup as a cancellative semigroup whose defining relations are produced from crossings on a knot diagram in a way similar to the Wirtinger presentation of the knot group; to be more precise, a knot semigroup as we define it is closely related to such tools of knot theory as the twofold branched cyclic cover space of a knot and the involutory quandle of a knot. We describe knot semigroups of several standard classes of knot diagrams, including torus knots and torus links T(2, n) and twist knots. The description includes a solution of the word problem. To produce this description, we introduce alternating sum semigroups as certain naturally defined factor semigroups of free semigroups over cyclic groups. We formulate several conjectures for future research.

TI  - Prospective double blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of the pectoral nerves (Pecs) block type II
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Study objective: The aim of this clinical trial was to test the hypothesis whether adding the pectoral nerves (Pecs) block type II to the anesthetic procedure reduces opioid consumption during and after breast surgery.Design: A prospective randomized double blind placebo-controlled study.Setting: A secondary hospital. Patients: 140 breast cancer stage 1-3 patients undergoing mastectomy or tumorectomy with sentinel node or axillary node dissection.Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive either a Pecs block with levobupivacaine 0.25% (n = 70) or placebo block with saline (n = 70).Measurements: The pain levels were evaluated by Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores at 15-minute intervals during the post anesthesia care unit stay time (PAW), at 2-hour intervals for the first 24 h on the ward and at 4 hour intervals for the next 24 h. Intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption were recorded during the full stay. Patient satisfaction was evaluated upon discharge using a 10-point scale.Main results: Intraoperative sufentanil requirements were comparable for the Pecs and placebo group (8.0 +/- 3.5 mu g and 7.8 +/- 3.0 mu g, P= 0.730). Patients in the Pecs group experienced significantly less pain than patients in the control group (P = 0.048) during their PACU stay. Furthermore, patients in the Pecs group required significant less postoperative opioids (9.16 +/- 10.15 mg and 14.97 +/- 14.38 mg morphine equivalent, P = 0.037) and required significant fewer postsurgical opioid administration interventions than patients in the control group (P = 0.045). Both patient-groups were very satisfied about their management (9.6 +/- 0.6 and 9.1 +/- 1.8 on a 10-point scale, P = 0.211).Conclusions: The Pecs block reduces postsurgical opioid consumption during the PACU stay time for patients undergoing breast surgery.

TI  - Domestic Violence Against Partners According to Wife-Beaters: Construction of Lifestyle and Life Meaning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This qualitative study examines the life stories of men who committed violent crimes against their intimate partners, for which they have served prison sentences. For the study, nine men in a rehabilitation hostel in Israel were interviewed. The study aim was to understand the psychological process that had brought the participants to behave violently towards their partners. Narrative analysis of the life stories resulted in two main themes. The first, childhood, was related to how the interviewee during his childhood perceived his personal identity and his parents. The second theme represented the adult interviewee's worldview of violence in general and of intimate partner violence in particular. The findings revealed a subjective feeling of inferiority and lack of worth and volition during childhood, a feeling of chaos, and the absence of existential meaning. To avoid these feelings in adulthood, the participants chose a lifestyle that included the use of force and violence, which provided them with a sense of control and meaning. Discussion of the findings is based on the individual psychology theory of Adler and his followers, as well as on the existentialist orientation. According to these approaches, the study participants, who lacked a sense of positive "existential being," developed a negative lifestyle that enabled them to feel a sense of security, value, and meaning.

TI  - Acral lentiginous melanoma versus other melanoma: A single-center analysis in Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We summarize herein our 14-year experience of conventional treatment outcomes before the era of molecular-targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Specifically, we conducted a retrospective review of our 252 patients with primary cutaneous melanoma (acral lentiginous melanoma [ALM], n = 121; non-acral lentiginous melanoma [non-ALM], n = 131), and compared the prognostic factors between ALM and non-ALM. Melanoma-specific survival and disease-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Regarding the results, all patients were Japanese (106 male and 146 female), with a mean age of 60.1 years. Among ALM patients, age was elder and primary tumor size was larger than non-ALM. As for tumor thickness, in situ lesions were more frequently observed in ALM. There was no significant difference in the distribution of tumor thickness between the two groups when excluding the in situ lesions. For treatment of the primary melanoma, 248 patients (98.4%) had undergone curative surgical excision and 120 patients with more than 1 mm or ulcerated melanoma had undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy. Patients with systemic metastasis primarily underwent dacarbazine-based chemotherapy. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed no significant difference in melanoma-specific survival and disease-free survival between those with ALM and non-ALM. The results also showed that both ALM and non-ALM, when they initially metastasize, first affect the regional lymph nodes. Incisional biopsy was not an adverse prognostic factor. These results suggest that ALM does not differ in its biological behavior from non-ALM, so we can consider ALM as being equivalent to non-ALM. The initial treatment for ALM and non-ALM can involve the same strategy.

TI  - The P2L method of mismatch detection for push broom high-resolution satellite images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - RANSAC-based mismatch detection methods are widely used in the geometric registration of images. Despite their prevalence, setting the detection thresholds for different situations continues to be difficult without an appropriate geometric model. In high-resolution satellite images, simple image-space transformations are commonly influenced by the terrain or elevation errors. This paper introduces a new method, called the P2L method, which uses the distance between the transformed right image point and the segment of the corresponding epipolar line to distinguish the correct matches and mismatches. The affine model of the P2L method is solved to transform the right image points towards the segment of the epipolar line. The images for demonstration were acquired by GeoEye-1, Ikonos-2, and Ziyuan-3; and each type of image pairs had different intersection angles to explore the influence of the elevation error. The correct matches were manually collected and the mismatches were simulated. The experiments in this paper, which used only correct matches, demonstrated that this method was very robust with one specific threshold (five pixels) and was suitable for all the image pairs. The experiments using simulated mismatches and real matching points demonstrated that this method was able to distinguish most of the mismatches; and even for the image pair that had a 54-degree intersection angle, the ratio of mismatches was reduced from 81% to 11%.

TI  - Image Fusion-Based Land Cover Change Detection Using Multi-Temporal High-Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection is usually treated as a problem of explicitly detecting land cover transitions in satellite images obtained at different times, and helps with emergency response and government management. This study presents an unsupervised change detection method based on the image fusion of multi-temporal images. The main objective of this study is to improve the accuracy of unsupervised change detection from high-resolution multi-temporal images. Our method effectively reduces change detection errors, since spatial displacement and spectral differences between multi-temporal images are evaluated. To this end, a total of four cross-fused images are generated with multi-temporal images, and the iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) method-a measure for the spectral distortion of change information-is applied to the fused images. In this experiment, the land cover change maps were extracted using multi-temporal IKONOS-2, WorldView-3, and GF-1 satellite images. The effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other unsupervised change detection methods is demonstrated through experimentation. The proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 80.51% and 97.87% for cases 1 and 2, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method performed better when differentiating the water area from the vegetation area compared to the existing change detection methods. Although the water area beneath moderate and sparse vegetation canopy was captured, vegetation cover and paved regions of the water body were the main sources of omission error, and commission errors occurred primarily in pixels of mixed land use and along the water body edge. Nevertheless, the proposed method, in conjunction with high-resolution satellite imagery, offers a robust and flexible approach to land cover change mapping that requires no ancillary data for rapid implementation.

TI  - Modeling radiation belt dynamics using a 3-D layer method code
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new 3-D diffusion code using a recently published layer method has been developed to analyze radiation belt electron dynamics. The code guarantees the positivity of the solution even when mixed diffusion terms are included. Unlike most of the previous codes, our 3-D code is developed directly in equatorial pitch angle (alpha(0)), momentum (p), and L shell coordinates; this eliminates the need to transform back and forth between (alpha(0),p) coordinates and adiabatic invariant coordinates. Using (alpha(0),p,L) is also convenient for direct comparison with satellite data. The new code has been validated by various numerical tests, and we apply the 3-D code to model the rapid electron flux enhancement following the geomagnetic storm on 17 March 2013, which is one of the Geospace Environment Modeling Focus Group challenge events. An event-specific global chorus wave model, an AL-dependent statistical plasmaspheric hiss wave model, and a recently published radial diffusion coefficient formula from Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) statistics are used. The simulation results show good agreement with satellite observations, in general, supporting the scenario that the rapid enhancement of radiation belt electron flux for this event results from an increased level of the seed population by radial diffusion, with subsequent acceleration by chorus waves. Our results prove that the layer method can be readily used to model global radiation belt dynamics in three dimensions.

TI  - A large-scale serological survey of Akabane virus infection in cattle, yak, sheep and goats in China
T2  - VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Akabane virus (AKAV) is a member of the Simbu serogroup, classified in the genus Orthobunyavirus, family Bunyaviridae. AKAV infection can cause abortion, stillbirth, and congenital arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly in cattle and sheep. The distribution and prevalence of AKAV infection in China is still unknown. A total of 2731 sera collected from 2006 to 2015 in 24 provinces of China from cattle, sheep, goats and yak were examined by serum neutralisation test. The overall seroprevalence rates for AKAV antibodies were 21.3% in cattle (471/2215) and 12.0% (17/142) in sheep or goats, and 0% in yak (0/374). The results indicated widespread AKAV infection in China among cattle and sheep but yak appear to have a low risk of infection. Using a selection of 50 AKAV-positive and 25 AKAV-negative cattle sera, neutralisation tests were also conducted to detect antibodies to several other Simbu serogroup bunyaviruses and closely related Leanyer virus. Although inconclusive, the data suggest that both Aino virus and Peaton virus, which have been reported previously in Japan and Korea, may also be present in cattle in China.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of ecological quality in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban megaregion, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological quality symbolizes the capacity of sustainable development of regional economy and society, as well as the degree of stability and coordination between social production and human settlement environment. Therefore, how to quantitatively assess ecological quality and its change, as well as coordinate the relation between the ecological quality and urbanization, is be. coming a hotspot of urban ecology. The Beijing. Tianjin. Hebei (BTH) urban megaregion, where ur. banization developed rapidly and environmental problems became increasingly evident, was chosen as the study area. Then we calculated the ecological parameters including the vegetation fraction, biomass, and the percent cover of built. up land based on remote sensing data, and combined with vegetation fragmentation index, to develop a comprehensive index model of ecological quality based on RS indicators by using principal component analysis. The ecological quality and its dynamics in the BTH urban megaregion from 2000 to 2010 were quantitatively evaluated. The results showed that the ecological model constructed in this paper could be used to evaluate the ecological quality and change of city and region objectively and comprehensively. The index of ecological quality in BTH increased from 2.38 in 2000 to 2.84 in 2010, with a growth rate of 19.3%. The growth rate of 2000-2005 (12.2%) was higher than that of 2006-2010 (7.2%). Spatially, high values of the in. dex were distributed in the north of the megaregion, while low values in the west and southeast. Ecological quality and its change varied greatly by cities. The ecological quality of Chengde was bet. ter than the other cities significantly, followed by Beijing, Qinhuangdao and Baoding, whereas Tianjin had the worst ecological quality. The ecological quality in Chengde, Beijing, Qinhuangdao and Baoding were higher than the average level of the entire BTH megaregion, while Langfang, Tianjin and Cangzhou were lower than the average level. Except for Tangshan, the ecological quality in all other cities was improved from 2000 to 2010. The ecological quality indices of Cangzhou and Hengshui were improved significantly, with growth rates of 520.5% and 171.8%, respectively.

TI  - Estimation of leaf nitrogen concentration in wheat using the MK-SVR algorithm and satellite remote sensing data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The appropriate spectral vegetation indices can be used to rapidly and non-destructively estimate the leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) in wheat for on-farm wheat management. However, the accuracy of estimation should be further improved. Previous studies focused on developing vegetation indices, but research about modeling algorithms were limited. In this study, multiple-kernel support vector regression (MK-SVR) was used to assess the LNC in wheat based on satellite remote sensing data. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the applicability of the MK-SVR algorithm for remotely estimating the LNC in wheat, (2) test the performance of the MK-SVR regression model, and (3) compare the performance of the MI-SVR algorithm with multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares (PLS), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and single-kernel SVR (SK-SVR) algorithms for wheat LNC estimation. In-situ LNC data over four years at different sites in Jiangsu Province of China were measured during the jointing, booting, and anthesis stages; one HJ-CCD image of wheat was obtained during each stage. Vegetation indices were calculated based on these images, and correlations between vegetation indices and LNC data were measured. Finally, a MK-SVR model whose inputs were vegetation indices was established to estimate the LNC during each stage. The results showed that the MK-SVR model performed well in estimating LNC. The coefficients of determination (R-2) of the estimated-versus-measured LNC values for the three stages were respectively 0.73, 0.82, and 0.75, meanwhile, the corresponding root mean square errors (RMSE) and the relative RMSE were respectively 0.13 and 6.6%, 0.21 and 7.7%, and 0.20 and 6.5%. Thus, the MK-SVR algorithm provides an effective way to improve the prediction accuracy of LNC in wheat on a large scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Validation and Accuracy Analysis of Global MODIS Aerosol Products over Land
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface reflectance (LSR) and aerosol types are the two main factors that affect aerosol inversions over land. According to LSR determination methods, Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol products are produced using the Deep Blue (DB) and Dark Target (DT) algorithms. Five aerosol types that are determined from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground measurements are used to describe the global distribution of aerosol types in each algorithm. To assess the influence of LSR and the method used to determine aerosol type from aerosol retrievals, 10-km global aerosol products that cover 2013 are selected for validation using Level 2.0 aerosol observations from 175 AERONET sites. The variations in the retrieval accuracy of the DB and DT algorithms for different LSR values are analyzed by combining them with a global 10-km LSR database. Meanwhile, the adaptability of the MODIS products over areas covered with different aerosols is also explored. The results are as follows. (1) Compared with DT retrievals, the DB algorithm yields lower root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolut error (MAE) values, and a greater number of appropriate sample points fall within the expected error (EE). The DB algorithm shows higher overall reliability; (2) The aerosol retrieval accuracy of the DB and DT algorithms decline irregularly as the surface reflectance increases; the DB algorithm displays relatively high accuracy; (3) Both algorithms have a high retrieval accuracy over areas covered by weak absorbing aerosols, whereas dust aerosols and continental aerosols produce a low retrieval accuracy. The DB algorithm shows good retrieval results for most aerosols, but a lower accuracy for strong absorbing aerosols.

TI  - Mapping Regional Urban Extent Using NPP-VIIRS DNB and MODIS NDVI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and timely monitoring of regional urban extent is helpful for analyzing urban sprawl and studying environmental issues related to urbanization. This paper proposes a classification scheme for large-scale urban extent mapping by combining the Day/Night Band of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Satellite (NPP-VIIRS DNB) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer products (MODIS NDVI). A Back Propagation (BP) neural network based one-class classification method, the Present-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) algorithm, is employed to classify images into urban and non-urban areas. Experiments are conducted in mainland China (excluding surrounding islands) to detect urban areas in 2012. Results show that the proposed model can successfully map urban area with a kappa of 0.842 on the pixel level. Most of the urban areas are identified with a producer's accuracy of 79.63%, and only 10.42% the generated urban areas are misclassified with a user's accuracy of 89.58%. At the city level, among 647 cities, only four county-level cities are omitted. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, three contrastive analyses are conducted: (1) comparing the urban map obtained in this paper with that generated by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System Nighttime Light Data (DMSP/OLS NLD) and MODIS NDVI and with that extracted from MCD12Q1 in MODIS products; (2) comparing the performance of the integration of NPP-VIIRS DNB and MODIS NDVI with single input data; and (3) comparing the classification method used in this paper (PUL) with a linear method (Large-scale Impervious Surface Index (LISI)). According to our analyses, the proposed classification scheme shows great potential to map regional urban extents in an effective and efficient manner.

TI  - New Application of Old Material: Chinese Traditional Ink for Photothermal Therapy of Metastatic Lymph Nodes
T2  - ACS OMEGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Finding a simple and effective strategy to eliminate tumor metastatic lymph nodes is highly desired in clinical tumor treatment. Herein, we reported a Chinese traditional ink (Hu-ink)based treatment for photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumor metastatic lymph nodes. By simple dilution, stable Chinese traditional ink dispersion was obtained, which presents excellent photothermal effect because of its high absorption in near-infrared (NIR) region. Meanwhile, as revealed by staining and photoacoustic imaging, Hu-ink could transfer to nearby lymph nodes after directly injected into the primary tumors. Under the guidance of dual-modality mapping, the metastatic sentinel lymph nodes could be subsequently eliminated by NIR irradiation. The good biocompatibility of Hu-ink has also been verified by a series of experiments. Therefore, the Hu-ink-based treatment exhibits great potential for PTT of tumor metastatic lymph nodes in future clinical practice.

TI  - The surgical treatment of gastric cancer in the era of minimally invasive surgery
T2  - MINERVA CHIRURGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Minimally invasive surgery is regarded as an alternative to conventional open surgery in gastric cancer. More and more surgeons devote their efforts to reduce surgical incision and acquire better recovery. Nowadays, laparoscopic distal gastrectomy has been the standard method for early stage cancer with remarkable advantage in short-term outcomes and is widely accepted by patients. The indication of laparoscopic gastrectomy has been extended to local advanced gastric cancer. However, the oncological safety has long been debated. Therefore, large scale randomized controlled clinical trials are ongoing to confirm the feasibility and safety in more advanced gastric cancer. With the accumulation of surgical experience and development of instrument, several advanced techniques, such as function preserving surgery, total laparoscopic anastomosis, sentinel node navigation surgery, robotic assisted surgery and reduced port laparoscopic gastrectomy have also been explored and applied to gastric cancer patient. All these techniques could modify the extent of surgery, reduce the risk of perioperative complications and generate potential better results in quality of life. Although recent studies have confirmed the feasibility and safety of each procedure, more evidence is required for further popularization of the newly technique. Herein we describe the current status and evidence for surgical treatment of gastric cancer in the era of minimally invasive surgery.

TI  - Deriving Hourly PM2.5 Concentrations from Himawari-8 AODs over Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring fine particulate matter with diameters of less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) is a critical endeavor in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, which is one of the most polluted areas in China. Polar orbit satellites are limited by observation frequency, which is insufficient for understanding PM2.5 evolution. As a geostationary satellite, Himawari-8 can obtain hourly optical depths (AODs) and overcome the estimated PM2.5 concentrations with low time resolution. In this study, the evaluation of Himawari-8 AODs by comparing with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements showed Himawari-8 retrievals (Level 3) with a mild underestimate of about -0.06 and approximately 57% of AODs falling within the expected error established by the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (+/-(0.05 + 0.15AOD)). Furthermore, the improved linear mixed-effect model was proposed to derive the surface hourly PM2.5 from Himawari-8 AODs from July 2015 to March 2017. The estimated hourly PM2.5 concentrations agreed well with the surface PM2.5 measurements with high R-2 (0.86) and low RMSE (24.5 mu g/m(3)). The average estimated PM2.5 in the BTH region during the study time range was about 55 mu g/m(3). The estimated hourly PM2.5 concentrations ranged extensively from 35.2 +/- 26.9 mu g/m(3) (1600 local time) to 65.5 +/- 54.6 mu g/m(3) (1100 local time) at different hours.

TI  - Evaluation of Precipitable Water Vapor from Four Satellite Products and Four Reanalysis Datasets against GPS Measurements on the Southern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern Tibetan Plateau (STP) is the region in which water vapor passes from South Asia into the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The accuracy of precipitable water vapor (PWV) modeling for this region depends strongly on the quality of the available estimates of water vapor advection and the parameterization of land evaporation models. While climate simulation is frequently improved by assimilating relevant satellite and reanalysis products, this requires an understanding of the accuracy of these products. In this study, PWV data from MODIS infrared and near-infrared measurements, AIRS Level-2 and Level-3, MERRA, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, and NCEP final reanalysis (NCEP-Final) are evaluated against ground-based GPS measurements at nine stations over the STP, which covers the summer monsoon season from 2007 to 2013. The MODIS infrared product is shown to underestimate water vapor levels by more than 20% (1.84 mm), while the MODIS near-infrared product overestimates them by over 40% (3.52 mm). The AIRS PWV product appears to be most useful for constructing high-resolution and high-quality PWV datasets over the TP; particularly the AIRS Level-2 product has a relatively low bias (0.48 mm) and RMSE (1.83 mm) and correlates strongly with the GPS measurements (R = 0.90). The four reanalysis datasets exhibit similar performance in terms of their correlation coefficients (R = 0.87-0.90), bias (0.72-1.49 mm), and RMSE (2.19-2.35 mm). The key finding is that all the reanalyses have positive biases along the PWV seasonal cycle, which is linked to the well-known wet bias over the TP of current climate models.

TI  - Forest biomass carbon dynamics (1980-2009) in western Himalaya in the context of REDD plus policy
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon emissions from forests have decreased in the past decade due to conservation efforts, however majority of carbon losses suffered in the past went unnoticed until the role of forests in mitigating climate change was realized. Forestry sector in developing countries is recognized as one of the largest and low cost mitigation options to address climate change. The present study was conducted to assess the multi-temporal biomass carbon mitigation in the temperate forests of western Himalaya using satellite (Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+) and forest inventory data. Forest type density mapping was done through on-screen visual interpretation of satellite data. After conducting preliminary survey in 2009, 45 quadrats (0.1 ha) were laid in six forest types for collecting field inventory data viz., diameter at breast height, tree height, slope and aspect. Biomass carbon (t ha(-1)) was estimated for different forest types with different crown densities (open with 10-40% crown density and closed with > 40%) using recommended regression equations, ratios and factors. A decreasing trend of carbon (145.13-134.87 mt) was observed over the period of time. Temporal biomass carbon dynamics was analyzed for REDD+ opportunities. The temporal variation of carbon observed was found to be more useful for claiming benefits under negative options (deforestation and forest degradation) of REDD+. The study doesn't take actual conversions to CO2 into account. However, the findings are useful in establishing baseline emissions through temporal carbon losses. Further, the study helps in identification of location specific socioe-conomic drivers of losses that can be used for appropriate mitigation interventions.

TI  - CLEANSING THE NATION OF THE "DOGS OF HELL": 'ALI JUM'A'S NATIONALIST LEGAL REASONING IN SUPPORT OF THE 2013 EGYPTIAN COUP AND ITS BLOODY AFTERMATH
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EAST STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article contributes to an emerging scholarly debate over the support displayed by key Azhari 'ulama' for the 3 July 2013 coup in Egypt and the subsequent massacres of anticoup protesters. I focus on the Islamic legal justifications articulated by the former grand mufti of Egypt 'Ali Jum'a, which academics have contextualized primarily in relation to quietist precedents from latemedieval Islamic political thought or his Sufi background. By contrast, I consider Jum'a's justifications as representative of a nationalist discourse that has its historical origins in the protonationalism of Rifa'a al-Tahtawi (d. 1873). My argument has wider implications for our conceptualization of the contemporary Islamic tradition. If, as scholars have argued, the Islamic tradition is a framework for inquiry rather than a set of doctrines, then in the 19th century a concern for the nation and its future became a key part of that framework. I contend that these additions came to redefine the worldview and politics of the 'ulama' in terms of national progress and its horizon of expectations.

TI  - Land-atmosphere-aerosol coupling in North China during 2000-2013
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - North China is one of the most densely populated regions in the world. To its west, north, and northwest, the world's largest afforestation project has been going on for decades. At the same time, North China has been suffering from air pollution because of its large fossil fuel consumption. Here we show that the changes in land cover and aerosol concentration are coupled with the variations of land surface temperature, cloud cover, and surface solar radiation during the summer 2000-2013. Model experiments show that the interannual variation of aerosol concentration in North China is mainly a result of the varying atmospheric circulation. The increasing vegetation cover due to afforestation has enhanced surface evapotranspiration (ET) and cooled the local surface, and precipitation is observed to be increasing with ET. The model with prescribed increasing vegetation cover can simulate the increasing ET but cannot reproduce the increasing precipitation. Although this may be caused by model biases, the lack of aerosol processes in the model could also be a potential cause.

TI  - Development of remote sensing indicators for mapping episodic die-off of an invasive annual grass (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>) from the Landsat archive
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The exotic annual grass Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) dominates vast acreages of rangeland in the western USA, leading to increased fire frequency and ecosystem degradation that is often irreversible. Episodic regeneration failure ("die-off") has been observed in cheatgrass monocultures and can have negative ecosystem consequences, but can also provide an opportunity for restoration of native species and ecological function within the imperiled sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Proximate causes of cheatgrass die-off are uncertain, although several taxa of fungal soil pathogens have been implicated. Die-off occurrence is stochastic and can occur in remote areas. Thus, developing remote sensing indicators that are repeatable over long time periods, across extensive regions, and at relatively fine spatial resolution would be beneficial for accurately pinpointing events.We developed a remote sensing approach for mapping historical die-off from the Landsat archive (1985-2015), and used this to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of die-off occurrence annually at 30-m resolution. A Random Forests classification of image-derived spectral endmembers, trained on 2014 data, predicted die-off with 93% accuracy (kappa = 0.845) when applied to independent validation data from 2009. Die off extent varied greatly across years, though some areas experienced die-off multiple times during the observation period. We found a strong correspondence between die-off occurrence and winter drought conditions, with strongest negative associations with current-year winter precipitation and previous years' lagged winter and annual precipitation. Die-off duration was heavily skewed towards single-year die-off (81.5% of events), even in localized areas of more frequent occurrence('die-off hotspots').Our retrospective classification of the Landsat archive suggests that cheatgrass die-off occurrence is predictable as the intersection of particular site environmental conditions with annual weather conditions, possibly because they are favorable for disease expression. Associations with previous year conditions suggest that die-off may also depend upon feedbacks between cheatgrass dominance and litter production, suitable sites for seedling establishment, and abundance and persistence of pathogen inoculum. Remote sensing indicators such as those developed in this study are needed to develop hypotheses about die-off causal factors, as well as support improved management of cheatgrass, mitigation for negative consequences associated with die-off (e.g. wind erosion), and successful restoration of native plant communities on die-off areas.

AB  - Sea ice decline is an essential player, as well as an emblematic signature, of global warming. Besides sea surface temperature rising, sea ice drift, and deformation play a major role on the observed negative mass balance, thus calling for a deeper understanding of sea ice mechanics. Over the last decades, drifters and satellite data allowed a detailed characterization of sea ice kinematics, however limited by relatively coarse space (approximate to 10 km) and time (similar to day) resolutions. A new work allows bridging the gap between these large scales and fundamental ice physics and mechanics.

TI  - Alcohol screening among young people: a prospective study from the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance System (Sentinella) of physicians' a priori opinions
T2  - FAMILY PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Systematic screening for excessive alcohol use among young people is recommended but rarely implemented. Family practitioners tend to select patients for screening, based on their preliminary subjective opinions, which may be biased.Objective. To evaluate the ability of family practitioners to identify excessive alcohol use among young people prior to screening them.Methods. This prospective study was conducted through Sentinella, an epidemiological network involving 150 family practitioners across Switzerland. All patients aged 10-24 years old, consulting participating physicians between January 1 and December 31, 2014 were eligible. First, physicians were asked to give their a priori opinion about patients' potential alcohol use. Subsequently, they asked two screening questions: (i) 'Do you drink alcohol?' and (ii) 'How many times have you had 5 (4 for girls) or more standard drinks in one day over the past year?'. Excessive alcohol use was defined as >= 1 episode of binge drinking a month. Physicians' a priori opinions were regarded as a screening test and were compared with patients' answers.Results. 7723 patients were eligible for analysis. Their mean age (SD) was 17.3(4.0) years. The two screening questions identified 3559 (46.1%) and 509 (6.6%) patients who consumed alcohol occasionally and regularly, respectively. 406 patients (5.3%) reported excessive alcohol use. Physicians' a priori opinions had a sensitivity of 26.4% and a positive predictive value of 35.5% for the identification of excessive alcohol use.Conclusion. The systematic use of a screening tool should be preferred over family practitioners' subjective opinions to identify excessive alcohol use in young people.

TI  - Identifying Droughts Affecting Agriculture in Africa Based on Remote Sensing Time Series between 2000-2016: Rainfall Anomalies and Vegetation Condition in the Context of ENSO
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts are amongst the most destructive natural disasters in the world. In large regions of Africa, where water is a limiting factor and people strongly rely on rain-fed agriculture, droughts have frequently led to crop failure, food shortages and even humanitarian crises. In eastern and southern Africa, major drought episodes have been linked to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. In this context and with limited in-situ data available, remote sensing provides valuable opportunities for continent-wide assessment of droughts with high spatial and temporal resolutions. This study aimed to monitor agriculturally relevant droughts over Africa between 2000-2016 with a specific focus on growing seasons using remote sensing-based drought indices. Special attention was paid to the observation of drought dynamics during major ENSO episodes to illuminate the connection between ENSO and droughts in eastern and southern Africa. We utilized Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)-based Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) with 0.25 degrees resolution and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) with 500 m resolution as indices for analysing the spatio-temporal patterns of droughts. We combined the drought indices with information on the timing of site-specific growing seasons derived from MODIS-based multi-annual average of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We proved the applicability of SPI-3 and VCI as indices for a comprehensive continental-scale monitoring of agriculturally relevant droughts. The years 2009 and 2011 could be revealed as major drought years in eastern Africa, whereas southern Africa was affected by severe droughts in 2003 and 2015/2016. Drought episodes occurred over large parts of southern Africa during strong El Nino events. We observed a mixed drought pattern in eastern Africa, where areas with two growing seasons were frequently affected by droughts during La Nina and zones of unimodal rainfall regimes showed droughts during the onset of El Nino. During La Nina 2010/2011, large parts of cropland areas in Somalia (88%), Sudan (64%) and South Sudan (51%) were affected by severe to extreme droughts during the growing seasons. However, no universal El Nino- or La Nina-related response pattern of droughts could be deduced for the observation period of 16 years. In this regard, we discussed multi-year atmospheric fluctuations and characteristics of ENSO variants as further influences on the interconnection between ENSO and droughts. By utilizing remote sensing-based drought indices focussed on agricultural zones and periods, this study attempts to contribute to a better understanding of spatio-temporal patterns of droughts affecting agriculture in Africa, which can be essential for implementing strategies of drought hazard mitigation.

TI  - Multi-faceted land cover and land use change analyses in the Yellow River Basin based on dense Landsat time series: Exemplary analysis in mining, agriculture, forest, and urban areas
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow River Basin is one of China's most dynamic regions, where past and recent anthropogenic land use activities and polices have had a remarkably impact on the basin's surface. Over the past decades, the rapid socio-economic development has increased the pressure on the prevailing water and land resources with various repercussions on the environment and society. Counteracting ecological degradation in the basin, large-scale conservation and restoration plans have been initiated to expand vegetation coverage on deteriorated land, simultaneously fostering rural sustainable agriculture production. In this context, we derived precise spatial thematic products from long-term satellite time series about high-frequency temporal dynamics. This information, available in a consistent and repeatable fashion is rare and relevant for many regional and local stakeholders and must be monitored annually to capture the rapid rate of change. Such information serves as a valuable base for decision making processes. In this study, we used all the archived Landsat images between 2000 and 2015 (4520 scenes) to computed annually the spatially continuous spectral-temporal and textual metrics based on dense Landsat time-series to derive annual maps showing the most prominent land-cover change types related to mining, agriculture, forestry, and urbanization in four sub-regions spread over the Yellow River Basin. These novel land cover/use products provide new insights into recent regional and local dynamics. For final classification, we employed random forest classifiers for each thematic focus-region, trained and tested based on a stable-pixels data set. The resulting maps achieved high accuracies and show afforestation on the Loess Plateau and urbanization as the most prominent drivers of land use/cover dynamics. Agricultural land remained stable, showing local small-scale dynamics. Our study highlights the great potential of using consistent spectral-temporal metrics derived from dense Landsat time-series data together with a stable pixels reference set, allowing for local and regional land surface dynamics mapping at high spatial resolution and the prediction of implications of future change for effective and sustainable basin management.

TI  - Near-infrared Intraoperative Molecular Imaging Can Identify Metastatic Lymph Nodes in Prostate Cancer
T2  - UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE To propose a novel method to perform indocyanine green (ICG) based near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging during pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) for prostate cancer patients with lymph node metastasis (LNM).MATERIALS AND METHODS A prostate cancer cell line PC3 was used to establish xenograft model in NOD/SCID mice. After tumor growth, the mice were injected with ICG through the tail vein. Xenografts and surrounding tissues were imaged with NIR camera 24 hours after intravenous ICG, and tumor-tobackground ratios were calculated. We then performed a pilot human study to evaluate the role of NIR imaging in robotic PLND after systemic ICG in 4 patients with prostate cancer and preoperative lymphadenopathy.RESULTS ICG localized to PC3 xenografts in the mice and all xenografts were highly fluorescent compared with surrounding tissues, with a median tumor-to-background ratio of 2.85 (interquartile range = 2.64-3.90). In the human study, intraoperative in vivo NIR imaging identified 3 of the 4 preoperative lymphadenopathies as fluorescence-positive, and back table ex vivo NIR imaging identified all 4 lymphadenopathies as fluorescence-positive. All the lymphadenopathies were found to be LNMs by pathologic examination. Two of the four cases had additional LNMs, all of which were fluorescence-positive with intraoperative in vivo NIR imaging.CONCLUSION Intravenously administered ICG accumulates in prostate cancers in both a murine model and human patients. NIR fluorescence based on intravenous ICG may serve as a useful tool to facilitate the identification of positive nodes during PLND in patients with higher risk of LNMs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Scalp melanoma: Distinctive high risk clinical and histological features
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/ObjectivesScalp melanoma has a worse prognosis than melanoma elsewhere, though the reasons for this are poorly understood. Current literature describing the clinicopathological associations of scalp melanoma is sparse. This study aims to compare clinical and histological features of scalp melanoma with other cutaneous head and neck melanomas (CHNM).MethodsA cross-sectional study was performed of all primary CHNM cases seen by the Victorian Melanoma Service between 1994 and 2014, using prospectively recorded clinical data. Invasive and insitu melanomas were compared separately.ResultsInvasive scalp melanoma was associated with male sex (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.9-3.9), increasing age (OR, 1.02 per year increase in age; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03), being first noticed by a person other than self, spouse/relative or doctor (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5-5.7), amelanosis (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3), and increased growth rate (OR, 1.14 per 1mm/month growth rate increase; 95% CI, 1.04-1.26). Compared with other CHNM, scalp melanoma had greater median Breslow thickness (2.8 vs 1.2mm) and was independently associated with satellite metastases (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.9-11.5) and nodular subtype (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1). In situ scalp melanoma was associated with male sex, increasing age and solar keratoses.ConclusionScalp melanoma tends to occur in older men, is often rapidly growing and amelanotic, and is associated with high risk histological features. As it is likely to be overlooked, increased recognition of the atypical presentations of scalp melanoma is required.

TI  - Detection of Asian Dust Storm Using MODIS Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Every year, a large number of aerosols are released from dust storms into the atmosphere, which may have potential impacts on the climate, environment, and air quality. Detecting dust aerosols and monitoring their movements and evolutions in a timely manner is a very significant task. Satellite remote sensing has been demonstrated as an effective means for observing dust aerosols. In this paper, an algorithm based on the multi-spectral technique for detecting dust aerosols was developed by combining measurements of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflective solar bands and thermal emissive bands. Data from dust events that occurred during the past several years were collected as training data for spectral and statistical analyses. According to the spectral curves of various scene types, a series of spectral bands was selected individually or jointly, and corresponding thresholds were defined for step-by-step scene classification. The multi-spectral algorithm was applied mainly to detect dust storms in Asia. The detection results were validated not only visually with MODIS true color images, but also quantitatively with products of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). The validations showed that this multi-spectral detection algorithm was suitable to monitor dust aerosols in the selected study areas.

TI  - Evaluation and Correction of Atmosphere Contamination on the Measurement of the Spectral Response of FY-2 Water Vapor Channels
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral response is an important parameter of satellite instruments, and is the integrated performance of the reflective and transmission characteristics of each optical element and the spectral response characteristics of detectors. As do not have monochromatic light source devices for onboard spectral calibration, the spectral response in orbit is usually characterized by prelaunch evaluation in laboratory. Due to lack of vacuum environment, spectral response measurement in laboratory will be certainly contaminated due to atmospheric absorption between the calibration source and the instrument. In order to improve spectral calibration accuracy, influences of atmosphere contamination on the spectral response measurements of FY-2 water vapor channels were assessed based on a series of sensitivity tests using radiative transfer models (RTM). Because of the atmospheric absorption, the spectral responses become unsmooth, and the structure shows good consistency with the transmittance distribution. The channel brightness temperatures (BT) simulated based on contaminated SRF will be overestimated, and the biases increase exponentially over water vapor column. The biases are greater than 0.5 K and less than 1 K only during extremely dry environment with humidity less than 15% and homogeneous path less than 1m. However, when the homogeneous path approaches 4m under a normal ambient condition where the humidity is around 35%, the simulation BT bias can reach 4 K. Atmospheric contamination on spectral response measurement is happen for all water channels of FY-2 series satellites. Spectral correction was implemented for FY-2D by removing horizontal transmittance influence using spectra ratio. The corrected spectral response curve becomes much smooth and the distribution is more physically reasonable. The contamination leads to a warm bias of 2.2 K for clear sky top of atmosphere BT simulation, and a 7.6% positive bias for the blackbody radiance as well as the radiometric calibration calculation. The influence of atmospheric contamination on spectral response measurement is serious, thus can't be ignored not only for the water vapor channel but for all absorptive channels. The contamination to spectral measurements which can not be neglected should be corrected from dividing the original spectral response by atmospheric transmittance.

TI  - Passive-ocean radial basis function approach to improve temporal gravity recovery from GRACE observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a state-of-the-art approach of passive-ocean modified radial basis functions (MRBFs) that improves the recovery of time-variable gravity fields from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). As is well known, spherical harmonics (SHs), which are commonly used to recover gravity fields, are orthogonal basis functions with global coverage. However, the chosen SH truncation involves a global compromise between data coverage and obtainable resolution, and strong localized signals may not be fully captured. Radial basis functions (RBFs) provide another representation, which has been proposed in earlier works to be better suited to retrieve regional gravity signals. In this paper, we propose a MRBF approach by embedding the known coastal geometries in the RBF parameterization and imposing global mass conservation and equilibrium behavior of the oceans. Our hypothesis is that with this physically justified constraint, the GRACE-derived gravity signals can be more realistically partitioned into the land and ocean contributions along the coastlines. We test this new technique to invert monthly gravity fields from GRACE level-1b observations covering 2005-2010, for which the numerical results indicate that (1) MRBF-based solutions reduce the number of parameters by approximately 10% and allow for more flexible regularization when compared to ordinary RBF solutions and (2) the MRBF-derived mass flux is better confined along coastal areas. The latter is particularly tested in the southern Greenland, and our results indicate that the trend of mass loss from the MRBF solutions is approximately 11% larger than that from the SH solutions and approximately 4%-6% larger than that of RBF solutions.

TI  - Phylogenetic Characterization Genome Segment 2 of <i>Bluetongue Virus</i> Strains Belonging to Serotypes 5, 7 and 24 Isolated for the First Time in China During 2012 to 2014
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Bluetongue is endemic in China, and Bluetongue virus (BTV) strains belonging to eight different serotypes (BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-3, BTV-4, BTV-9, BTV-12, BTV-15 and BTV-16) had been isolated between 1996 and 1997. However, there has been a long pause in investigating the epidemiology of BTV infection since then. During 2012-2014, eight BTV strains belonging to serotypes 5, 7 and 24 were isolated for the first time in Yunnan and Guangdong provinces from the blood of sentinel animals. Phylogenetic analyses of genome segment 2 of these Chinese BTV strains grouped them into nucleotypes E, F and A, respectively, along with the reference strains of the same serotype. For each serotype, Chinese strains cluster together closely to form a China's sublineage. In addition, these strains were most closely related to strains from Africa, indicating that they may share a recent common ancestry with African strains. To our knowledge, this is the first time that BTV-5, BTV-7 and BTV-24 strains have been isolated in South-East Asia. These data will be beneficial for understanding the BTV epidemiology and improving diagnostic assays and control measures against bluetongue in China and its neighbouring countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

TI  - A Robust Algorithm for Estimating Surface Fractional Vegetation Cover from Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an essential land surface parameter for Earth surface process simulations and global change studies. The currently existing FVC products are mostly obtained from low or medium resolution remotely sensed data, while many applications require the fine spatial resolution FVC product. The availability of well-calibrated coverage of Landsat imagery over large areas offers an opportunity for the production of FVC at fine spatial resolution. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a general and reliable land surface FVC estimation algorithm for Landsat surface reflectance data under various land surface conditions. Two machine learning methods multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model and back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs) were trained using samples from PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and the scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves (SAIL) model simulations, which included Landsat reflectance and corresponding FVC values, and evaluated to choose the method which had better performance. Thereafter, the MARS model, which had better performance in the independent validation, was evaluated using ground FVC measurements from two case study areas. The direct validation of the FVC estimated using the proposed algorithm (Heihe: R-2 = 0.8825, RMSE = 0.097; Chengde using Landsat 7 ETM+: R-2 = 0.8571, RMSE = 0.078, Chengde using Landsat 8 OLI: R-2 = 0.8598, RMSE = 0.078) showed the proposed method had good performance. Spatial-temporal assessment of the estimated FVC from Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI data confirmed the robustness and consistency of the proposed method. All these results indicated that the proposed algorithm could obtain satisfactory accuracy and had the potential for the production of high-quality FVC estimates from Landsat surface reflectance data.

TI  - Assessment of Rainfall-Induced Landslide Susceptibility Using GIS-Based Slope Unit Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, in order to map storm event-induced landslide susceptibility for central Taiwan, remote-sensing data were used to interpret landslides using a geographical information system (GIS). Discriminant analysis was used to establish rules that can successfully classify landslide and nonlandslide slopes. GIS-based slope units were used as the terrain subdivision to determine landslide susceptibility. A set of causative factors and a triggering factor were used to build a landslide prediction model. Data for shallow landslides triggered by three crucial rainfall events in July 2001, July 2004, and June 2006 were selected for developing the model. Among the factors used, the total accumulated rainfall is found to be a key factor in the interpretation of landslides. The landslide susceptibility maps were built for the Guoshin region and validated using predicting samples and data from a subsequent storm event, the 2008 Sinlaku typhoon. Results show that the developed model is capable of predicting the shallow landslide distribution induced by heavy rainfall in the study area.

TI  - Downscaling Land Surface Temperature in an Arid Area by Using Multiple Remote Sensing Indices with Random Forest Regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many downscaling algorithms have been proposed to address the issue of coarse-resolution land surface temperature (LST) derived from available satellite-borne sensors. However, few studies have focused on improving LST downscaling in arid regions (especially in deserts) because of inaccurate remote sensing LST products. In this study, LST was downscaled by a random forest model between LST and multiple remote sensing indices (such as soil-adjusted vegetation index, normalized multi-band drought index, modified normalized difference water index, and normalized difference building index) in an arid region with an oasis-desert ecotone. The proposed downscaling approach, which involves the selection of remote sensing indices, was evaluated using LST derived from the MODIS LST product of Zhangye City in Heihe Basin. The spatial resolution of MODIS LST was downscaled from 1 km to 500 m. Results of visual and quantitative analyses show that the distribution of downscaled LST matched that of the oasis and desert ecosystem. The lowest (approximately 22 degrees C) and highest temperatures (higher than 37 degrees C) were detected in the middle oasis and desert regions, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieves relatively satisfactory downscaling results, with coefficient of determination and root mean square error of 0.84 and 2.42 degrees C, respectively. The proposed approach shows higher accuracy and minimization of the MODIS LST in the desert region compared with other methods. Optimal availability occurs in the vegetated region during summer and autumn. In addition, the approach is also efficient and reliable for LST downscaling of Landsat images. Future tasks include reliable LST downscaling in challenging regions.

TI  - Modeling Canopy Reflectance Over Sloping Terrain Based on Path Length Correction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sloping terrain induces distortion of canopy reflectance (CR), and the retrieval of biophysical variables from remote sensing data needs to account for topographic effects. We developed a 1-D model (the path length correction (PLC)-based model) for simulating CR over sloping terrain. The effects of sloping terrain on single-order and diffuse scatterings are accounted for by PLC and modification of the fraction of incoming diffuse irradiance, respectively. The PLC model was validated via both Monte Carlo and remote sensing image simulations. The comparison with the Monte Carlo simulation revealed that the PLC model can capture the pattern of slope-induced reflectance distortion with high accuracy (red band: R-2 = 0.88; root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.0045; relative RMSE (RRMSE) = 15%; near infrared response (NIR) band: R-2 = 0.79; RMSE = 0.041; RRMSE = 16%). The comparison of the PLC-simulated results with remote sensing observations acquired by the Landsat8-OLI sensor revealed an accuracy similar to that with the Monte Carlo simulation (red band: R-2 = 0.83; RMSE = 0.0053; RRMSE = 13%; NIR band: R-2 = 0.77; RMSE = 0.023; RRMSE = 8%). To further validate the PLC model, we used it to implement topographic normalization; the results showed a large reduction in topographic effects after normalization, which implied that the PLC model captures reflectance variations caused by terrain. The PLC model provides a promising tool to improve the simulation of CR and the retrieval of biophysical variables over mountainous regions.

TI  - What is the Direction of Land Change? A New Approach to Land-Change Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate characterization of the direction of land change is a neglected aspect of land dynamics. Knowledge on direction of historical land change can be useful information when understanding relative influence of different land-change drivers is of interest. In this study, we present a novel perspective on land-change analysis by focusing on directionality of change. To this end, we employed Maximum Cross-Correlation (MCC) approach to estimate the directional change in land cover in a dynamic river floodplain environment using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images. This approach has previously been used for detecting and measuring fluid and ice motions but not to study directional changes in land cover. We applied the MCC approach on land-cover class membership layers derived from fuzzy remote-sensing image classification. We tested the sensitivity of the resulting displacement vectors to three user-defined parameters-template size, search window size, and a threshold parameter to determine valid (non-noisy) displacement vectors-that directly affect the generation of change, or displacement, vectors; this has not previously been thoroughly investigated in any application domain. The results demonstrate that it is possible to quantitatively measure the rate of directional change in land cover in this floodplain environment using this particular approach. Sensitivity analyses indicate that template size and MCC threshold parameter are more influential on the displacement vectors than search window size. The results vary by land-cover class, suggesting that spatial configuration of land-cover classes should be taken into consideration in the implementation of the method.

TI  - Multi-Year Mapping of Maize and Sunflower in Hetao Irrigation District of China with High Spatial and Temporal Resolution Vegetation Index Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop identification in large irrigation districts is important for crop yield estimation, hydrological simulation, and agricultural water management. Remote sensing provides an opportunity to visualize crops in the regional scale. However, the use of coarse resolution remote sensing images for crop identification usually causes great errors due to the presence of mixed pixels in regions with complex planting structure of crops. Therefore, it is preferable to use remote sensing data with high spatial and temporal resolutions in crop identification. This study aimed to map multi-year distributions of major crops (maize and sunflower) in Hetao Irrigation District, the third largest irrigation district in China, using HJ-1A/1B CCD images with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) series obtained from HJ-1A/1B CCD images was fitted with an asymmetric logistic curve to find the NDVI characteristics and phenological metrics for both maize and sunflower. Nine combinations of NDVI characteristics and phenological metrics were compared to obtain the optimal classifier to map maize and sunflower from 2009 to 2015. Results showed that the classification ellipse with the NDVI characteristic of the left inflection point in the NDVI curve and the phenological metric from the left inflection point to the peak point normalized, with mean values of corresponding grassland indexes achieving the minimum mean relative error of 10.82% for maize and 4.38% for sunflower. The corresponding Kappa coefficient was 0.62. These results indicated that the vegetation and phenology-based classifier using HJ-1A/1B data could effectively identify multi-year distribution of maize and sunflower in the study region. It was found that maize was mainly distributed in the middle part of the irrigation district (Hangjinhouqi and Linhe), while sunflower mainly in the east part (Wuyuan). The planting sites of sunflower had been gradually expanded from Wuyuan to the north part of Hangjinhouqi and Linhe. These results were in agreement with the local economic policy. Results also revealed the increasing trends of both maize and sunflower planting areas during the study period.

TI  - Current management of pregnancy-associated breast cancer
T2  - HONG KONG MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Pregnancy-associated breast cancer is the most common malignancy during pregnancy with an expected rise in incidence. The belief in the need for termination of pregnancy and that chemotherapy is contra-indicated during pregnancy is challenged by recent evidence. Patients can consider breast conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy with acceptably low fetal risk from radiation exposure. A range of chemotherapeutics is possible in the second trimester in terms of drug class and frequency. Hormonal therapy and monoclonal antibody therapy are contra-indicated during pregnancy and lactation. Fetal outcome after in-utero exposure to chemotherapy appears similar to that in a non-pregnant population. Future pregnancy, in most situations, does not appear to be contra-indicated but a multidisciplinary and patient-centred approach is recommended. Fertility preservation techniques are also being developed with reported success and consequent pregnancies.

TI  - The Effects of Interannual Rainfall Variability on Tree-Grass Composition Along Kalahari Rainfall Gradient
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation variability has been predicted to increase in a global warmer climate, and is expected to greatly affect plant growth, interspecies interactions, plant community composition, and other ecosystem processes. Although previous studies have investigated the effect of intra-annual rainfall variability on plant growth and ecosystem dynamics, the impacts of interannual rainfall variability remain understudied. This paper uses satellite data and develops a new mechanistic model to investigate the response of tree-grass composition to increasing interannual rainfall variability in arid to sub-humid ecosystems along the Kalahari Transect in Southern Africa. Both satellite data and model results show that increasing interannual rainfall fluctuations favor deep-rooted trees over shallow-rooted grasses in drier environments (that is, mean annual rainfall, MAP < 900-1000 mm) but favor grasses over trees in wetter environments (that is, MAP > 900-1000 mm). Trees have a competitive advantage over grasses in dry environments because their generally deeper root systems allow them to have exclusive access to the increased deep soil water resources expected to occur in wet years as a result of the stronger interannual rainfall fluctuations. In relatively wet environments, grasses are favored because of their high growth rate that allows them to take advantage of the window of opportunity existing in years with above average precipitation and thus increase fire-induced tree mortality. Thus, under increasing interannual rainfall fluctuations both direct effects on soil water availability and indirect effects mediated by tree-grass interactions and fire dynamics are expected to play an important role in determining changes in plant community composition.

TI  - Improving satellite-based PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimates in China using Gaussian processes modeling in a Bayesian hierarchical setting
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements and statistical models to estimate ground-level PM2.5 is a promising way to fill the areas that are not covered by ground PM2.5 monitors. The statistical models used in previous studies are primarily Linear Mixed Effects (LME) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models. In this study, we developed a new regression model between PM2.5 and AOD using Gaussian processes in a Bayesian hierarchical setting. Gaussian processes model the stochastic nature of the spatial random effects, where the mean surface and the covariance function is specified. The spatial stochastic process is incorporated under the Bayesian hierarchical framework to explain the variation of PM2.5 concentrations together with other factors, such as AOD, spatial and non-spatial random effects. We evaluate the results of our model and compare them with those of other, conventional statistical models (GWR and LME) by within-sample model fitting and out-of-sample validation (cross validation, CV). The results show that our model possesses a CV result (R-2 = 0.81) that reflects higher accuracy than that of GWR and LME (0.74 and 0.48, respectively). Our results indicate that Gaussian process models have the potential to improve the accuracy of satellite-based PM2.5 estimates.

TI  - Assimilation of Sentinel-1 Derived Sea Surface Winds for Typhoon Forecasting
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wind observations provide fine structural information for tropical cycles and could be assimilated into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. However, in the conventional method assimilating the u and v components for SAR wind observations (SAR_uv), the wind direction is not a state vector and its observational error is not considered during the assimilation calculation. In this paper, an improved method for wind observation directly assimilates the SAR wind observations in the form of speed and direction (SAR_sd). This method was implemented to assimilate the sea surface wind retrieved from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in the basic three-dimensional variational system for the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF 3DVAR). Furthermore, a new quality control scheme for wind observations is also presented. Typhoon Lionrock in August 2016 is chosen as a case study to investigate and compare both assimilation methods. The experimental results show that the SAR wind observations can increase the number of the effective observations in the area of a typhoon and have a positive impact on the assimilation analysis. The numerical forecast results for this case show better results for the SAR_sd method than for the SAR_uv method. The SAR_sd method looks very promising for winds assimilation under typhoon conditions, but more cases need to be considered to draw final conclusions.

TI  - The Clinical Application of Mastectomy With Single Incision Followed by Immediate Laparoscopic-Assisted Breast Reconstruction With Latissimus Dorsi Muscle Flap
T2  - SURGICAL INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the clinical application of mastectomy with single incision followed by immediate laparoscopic-assisted breast reconstruction with latissimus dorsi muscle flap. Methods: Fifteen women with primary early breast cancer, 3 women with breast ductal carcinoma in situ, and 7 women with severe plasma cell mastitis were treated with partial mastectomy or total mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, or axillary lymph node dissection through a breast lateral transverse incision. Subsequent breast reconstruction with latissimus dorsi muscle flap was assisted by laparoscopy. The patient's position, time used in dissecting latissimus dorsi muscle flap, size of latissimus dorsi muscle flap, postoperative complications, and the cosmetic results after reconstruction were assessed. Results: All the operations were well done through the breast lateral transverse incision and assistance of laparoscopy. The patient's position was changed only once during the operation. It took 1.5 to 2 hours to dissect latissimus dorsi muscle flap. The sizes of the latissimus dorsi muscle flap were 5 to 8 x 12 to 16 cm. There were no serious postoperative complications noted. The patients were satisfied with the appearance of the breasts and the small surgical scar. Conclusion: The surgical approach introduced is minimally invasive with concealed scar and outstanding cosmetic results. It is worth promoting in clinical application.

T2  - World journal of oncology
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - This study set out to investigate the clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies for malignant breast adenomyoepithelioma (AME), thus increasing the clinical knowledge on such disease. Two patients with malignant breast AME in Beijing Friendship Hospital were selected for study. Here we report the diagnosis and treatment processes in terms of the failure experience and lessons and relate our findings to those in the literature. Malignant breast AME is inclined to affect the areola area. It is recommended to conduct simple mastectomy combined with sentinel lymph node dissection due to the low sensitivity of the preoperative imaging diagnosis and difficulty in the pathological diagnosis. Malignant breast AME features strong invasiveness and vulnerability to recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, the operative schemes and clinical treatment strategies should be formulated based on the comprehensive analyses of the physical signs, imageological examinations and pathology.

M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring coastal areas is an important parameter in the sustainable development and protection of the environment. The expansion of constructions in Iran's southern coasts has not only led to the destruction of geomorphological landforms, but has also changed the process of erosion and sedimentation in coastal areas. Nowadays, remote sensing data are considered as the most efficient source of information for the study and interpretation of coastal landforms, tidal levels, changes in coastline, depth of water, and so forth. The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes in the coastline of Chabahar Gulf, located on the coasts of the Oman Sea by using remote sensing techniques. This study examined and interpreted qualitative and quantitative changes of the coastlines in a forty-two-year period. Different supervised classification methods were used from which the most accurate one was ultimately chosen. The classified images were divided into two classes of land and water, and the changes of these two classes between 1972 and 2014 were extracted. The net change results indicate that in the forty-two-year period, 1,832,436 m(2) of the land has been added to water class, and 7,004,844 m(2) of water has been added to land.

TI  - The application of geospatial techniques in monitoring karst vegetation recovery in southwest China: A review
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The karst region in southwestern China, one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world, is special for its high landscape heterogeneity, unique hydrology, high endemism among vegetation species and high intensity of human disturbance. The region had experienced severe degradation through karst rocky desertification (KRD) between the 1950s and 1990s. Starting in the late 1990s, various levels of the Chinese government conducted several ecological projects to recover degraded karst ecosystems. It was reported that the implementation of these projects had been successful in facilitating the recovery of karst vegetation in many areas. However, global climate changes may compromise the efficacy of recovery. Geospatial techniques had been employed to map and monitor karst ecosystem conditions during the recovery process. We examined the history and progress of the various geospatial techniques applied to monitor and evaluate karst vegetation conditions. In addition, we reviewed the techniques used to assess and monitor KRD, KRD influencing factors, vegetation community type, fractional vegetation cover, vegetation dynamics, vegetation productivity, ecosystem goods and services, vegetation biodiversity, ecosystem health and rural society changes. We also explored the potential to apply geospatial techniques for karst vegetation recovery in the future. It is projected that there will be more remotely sensed images for the vegetation dynamics monitoring at numerous scales. New techniques (e.g. image fusion and data assimilation) will be available to manage scale and heterogeneity issues in the karst landscape.

TI  - A Hurricane Wind Speed Retrieval Model for C-Band RADARSAT-2 Cross-Polarization ScanSAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A hybrid backscattering model is built to provide a consistent description for C-band VH- and VV-polarized normalized radar cross sections (NRCSs). Ocean surface co- and cross-polarized NRCS are both treated as a sum of Bragg and non-Bragg scattering components. To better understand the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observed NRCS signals under high-wind conditions, five C-band RADARSAT-2 dual-polarization SAR hurricane images and the collocated wind vectors measured by the airborne stepped-frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) are collected. Based on the match-up data, we add a non-Bragg term in the composite Bragg theory to explain the discrepancy between the measurements in the cross-polarization channel and the existing theory results. The non-Bragg scattering to Bragg scattering ratio (B-r) is found to be a constant. We build the hybrid backscattering model with B-r and establish a relationship between the cross-polarization NRCS and the radar incidence angle under different wind conditions. The NRCS dependence on incidence angle is simulated by the hybrid backscattering model. Finally, a C-band Cross-Polarization Coupled-Parameters Ocean (C-3PO) model is developed to retrieve hurricane winds using VH-polarized ScanSAR by including the radar incidence angle. The collocated SAR and SFMR data sets are separated into two parts: data set-A, for hybrid backscattering model derivation and C-3PO model coefficients tuning, and data set-B, for hurricane wind validation. C-3PO model validation results show that the model is suitable for ocean surface wind mapping from RADARSAT-2 cross-polarization ScanSAR images. The retrieval has a root-mean-square error less than 3 m/s for wind speed up to 40 m/s.

TI  - Using the 500 m MODIS land cover product to derive a consistent continental scale 30 m Landsat land cover classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification is a fundamental process in remote sensing used to relate pixel values to land cover classes present on the surface. Over large areas land cover classification is challenging particularly due to the cost and difficulty of collecting representative training data that enable classifiers to be consistent and locally reliable. A novel methodology to classify large volume Landsat data using high quality training data derived from the 500 m MODIS land cover product is demonstrated and used to generate a 30 m land cover classification for all of North America between 20 degrees N and 50 degrees N. Publically available 30 m global monthly Web-enabled Landsat Data (GWELD) products generated from every available Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 5 TM image for a three year period, that are defined aligned to the MODIS land products and are consistently pre-processed data (cloud-screened, saturation flagged, atmospherically corrected and normalized to nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance), were classified. The MODIS 500 m land cover product was filtered judiciously, using only good quality pixels that did not change land cover class in 2009, 2010 or 2011, followed by automated selection of spatially corresponding 30 m GWELD temporal metric values, to define a large training data set sampled across North America. The training data were sampled so that the class proportions were the same as the North America MODIS land cover product class proportions and corresponded to 1% of the 500 m and <0.005% of the 30 m pixels. Thirty nine GWELD temporal metrics for every 30 m North America pixel location were classified using (a) a single random forest, and (b) a locally adaptive method with a random forest classifier derived and applied locally and the classification results spatially mosaicked together. The land cover classification results appeared geographically plausible and at synoptic scale were similar to the MODIS land cover product. Detailed visual inspection revealed that the locally adaptive random forest classifications and associated classification confidences were generally more coherent than the single random forest classification results. The level of agreement between the 30 m classifications and the MODIS land cover product derived training data was assessed by bootstrapping the random forest implementation. The locally adaptive random forest classification had higher overall agreement (95.44%, 0.9443 kappa) than the single random forest classification (93.13%, 0.9195 kappa). The paper concludes with a discussion of future research including the potential for automated global land cover classification. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Tetra-primer ARMS PCR for rapid detection and characterisation of <i>Plasmopara viticola</i> phenotypes resistant to carboxylic acid amide fungicides
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDThe occurrence of Plasmopara viticola populations resistant to carboxylic acid amide (CAA) fungicides is becoming a serious problem in the control of grapevine downy mildew worldwide. The resistance is caused by point mutations in the PvCesA3 gene. These isolates with this mutation have been detected mainly by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration of fungicides, which is always time consuming and inefficient.RESULTSTo establish a suitable method for rapid detection of the G1105S mutation in P. viticola, an efficient and simple molecular method was developed, based on tetra-primer ARMS PCR. A set of four primers were designed and optimised to distinguish the different genotypes within one step. Only 2 h was required from the sampling of symptoms to the phenotyping of fungicide resistance. Using this method, CAA-resistant P. viticola were identified for the first time in China. Also, the finding of sensitive heterozygotes indicated that the resistant allele is spreading in the population in Ziyuan.CONCLUSIONThis new method proved to be useful as an early warning system for resistance outbreaks of P. viticola to CAA fungicides in the field and may be helpful in decisions concerning rotation of different fungicide groups.

TI  - Validation of MODIS C6 AOD products retrieved by the Dark Target method in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, China
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality of the MODIS C6 3-km and 10-km aerosol optical depth (AOD) products retrieved by the Dark Target (DT) method is discussed using ground-based observations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008. Good consistency exists between the 3-km and 10-km products and ground-based observations. The retrieval accuracy of the two products both show distinctive seasonality. The percentage falling within the expected error (EE) is largest in the winter, moderate in the spring and autumn, and smallest in the summer. A worse overestimation appears in the spring and summer (27%-66%). However, the 3-km and 10-km products over different surfaces still exhibit obvious deviations. The 10-km product performs better in the large cities, while the 3-km product has advantages in the suburbs. In urban areas, the percentage falling within EE of the 3-km AOD product (18%-59%) is lower than that for the 10-km AOD product (31%-69%). However, in suburban areas, the percentage falling within EE of the 3-km AOD product (61%-84%) is higher than for the 10 km AOD product (54%-83%).The percentages falling within EE differ considerably when the AOD is greater than 1.5 (73% and 63% for the 3-km and 10-km products, respectively). On the whole, the 3-km (10-km) AOD product performs better in suburban (urban) areas.

In this study, the canopy reflectance time series of three typical subtropical forests (moso bamboo forest, MBF; lei bamboo forest, LBF; evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest, EDBF) was simulated by coupling PROSPECT5 and 4SAIL models. First, the sensitivity of parameters in PROSPECT5 and 4SAIL model was analyzed to discuss the effects of parameters on the canopy reflectance simulation. Second, unsensitive parameters were optimized using the observed reflectance. Finally, the canopy reflectances of three typical subtropical forests were simulated using PROSPECT5 and 4SAIL models, and compared with MODIS reflectance dataset. The results showed that leaf area index was most sensitive to bands 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7, with the total-order sensitivity indexes of 0.80, 0.83, 0.49, 0.66 and 0.47, respectively. Chlorophyll content was most sensitive to band 4, with the total-order sensitivity index of 0.59. Leaf water content was most sensitive to band 6, with the total-order sensitivity index of 0.54. Leaf structure, carotenoids content, dry matter content, hot parameter and soil factors were not/low sensitive to these bands. Canopy reflectance simulated using the optimized PROSPECT5 and 4SAIL models had the capability in reflecting the real seasonal changes of three typical subtropical forests. The simulated canopy reflectance significantly correlated with MODIS reflectance, with high R-2 of 0.86, 0.90, 0.93, and low root mean square of 0.09, 0.07, 0.05 for MBF, LBF, and EDBF, respectively. The simulated canopy reflectance solved to some extent the problems of influence on MODIS reflectance products by precipitation and snow in winter, and mixed pixels.

TI  - Effects of Land Use/Cover Changes and Urban Forest Configuration on Urban Heat Islands in a Loess Hilly Region: Case Study Based on Yan'an City, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study Yan'an City, a typical hilly valley city, was considered as the study area in order to explain the relationships between the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and land use/land cover (LULC) types, the landscape pattern metrics of LULC types and land surface temperature (LST) and remote sensing indexes were retrieved from Landsat data during 1990-2015, and to find factors contributed to the green space cool island intensity (GSCI) through field measurements of 34 green spaces. The results showed that during 1990-2015, because of local anthropogenic activities, SUHI was mainly located in lower vegetation cover areas. There was a significant suburban-urban gradient in the average LST, as well as its heterogeneity and fluctuations. Six landscape metrics comprising the fractal dimension index, percentage of landscape, aggregation index, division index, Shannon's diversity index, and expansion intensity of the classified LST spatiotemporal changes were paralleled to LULC changes, especially for construction land, during the past 25 years. In the urban area, an index-based built-up index was the key positive factor for explaining LST increases, whereas the normalized difference vegetation index and modified normalized difference water index were crucial factors for explaining LST decreases during the study periods. In terms of the heat mitigation performance of green spaces, mixed forest was better than pure forest, and the urban forest configuration had positive effects on GSCI. The results of this study provide insights into the importance of species choice and the spatial design of green spaces for cooling the environment.

TI  - Estimation of vegetation net primary productivity in Hailiutu River catchment of Mu Us Sandland
T2  - Journal of Plant Resources and Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) model, and combing TERRA MODIS satellite data and meteorological data, vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) of each month in Hailiutu River catchment of Mu Us Sandland in 2015 was estimated, and spatial and temporal distribution rule and its relationships with meteorological factors and depth to water table were analyzed. The results show that in 2015, total vegetation NPP is 2.88x10(11) g in Hailiutu River catchment of Mu Us Sandland, and the sum of vegetation NPP during the growing season (April to October) reaches 2.81x10(11) g, accounting for 97.57% of total vegetation NPP of whole year. With prolonging of time, monthly mean vegetation NPP and monthly mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) appear the trend of "increasing slowly increasing sharply decreasing sharply". The seasonal variation of monthly mean vegetation NPP is clear, and the sums of monthly' mean vegetation NPP in spring, summer, autumn and winter are 20.55, 69.39, 20.46 and 0.48 g.m(-2), respectively. On the view of spatial distribution, monthly mean vegetation NPP in river valley and bottomland in middle area is generally higher than that in dune and desert in southeastern, western and northwestern areas. The effect of monthly mean temperature on change of monthly mean vegetation NPP is the greatest, following by mean actual daily evapotranspiration and surface monthly solar radiation. With increasing of depth to water table, monthly mean vegetation NPP decreases, and the maximum value occurs in depth to water table of 1-2 m. It is suggested that vegetation NPP in Hailiutu River catchment of Mu Us Sandland can be estimated well by using CASA model, and monthly mean temperature and depth to water table have important effects on vegetation NPP in this catchment.

TI  - Water Optics and Water Colour Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The editorial paper aims to highlight the main topics investigated in the Special Issue (SI) "Water Optics and Water Colour Remote Sensing". The outcomes of the 21 papers published in the SI are presented, along with a bibliometric analysis in the same field, namely, water optics and water colour remote sensing. This editorial summarises how the research articles of the SI approach the study of bio-optical properties of aquatic systems, the development of remote sensing algorithms, and the application of time-series satellite data for assessing long-term and temporal-spatial dynamics in inland, coastal, and oceanic waters. The SI shows the progress with a focus on: (1) bio-optical properties (three papers); (2) atmospheric correction and data uncertainties (five papers); (3) remote sensing estimation of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) (eight papers); (4) remote sensing estimation of suspended matter and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (four papers); and (5) water quality and water ecology remote sensing (four papers). Overall, the SI presents a variety of applications at the global scale (with case studies in Europe, Asia, South and North America, and the Antarctic), achieved with different remote sensing instruments, such as hyperspectral field and airborne sensors, ocean colour radiometry, geostationary platforms, and the multispectral Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites. The bibliometric analysis, carried out to include research articles published from 1900 to 2016, indicates that "chlorophyll-a", "ocean colour", "phytoplankton", "SeaWiFS" (Sea-Viewing-Wide Field-of-View Sensor), and "chromophoric dissolved organic matter" were the five most frequently used keywords in the field. The SI contents, along with the bibliometric analysis, clearly suggest that remote sensing of Chl-a is one of the topmost investigated subjects in the field.

TI  - Investigation of the Impacts of Urban Land Use Patterns on Energy Consumption in China: A Case Study of 20 Provincial Capital Cities
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land use patterns are increasingly recognized as significant contributors to energy consumption. However, few studies have quantified the impacts of urban land use patterns on energy consumption. In this study, we analyzed the impacts of urban land use patterns on energy consumption for 20 provincial capital cities in China from 2000 to 2010. Landsat data and spatial metrics were first used to quantify the urban land use patterns, and then city-level energy consumption was estimated based on nighttime light (NTL) data and statistical provincial energy consumption data. Finally, a panel data analysis was applied to investigate the impacts of urban land use patterns on energy consumption. Our results showed that NTL data were effective for estimating energy consumption at the city level and indicated that accelerated energy consumption was caused by increases in the irregularity of urban land forms and the expansion of urban land. Moreover, significant regional differences in the impacts of urban land use patterns on energy consumptions were identified. Our results provide insights into the relationship between urban growth and energy consumption and may support effective planning towards sustainable development.

TI  - A Novel Method of Change Detection in Bi-Temporal PolSAR Data Using a Joint-Classification Classifier Based on a Similarity Measure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely change detection of the Earth's surface features is extremely important for understanding the relationships and interactions between people and natural phenomena. Owing to the all-weather response capability, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has become a key tool for change detection. Change detection includes both unsupervised and supervised methods. Unsupervised change detection is simple and effective, but cannot detect the type of land cover change. Supervised change detection can detect the type of land cover change, but is easily affected and depended by the human interventions. To solve these problems, a novel method of change detection using a joint-classification classifier (JCC) based on a similarity measure is introduced. The similarity measure is obtained by a test statistic and the Kittler and Illingworth (TSKI) minimum-error thresholding algorithm, which is used to automatically control the JCC. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by the use of bi-temporal PolSAR images acquired by RADARSAT-2 over Wuhan, China. The experimental results show that the proposed method can identify the different types of land cover change and can reduce both the false detection rate and false alarm rate in the change detection.

TI  - Estimation of high-resolution near-surface freeze/thaw state by the integration of microwave and thermal infrared remote sensing data on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate how the complementarity between microwave and thermal infrared remote sensing can be exploited for a high-resolution near-surface freeze/thaw state estimation. The basic idea is to establish a feasible relationship between the microwave-derived freeze/thaw state and thermal infrared observations. A quantitative freeze/thaw index from microwave observations at 18.7 and 36.5 GHz is innovatively defined and is assumed to be linearly correlated with land surface temperature from thermal infrared observations. Thus, a linear regression method is proposed and verified to be effective over a multiscale network of Naqu of the Tibetan Plateau. In order to demonstrate the potentiality of the proposed method, it is implemented in the entire Tibetan Plateau. It is found that the linear relationship is quite reliable for most areas and can obtain a high-resolution near-surface soil freeze/thaw state with integrated information from microwave and thermal infrared remote sensing. The validation of the high-resolution freeze/thaw state against soil temperature measured at active layer monitoring sites along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway illustrates a moderate accuracy over a decade scale. This study provides new insights for high-resolution freeze/thaw mapping beyond the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission.

TI  - Combined Space and Ground Radars for Improving Quantitative Precipitation Estimations in the Eastern Downstream Region of the Tibetan Plateau. Part I: Variability in the Vertical Structure of Precipitation in ChuanYu Analyzed from Long-Term Spaceborne Observations by TRMM PR
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a statistical analysis of the variability of the vertical structure of precipitation in the eastern downstream region of the Tibetan Plateau as measured by the Precipitation Radar (PR) on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. Data were analyzed over an 11-yr time span (January 2004-December 2014). The results show the seasonal and spatial variability of the storm height, freezing level, and bright band for different types of precipitation as well as the characteristics of intensity-related and type-related vertical profiles of reflectivity (VPR). Major findings were as follows: About 90% of the brightband peak reflectivity of stratiform precipitation was less than 32 dBZ, and 40% of the maximum reflectivity of convective precipitation exceeded 35 dBZ. The intensity of surface rainfall rates also depended on the shapes of VPRs. For stratiform precipitation, ice-snow aggregation was faster during moderate and heavy rainfall than it was in light rainfall. Since both the moisture and temperature are lower in winter, the transformation efficiency of hydrometeors becomes slower. Typical Ku-band representative climatological VPRs (CPRs) for stratiform precipitation have been created on the basis of the integration of normalized VPR shape for the given area and the rainfall intensity. All of the findings indicate that the developed CPRs can be used to improve surface precipitation estimates in regions with complex terrain where the ground-based radar net has limited visibility at low levels.

TI  - A Thermal Sampling Depth Correction Method for Land Surface Temperature Estimation From Satellite Passive Microwave Observation Over Barren Land
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite passive microwave (MW) remote sensing has a better ability to observe land surface temperature (LST) in cloudy conditions than thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing. Due to the much greater thermal sampling depth (TSD) of MW, currently available MW LST do not represent the thermodynamic temperature of the land surface and, therefore, yield systematic differences from TIR LST. The TSD effect is particularly prominent over barren land and sparsely vegetated surfaces. Here, we present a novel TSD correction (TSDC) method to estimate the MW LST over barren land. The core of this method is a new formulation of the passive MW radiation balance equation, which allows linking MW effective physical temperature to the soil temperature at a specific depth. The TSDC method is applied to the 6.9-GHz channel of AMSR-E in northwestern China-western Mongolia and western Namibia (WN). Evaluation shows that LST estimated by the TSDC method agrees well with the MODIS LST. Validation based on in situ LSTs measured at the Gobabeb site in WN demonstrates the high accuracy of the TSDC method: it yields a root mean squared error of about 2-3 K and slight systematic error. In contrast, other methods without TSDC yield lower accuracies and significantly underestimate LST. Therefore, the TSDC method has the potential to generate MW LST with the same physical meaning and similar accuracy as TIR LST. This study provides implications for developing practical and accurate methods to estimate MW LST over other land surface types and at the global scale.

M3  - Article
AB  - This letter expands the block adjustment method by, respectively, adopting high-precision global positioning system (GPS) points, geoscience laser altimeter system (GLAS) data, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)-digital elevation model (DEM) as vertical control data. Block adjustment experiments were conducted with these control data, with 388 ZY-3 satellite stereo image pairs across over 18 600 km(2) of land in Hubei province of China utilized as experimental images and 180 GPS points as checkpoints. The experimental results obtained show that, with the adoption of 23 GPS points as control points, the horizontal root-mean-square error (RMSE) and vertical RMSE of the ZY-3 image improved from 10.97 to 5.72 m and from 7.12 to 1.65 m, respectively. Furthermore, with the adoption of 326 GLAS data points as vertical control points, the vertical RMSE of the ZY-3 images of the flat terrain areas and mountain terrain areas improved to 1.69 and 3.62 m, respectively. Through block adjustment constrained by SRTM-DEM, the vertical RMSE of the ZY-3 images was 1.44 m for flat terrain areas and 3.05 m for mountain terrain areas, respectively. The vertical accuracy of the satellite images was significantly enhanced, especially on the flat terrain area, when GLAS and STRM-DEM were used for vertical control block adjustment, which is similar to the vertical accuracy of block adjustments adopting GPS points as control.

TI  - Adaptive Scale Selection for Multiscale Segmentation of Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With dramatically increasing of the spatial resolution of satellite imaging sensors, object-based image analysis (OBIA) has been gaining prominence in remote sensing applications. Multiscale image segmentation is a prerequisite step that splits an image into hierarchical homogeneous segmented objects for OBIA. However, scale selection remains a challenge in multiscale segmentation. In this study, we presented an adaptive approach for defining and estimating the optimal scale in the multiscale segmentation process. Central to our method is the combined use of image features from segmented objects and prior knowledge from historical thematic maps in a top-down segmentation procedure. Specifically, the whole image was first split into segmented objects, with the largest scale in a presupposition segmentation scale sequence. Second, based on segmented object features and prior knowledge in the local region of thematic maps, we calculated complexity values for each segmented object. Third, if the complexity values of an object were large enough, this object would be further split into multiple segmented objects with a smaller scale in the scale sequence. Then, in the similar manner, complex segmented objects were split into the simplest objects iteratively. Finally, the final segmentation result was obtained and evaluated. We have applied this method on a GF-1 multispectral satellite image and a ZY-3 multispectral satellite image to produce multiscale segmentation maps and further classification maps, compared with the state-of-the-art and the traditional mean shift algorithm. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method is practically helpful and efficient to produce the appropriate segmented image objects with optimal scales.

TI  - Retrospective observational study about reducing the false negative rate of the sentinel lymph node biopsy Never underestimate the effect of subjective factors
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing the false negative rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for breast cancer patients has always been a focus of clinical research. We aimed to map the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in detail, and analyze the factors related to SLNs located at locations that are often ignored by surgeons, to reduce the rate of false negatives from SLNB. A retrospective analysis involving 545 breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB in west China hospital between August 2010 and February 2016 was performed. Blue dye, radioisotope, or combined methods were used for tracing SLNs. Using blue dye, radioisotope, and a combination of blue dye and radioisotope successfully traced SLNs in 479, 507, and 525 patients, the detection rate was 88.2%, 93.9%, and 97.4%, respectively. Among the 1559 detected SLNs, 139 (9.6%) were located at the latissimus dorsi lateral margin, and 108 (6.9%) were located at level 2. Subcutaneous injection of radioisotope (P =. 004) and intradermal injection of blue dye (P=. 002) were independent factors associated with SLNs distributed at level 2 and the latissimus dorsi lateral margin, respectively. It was noteworthy that 2 of 7 patients had skipping metastasis in level 2, so subcutaneous injection of the isotope is strongly recommended for tracing SLNs distributed in level 2 because of the possibility of skipping metastasis. Though intradermal injection of blue dye was superior methods for tracing SLNs located at the latissimus dorsi lateral margin, we surprisingly found those patients with metastasis to the latissimus dorsi lateral margin nodes also could have metastasis to level 1 (expect for the latissimus dorsi lateral margin) nodes, it seemed that maybe there is no need to excise SLNs at the latissimus dorsi lateral margin in SLNB, whether such nodes should be regarded as useful for SLNB still needs to be determined by further large, multicenter clinical studies.

TI  - Change detection using landsat time series: A review of frequencies, preprocessing, algorithms, and applications
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The free and open access to all archived Landsat images in 2008 has completely changed the way of using Landsat data. Many novel change detection algorithms based on Landsat time series have been developed We present a comprehensive review of four important aspects of change detection studies based on Landsat time series, including frequencies, preprocessing, algorithms, and applications. We observed the trend that the more recent the study, the higher the frequency of Landsat time series used. We reviewed a series of image preprocessing steps, including atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud shadow detection, and composite/fusion/metrics techniques. We divided all change detection algorithms into six categories, including thresholding, differencing, segmentation, trajectory classification, statistical boundary, and regression. Within each category, six major characteristics of different algorithms, such as frequency, change index, univariate/multivariate, online/offline, abrupt/gradual change, and sub-pixel/pixel/spatial were analyzed. Moreover, some of the widely-used change detection algorithms were also discussed. Finally, we reviewed different change detection applications by dividing these applications into two categories, change target and change agent detection.

M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review Advances in cervical cancer screening and treatment have resulted in high cure rates in developed countries for early-stage disease. Current research focuses on minimizing morbidity and maximizing quality of life.Recent Findings Imaging has been disappointing in identifying small volume metastases. Sentinel lymph node biopsy represents a significant advantage with high sensitivity, low false negative rates, reduced morbidity, and equivalent survival in recent studies compared to pelvic lymphadenectomy. Non-radical surgical options are currently being investigated for early cervical cancer in a number of large prospective studies in patients at low risk for metastases.Summary Evidence suggests that sentinel lymph node biopsy and non-radical surgery are safe approaches for the staging and management of early cervical cancer in appropriately selected patients with the potential to significantly reduce treatment-related morbidity.

TI  - Biological threats from a 'One Health' perspective
T2  - REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological threats are a prime example of an issue that needs the 'One Health' approach. Such an approach would facilitate the prevention and mitigation of these threats. 'One Health' is defined as any added value in terms of the health of humans and animals, financial savings or environmental services achievable through the cooperation of human and veterinary medicines when compared to the two disciplines working, separately. This principle also applies to the involvement of other disciplines from the natural sciences and humanities. This paper is not an exhaustive survey of integrated approaches but discusses concepts and methods and provides key examples of the benefits of a 'One Health' approach when applied to biological threats. Zoonoses and vector-borne diseases (i.e. diseases transmitted between animals and humans and by insect or acarian vectors) remain central biological threats in highly dynamic social and environmental conditions. Such diseases are not always directly transmitted. Contaminated food, water, air and soil represent important sources of transmission for foodborne and environmentally related diseases. Therefore, this paper treats environmental sanitation separately because of the importance of the excreta management of humans and animals. Integrated syndromic surveillance and antimicrobial resistance surveillance link the above aspects and are showcases for a 'One Health' approach to biological threat reduction. Biological threats are not only related to natural conditions but may also be exacerbated by large development projects such as dams, mining and infrastructure. Consequently, it is recommended that the health impact assessment (HIA) approach be implemented as early as the planning stage of any large infrastructure project located in a complex socioecological system. This paper extends the HIA approach to an integrated 'One Health' impact assessment approach.

TI  - A Comparison of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy to Lymphadenectomy for Endometrial Cancer Staging (FIRES Trial): A Multicentre, Prospective, Cohort Study
T2  - OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - In more than 75% of women with endometrial cancer, the disease is confined to the uterus. Recurrence risk is defined by surgical staging with lymphadenectomy and helps in the decision to give adjuvant treatment to high-risk patients.The technique of sentinel-lymph-node (SLN) mapping for detection of endometrial cancer was described in 2006. With SLN biopsy, selective and limited removal of tumor-specific or organ-specific lymph nodes identified after injection of tracer dye allows surgeons to remove only the nodal tissue directly draining from the site of the primary tumor. There are no definitive studies to determine the accuracy and long-term outcomes of SLN mapping. A number of single-institution retrospective and prospective studies have reported the accuracy and feasibility of the technique. However, these were limited by small numbers of patients or surgeons, use of nonstandardized techniques, and many did not use routine systematic lymphadenectomy on all patients as a comparison.The primary aim of the FIRES study was to determine whether SLN biopsy is associated with a clinically acceptable sensitivity and negative predictive value in detecting lymphatic metastases in patients with endometrial cancer compared with lymphadenectomy-the criterion standard. FIRES was a multicenter, prospective, cohort study. Eligible patients had clinical stage 1 endometrial cancer of all histologies and grades and were undergoing robotic staging. Patients were given a standardized cervical injection of indocyanine green tracer; SLN mapping was followed by complete bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Eighteen surgeons from 10 tertiary academic and community nonacademic centers in the United States participated in the trial. Sentinel lymph nodes found to be negative by hematoxylin-eosin staining were ultrastaged with immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin.The primary study end points were the sensitivity of the SLN-based detection in identifying metastatic disease and the negative predictive value of the technique. Sensitivity was defined as the proportion of patients with node-positive disease who had successful SLN mapping (metastatic disease correctly identified). Patients included in the primary analysis (per protocol) had mapping of at least 1 SLN. All patients who received injection of dye (study intervention), regardless of mapping result, were included as part of the assessment of mapping and the safety analysis.Patients were enrolled between August 1, 2012, and October 20, 2015. Sentinel-lymph-node mapping with complete pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 340 patients; 196 (58%) of these had para-aortic lymphadenectomy. In 293 (86%) of the 340 patients, mapping successfully identified at least 1 SLN. Positive nodes were found in 41 patients (12%) who had lymphadenectomy, 36 of whom had at least 1 mapped SLN.In 35 (97%) of these 36 patients, nodal metastases were identified; the sensitivity to detect node-positive disease was 97.2% (95% confidence interval, 85.0%-100%), and the negative predictive value was 99.6% (95% confidence interval, 97.9%-100%). The most common grade 3 to 4 adverse events or serious adverse events were postoperative neurological disorders (4 patients), postoperative respiratory distress or failure (4 patients), bowel injury (3 patients), and postoperative nausea and vomiting (3 patients). Twenty-two patients had serious adverse events; 1 related to the study intervention was a ureteral injury incurred during SLN dissection.Consistent with the results of smaller studies, the FIRES trial data show a high degree of diagnostic accuracy for detecting endometrial cancer metastases using indocyanine green to identify SLNs. Approximately only 3% of patients with nodal metastases will not be identified. Sentinel-lymph-node biopsy can safely replace lymphadenectomy in the staging of endometrial cancer and will expose fewer patients to the morbidity of a complete lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Modeling water needs and total irrigation depths of maize crop in the south west of France using high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is projected to increase water resources limitation and to impact significantly agricultural production. A big challenge for agriculture will be to reduce the amount of water used to fit the environmental constraints, while maintaining a level of production that ensure food security. In this context, we develop a methodology based on high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data combined with a semi-empirical crop model coupling the Simple Algorithm For Yield estimates (SAFY, Duchemin et al., 2008, 2015) with the new formulation (Battude et al., 2016) to a water balance model adapted from the FAO-56 method (Allen et al., 1998). A module was added to automatically simulate irrigation. The model was used to assess the dynamics of actual Evapotranspiration (ETca) and water supplies of maize crop over large areas and during contrasted climatic years in the south west of France. It was first calibrated and evaluated over an experimental field using four years of ETca measurements. The validation was done over 18 maize fields and larger irrigated zones (135 ha to 450 ha) using total irrigation depths. This work permitted to quantify the ability of different methods to estimate the storage capacity (soil map vs in situ data) and the basal crop coefficient Kcb (standard vs remotely sensed values) and their impact on total irrigation depths. Good estimations were obtained for ETca (R=0.88; RRMSE=20%). The model also reproduced correctly the total irrigation depth over the 18 maize fields (R=0.79; RRMSE=18.8%) and three larger irrigated zones (R=0.8; RRMSE=42%). The underestimation (Bias = -93 mm) is due to several reasons such as errors in soil water storage capacity estimates, but also to an overestimation of water needs by water managers or a potential over-irrigation carried out by farmers. Finally, the work demonstrates the high potential of combining a simple agro-meteorological model using only few parameters with satellite imagery for a large-scale monitoring of total irrigation depth.

TI  - Validation of two Huanjing-1A/B satellite-based FAO-56 models for estimating winter wheat crop evapotranspiration during mid-season
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is an important indicator used in managing agriculture water and monitoring crop growth. The objectives of this study were to: (1) analyze the seasonal dynamics of crop coefficients (K-c) and basal crop coefficient (K-cb) derived from vegetation indices (VIs) based on a time series of Huanjing (HJ) satellite images during 2011 and 2013; (2) investigate daily and monthly variations of ET, at key growth stages of winter wheat using lysimeter or eddy covariance systems; (3) compare the performance of two Huanjing-1A/B satellite-based FAO-56 models (the FAO-56 dual-crop coefficient model and the vegetation indices-reference evapotranspiration (Vls-ET0) method) to the ET, measurements; (4) select the best ETc model for estimating daily ETc (mm/day) at the Xiaotangshan experimental site and its surrounding farmland in conjunction with HJ satellite overpasses from March to May 2011. The VIs and concurrent ETc were acquired at the Xiaotangshan experimental site, Beijing, China, during the 2011 and 2013 winter wheat growing seasons. The results showed that the overall tendencies of crop coefficient patterns (K-cb and K-c), ETc and ETc first increased and then decreased at key growth stages of winter wheat. The cumulative ETc of water consumption was highest at the heading-filling stage in May. Similar changes in cumulative ETc were found during April-May 2011 and 2013. The estimation accuracy of ET, was better based on FAO-56 dual-crop coefficient model (R-2 = 0.88 and RMSE= 1.06 mm/day in 2011 and R-2 = 0.84 and RMSE= 0.55 mm/day in 2013) than the VI-ET0 method (R-2 = 0.77 and RMSE= 1.22 mm/day in 2011 and R-2 = 0.67 and RMSE = 0.81 mm/day in 2013). The results indicated that the FAO-56 dual-crop coefficient model and VI-ETo methods were used to estimate ET, in winter wheat. Two Huanjing-1A/B satellite-based FAO-56 models were used to timely estimate ET, during the winter wheat mid-season, and ET, was used to adjust agricultural water management practices.

TI  - Uncertainty assessment and applicability of an inversion method for volcanic ash forecasting
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant improvements in the way we can observe and model volcanic ash clouds have been obtained since the 2010 Eyjafjallajokull eruption. One major development has been the application of data assimilation techniques, which combine models and satellite observations such that an optimal understanding of ash clouds can be gained. Still, questions remain regarding the degree to which the forecasting capabilities are improved by inclusion of such techniques and how these improvements depend on the data input. This study explores how different satellite data and different uncertainty assumptions of the satellite and a priori emissions affect the calculated volcanic ash emission estimate, which is computed by an inversion method that couples the satellite retrievals and a priori emissions with dispersion model data. Two major ash episodes over 4 days in April and May of the 2010 Eyjafjallajokull eruption are studied. Specifically, inversion calculations are done for four different satellite data sets with different size distribution assumptions in the retrieval. A reference satellite data set is chosen, and the range between the minimum and maximum 4-day average load of hourly retrieved ash is 121% in April and 148% in May, compared to the reference. The corresponding a posteriori maximum and minimum emission sum found for these four satellite retrievals is 26 and 47% of the a posteriori reference estimate for the same two periods, respectively. Varying the assumptions made in the satellite retrieval is seen to affect the a posteriori emissions and modelled ash column loads, and modelled column loads therefore have uncertainties connected to them depending on the uncertainty in the satellite retrieval. By further exploring our uncertainty estimates connected to a priori emissions and the mass load uncertainties in the satellite data, the uncertainty in the a priori estimate is found in this case to have an order-of-magnitude-greater impact on the a posteriori solution than the mass load uncertainties in the satellite. Part of this is explained by a too-high a priori estimate used in this study that is reduced by around half in the a posteriori reference estimate. Setting large uncertainties connected to both a priori and satellite mass load shows that they compensate each other, but the a priori uncertainty is found to be most sensitive. Because of this, an inversion-based emission estimate in a forecasting setting needs well-tested and well-considered assumptions on uncertainties for the a priori emission and satellite data. The quality of using the inversion in a forecasting environment is tested by adding gradually, with time, more observations to improve the estimated height versus time evolution of Eyjafjallajokull ash emissions. We show that the initially too-high a priori emissions are reduced effectively when using just 12 h of satellite observations. More satellite observations (>12 h), in the Eyjafjallajokull case, place the volcanic injection at higher altitudes. Adding additional satellite observations (>36 h) changes the a posteriori emissions to only a small extent for May and minimal for the April period, because the ash is dispersed and transported effectively out of the domain after 1-2 days. A best-guess emission estimate for the forecasting period was constructed by averaging the last 12 h of the a posteriori emission.Using this emission for a forecast simulation leads to better performance, especially compared to model simulations with no further emissions over the forecast period in the case of a continued volcanic eruption activity. Because of undetected ash in the satellite retrieval and diffusion in the model, the forecast simulations generally contain more ash than the observed fields, and the model ash is more spread out. Overall, using the a posteriori emissions in our model reduces the uncertainties in the ash plume forecast, because it corrects effectively for false-positive satellite retrievals, temporary gaps in observations, and false a priori emissions in the window of observation.

TI  - A satellite based crop water stress index for irrigation scheduling in sugarcane fields
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the capability of crop water stress index (CWSI) based on satellite thermal infrared data for estimating water stress and irrigation scheduling in sugarcane fields was evaluated. For this purpose, eight Landsat 8 satellite images were acquired during the sugarcane growing season (May-September 2015). Simultaneous with the satellite overpass times, in-situ measurements of canopy temperature and vegetation water content (VWC) were conducted in forty points located in eight sugarcane fields per image (in total 320 observation points in 32 fields). These fields were selected with different ages (Plant, Ratoon 1, Ratoon 2, and Ratoon 3) and irrigation schedule. Then, the CWSI was calculated in three different ways including: 1) based on the Idso method and using the handheld infrared thermometer, 2) based on the Idso method and thermal infrared data of Landsat 8 satellite imagery, 3) using a new proposed procedure for retrieving CWSI from the satellite imagery with using the hot and cold pixels. Results show a good relationship between the calculated CWSI based on field measurement and new CWSI based on satellite data with the coefficient of determination of 0.49-0.85 and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12-0.29 for different images. Further, a negative relationship between VWC and CWSI, with R-2 values of 0.42-0.78, was observed. This relationship increases with developing sugarcane canopy, and decreases with an increasing plant age. Comparing recorded irrigation events in the fields, estimated CWSI and VWC shows that water stress can be classified into three critical classes including high water stress (0.70 <VWC < 0.75), medium water stress (0.75 <VWC< 0.8), and low stress (0.8 < VWC < 0.85). This classification can be used as a part of an operational procedure for appropriate irrigation scheduling. All of the aforementioned results indicate that the CWSI based on the proposed approach in this study can be used effectively for monitoring water stress and irrigation scheduling in sugarcane fields using satellite imagery without any need for ground ancillary data.

TI  - Prediction of aboveground grassland biomass on the Loess Plateau, China, using a random forest algorithm
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are an important component of terrestrial ecosystems that play a crucial role in the carbon cycle and climate change. In this study, we collected aboveground biomass (AGB) data from 223 grassland quadrats distributed across the Loess Plateau from 2011 to 2013 and predicted the spatial distribution of the grassland AGB at a 100-m resolution from both meteorological station and remote sensing data (TM and MODIS) using a Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The results showed that the predicted grassland AGB on the Loess Plateau decreased from east to west. Vegetation indexes were positively correlated with grassland AGB, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) acquired from TM data was the most important predictive factor. Tussock and shrub tussock had the highest AGB, and desert steppe had the lowest. Rainfall higher than 400 m might have benefitted the grassland AGB. Compared with those obtained for the bagging, mboost and the support vector machine (SVM) models, higher values for the mean Pearson coefficient (R) and the symmetric index of agreement (lambda) were obtained for the RF model, indicating that this RF model could reasonably estimate the grassland AGB (65.01%) on the Loess Plateau.

TI  - Assessment of SPOT-6 optical remote sensing data against GF-1 using NNDiffuse image fusion algorithm
T2  - MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B
M3  - Article
AB  - A cross-comparison method was used to assess the SPOT-6 optical satellite imagery against Chinese GF-1 imagery using three types of indicators: spectral and color quality, fusion effect and identification potential. More specifically, spectral response function (SRF) curves were used to compare the two imagery, showing that the SRF curve shape of SPOT-6 is more like a rectangle compared to GF-1 in blue, green, red and near-infrared bands. NNDiffuse image fusion algorithm was used to evaluate the capability of information conservation in comparison with wavelet transform (WT) and principal component (PC) algorithms. The results show that NNDiffuse fused image has extremely similar entropy vales than original image (1.849 versus 1.852) and better color quality. In addition, the object-oriented classification tool set (ENVIEX) was used to identify greenlands for comparing the effect of self-fusion image of SPOT-6 and inter-fusion image between SPOT-6 and GF-1 based on the NNDiffuse algorithm. The over all accuracy is 97.27% and 76.88%, respectively, showing that self-fused image of SPOT-6 has better identification capability.

TI  - The future of Earth observation in hydrology
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In just the past 5 years, the field of Earth observation has progressed beyond the offerings of conventional space-agency-based platforms to include a plethora of sensing opportunities afforded by CubeSats, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and smartphone technologies that are being embraced by both for-profit companies and individual researchers. Over the previous decades, space agency efforts have brought forth well-known and immensely useful satellites such as the Landsat series and the Gravity Research and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system, with costs typically of the order of 1 billion dollars per satellite and with concept-to-launch timelines of the order of 2 decades (for new missions). More recently, the proliferation of smart-phones has helped to miniaturize sensors and energy requirements, facilitating advances in the use of CubeSats that can be launched by the dozens, while providing ultra-high (3-5 m) resolution sensing of the Earth on a daily basis. Start-up companies that did not exist a decade ago now operate more satellites in orbit than any space agency, and at costs that are a mere fraction of traditional satellite missions. With these advances come new space-borne measurements, such as real-time high-definition video for tracking air pollution, storm-cell development, flood propagation, precipitation monitoring, or even for constructing digital surfaces using structure-from-motion techniques. Closer to the surface, measurements from small unmanned drones and tethered balloons have mapped snow depths, floods, and estimated evaporation at sub-metre resolutions, pushing back on spatio-temporal constraints and delivering new process insights. At ground level, precipitation has been measured using signal attenuation between antennae mounted on cell phone towers, while the proliferation of mobile devices has enabled citizen scientists to catalogue photos of environmental conditions, estimate daily average temperatures from battery state, and sense other hydrologically important variables such as channel depths using commercially available wireless devices. Global internet access is being pursued via high-altitude balloons, solar planes, and hundreds of planned satellite launches, providing a means to exploit the "internet of things" as an entirely new measurement domain. Such global access will enable real-time collection of data from billions of smartphones or from remote research platforms. This future will produce petabytes of data that can only be accessed via cloud storage and will require new analytical approaches to interpret. The extent to which today's hydrologic models can usefully ingest such massive data volumes is unclear. Nor is it clear whether this deluge of data will be usefully exploited, either because the measurements are superfluous, inconsistent, not accurate enough, or simply because we lack the capacity to process and analyse them. What is apparent is that the tools and techniques afforded by this array of novel and game-changing sensing platforms present our community with a unique opportunity to develop new insights that advance fundamental aspects of the hydrological sciences. To accomplish this will require more than just an application of the technology: in some cases, it will demand a radical rethink on how we utilize and exploit these new observing systems.

TI  - Entrainment rate diurnal cycle in marine stratiform clouds estimated from geostationary satellite retrievals and a meteorological forecast model
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The mean diurnal cycle of cloud entrainment rate (we) over the northeast Pacific region is for the first time computed by combining, in a mixed-layer model framework, the hourly composited GOES-15 satellite-based cloud top height (H-T) tendency, advection, and large-scale vertical velocity (w) during May to September 2013, with horizontal winds and w taken from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model. The tendency term dominates the magnitude and phase of the we diurnal cycle, with a secondary role of w, and a modest advective contribution. The peak and minimum in we occur between 20:00-22:00 LT and 9:00-11:00 LT, respectively, in close agreement with the diurnal cycle of turbulence driven by cloud top longwave cooling. Uncertainties in HT and ECMWF fields are assessed with in situ observations and three meteorological reanalysis data sets. This study provides the basis for constructing nearly global climatologies of we by combining a suite of well-calibrated geostationary satellites.

TI  - Application of Landsat-8 and ALOS-2 data for structural and landslide hazard mapping in Kelantan, Malaysia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of high potential risk and susceptible zones for natural hazards of geological origin is one of the most important applications of advanced remote sensing technology. Yearly, several landslides occur during heavy monsoon rainfall in Kelantan River basin, Peninsular Malaysia. Flooding and subsequent landslide occurrences generated significant damage to livestock, agricultural produce, homes and businesses in the Kelantan River basin. In this study, remote sensing data from the recently launched Landsat-8 and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) on board the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) were used to map geologic structural and topographical features in the Kelantan River basin for identification of high potential risk and susceptible zones for landslides and flooding areas. The data were processed for a comprehensive analysis of major geological structures and detailed characterizations of lineaments, drainage patterns and lithology at both regional and district scales. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach was used for landslide susceptibility mapping. Several factors such as slope, aspect, soil, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land cover, distance to drainage, precipitation, distance to fault and distance to the road were extracted from remote sensing satellite data and fieldwork to apply the AHP approach. Directional convolution filters were applied to ALOS-2 data for identifying linear features in particular directions and edge enhancement in the spatial domain. Results indicate that lineament occurrence at regional scale was mainly linked to the N-S trending of the Bentong-Raub Suture Zone (BRSZ) in the west and Lebir Fault Zone in the east of the Kelantan state. The combination of different polarization channels produced image maps that contain important information related to water bodies, wetlands and lithological units. The N-S, NE-SW and NNE-SSW lineament trends and dendritic, sub-dendritic and rectangular drainage patterns were detected in the Kelantan River basin. The analysis of field investigation data indicates that many of flooded areas were associated with high potential risk zones for hydrogeological hazards such as wetlands, urban areas, floodplain scroll, meander bend, dendritic and sub-dendritic drainage patterns, which are located in flat topographic regions. Numerous landslide points were located in a rectangular drainage system that is associated with a topographic slope of metamorphic and quaternary rock units. Consequently, structural and topographical geology maps were produced for Kelantan River basin using PALSAR-2 data, which could be broadly applicable for landslide hazard mapping and identification of high potential risk zone for hydrogeological hazards. Geohazard mitigation programs could be conducted in the landslide recurrence regions and flooded areas to reduce natural catastrophes leading to loss of life and financial investments in the Kelantan River basin. In this investigation, Landsat-8 and ALOS-2 have proven to successfully provide advanced Earth observation satellite data for disaster monitoring in tropical environments.

TI  - Passive remote sensing of altitude and optical depth of dust plumes using the oxygen A and B bands: First results from EPIC/DSCOVR at Lagrange-1 point
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We presented an algorithm for inferring aerosol layer height (ALH) and optical depth (AOD) over ocean surface from radiances in oxygen A and B bands measured by the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) on the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) orbiting at Lagrangian-1 point. The algorithm was applied to EPIC imagery of a 2 day dust outbreak over the North Atlantic Ocean. Retrieved ALHs and AODs were evaluated against counterparts observed by Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and Aerosol Robotic Network. The comparisons showed 71.5% of EPIC-retrieved ALHs were within +/- 0.5 km of those determined from CALIOP and 74.4% of EPIC AOD retrievals fell within a +/- (0.1 + 10%) envelope of MODIS retrievals. This study demonstrates the potential of EPIC measurements for retrieving global aerosol height multiple times daily, which are essential for evaluating aerosol profile simulated in climate models and for better estimating aerosol radiative effects.Plain Language Summary DSCOVR is a satellite parked at Lagrange-1 point, similar to 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. It was launched in February 2015 and started the data collection in June 2015. It carries a sensor called EPIC that looks at the sunlit surface every 1 to 2 h. This paper presents a new technique to retrieve dust optical depth and dust altitude from EPIC's measurements within and outside of oxygen A and B absorption bands. The results are validated with MODIS and CALIOP data. The technique represents, for the first time, that we can reliably retrieve dust plume height from passive remote sensing multiple times a day.

TI  - Probabilistic global maps of the CO<sub>2</sub> column at daily and monthly scales from sparse satellite measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The column-average dry air-mole fraction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (XCO2) is measured by scattered satellite measurements like those from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2). We show that global continuous maps of XCO2 (corresponding to level 3 of the satellite data) at daily or coarser temporal resolution can be inferred from these data with a Kalman filter built on a model of persistence. Our application of this approach on 2 years of OCO-2 retrievals indicates that the filter provides better information than a climatology of XCO2 at both daily and monthly scales. Provided that the assigned observation uncertainty statistics are tuned in each grid cell of the XCO2 maps from an objective method (based on consistency diagnostics), the errors predicted by the filter at daily and monthly scales represent the true error statistics reasonably well, except for a bias in the high latitudes of the winter hemisphere and a lack of resolution (i.e., a too small discrimination skill) of the predicted error standard deviations. Due to the sparse satellite sampling, the broad-scale patterns of XCO2 described by the filter seem to lag behind the real signals by a few weeks. Finally, the filter offers interesting insights into the quality of the retrievals, both in terms of random and systematic errors.

TI  - Variability, trends, and drivers of regional fluctuations in Australian fire activity
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout the world fire regimes are determined by climate, vegetation, and anthropogenic factors, and they have great spatial and temporal variability. The availability of high-quality satellite data has revolutionized fire monitoring, allowing for a more consistent and comprehensive evaluation of temporal and spatial patterns. Here we utilize a satellite based "active fire" (AF) product to statistically analyze 2001-2015 variability and trends in Australian fire activity and link this to precipitation and large-scale atmospheric structures (namely, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)) known to have potential for predicting fire activity in different regions. It is found that Australian fire activity is decreasing (during summer (December-February)) or stable, with high temporal and spatial variability. Eastern New South Wales (NSW) has the strongest decreasing trend (to the 1% confidence level), especially during the winter (JJA) season. Other significantly decreasing areas are Victoria/NSW, Tasmania, and South-east Queensland. These decreasing fire regions are relatively highly populated, so we suggest that the declining trends are due to improved fire management, reducing the size and duration of bush fires. Almost half of all Australian AFs occur during spring (September-November). We show that there is considerable potential throughout Australia for a skillful forecast for future season fire activity based on current and previous precipitation activity, ENSO phase, and to a lesser degree, the IOD phase. This is highly variable, depending on location, e.g., the IOD phase is for more indicative of fire activity in southwest Western Australia than for Queensland.

AB  - Objective To investigate the water infectivity in key water regions, and analyze the transmission risk of schistosomiasis in suspicious and high-risk environments in Hubei Province in 2016. Methods Schistosome-endemic areas of the Yangtze River, the Hanbei River and the Fu River were chosen as the surveillance and forecast sites. The water infectivity was detected by using the sentinel mice during the flood season. The infection status of residents in the villages around the surveillance sites and the activities of human beings and domestic animals were surveyed. The emergency response system was initiated when the water infectivity areas were detected. Results From May to June, among the ten surveillance sites of the first batch, two positive spots with infected mice were found, accounting for 20%. All the recovered mice (totally 200) were dissected: five mice were infected, with a total infection rate of 2.5%. Totally five schistosome adult worms were collected, with mean worm burden of 1 worm per infected mouse. The site with cercariae-infected water body started the emergency response and no epidemic occurred. From August to September, among the eight surveillance sites of the second batch, the recovered mice (totally 160) were dissected, and no infected sentinel mice were found. Conclusion The sentinel mice method plays an important role in analyzing the schistosomiasis transmission risk in Hubei Province.

TI  - An efficient radiative transfer model for hyperspectral IR radiance simulation and applications under cloudysky conditions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - An efficient radiative transfer model has been developed for hyperspectral infrared radiance simulation under both clear-and cloudy-sky conditions. The hyperspectral IR cloudy radiative transfer model (HIRTM) combines atmospheric transmittances due to molecular absorption and cloud absorption and scattering from cloud hydrometeors. An efficient analytical Jacobian methodology is also developed under both clear-and cloudy-sky conditions, which is needed both to assimilate cloudy radiances directly into numerical weather prediction models and to retrieve atmospheric soundings and cloud properties simultaneously from cloudy radiance measurements. In comparing HIRTM and its analytical Jacobian with the community radiative transfer model (CRTM), our research has shown that HIRTM's Jacobian calculations are similar to those of CRTM. HIRTM and CRTM synthetic observations derived from model output are compared with corresponding real observations from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 13 Imager observations, and both perform similarly under water clouds, while CRTM is colder than HIRTM for thick ice clouds.

TI  - Validation of high-resolution MAIAC aerosol product over South America
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) is a new Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) algorithm that combines time series approach and image processing to derive surface reflectance and atmosphere products, such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and columnar water vapor (CWV). The quality assessment of MAIAC AOD at 1 km resolution is still lacking across South America. In the present study, critical assessment of MAIAC AOD550 was performed using ground-truth data from 19 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites over South America. Additionally, we validated the MAIAC CWV retrievals using the same AERONET sites. In general, MAIAC AOD Terra/Aqua retrievals show high agreement with ground-based measurements, with a correlation coefficient (R) close to unity (R-Terra: 0.956 and R-Aqua: 0.949). MAIAC accuracy depends on the surface properties and comparisons revealed high confidence retrievals over cropland, forest, savanna, and grassland covers, where more than 2/3 (similar to 66%) of retrievals are within the expected error (EE = +/-(0.05 + 0.05 x AOD)) and R exceeding 0.86. However, AOD retrievals over bright surfaces show lower correlation than those over vegetated areas. Both MAIAC Terra and Aqua retrievals are similarly comparable to AERONET AOD over the MODIS lifetime (small bias offset similar to 0.006). Additionally, MAIAC CWV presents quantitative information with R similar to 0.97 and more than 70% of retrievals within error (+/- 15%). Nonetheless, the time series validation shows an upward bias trend in CWV Terra retrievals and systematic negative bias for CWV Aqua. These results contribute to a comprehensive evaluation of MAIAC AOD retrievals as a new atmospheric product for future aerosol studies over South America.

TI  - High-Resolution Digital Elevation Modeling from TLS and UAV Campaign Reveals Structural Complexity at the 2014/2015 Holuhraun Eruption Site, Iceland
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fissure eruptions are commonly linked to magma dikes at depth and are associated with elastic and inelastic surface deformation. Elastic deformation is well described by subsidence occurring above the dike plane and uplift and lateral widening occurring perpendicular to the dike plane. Inelastic deformation is associated with the formation of a graben, which is bordered by graben parallel faults that might express as sets of fractures at the surface. Additionally, secondary structures, such as push-ups, bends and step overs, yield information about the deforming domain. However, once these structures are formed during fissure eruptions, they are rarely preserved in nature, due to the effects of rapid erosion, sediment coverage or overprinting by other faulting events. Therefore, simple normal fault displacements are commonly assumed at dikes. At the 2014/2015 Holuhraun eruption sites (Iceland), increasing evidence suggests that developing fractures exhibited variations in their displacement modes. In an attempt to investigate these variations, a fieldwork mapping project combining Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based aerophoto analysis was undertaken. Using these data, we generated local high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and a structural map that facilitated the identification of kinematic indicators and the assessment of the observed structures. We identified 315 fracture segments from these satellite data. We measured the strike directions of single segments, including the amount of opening and opening angles, which indicate that many of the measured fractures show transtensional dislocations. Of these, similar to 81% exhibit a significant left-lateral component and only similar to 17% exhibit a right-lateral component. Here, we demonstrate that the local complexities in these fracture traces and geometries are closely related to variations in their transtensional opening directions. Moreover, we identified local changes in fracture azimuths and offsets close to eruption sites, which we speculate are associated with geometric changes in the magma feeder itself. The results highlight that the opening of fractures associated with an erupting fissure may record transtensional modes with both, left-lateral and right-lateral components. These results further highlight the value of using UAV-based high-resolution data to contribute to the integrity of the observations of the structural complexities produced by local geologic events.

Patients swabbed within 7 days after onset of symptoms compatible with severe acute respiratory infection were included. Information on demographics, vaccination and underlying conditions was collected. Using logistic regression, we measured IVE adjusted for potential confounders. We included 355 influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 cases, 110 influenza B cases, and 1,274 controls. Adjusted IVE against influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 was 42% (95% confidence interval (CI): 22 to 57). It was 59% (95% CI: 23 to 78), 48% (95% CI: 5 to 71), 43% (95% CI: 8 to 65) and 39% (95% CI: 7 to 60) in patients with diabetes mellitus, cancer, lung and heart disease, respectively. Adjusted IVE against influenza B was 52% (95% CI: 24 to 70). It was 62% (95% CI: 5 to 85), 60% (95% CI: 18 to 80) and 36% (95% CI: -23 to 67) in patients with diabetes

TI  - Winter-to-summer transition of Arctic sea ice breakup and floe size distribution in the Beaufort Sea
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Breakup of the near-continuous winter sea ice into discrete summer ice floes is an important transition that dictates the evolution and fate of the marginal ice zone (MIZ) of the Arctic Ocean. During the winter of 2014, more than 50 autonomous drifting buoys were deployed in four separate clusters on the sea ice in the Beaufort Sea, as part of the Office of Naval Research MIZ program. These systems measured the ocean-ice-atmosphere properties at their location whilst the sea ice parameters in the surrounding area of these buoy clusters were continuously monitored by satellite TerraSAR-X Synthetic Aperture Radar. This approach provided a unique Lagrangian view of the winter-to-summer transition of sea ice breakup and floe size distribution at each cluster between March and August. The results show the critical timings of a) temporary breakup of winter sea ice coinciding with strong wind events and b) spring breakup (during surface melt, melt ponding and drainage) leading to distinctive summer ice floes. Importantly our results suggest that summer sea ice floe distribution is potentially affected by the state of winter sea ice, including the composition and fracturing (caused by deformation events) of winter sea ice, and that substantial mid-summer breakup of sea ice floes is likely linked to the timing of thermodynamic melt of sea ice in the area. As the rate of deformation and thermodynamic melt of sea ice has been increasing in the MIZ in the Beaufort Sea, our results suggest that these elevated factors would promote faster and more enhanced breakup of sea ice, leading to a higher melt rate of sea ice and thus a more rapid advance of the summer MIZ.

TI  - Verrucous-Keratotic Malignant Melanoma (VKMM).
T2  - Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We report a patient with a verrucous keratotic variant of melanoma visiting the policlinic of Medical Institute of Ministry of Interior (MVR-Sofia), Department of Dermatology and Dermatologic surgery, with a keratotic verrucous lesion, located on the right thigh, partially deeply pigmented at upper right quadrant. The lesion had appeared three years ago before her presentation in the policlinic, and it had gradually enlarged and become darker in the last twelve months. The surface of the lesion was covered with thick hyperkeratotic lobules. The histologic evaluation revealed verrucous melanoma with a tumour thickness of 3 mm and Clark Level IV and focal ulceration. The tumour was staged as stage IIB (T3bN0M0). Sentinel lymph node biopsy was planned. Verrucous-keratotic forms of malignant melanoma occur more commonly in women and favour the extremities, but may be found on any anatomic site. Seventy-one percent of this melanoma type are situated on the upper and lower extremities. Although two-thirds of these neoplasms can be can be histologically graded according to the classification of Clark, one-third of these melanomas with marked verrucous hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis of the epidermis do not fit into his classification. Histological classification of patients with a verrucous keratotic type of melanoma may sometimes be extremely difficult. The marked papilliferous architecture of these lesions made an assessment of Breslow depth difficult. The presented case highlights the clinical existence and features of such benign-looking melanomas. It is therefore important for surgical pathologists to recognise this unusual variant of malignant melanoma, as it may be confused both clinically and pathologically with benign lesions.

TI  - Validation of the CrIS fast physical NH<sub>3</sub> retrieval with ground-based FTIR
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Presented here is the validation of the CrIS (Cross-track Infrared Sounder) fast physical NH3 retrieval (CFPR) column and profile measurements using ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) observations. We use the total columns and profiles from seven FTIR sites in the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) to validate the satellite data products. The overall FTIR and CrIS total columns have a positive correlation of r = 0.77 (N = 218) with very little bias (a slope of 1.02). Binning the comparisons by total column amounts, for concentrations larger than 1.0 x 10(16) molecules cm(-2), i.e. ranging from moderate to polluted conditions, the relative difference is on average similar to 0-5% with a standard deviation of 25-50 %, which is comparable to the estimated retrieval uncertainties in both CrIS and the FTIR. For the smallest total column range (< 1.0x x 10(16) molecules cm(-2)) where there are a large number of observations at or near the CrIS noise level (detection limit) the absolute differences between CrIS and the FTIR total columns show a slight positive column bias. The CrIS and FTIR profile comparison differences are mostly within the range of the single-level retrieved profile values from estimated retrieval uncertainties, showing average differences in the range of similar to 20 to 40 %. The CrIS retrievals typically show good vertical sensitivity down into the boundary layer which typically peaks at similar to 850 hPa (similar to 1.5 km). At this level the median absolute difference is 0.87 (std = +/- 0.08) ppb, corresponding to a median relative difference of 39%(std = +/- 2 %). Most of the absolute and relative profile comparison differences are in the range of the estimated retrieval uncertainties. At the surface, where CrIS typically has lower sensitivity, it tends to overestimate in low-concentration conditions and underestimate in higher atmospheric concentration conditions.

TI  - Classification of remote sensed data using hybrid method based on ant colony optimization with electromagnetic metaheuristic
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a hybrid configuration of electromagnetic metaheuristic algorithm (EM) with Pachycondyla apicalis (API) ant algorithm (inspired by the behaviour of real ant colony Pachycondyla apicalis) belonging to ant colony optimization (ACO) called EMAPI algorithm is presented for remote sensing data classification. The traditional per-pixel classification method identifies the classes using spectral variance and ignores the spatial distribution of pixels. It requires training data to be normally distributed in the pixels corresponding to land use/land cover classes and creates a lot of confusion between classes within a remote sensed (RS) data. The proposed algorithm is an integrated strategy structure to achieve advantages of global and local search ability of EM and API algorithms respectively. The objective consists of improving overall accuracy of the classified results of RS data. This method can overcome intermixing with regard to scrub land with cultivated areas and build-up land with palm groves. The proposed algorithm is tested on objective functions well used in the literature and EMAPI is used for supervised land cover classification. Results of EMAPI algorithm over 6 classes showed an improvement of 8% in overall classification accuracy (OCA) for EM technique and improvement of 3% in OCA for API algorithm.

TI  - Uncertainty information in climate data records from Earth observation
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Review
AB  - The question of how to derive and present uncertainty information in climate data records (CDRs) has received sustained attention within the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (CCI), a programme to generate CDRs addressing a range of essential climate variables (ECVs) from satellite data. Here, we review the nature, mathematics, practicalities, and communication of uncertainty information in CDRs from Earth observations. This review paper argues that CDRs derived from satellite-based Earth observation (EO) should include rigorous uncertainty information to support the application of the data in contexts such as policy, climate modelling, and numerical weather prediction reanalysis. Uncertainty, error, and quality are distinct concepts, and the case is made that CDR products should follow international metrological norms for presenting quantified uncertainty. As a baseline for good practice, total standard uncertainty should be quantified per datum in a CDR, meaning that uncertainty estimates should clearly discriminate more and less certain data. In this case, flags for data quality should not duplicate uncertainty information, but instead describe complementary information (such as the confidence in the uncertainty estimate provided or indicators of conditions violating the retrieval assumptions). The paper discusses the many sources of error in CDRs, noting that different errors may be correlated across a wide range of timescales and space scales. Error effects that contribute negligibly to the total uncertainty in a single-satellite measurement can be the dominant sources of uncertainty in a CDR on the large space scales and long timescales that are highly relevant for some climate applications. For this reason, identifying and characterizing the relevant sources of uncertainty for CDRs is particularly challenging. The characterization of uncertainty caused by a given error effect involves assessing the magnitude of the effect, the shape of the error distribution, and the propagation of the uncertainty to the geophysical variable in the CDR accounting for its error correlation properties. Uncertainty estimates can and should be validated as part of CDR validation when possible. These principles are quite general, but the approach to providing uncertainty information appropriate to different ECVs is varied, as confirmed by a brief review across different ECVs in the CCI. User requirements for uncertainty information can conflict with each other, and a variety of solutions and compromises are possible. The concept of an ensemble CDR as a simple means of communicating rigorous uncertainty information to users is discussed. Our review concludes by providing eight concrete recommendations for good practice in providing and communicating uncertainty in EO-based climate data records.

TI  - A comprehensive data set of lake surface water temperature over the Tibetan Plateau derived from MODIS LST products 2001-2015
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is sensitive to long-term changes in thermal structure of lakes and regional air temperature. In the context of global climate change, recent studies showed a significant warming trend of LSWT based on investigating 291 lakes (71% are large lakes, >= 50 km(2) each) globally. However, further efforts are needed to examine variation in LSWT at finer regional spatial and temporal scales. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the Roof of the World' and ` Asia's water towers', exerts large influences on and is sensitive to regional and even global climates. Aiming to examine detailed changing patterns and potential driven mechanisms for temperature variations of lakes across the TP region, this paper presents the first comprehensive data set of 15-year (2001-2015) nighttime and daytime LSWT for 374 lakes (>= 10 km2 each), using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Land Surface Temperature (LST) products as well as four lake boundary shapefiles (i.e., 2002, 2005, 2009, and 2014) derived from Landsat/CBERS/GaoFen-1 satellite images. The data set itself reveals significant information on LSWT and its changes over the TP and is an indispensable variable for numerous applications related to climate change, water budget analysis (particularly lake evaporation), water storage changes, glacier melting and permafrost degradation, etc.

TI  - Detecting spatio-temporal and typological changes in land use from Landsat image time series
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of earth observation technology, the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing images have improved dramatically, providing abundant data for detecting land use change in detail. However, extracting spatio-temporal and typological changes in land use from remote sensing image time series is still challenging. Landsat image time series and land survey data are combined to develop a method to detect in detail the time and types of land use change. From the Landsat images, the time series of normalized difference vegetation index variation slope (TSNVS) on each pixel was constructed. The average TSNVS of sample pixels was used as the reference series. Based on TSNVS, the change in land use at six time points (S1 to S6) was detected by measuring the similarity of the time series on undetermined pixels and reference series. Land survey data were used to identify detailed types of land use change. The 16 different types of land use change were identified. The results indicate that the proposed method is effective at detecting spatio-temporal and typological changes in land use from Landsat image time series. After verification, the overall accuracy was 92%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.9. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

T2  - DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
M3  - Review
AB  - From 2003 to 2015, 360 free-ranging Atlantic bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon (IRL, n = 246), Florida, and coastal waters of Charleston (CHS, n = 114), South Carolina, USA, were captured, given comprehensive health examinations, and released as part of a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional study of individual and population health. The aim of this review is to summarize the substantial health data generated by this study and to examine morbidity between capture sites and over time. The IRL and CHS dolphin populations are affected by complex infectious and neoplastic diseases often associated with immunologic disturbances. We found evidence of infection with cetacean morbillivirus, dolphin papilloma and herpes viruses, Chlamydiaceae, a novel uncultivated strain of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (recently identified as the causal agent of dolphin lobomycosis/lacaziasis), and other pathogens. This is the first long-term study documenting the various types, progression, seroprevalence, and pathologic interrelationships of infectious diseases in dolphins from the southeastern USA. Additionally, the study has demonstrated that the bottlenose dolphin is a valuable sentinel animal that may reflect environmental health concerns and parallel emerging public health issues.

TI  - An integrated ecohydrological modeling approach to exploring the dynamic interaction between groundwater and phreatophytes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phreatophytes play an important role in maintaining the ecological services in arid and semi-arid areas. Characterizing the interaction between groundwater and phreatophytes is critical for the land and water management in such areas but has rarely been attempted via integrated ecohydrological modeling. In this study, a plant growth model was developed and coupled with a soil water dynamics model (Hydrus-1D) to explore the groundwater dependence of Populus euphratica, a rare, ancient and endangered phreatophytic species. The integrated ecohydroloigcal model was validated with observational data collected from the Heihe River Basin (northwest China). The groundwater dependence was also investigated at larger scales using remote sensing data and regional hydrological modeling. The major study findings include the following: (1) the ecohydrological behaviors and groundwater dependence of P. euphratica can be well explained by the existing theories; (2) groundwater is the dominant water source for P. euphratica during its growing season, and groundwater subsidy can be an intuitive measure of the water-shortage risk for P. euphratica, which is conditioned on root depth, the water-holding capacity of the soil, and groundwater depth; and (3) at large spatial and temporal scales, the impact of groundwater depth on P. euphratica growth is also discernable. A groundwater depth of 1-3.5 m appears to be the optimal depth range for P. euphratica growth in the study area. Overall, this study demonstrates how multi-source and multi-scale data can be effectively fused through an integrated modeling approach to generate a coherent understanding of the ecohydrological processes of phreatophytes.

TI  - Monitoring protected areas from space: A multi-temporal assessment using raptors as biodiversity surrogates
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring protected areas (PAs) is essential for systematic evaluation of their effectiveness in terms of habitat protection, preservation and representativeness. This study illustrates how the use of species distribution models that combine remote sensing data and information about biodiversity surrogates can contribute to develop a systematic protocol for monitoring PAs. In particular, we assessed the effectiveness of the Natura 2000 (N2000) network, for conserving and preserving the representativeness of seven raptor species in a highly-dynamic landscape in northwest Spain between 2001 and 2014. We also evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the N2000 network by using the total area under protection as a proxy for conservation costs. Overall, the N2000 network was found to poorly represent the habitats of the raptor species. Despite the low representativeness, this network showed a high degree of effectiveness due to increased overall habitat availability for generalist and forest specialist species between 2001 and 2014. Nevertheless, additional protected areas should be established in the near future to increase their representativeness, and thus ensure the protection of open-habitat specialist species and their priority habitats. In addition, proactive conservation measures in natural and semi-natural ecosystems (in particular, montane heathlands) will be essential for long-term protection of Montagu's harrier (species listed in the Annex I of the Bird Directive), and thus complying with the current European Environmental Legislation. This study sheds light on how the development and application of new protected area indices based on the combined use of freely-available satellite data and species distribution models may contribute substantially to the cost-efficiency of the PA monitoring systems, and to the 'Fitness Check' process of EU Nature Directives.

TI  - Spatial and simultaneous representative seroprevalence of anti-<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> antibodies in owners and their domiciled dogs in a major city of southern Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Toxoplasmosis, caused by Toxoplasma gondii, has traditionally been considered an important water and foodborne protozoonosis with important public health considerations. Although felids play a well-established role as definitive hosts, canine epidemiological involvement in the parasite's life cycle remains questionable and controversial. The increasing closeness of the human-dog bond, particularly seen in urban settings, has been recognized as a historically unprecedented worldwide movement. Sharing daily lives in the same households, dogs may be exposed to similar associated risks of T. gondii infection as their owners. Thus, epidemiological assessment of the intra-domiciled environment, especially among socio-economically different human populations, may provide novel information regarding the actual role of dogs in animal and human toxoplasmosis. Despite spatial approaches being recently used for other water and foodborne diseases, no study has been conducted on the simultaneous spatial seroprevalence of both human and animal IgG antiT. gondii antibodies in urban areas of major cities. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to assess the seroprevalence and associated variables of Toxoplasma infection in owners and their domiciled dogs in Londrina, southern Brazil. Human and canine seroprevalence rates and variables associated with seroprevalence were investigated through representative random sampling among 564 households, which included 597 owners and 729 dogs. Overall, statistically significant differences between the seroprevalence of human and dog anti-T. gondii antibodies were found by Immunofluorescence Antibody Testing in 248/597 (41.54%) owners and 119/729 (16.32%) dogs. Through multiple analysis, significant concomitant variables for seropositivity of household individuals (people and dogs) were determined, including public sewer service, yard cleaning frequency, and having a dirty yard. Although no statistically significant multiple logistic model was observed among owners, univariate analysis detected associations with monthly income, soil contact, and occupation. Among dogs, the absence of other dogs and the absence of a dirty yard were concomitant significantly protective associated factors. Age differences between seropositive and seronegative individuals was significant only for human beings, with the median age of negative individuals significantly higher than positive individuals. Although no spatial clusters were identified for humans or residences, a significant cluster was identified for dogs. In conclusion, characteristics of urban toxoplasmosis may include significantly higher owner seroprevalence than their owned dogs, with canine seroprevalence directly associated with having more dogs and a dirty backyard, and spatial differences in both human and dog exposures. Although not a good indicator for human foodborne diseases, dogs may be a reliable sentinel for environmental infection. Moreover, such a holistic approach may provide crucial information for more focused prevention and monitoring programs, particularly in households with multiple pets and trash-filled backyards.

TI  - Assessment of geostatistical features for object-based image classification of contrasted landscape vegetation cover
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping and monitoring of savanna and semiarid woodland biomes are needed to support the selection of areas of conservation, to provide sustainable land use, and to improve the understanding of vegetation. The potential of geostatistical features, derived from medium spatial resolution satellite imagery, to characterize contrasted landscape vegetation cover and improve object-based image classification is studied. The study site in Brazil includes cerrado sensu stricto, deciduous forest, and palm swamp vegetation cover. Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images were acquired and divided into objects, for each of which a semivariogram was calculated using near-infrared (NIR) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to extract the set of geostatistical features. The features selected by principal component analysis were used as input data to train a random forest algorithm. Tests were conducted, combining spectral and geostatistical features. Change detection evaluation was performed using a confusion matrix and its accuracies. The semivariogram curves were efficient to characterize spatial heterogeneity, with similar results using NIR and NDVI from Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8. Accuracy was significantly greater when combining geostatistical features with spectral data, suggesting that this method can improve image classification results.

AB  - Herein a small sensor array (or artificial tongue) generated by three sensing elements (Eu0.5Tb9.5(HFA) (n)@ ZY, Eu1Tb9(HFA)(n)@ ZY, Eu2Tb8(HFA) (n)@ ZY, HFA: hexafluoroacetylacetonate) obtained by encapsulating Eu-Tb binuclear complexes within the cavities of zeolite Y (ZY) has been demonstrated, which can accomplish the accurate identification for a group of 13 different amines. For each amine, the sensor array generates a unique response pattern, which can be used as a fingerprint to discriminate the 13 amine molecules. Additionally, this sensor array has the ability to distinguish between the isomers of some amines. Such work offers a new direction for developing sensitive array sensing for multi-analyte systems and isomers.

TI  - New observations indicate the possible presence of permafrost in North Africa (Djebel Toubkal, High Atlas, Morocco)
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Relict and present-day periglacial features have been reported in the literature for the upper reaches of the High Atlas mountains, which is the highest range in North Africa (Djebel Toubkal -4167 m a.s.l.) .A lobate feature in the Irhzer Ikhibi south at 3800 m a.s.l. has been previously interpreted as an active rock glacier, but no measurements of ground or air temperatures are known to exist for the area. In order to assess the possible presence of permafrost, we analyse data from June 2015 to June 2016 from two air temperature measurement sites at 2370 and 3210 m a.s.l. and from four ground surface temperature (GST) sites at 3220, 3815, 3980 and 4160 m a.s.l. to characterize conditions along an altitudinal gradient along the Oued Ihghyghaye valley to the summit of the Djebel Toubkal. GSTs were collected at 1 h intervals, and the presence of snow cover at the monitoring sites was validated using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery. Two field visits allowed for logger installation and collection and for assessing the geomorphological features in the area. The results show that snow plays a major role on the thermal regime of the shallow ground, inducing important spatial variability. The lowest site at 3220m had a thermal regime characterized by frequent freeze-thaw cycles during the cold season but with few days of snow. When snow settled, the ground surface remained isothermal at 0 degrees C, indicating the absence of permafrost. The highest sites at 3980 and 4160 m a.s.l. showed very frequent freeze-thaw cycles and a small influence of the snow cover on GST, reflecting the lack of snow accumulation due to the wind-exposed settings on a ridge and on the summit plateau. The site located at 3815m in the Irhzer Ikhibi south valley had a cold, stable thermal regime with GST varying from -4.5 to 6 degrees C from December to March, under a continuous snow cover. The site's location in a concave setting favours wind-driven snow accumulation and lower incoming solar radiation due to the shading effect of a ridge, inducing the conservation of a thick snow pack. The stable and low GSTs are interpreted as a strong indicator of the probable presence of permafrost at this site, which is an interpretation supported by the presence of lobate and arcuate features in the talus deposits. We present first results and further observations using geophysics, and borehole measurements are foreseen. This is the first time that probable permafrost has been reported from temperature observations in the mountains of North Africa.

TI  - Organic molecular tracers in the atmospheric aerosols from Lumbini, Nepal, in the northern Indo-Gangetic Plain: influence of biomass burning
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand the characteristics of biomass burning in the northern Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), total suspended particles were collected in a rural site, Lumbini, Nepal, during April 2013 to March 2014 and analyzed for the biomass burning tracers (i.e., levoglucosan, mannosan, vanillic acid). The annual average concentration of levoglucosan was 734 +/- 1043 ng m(-3) with the maximum seasonal mean concentration during post-monsoon season (2206 +/- 1753 ng m(-3)), followed by winter (1161 +/- 1347 ng m(3)), pre-monsoon (771 +/- 524 ng m(-3)) and minimum concentration during monsoon season (212 +/- 279 ng m(-3)). The other biomass burning tracers (mannosan, galactosan, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid and dehydroabietic acid) also showed the similar seasonal variations. There were good correlations among levoglucosan, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), indicating significant impact of biomass burning activities on carbonaceous aerosol loading throughout the year in Lumbini area. According to the characteristic ratios, levoglucosan / mannosan (lev / man) and syringic acid / vanillic acid (syr / van), we deduced that the high abundances of biomass burning products during nonmonsoon seasons were mainly caused by the burning of crop residues and hardwood while the softwood had less contribution. Based on the diagnostic tracer ratio (i.e., lev / OC), the OC derived from biomass burning constituted large fraction of total OC, especially during post-monsoon season. By analyzing the MODIS fire spot product and 5-day airmass back trajectories, we further demonstrated that organic aerosol composition was not only related to the local agricultural activities and residential biomass usage but also impacted by the regional emissions. During the post-monsoon season, the emissions from rice residue burning in western India and eastern Pakistan could impact particulate air pollution in Lumbini and surrounding regions in southern Nepal. Therefore, our finding is meaningful and has a great importance for adopting the appropriate mitigation measures, not only at the local level but also by involving different regions and nations, to reduce the biomass burning emissions in the broader IGP region nations.

TI  - A practical algorithm for the retrieval of floe size distribution of Arctic sea ice from high-resolution satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present an algorithm for summer sea ice conditions that semi-automatically produces the floe size distribution of Arctic sea ice from high-resolution satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar data. Currently, floe size distribution data from satellite images are very rare in the literature, mainly due to the lack of a reliable algorithm to produce such data. Here, we developed the algorithm by combining various image analysis methods, including Kernel Graph Cuts, distance transformation and watershed transformation, and a rule-based boundary revalidation. The developed algorithm has been validated against the ground truth that was extracted manually with the aid of 1-m resolution visible satellite data. Comprehensive validation analysis has shown both perspectives and limitations. The algorithm tends to fail to detect small floes (mostly less than 100 m in mean caliper diameter) compared to ground truth, which is mainly due to limitations in water-ice segmentation. Some variability in the power law exponent of floe size distribution is observed due to the effects of control parameters in the process of de-noising, Kernel Graph Cuts segmentation, thresholds for boundary revalidation and image resolution. Nonetheless, the algorithm, for floes larger than 100 m, has shown a reasonable agreement with ground truth under various selections of these control parameters. Considering that the coverage and spatial resolution of satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar data have increased significantly in recent years, the developed algorithm opens a new possibility to produce large volumes of floe size distribution data, which is essential for improving our understanding and prediction of the Arctic sea ice cover.

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of shifting cultivation in the middle-Amazonas river: Expansion and intensification
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifting cultivation is the main land-use system transforming landscapes in riverine Amazonia. Increased concentration of the human population around villages and increasing market integration during the last decades may be causing agricultural intensification. Studies have shown that agricultural intensification, i.e. higher number of swidden-fallow cycles and shorter fallow periods, reduces crop productivity of swiddens and the regrowth capacity of fallows, undermining the resilience of the shifting cultivation system as a whole. We investigated the temporal and spatial dynamics of shifting cultivation in Brazilian Amazonia to test the hypotheses that (i) agriculture has become more intensive over time, and (ii) patterns of land-use intensity are related to land accessibility and human population density. We applied a breakpoint-detection algorithm to Landsat time-series spanning three decades (1984-2015) and retrieved the temporal dynamics of shifting cultivation fields, which go through alternating phases of crop production (swidden) and secondary forest regrowth (fallow). We found that fallow-period length has decreased from 6.4 to 5.1 years on average, and that expansion over old-growth forest has slowed down over time. Shorter fallow periods and higher frequency of slash and burn cycles are practiced closer to residences and around larger villages. Our results indicate that shifting cultivation in riverine Amazonia has gone through a process of agricultural intensification in the past three decades. The resulting landscape is predominantly covered by young secondary forests (<= 12 yrs old), and 20% of it have gone through intensive use. Reversing this trend and avoiding the negative consequences of agricultural intensification requires land use planning that accounts for the constraints of land use in riverine areas.

TI  - Nd-ordering-driven Mn spin reorientation and magnetization reversal in the magnetostructurally coupled compound NdMnO<sub>3</sub>
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW B
M3  - Article
AB  - A detailed neutron diffraction study on NdMnO3 infers that the low temperature transition at 15 K is due to the ordering of Nd sublattice moment with a (0,-F-y, 0) type spin arrangement. Interestingly, the ordering of the Nd sublattice drives a reorientation (by 180 degrees.) of the net ferromagnetic moment of the Mn sublattice along the b axis. Such a Mn spin reorientation from (A(x), F-y, 0) (with an antiferromagnetic ordering temperature of 73 K) to (Ax,-Fy, 0) at 15 K, explains the magnetization reversal phenomenon present in this perovskite compound at 15 K. Moreover at 15 K, significant crystallographic structural distortions in terms of temperature variations of lattice parameters and bond angles are found. A sign change in the temperature variation of magnetic entropy is also found at 15 K. The present study signifies the role of rare-earth (Nd) moment ordering in tuning various physical properties, such as magnetocaloric andmagnetoelastic of the larger size (> 0.912 angstrom) R ion based RMnO3 compounds.

TI  - Invasive Ductal Carcinoma within a Benign Phyllodes Tumor.
T2  - The American journal of case reports
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Phyllodes tumor (PT) is a rare neoplasm of the breast. Concomitant PT with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is an even rarer occurrence. When ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or IDC are detected within the specimen, the management changes from wide local excision to further staging work-up, including sentinel node biopsy and radiation. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 70-year-old presented with right breast mass whose pathology showed benign PT with concomitant IDC and DCIS. The patient elected for a wide excision of the mass with sentinel lymph node biopsy, which did not show any involvement. The patient was started on appropriate therapy. She is currently doing well. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the importance of wide local excision for PT as well as prudent histologic examination to rule out other malignant components, as the presence of IDC distinctly changes management.

TI  - An ecological and digital epidemiology analysis on the role of human behavior on the 2014 Chikungunya outbreak in Martinique
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of endemic infections is of critical importance for a deeper understanding of pathogen transmission, and for the design of more efficient public health strategies. However, very few studies in this domain have focused on emerging infections, generating a gap of knowledge that hampers epidemiological response planning. Here, we analyze the case of a Chikungunya outbreak that occurred in Martinique in 2014. Using time series estimates from a network of sentinel practitioners covering the entire island, we first analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics and show that the largest city has served as the epicenter of this epidemic. We further show that the epidemic spread from there through two different propagation waves moving northwards and southwards, probably by individuals moving along the road network. We then develop a mathematical model to explore the drivers of the temporal dynamics of this mosquito-borne virus. Finally, we show that human behavior, inferred by a textual analysis of messages published on the social network Twitter, is required to explain the epidemiological dynamics over time. Overall, our results suggest that human behavior has been a key component of the outbreak propagation, and we argue that such results can lead to more efficient public health strategies specifically targeting the propagation process.

TI  - A climate-scale satellite record for carbon monoxide: the MOPITT Version 7 product
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The MOPITT (Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere) satellite instrument has been making observations of atmospheric carbon monoxide since 2000. Recent enhancements to the MOPITT retrieval algorithm have resulted in the release of the version 7 (V7) product. Improvements include (1) representation of growing atmospheric concentrations of N2O, (2) use of meteorological fields from the MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications) reanalysis for the entire MOPITT mission (instead of MERRA), (3) use of the MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Collection 6 cloud mask product (instead of Collection 5), (4) a new strategy for radiance-bias correction and (5) an improved method for calibrating MOPITT's near-infrared (NIR) radiances. Statistical comparisons of V7 validation results with corresponding V6 results are presented, using aircraft in situ measurements as the reference. Clear improvements are demonstrated for V7 products with respect to overall retrieval biases, bias variability and bias drift uncertainty.

TI  - Toward Monitoring Surface and Subsurface Lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet Using Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat-8 OLI Imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial lakes are an important component of the Greenland Ice Sheet's mass balance and hydrology, with their drainage affecting ice dynamics. This study uses imagery from the recently launched Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite to investigate supraglacial lakes in West Greenland. A semi-automated algorithm is developed to detect surface lakes from Sentinel-1 images during the 2015 summer. A combined Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 dataset, which has a comparable temporal resolution to MODIS (3 days vs. daily) but a higher spatial resolution (25-40 vs. 250-500 m), is then used together with a fully automated lake drainage detection algorithm. Rapid (< 4 days) and slow (> 4 days) drainages are investigated for both small (< 0.125 km(2), the minimum size detectable by MODIS) and large (>= 0.125 km(2)) lakes through the summer. Drainage events of small lakes occur at lower elevations (mean 159m), and slightly earlier (mean 4.5 days) in the melt season than those of large lakes. The analysis is extended manually into the early winter to calculate the dates and elevations of lake freeze-through more precisely than is possible with optical imagery (mean 30 August; 1,270m mean elevation). Finally, the Sentinel-1 imagery is used to detect subsurface lakes and, for the first time, their dates of appearance and freeze-through (mean 9 August and 7 October, respectively). These subsurface lakes occur at higher elevations than the surface lakes detected in this study (mean 1,593 and 1,185 m, respectively). Sentinel-1 imagery therefore provides great potential for tracking melting, water movement and freezing within both the firn zone and ablation area of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

TI  - Reviews and syntheses: Systematic Earth observations for use in terrestrial carbon cycle data assimilation systems
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The global carbon cycle is an important component of the Earth system and it interacts with the hydrology, energy and nutrient cycles as well as ecosystem dynamics. A better understanding of the global carbon cycle is required for improved projections of climate change including corresponding changes in water and food resources and for the verification of measures to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. An improved understanding of the carbon cycle can be achieved by data assimilation systems, which integrate observations relevant to the carbon cycle into coupled carbon, water, energy and nutrient models. Hence, the ingredients for such systems are a carbon cycle model, an algorithm for the assimilation and systematic and well error-characterised observations relevant to the carbon cycle. Relevant observations for assimilation include various in situ measurements in the atmosphere (e.g. concentrations of CO2 and other gases) and on land (e.g. fluxes of carbon water and energy, carbon stocks) as well as remote sensing observations (e.g. atmospheric composition, vegetation and surface properties).We briefly review the different existing data assimilation techniques and contrast them to model benchmarking and evaluation efforts (which also rely on observations). A common requirement for all assimilation techniques is a full description of the observational data properties. Uncertainty estimates of the observations are as important as the observa-tions themselves because they similarly determine the outcome of such assimilation systems. Hence, this article reviews the requirements of data assimilation systems on observations and provides a non-exhaustive overview of current observations and their uncertainties for use in terrestrial carbon cycle data assimilation. We report on progress since the review of model-data synthesis in terrestrial carbon observations by Raupach et al. (2005), emphasising the rapid advance in relevant space-based observations.

TI  - An assessment of the impact of ATMS and CrIS data assimilation on precipitation prediction over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation data assimilation system and the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) regional model, the impact of assimilating Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) and Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) satellite data on precipitation prediction over the Tibetan Plateau in July 2015 was evaluated. Four experiments were designed: a control experiment and three data assimilation experiments with different data sets injected: conventional data only, a combination of conventional and ATMS satellite data, and a combination of conventional and CrIS satellite data. The results showed that the monthly mean of precipitation is shifted northward in the simulations and showed an orographic bias described as an overestimation upwind of the mountains and an underestimation in the south of the rain belt. The rain shadow mainly influenced prediction of the quantity of precipitation, although the main rainfall pattern was well simulated. For the first 24 h and last 24 h of accumulated daily precipitation, the model generally overestimated the amount of precipitation, but it was underestimated in the heavy-rainfall periods of 3-5, 13-16, and 22-25 July. The observed water vapor conveyance from the southeastern Tibetan Plateau was larger than in the model simulations, which induced inaccuracies in the forecast of heavy rain on 3-5 July. The data assimilation experiments, particularly the ATMS assimilation, were closer to the observations for the heavy-rainfall process than the control. Overall, based on the experiments in July 2015, the satellite data assimilation improved to some extent the prediction of the precipitation pattern over the Tibetan Plateau, although the simulation of the rain belt without data assimilation shows the regional shifting.

TI  - Identifying Land Use and Land-Use Changes (LULUC): A Global LULUC Matrix
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land-use changes (LULUC) information is essential to determine the environmental impacts of anthropogenic land-use and conversion. However, existing data sets are either local-scale or they quantify land occupation per land-use type rather than providing information on land-use changes. Here we combined the strengths of the remotely sensed MODIS land cover data set and FAOSTAT land-use data to obtain a database including a collection of 231 country-specific LULUC matrixes, as suggested by the IPCC. We produced two versions of each matrix: version 1, identifying forestland based on canopy cover criteria; version 2, distinguishing primary, secondary, planted forests and permanent crops. The outcome was a first country-based, consistent set of spatially explicit LULUC matrixes. The database facilitates a more holistic assessment of land-use changes, quantifying changes that occur between land classes from 2001 to 2012, providing crucial information for assessing environmental impacts caused by LULUC. The data allow global-scale land-use change analyses, requiring a distinction between land types based not only on land cover but also on land uses. The spatially explicit data set may also serve as a starting point for further studies aiming at determining the drivers of land-use change supported by spatial statistical modeling.

AB  - Glyoxal (CHOCHO) is produced in the atmosphere by the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Like formaldehyde (HCHO), another VOC oxidation product, it is measurable from space by solar backscatter. Isoprene emitted by vegetation is the dominant source of CHOCHO and HCHO in most of the world. We use aircraft observations of CHOCHO and HCHO from the SENEX campaign over the southeast US in summer 2013 to better understand the CHOCHO time-dependent yield from isoprene oxidation, its dependence on nitrogen oxides (NOx equivalent to NO + NO2), the behavior of the CHOCHO-HCHO relationship, the quality of OMI CHOCHO satellite observations, and the implications for using CHOCHO observations from space as constraints on isoprene emissions. We simulate the SENEX and OMI observations with the Goddard Earth Observing System chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) featuring a new chemical mechanism for CHOCHO formation from isoprene. The mechanism includes prompt CHOCHO formation under low-NOx conditions following the isomerization of the isoprene peroxy radical (ISOPO2). The SENEX observations provide support for this prompt CHOCHO formation pathway, and are generally consistent with the GEOS-Chem mechanism. Boundary layer CHOCHO and HCHO are strongly correlated in the observations and the model, with some departure under low-NOx conditions due to prompt CHOCHO formation. SENEX vertical profiles indicate a free-tropospheric CHOCHO background that is absent from the model. The OMI CHOCHO data provide some support for this free-tropospheric background and show southeast US enhancements consistent with the isoprene source but a factor of 2 too low. Part of this OMI bias is due to excessive surface reflectivities assumed in the retrieval. The OMI CHOCHO and HCHO seasonal data over the southeast US are tightly correlated and provide redundant proxies of isoprene emissions. Higher temporal resolution in future geostationary satellite observations may enable detection of the prompt CHOCHO production under low-NOx conditions apparent in the SENEX data.

AB  - Objective To analyze the overseas imported malaria situation of Shijiazhuang City from 2012 to 2015, so as to provide the evidence for exploring the prevention and control strategy. Methods The data of overseas imported malaria were collected and analyzed with the descriptive method including Plasmodium species, population characteristics, epidemic focus distribution, onset time, diagnosis and treatment in Shijiazhuang City from 2012 to 2015, and the time from the onset to first medical visit, time from first medical visit to being diagnosed, and time from onset to being diagnosed of different Plasmodium species were analyzed respectively with the statistical analysis method. Results A total of 92 overseas imported malaria cases were reported in Shijiazhuang City from 2012 to 2015, including 88 cases from African countries (falciparum malaria taking 53.41%), and 4 cases from Southeast Asian and other countries (vivax malaria taking 50%). Eighty-nine cases were distributed in 28 counties (districts) of 6 cities in Hebei Province, except 2 persons with foreign nationalities and 1 with Anhui Province census register. The male and young adults were dominant. The median time from the onset to seeing a doctor was one day and the median time from seeing a doctor to being diagnosed was five days. Most cases were reported by the Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang which was the sentinel hospital. Totally 42.39% of the cases were misdiagnosed when the first visit to a doctor. All of the cases were laboratory confirmed and 100% of them received the standard treatment after diagnosis. Conclusions The overseas imported malaria cases are increasing rapidly with years and the malignant malaria cases were more than other malaria cases in Shijiazhuang City. It is necessary to further strengthen the long-term cooperation mechanism between the medical institutions and the entry-exit inspection and quarantine department. The technician training should be strengthened to avoid the severe cases and death cases.

TI  - Drought identification in the eastern Baltic region using NDVI
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts are phenomena that affect large areas. Remote sensing data covering large territories can be used to assess the impact and extent of droughts. Drought effect on vegetation was determined using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) in the eastern Baltic Sea region located between 53-60 degrees N and 20-30 degrees E. The effect of precipitation deficit on vegetation in arable land and broadleaved and coniferous forest was analysed using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) calculated for 1-to 9-month timescales. Vegetation has strong seasonality in the analysed area. The beginning and the end of the vegetation season depends on the distance from the Baltic Sea, which affects temperature and precipitation patterns. The vegetation season in the southeastern part of the region is 5-6 weeks longer than in the northwestern part. The early spring air temperature, snowmelt water storage in the soil and precipitation have the largest influence on the NDVI values in the first half of the active growing season. Precipitation deficit in the first part of the vegetation season only has a significant impact on the vegetation on arable land. The vegetation in the forests is less sensitive to the moisture deficit. Correlation between VCI and the same month SPI1 is usually negative in the study area. It means that wetter conditions lead to lower VCI values, while the correlation is usually positive between the VCI and the SPI of the previous month. With a longer SPI scale the correlation gradually shifts towards the positive coefficients. The positive correlation between 3-and 6-month SPI and VCI was observed on the arable land and in both types of forests in the second half of vegetation season. The precipitation deficit is only one of the vegetation condition drivers and NDVI cannot be used universally to identify droughts, but it may be applied to better assess the effect of droughts on vegetation in the eastern Baltic Sea region.

TI  - Impacts of El Nino and La Nina on interannual snow accumulation in the Andes: Results from a high-resolution 31 year reanalysis
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present new insights on extratropical Andean snow climatology (27 degrees S to 37 degrees S) based on the results from a 31 year high-resolution reanalysis. The snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates were generated by integrating observed snow depletion data from Landsat together with a snow model forced by the Modern-era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications. The spatial resolution (180 m), geographic extent (175,000 km(2)), and temporal span (1984-2015) constitute an unprecedented data set for the region. SWE reaches annual peak volumes between 13 and 66 km(3), with a climatological average of 27.7 km(3). A positive correlation between SWE and the Oceanic Nino Index (R-2 = 0.35) exists for the region, with a strengthening of the signal from north to south, peaking at 34 degrees S. Although the correlation between El Nino and positive SWE anomalies is significant, La Nina was not found to drive negative anomalies beyond what is observed during non-La Nina years.

TI  - Competing effects of surface albedo and orographic elevated heating on regional climate
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - All else being equal, a given atmospheric pressure level is thought to be warmer over a plateau than over surrounding nonelevated terrain because of orographic "elevated heating." However, elevated surfaces are also typically brighter due to reduced vegetation and increased ice cover. Here we assess the degree to which surface albedo compensates for orographic elevated heating. We confirm that land surface albedo generally increases with surface elevation in observations. Using a cloud system-resolving model, we show that increased surface albedo strongly compensates for orographic elevated heating in radiative-convective equilibrium. A nonelevated surface with the albedo of modern India would enter a runaway greenhouse regime without ventilation by monsoonal winds, while a surface with the albedo and elevation of Tibet would achieve a cooler radiative-convective equilibrium. Surface albedo changes may thus be just as important as surface elevation changes for the evolution of low-latitude regional climate throughout Earth's history.

TI  - Wind and rainfall regulation of the diffuse attenuation coefficient in large, shallow lakes from long-term MODIS observations using a semianalytical model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the variation and regulation of the diffuse attenuation coefficient is important for management of lake water quality and ecological environments. Data were collected seven times (378 samples) from 2006 to 2011 in Lake Taihu to improve the existing semianalytical model of diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d(490)) by measuring in situ K-d(490) and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). This semianalytical model was applied to determine the long-term variation of K-d(490) and its driving factors from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Our semianalytical model of K-d(490) improves the retrieval accuracy of K-d(490) from 29.60% to 22.58% (root-mean-square percentage error) and 24.28 +/- 18.54% (mean value +/- standard deviation) to 19.29 +/- 14.34% (mean absolute relative error). The K-d (490) from maps produced from MODIS images clearly present the temporal and spatial variations of K-d(490). This indicates the suitability of using the improved semianalytical model and MODIS to observe K-d(490) in turbid shallow inland waters. Long-term MODIS observation of K-d(490) shows distinct seasonal and spatial variations. Temporally, the highest and the lowest K-d(490) were found in winter and in summer, respectively. Spatially, high K-d(490) values were primarily distributed in the southwestern and northwestern Lake Taihu, and relatively low K-d(490) values were distributed in Meiliang Bay and Gonghu Bay (the eastern part of the lake and East Bay were excluded in this study due to invalid retrieval results of K-d(490)). Many covarying points were found between K-d(490) and maximum wind speed from long-term observations, suggesting that wind-induced sediment resuspension is the principal driver of high K-d(490). Correlation was also observed between K-d(490) and heavy rainfall events, suggesting the regulating effect of heavy rainfall.

TI  - Observational evidence of 3-D cloud effects in OCO-2 CO<sub>2</sub> retrievals
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The standard deviations of the distributions of Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) measurements of CO2 (i. e., XCO2) increase in size in the presence of clouds. XCO2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) radiance and cloud fields, and OCO-2 A-band radiances, are analyzed in order to determine if this behavior is best described as a radiance-level retrieval artifact or by 3-D radiative transfer effects. Observations in clear-sky and fair weather cumulus scenes are analyzed. Scatter diagrams of XCO2 versus MODIS (and OCO-2) radiances are presented, and averages are calculated for each scene for several radiance bins. The averages vary little in clear skies but decrease markedly for cloudy scenes as radiances increase. These decreases are consistent with an interpretative framework provided by 3-D SHDOM radiative transfer calculations. Two 3-D metrics,.XCO2 and Have, are calculated and applied..XCO2 is the difference in XCO2 for the smallest and largest radiance bins. Have is a measure of the heterogeneity of the cloud radiance field. Lines of XCO2 and MODIS radiance for four target mode scenes have different slopes for clear and cloudy scenes, contrary to the radiance-level retrieval artifact interpretation. In contrast, the graph of.XCO2 and MODIS Have for the various scenes has a linear correlation coefficient of 0.92, consistent with the 3-D interpretation. Since the OCO-2 measurement requirement is 1 ppmv, the cloudy scene XCO2 standard deviations between 1.2 and 2.6 ppmv indicate that 3-D cloud effects add an important component to the XCO2 error budget.Plain Language Summary The measurement goal of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) satellite is to measure CO2 to better to 1% accuracy on a regional scale. OCO-2 CO2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite radiance and cloud fields for a half-dozen individual scenes are analyzed to demonstrate that three-dimensional cloud effects contribute to variations in CO2 at local (e. g. 20 km x 20 km) spatial scales. Two three-dimensional indicators (.XCO2 and Have) are calculated and applied. The correlation of.XCO2 and Have (0.92) demonstrates that three-dimensional cloud effects increasingly add to the variations of OCO-2 CO2 measurements as the cloud field becomes increasingly more complicated.

TI  - Shock metamorphism of clay minerals on Mars by meteor impact
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A large fraction of clay minerals detected on Mars by infrared remote sensing represent materials exhumed from the subsurface by meteor impact, begging the question of whether the infrared features used to detect the clays are affected by shock associated with the impacts. We used X-ray diffraction and infrared and Mossbauer spectroscopy to evaluate the mineralogy of five clay minerals after experimentally shocking them to six shock pressures from similar to 10 to 40 GPa. The shocked clays exhibit three main relevant shock effects: (1) an overall decrease in infrared spectral contrast in the impact-fragmented materials, (2) oxidation of Fe in ferrous clays, and (3) loss of some spectral structure in relatively well-ordered clays such as kaolinite. Other than the widespread oxidation of ferrous clays, shock metamorphism likely has little effect on the accurate interpretation of clay mineralogy on Mars from remote sensing data. However, we are able to identify rare cases of extreme shock in some Martian clay deposits.Plain Language Summary One of the most significant achievements in planetary sciences in the last 20 years has been the identification and mapping of Martian surface mineralogy by infrared remote sensing. Of major interest is the characterization of clay minerals that formed in ancient habitable environments on Mars >3.5 Ga ago. Because most of these deposits are extremely ancient, they exist within crustal materials that have experienced numerous meteor impacts and therefore could have been affected by heat and pressure associated with those events. The paper contains three main points: (1) the main features that are used to interpret clay mineralogy from infrared data remain intact despite shock metamorphic effects up to pressures of similar to 40 GPa, (2) shocked clays display some key features that can be used to identify effects of shock remotely, and (3) we describe some of the global-scale spectral biases in interpretation of clays on Mars that are likely to arise from shock effects and we show some concrete examples of shocked Martian clays in certain cases. We believe that this would be the first publication of clear evidence for shocked minerals detected by remote sensing on any planet.

TI  - Mapping finer-resolution land surface emissivity using Landsat images in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface emissivity is a crucial parameter for obtaining the land surface temperature and estimating the land surface energy budget from remote sensing data. The current emissivity products always have a coarser spatial resolution than the products from the visible and near-infrared data. This study focused on the generation of an emissivity product at a spatial resolution of 30 m using a new global land cover product called Finer-Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover and Landsat images. Summer-average emissivity products in four narrowbands (Landsat 5/Thematic Mapper Band 6, Landsat 7/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Band 6, and Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor bands 1 and 2) and two broadbands (3-14 mu m and 8-13.5 mu m) were produced in China. Results illustrated that the narrowband emissivities ranged from 0.95 to 0.99, whereas the broadband emissivities ranged from 0.93 to 0.99 in the study area. Intercomparisons in different places showed that the new emissivity was close to Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer emissivity with a difference of about 0.015 for narrowband emissivity and about 0.02 for broadband emissivity on a regional scale. For application purposes, the emissivities were released in the Worldwide Reference System 2 and geographic coordinate systems with several spatial resolutions resampled from its original scale of 30 m.

TI  - Ground deformation before the 2015 eruptions of Cotopaxi volcano detected by InSAR
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotopaxi volcano started a period of volcanic unrest in April 2015 that led to a series of eruptions between August and November 2015. We use COSMO-SkyMed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar supported by continuous GPS observations spanning the period of 2014-2016 to obtain time-dependent ground deformation data over Cotopaxi volcano related to the period of unrest and onset of eruptions. We find evidence of precursory deformation, with a maximum uplift on the western flank of 3.4 cm from April to August 2015. Deformation is explained by an inclined sheet intrusion located a few km southwest of the summit with an opening volume of 6.8 x 10(6)m(3), extending from a depth of 12.1 km and shallowing to 5.5 km below the summit, that contributed to internal edifice growth. The temporal coincidence of deformation prior to the eruptions potentially suggests that short-term eruptions at Cotopaxi are partly controlled by episodic edifice growth.

AB  - Effects of absorbing atmospheric aerosols in modulating the tropospheric refractive index structure parameter (C-n(2)) are estimated using high resolution radiosonde and multi-satellite data along with a radiative transfer model. We report the influence of variations in residence time and vertical distribution of aerosols in modulating C-n(2) and why the aerosol induced atmospheric heating needs to be considered while estimating a free space optical communication link budget. The results show that performance of the link is seriously affected if large concentrations of absorbing aerosols reside for a long time in the atmospheric path. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

TI  - Mortality salience increases death-thought accessibility and worldview defense among high Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP) individuals
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP) is an individual difference whereby persons exhibit mild characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including being socially aloof and having a rigid personality. Given that individuals high in BAP rigidity have difficulty adjusting to change, the present research examined whether rigid persons report greater concerns about death and adhere to their cultural beliefs following mortality salience (MS). In Study 1, we found that BAP rigidity was positively associated with greater mortality-related concerns. In Study 2, high rigid individuals evidenced increased death-thought accessibility following MS. Finally, Study 3 found that MS led to heightened worldview defense for individuals high in rigidity, while decreasing defensiveness for those low in rigidity. These results provide evidence for the moderating role of individual differences in terror management effects. Specifically, ASD characteristics in young adults, particularly in the area of rigidity, contribute to heightened death concerns and greater defensiveness. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Satellite observations of fumarole activity at Aluto volcano, Ethiopia: Implications for geothermal monitoring and volcanic hazard
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fumaroles are the surface manifestation of hydrothermal circulation and can be influenced by magmatic, hydro thermal, hydrological and tectonic processes. This study investigates the temporal changes in fumarole temperatures and spatial extent on Aluto, a restless volcano in the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), in order to better understand the controls on fluid circulation and the interaction between the magmatic and hydrothermal systems. Thermal infrared (TIR) satellite images, acquired by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER) over the period of 2004 to 2016, are used to generate time series of the fumarole temperatures and areas. The thermal anomalies identified in the ASTER images coincide with known fumaroles with temperatures >80 degrees C and are located on or close to fault structures, which provide a pathway for the rising fluids. Most of the fumaroles, including those along the major zone of hydrothermal upwelling, the Artu Jawe Fault Zone, have pixel-integrated temperature variations of only similar to 2 +/- 1.5 degrees C. The exception are the Bobesa fumaroles located on a hypothesised caldera ring fault which show pixel-integrated temperature changes of up to 9 degrees C consistent with a delayed response of the hydrothermal system to precipitation. We conclude that fumaroles along major faults are strongly coupled to the magmatic-hydrothermal system and are relatively stable with time, whereas those along shallower structures close to the rift flank are more strongly influenced by seasonal variations in groundwater flow. The use of remote sensing data to monitor the thermal activity of Aluto provides an important contribution towards understanding the behaviour of this actively deforming volcano. This method could be used at other volcanoes around the world for monitoring and geothermal exploration. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of typhoon events on chlorophyll and carbon fixation in different regions of the East China Sea
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoons play an important role in the regulation of phytoplankton biomass and carbon fixation in the ocean. Data from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on 35 typhoon events during 2002-2011 are analyzed to examine the effects of typhoon events on variations in sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and depth-integrated primary productivity (IPP) in the East China Sea (ECS). For all 35 typhoon cases, the average SST drops by 0.1 degrees C in the typhoon influenced regions, and the maximal decrease is 2.2 degrees C. During the same period, average Chl-a increases by 0.1 mg m(-3), with the maximal increase reaching up to 1 mg m-3, and average IPP increases by 32.9 mg C M-2.d(-1), with the largest increase being 221 mg C m(-2). d(-1). The IPP are significantly correlated with SST and Chl-a data, and the correlations become stronger after typhoon passage. On average, nearly one-third of the ECS is affected by typhoons during the 10 year period, and the resident time of the typhoons in the area reach to 38.2 h. Effects of the typhoon events on SST, Chl-a, and IPP manifest differently in the three key sea areas, namely, the coastal water (depths <50 m), continental shelf (depths 50-200 m), and open sea (depths >200 m) regions in the ECS. Specifically, stronger responses are observed in shallow water than in deeper depths. The comparisons between the pre-and post-typhoon periods show that IPP in the post-typhoon period increases by 19.7% and 12.2% in the coastal and continental shelf regions, respectively, but it decreases by 9.4% in the open sea region. Overall, our results reveal that there is a close coupling between Chl-a, SST, and IPP in shallow areas and that typhoon events can have strong effects on carbon fixation in coastal regions.

TI  - Glacial-geomorphic study of the Thajwas glacier valley, Kashmir Himalayas, India
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial-geomorphic studies provide vital information to make inferences about the effect of glacial advance and retreat on the geomorphology of an area. In the present study, glacial-geomorphic land-forms of the Thajwas glacial valley in the upper reaches of the Indus, Kashmir Himalayas were mapped using geospatial technology validated with GPS-based field observations and ground photography. The glacial-geomorphic landforms were digitized using ASTER DEM (30 m resolution), Landsat ETM+ satellite imagery (30 m resolution) and Google Earth (1 m resolution) data. Results showed that Google Earth imagery, supported by field validation, is very useful for the interpretation of glacial-geomorphic landscapes and relief features at micro-and meso-scales. However, morphometric characteristics of landforms are best obtained using DEM overlaid onto the Landsat ETM+ satellite data. Glaciers in the valley are presently confined along the south and southwestern slopes. However, the significant role played by glaciers in shaping the geomorphic landforms and their subsequent preservation within the scenic landscape under the Late Quaternary climatic conditions are remarkably evident. The glacial-geomorphic landforms, especially terminal moraine, glacial trough and cirques observed in the valley aided the reconstruction of palaeo-glacial setting of the area. Morphology, shape and location of terminal and lateral moraine ridges were used to establish the palaeo-glacial extents, glacial volume and the number of glacial advances of the Thajwas glacier. The maximum elevation of the lateral moraines was used to define the former Equilibrium-Line Altitude (ELA). The greater rock excavation to form a large valley during the last glacial maximum might have induced isostatic rock uplift/exhumation in the glacier source area. It is observed that the concomitant retreat of the north-facing glacial cirques has played an important role in expanding the glacial valley and limiting the topographic relief.

TI  - Characterizing post-construction settlement of the Masjed-Soleyman embankment dam, Southwest Iran, using TerraSAR-X SpotLight radar imagery
T2  - ENGINEERING STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Geodetic monitoring of infrastructures is one of the key tasks in surveying and engineering geology. Systematic monitoring and assessment of the exterior deformation of embankment dams for safety analysis are often difficult when using classical surveying techniques due to time-consuming surveying procedures and high labour costs. Modern remote sensing techniques play an important role in efficiently assessing deformation: changes in the geometry, position and orientation of dams. In this study, we present the feasibility of effective post-construction deformation monitoring of the Masjed-Soleyman dam in Iran using high-resolution (similar to 1 m) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery in SpotLight (SL) mode from the X-band TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite. This dam has been monitored over the last 15 years using classical surveying techniques, which provide horizontal and vertical deformation measurements of the structure. We show that high-resolution X-band SAR data provide a much more detailed identification of dam deformation in the crest and downstream that is not possible to infer from classical surveying techniques with few sparse geodetic monuments. High-resolution TSX data reveal that the dam is currently subject to two different deformation regimes: one is related to the crest and its adjacent area downstream, with a maximum rate of deformation of approximately 13 cm/yr in the radar line-of-sight (LOS). The other is related to the lower part of the downstream, with a maximum LOS velocity of 7 cm/yr. The effect of this centimetre displacement rate has been shown through several damage features on the dam body, including minor to large dislocation cracks on the crest and a significant deformation zone on the downstream slope.

TI  - Monitoring the aftermath of Flint drinking water contamination crisis: Another case of sampling bias?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The delay in reporting high levels of lead in Flint drinking water, following the city's switch to the Flint River as its water supply, was partially caused by the biased selection of sampling sites away from the lead pipe network. Since Flint returned to its pre-crisis source of drinking water, the State has been monitoring water lead levels (WLL) at selected "sentinel" sites. In a first phase that lasted two months, 739 residences were sampled, most of them bi-weekly, to determine the general health of the distribution system and to track temporal changes in lead levels. During the same period, water samples were also collected through a voluntary program whereby concerned citizens received free testing kits and conducted sampling on their own. State officials relied on the former data to demonstrate the steady improvement in water quality. A recent analysis of data collected by voluntary sampling revealed, however, an opposite trend with lead levels increasing over time. This paper looks at potential sampling bias to explain such differences. Although houses with higher WLL were more likely to be sampled repeatedly, voluntary sampling turned out to reproduce fairly well the main characteristics (i.e. presence of lead service lines (LSL), construction year) of Flint housing stock. State-controlled sampling was less representative; e.g., sentinel sites with LSL were mostly built between 1935 and 1950 in lower poverty areas, which might hamper our ability to disentangle the effects of LSL and premise plumbing (lead fixtures and pipes present within old houses) on WLL. Also, there was no sentinel site with LSL in two of the most impoverished wards, including where the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels tripled following the switch in water supply. Correcting for sampling bias narrowed the gap between sampling programs, yet overall temporal trends are still opposite. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Small-scale density variations in the lunar crust revealed by GRAIL
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission have revealed that similar to 98% of the power of the gravity signal of the Moon at high spherical harmonic degrees correlates with the topography. The remaining 2% of the signal, which cannot be explained by topography, contains information about density variations within the crust. These high-degree Bouguer gravity anomalies are likely caused by small-scale (10's of km) shallow density variations. Here we use gravity inversions to model the small-scale three-dimensional variations in the density of the lunar crust. Inversion results from three nondescript areas yield shallow density variations in the range of 100-200 kg/m(3). Three end-member scenarios of variations in porosity, intrusions into the crust, and variations in bulk crustal composition were tested as possible sources of the density variations. We find that the density anomalies can be caused entirely by changes in porosity. Characteristics of density anomalies in the South Pole-Aitken basin also support porosity as a primary source of these variations. Mafic intrusions into the crust could explain many, but not all of the anomalies. Additionally, variations in crustal composition revealed by spectral data could only explain a small fraction of the density anomalies. Nevertheless, all three sources of density variations likely contribute. Collectively, results from this study of GRAIL gravity data, combined with other studies of remote sensing data and lunar samples, show that the lunar crust exhibits variations in density by +/- 10% over scales ranging from centimeters to 100's of kilometers.

TI  - Variation in public perceptions and attitudes towards terrestrial ecosystems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity is a global asset of inestimable value which is threatened by human activities. Biodiversity exists within ecosystems, which enjoy differing levels of conservation. The ways in which humans regard ecosystems can play an important role in identifying strategies to change human behaviour, thereby achieving conservation goals. We investigated how preference, scenic attractiveness, perceptions of biodiversity and conservation value varied between five terrestrial ecosystems in Victoria, Australia (503 respondents). We document, for the first time, distinct ecosystem preferences, with people favouring wet forest, followed by dry forest, arid woodland/shrubland, heathland and then grassland. The ecological worldview of the respondent (i.e., the set of beliefs that guide the way a person interacts with the natural world), their familiarity with the habitat and perceived scenic attractiveness influenced the conservation value assigned by the members of the public to each ecosystem. The conservation and biodiversity value assigned to each ecosystem was higher where people were familiar with the ecosystem, considered it attractive, and held an ecocentric worldview. These aspects may correlate with public attitudes and represent key elements which could be used to engender higher levels of support for less appreciated ecosystems. Enhanced support may then underpin better conservation outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Solar variability zones: Satellite-derived zones that represent high-frequency ground variability
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine the impact of solar variability to electric grid operations, appropriate samples of solar variability must be used, but determining appropriate variability samples is difficult for locations without ground measurements. In this work, we evaluate and model the relationship between high-frequency and low-frequency solar variability. The developed model is then used to define solar variability zones zones of similar high-frequency solar variability - using low-frequency satellite data. A map of the United States is presented indicating areas of high, moderate, and low solar variability. To demonstrate the value of the variability zones, quasi-static time series (QSTS) simulations are used to determine the impact of variability samples from each zone on distribution grid voltage regulator tap change operations (a measure of the impact of solar variability to electric grid operations). Strong correlation is found between satellite-derived variability zone and QSTS simulated tap changes based on ground samples of solar variability, showing that solar variability zones can be useful to approximate the impacts of high -frequency solar variability. The relationship between high -frequency and low-frequency variability is found to apply to timescales as short as 10-s. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Contrast in column-integrated aerosol optical properties during heating and non-heating seasons at Urumqi - Its causes and implications
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical properties were retrieved from two years' worth of Sunphotometer measurements at Urumqi, an urban station in western China. Distinct seasonal variations of aerosol optical properties were revealed. During the heating season, mean aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (T-a), Angstrom exponent calculated from aerosol optical depth at wavelength of 440 and 870 nm (alpha) as well as PM2.5 concentration were 0.58 +/- 0.33, 1.11 +/- 034 and 79.5 +/- 69.6 mu g m(-3), respectively, which contrasted their counterparts during the non-heating season of 0.32 +/- 0.22, 0.79 +/- 0.26, and 35.0 +/- 20.1 mu g m(-3). Seasonal variations of T-a and PM2.5 at Urumqi contrasted with corresponding values in eastern China. Enhancement of T-a was associated with fine mode radius (r(f)) exceeding 0.15 mu m. Relative humidity frequently exceeded 80% during the heating season, which probably resulted in r(f) > 0.15 as a result of the hygroscopic growth under the humid environment. r(f) was larger than value assigned to the fine-mode dominated aerosol models used in the dark-target algorithm of the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Annual mean single scattering albedo at 550 nm (omega) was 0.87 that was close to the value assigned to the absorption aerosol model in the MODIS algorithm. omega increased as T-a increased, probably as a result of the growth of aerosol size. omega of dust aerosols at Urumqi was slightly lower than that in dust source and downwind regions. Substantial differences in aerosol optical and physical properties and their seasonal variation between western and eastern China require maintaining long-term ground based remote sensing aerosols, which would be expected to play an important role in studying aerosol's effects on weather, climate and atmospheric environment.

TI  - Are There Patients With T1 to T2, Lymph Node-Negative Breast Cancer Who Are "High-Risk" for Locoregional Disease Recurrence?
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Indications for postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in patients with T1 to T2, lymph node-negative (N0) breast cancer with "high-risk" features are controversial. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22922 and National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group MA20 trials reporting improved 10-year disease-free survival with lymph node irradiation included patients with high-risk N0 disease, but, to the authors' knowledge, benefits in patients receiving modern systemic therapy are uncertain. METHODS: The authors retrospectively identified patients with T1 to T2N0 disease who were treated with mastectomy from January 2006 through December 2011. High-risk features included age <40 years, multifocality/multicentricity, lymphovascular invasion, medial/central tumor location, and high nuclear grade. RESULTS: Among 672 eligible patients, only 15 received PMRT and were excluded. Of the remaining 657 patients, 187 (28%) had 1 high-risk feature and 449 patients (68%) had >= 2 high-risk features. A total of 36 patients with unknown tumor grade were excluded from risk analysis. Approximately 98% of patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy alone and 86% received adjuvant systemic therapy. At a median of 5.6 years of follow-up, the locoregional disease recurrence (LRR) rate was 4.7% (31 patients). Increasing tumor size was found to be associated with LRR (hazard ratio, 1.70; P = .006), whereas other high-risk features were not (all P > .05). Receipt of systemic therapy decreased the LRR rate (hazard ratio, 0.40; P = .03). Although crude LRR rates increased from 3.8% to 9.4% with 1 versus >= 4 high-risk features, the number of risk factors was not found to be significantly associated with LRR (P = .54). CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, a low crude LRR rate (4.7%) was observed in a large unselected cohort of patients with T1 to T2N0 breast cancer with high-risk features who were treated with mastectomy and systemic therapy without PMRT. Although increasing tumor size and the omission of systemic therapy were found to be predictive, other features did not confer a higher LRR risk either independently or together, and do not by themselves mandate the use of PMRT in this patient population.

TI  - A new approach for the estimation of phytoplankton cell counts associated with algal blooms
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a method for estimating phytoplankton cell counts associated with an algal bloom, using satellite images coincident with in situ and meteorological parameters. Satellite images from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), Operational Land Imager (OLD and Hj-1 A/B Charge Couple Device (CCD) sensors were integrated with the meteorological observations to provide an estimate of phytoplankton cell counts. All images were atmospherically corrected using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) atmospheric correction method with a possible error of 1.2%, 2.6%, 1.4% and 23% for blue (450-520 nm), green (520-600 nm), red (630-690 nm) and near infrared (NIR 760-900 nm) wavelengths, respectively. Results showed that the developed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model yields a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.95 with the in situ validation data with Sum of Squared Error (SSE) of 034 cell/ml, Mean Relative Error (MRE) of 0.154 cells/ml and a bias of -504.87. The integration of the meteorological parameters with remote sensing observations provided a promising estimation of the algal scum as compared to previous studies. The applicability of the ANN model was tested over Hong Kong as well as over Lake Kasumigaura, Japan and Lake Okeechobee, Florida USA, where algal blooms were also reported. Further, a 40-year (1975-2014) red tide occurrence map was developed and revealed that the eastern and southern waters of Hong Kong are more vulnerable to red tides. Over the 40 years, 66% of red tide incidents were associated with the Dinoflagellates group, while the remainder were associated with the Diatom group (14%) and several other minor groups (20%). The developed technology can be applied to other similar environments in an efficient and cost saving manner. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Using the NDVI to identify variations in, and responses of, vegetation to climate change on the Tibetan Plateau from 1982 to 2012
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We used the third generation Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and climate data (temperature and precipitation) to examine recent (1982 -2012) spatial and temporal variations in vegetation, and relationships between climate and vegetation for both the growing period and for different seasons, on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Across the whole plateau, trends calculated by linear regression showed that as temperature and precipitation increased, the growing season (May-September) NDVI values increased at rate of 0.002 decade(-1) (p = 0.14) from 1982 to 2012. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition estimation method showed that the rates of increase in the NDVI gradually intensified until the end of the 1990s, and then decreased slightly in the following years. The autumn NDVI increased at a rate of 0.005 decade(-1) (p = 0.04) and was a major contributor to the growing season NDVI. The NDVI and temperature were positively correlated at seasonal and monthly timescales during the growing season. The responses of vegetation growth to seasonal and monthly changes in precipitation, however, were complex. The NDVI trends showed obvious spatial heterogeneity and coincided well with regional and seasonal changes in climate. The growing season NDVI increased in 55% of the area of the TP. On a seasonal basis, the largest increase in the NDVI occurred in autumn and affected more than 61% of the TP, while the smallest increase in the NDVI occurred in spring, and affected over 41% of the area. Moreover, there were seasonal and spatial variations in the responses of different vegetation types to temperature and precipitation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

TI  - Reconstruction of Little Ice Age glacier area and equilibrium line attitudes in the central and western Himalaya
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial changes during the Little Ice Age (LIA) in the Himalayan Mountains are important for understanding changes in the monsoonal and westerly climate of the so-called 'the Third Pole'. However, knowledge of these changes and their dynamics remains limited because of the region's geographical inaccessibility, in addition to geopolitical reasons. In this study, we used high resolution three-dimensional images from Google Earth to identify lateral and terminal moraines as delineators of paleoglacier boundaries, and mapped the boundaries of both modern and LIA glaciers. ArcGIS 9.3 software was applied to map data and to calculate glacier lengths and areas; modern glacier surface elevation data were derived from SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) records. Three methods, the toe-to-headwall altitude ratio (THAR), the toe-to-summit altitude method (TSAM), and the toe-to-ridge altitude method (TRAM) were used to estimate equilibrium line altitude (ELA). The transient snowlines (TSL) of ninety-one modern glaciers were acquired using Landsat 8 OLI images in late summer to evaluate the reliability of the calculated ELAs. Our results showed that the total length and total area of two hundred and twenty glaciers in the central and western Himalaya (CWH) had decreased respectively by 35% and 31% since the LIA. The TRAM method was the preferred method for the reconstruction of ELAs. The mean depression of ELAs from the LIA to the first decade of the 21st Century, as reconstructed using the TRAM method, was 123 m. The ELA depression and rate of change of glacier length and glacier area displayed generally increasing trends from west to east along the central and western Himalaya, suggesting that the moisture was most likely transported from an easterly direction. These changes were more intensive on southern than northern slopes, suggesting that southerly and westerly precipitation likely increased over the same period. We speculated that the CWH had been influenced by both the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and Westerlies since the LIA. ISM moisture, as in modern times, was the main factor controlling the distribution of glaciers during the LIA. Further, precipitation carried by the Westerlies likely intensified along southerly pathways along the CWH during the LIA. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

TI  - Glacier status during the period 1973-2014 in the Hunza Basin, Western Karakoram
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier changes in the Karakoram have shown a complex pattern since the recent decades with the coexistence of advancing, retreating, and stable glaciers, but the mechanisms driving these changes remain, for the most part, unclear. We examined the changes in glacier length, area, and elevation in the Hunza Basin of the upper Indus River region, western Karakoram, using CORONA remote sensing data, Landsat MSS/TM/OLI imagery, SRTM digital elevation model (DEM), and GLAS/ICESat altimeter data. We delineated 108 glaciers within the study area. The total area of these glaciers decreased 28.86 km(2), or 1.36%, from 2115.48 km(2) in 1973-2086.62 km(2) in 2014. The most significant reduction in ice coverage occurred between 1992 and 1998, when glaciers retreated on average at a rate of -2.97 km(2)/yr (0.85% of the total coverage measured in the 1970s). In contrast, many glaciers advanced from 2008 to 2014 and glacial coverage increased by 0.19 +/- 0.00 km(2). In comparison to fast retreating glaciers in the Hindukush and the Trans-Himalayan regions, the glaciers in the Hunza Basin are relatively stable. The topographical characteristics and the size of the glaciers have direct impacts on glacial changes in the Hunza Basin. Specifically, significant changes occurred mainly below 5500 m above sea level, glaciers retreated more extensively on steep slopes than on gentle slopes, and small glaciers retreated relatively faster than large glaciers. The overall pattern of glacial retreat is related to the warming trend in summer temperature, whereas the relative stability of glaciers in the Hunza Basin, as well as their recent advance (2008-2014), is likely driven by increasing autumn and winter precipitation.

TI  - Estimation of quantitative measures of total water storage variation from GRACE and GLDAS-NOAH satellites using geospatial technology
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study represents the first attempt to examine spatial and seasonal variations of the surface water budget by using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) by measuring gravity anomalies on earth to estimate changes in Total Water Storage (TWS) content over the north-western region of the India including New Delhi and states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, covering an area of 676,917 km(2). The TWS (surface plus ground) and its changes were estimated from 2003 to 2012. Additionally, Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) variables were used to infer as to how TWS was partitioned into canopy water and soil moisture components. To evaluate monthly accumulated rainfall, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data, processed by the Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) were used. By computing storage changes in GRACE, TWS, GLDAS land surface state variables and terrestrial-based water balance approach, we calculated groundwater storage changes. The time-series comparisons show good agreement between the GRACE satellite data, GLDAS model data and computed groundwater data. The change in soil moisture storage is less than that in saturated storage. Both the GRACE and calculated groundwater storage changes indicate storage loss in the range of 86.43 km(3)/y +/- average of 10 years data (in terms of equivalent water thickness). The average groundwater loss for was calculated as 9.7 +/- km(3)/y, states of Haryana as 9.7 +/- km(3)/y, Rajasthan as 33.199 +/- km(3)/y and Uttar Pradesh as 44.4827 +/- km(3)/y. Our results are convincing of a credible GRACE hydrology data which can be handy in monitoring storage dynamics and water availability at regional scale. As GRACE data are available for virtually every region of the world, their application in conjunction with hydrological models will improve applications of hydrological studies which may lead not only to water balance closures, but also to sustainable water resource management at regional scale.

TI  - Recent land-use and land-cover changes and its driving factors in a fire-prone area of southwestern Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decades, contrasted trends in forest fires among countries around the Mediterranean basin have been observed. In the northern/western countries, Land Use-Land Cover (LULC) changes led to more hazardous landscapes, with consequent increases in fires. This contrasted with fire trends in southern/eastern countries. The recent incidence of large fires in some of the latter prompted the question of whether they are now following the path of their neighbors decades earlier. In this study, we investigated recent LULC changes in southwestern Turkey, focusing on those that could affect fire, and the factors driving them. To this end, LULC maps at different time steps (1975,1990, 2000 and 2010) were obtained from Landsat images, together with relevant socioeconomic data. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were applied to assess the effects of socioeconomic and geophysical factors on the dominant LULC changes over time. Over the whole period studied, the most important LULC changes were deforestation followed by afforestation. Deforestation was positively related to high livestock density and proximity to villages and increased forest interfaces with other LULC types. We found no evidence that LULC changes were making the landscape more hazardous as there was a net decrease in fuels biomass and the landscape became more fragmented over time. However, despite the area being heavily used and relatively fragmented, large fires can occur driven by severe weather. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Gulf of Carpentaria heated Torres Strait and the Northern Great Barrier Reef during the 2016 mass coral bleaching event
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2015/16 ENSO event increased the temperature of waters surrounding northeast Australia to above 30 degrees C, with large patches of water reaching 32 degrees C, for over two months, which led to severe bleaching of corals of the Northern Great Barrier Reef (NGBR). This study provides evidence gained from remote sensing data, oceanographic data and oceanographic modeling, that three factors caused this excessive heating, namely: 1) the shutdown of the North Queensland Coastal Current, which would otherwise have flushed and cooled the Northern Coral Sea and the NGBR through tidal mixing 2) the advection of warm (>30 degrees C) water from the Gulf of Carpentaria eastward through Torres Strait and then southward over the NGBR continental shelf, and 3) presumably local solar heating. The eastward flux of this warm water through Torres Strait was driven by a mean sea level difference on either side of the strait that in turn was controlled by the wind, which also generated the southward advection of this warm water onto the NGBR shelf. On the NGBR shelf, the residence time of this warm water was longer inshore than offshore, and this may explain the observed cross-shelf gradient of coral bleaching intensity. The fate of the Great Barrier Reef is thus controlled by the oceanography of surrounding seas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Use of Geriatric Assessment Tools in Selecting Therapies in Women Aged ≥70 Years With Hormone Receptor-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Preliminary Experience With a Quality Improvement Initiative
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To develop a multidisciplinary algorithmic approach to management of women aged >= 70 years with clinically staged T1N0 hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, including geriatric assessments predicting life expectancy and the likelihood of functional decline in the near future, in the context of a program-wide quality improvement initiative, to better select patients for therapeutic interventions.Methods and Materials: Two geriatric assessment tools, the Combined Lee-Schonberg Index and the Vulnerable Elderly Scale, were introduced into our clinical workflow to predict long-term mortality and likelihood of functional decline. Scores from these tools, along with patient preferences and clinical features, were incorporated into a preoperative algorithm addressing the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and a postoperative algorithm addressing the use of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT).Results: The algorithms were approved for use in August 2015. Twenty-four patients were identified by in-clinic screening and have been managed using the algorithms as a guide. Mean patient age was 80 years (range, 71-89 years). Per the preoperative algorithm, consideration of omission of SLNB was an option in 11 of 24 patients (46%), and in total 18 of 24 (75%) opted against SLNB. Per the postsurgical algorithm, consideration of omission of adjuvant RT was an option for 19 of 24 patients (79%), and in total 17 of 24 (71%) opted to forego RT.Conclusion: Incorporation of simple geriatric assessments seems to have had a marked impact on decision making regarding both surgical and adjuvant therapies for women aged >= 70 years with early-stage hormone-positive breast cancer compared with historical patterns, with >= 71% omission of both SLNB and adjuvant RT in patients managed according to an institutional quality improvement initiative.

TI  - Static FT imaging spectrometer based on a modified waveguide MZI array
T2  - OPTICS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We proposed a large aperture push-broom static Fourier transform (FT) imaging spectrometer for hyper-spectral imaging. The spectroscopic system was based on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform, consisting of spot size converters, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) array, and a detector array. The arm length differences of the 201 MZI arrays are linearly varied. It is one on-chip FT spectrometer operating in a large spectral range from 1100 to 1700 nm with a resolution of 24 cm(-1) and small foot print (chip size: 11 mm x 15 mm). The waveguide-MZI-based large aperture push-broom FT spectrometer can provide a compact solution for high spectral resolution remote sensing in both the fore-optic lens and the spectroscopic system.

T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - This work compared the collection 6 MODIS aerosol optical depth products with sun photometer data from AERONET, and evaluated the applicability of C6 merged data in the northwest of China. The spatio-temporal variation characteristics and influencing factors of AOD over northwest of China were analyzed by MODIS/AQUA C6 MYD08-M3 products from 2006 to 2015, and the results showed that Southern Xinjiang and Guanzhong region of Shanxi province had relatively high AOD, whereas the south of Qinghai and Gansu province had low values; Junggar Basin was the incremental area of AOD for the first 5 years and second 5 years, whereas converse result existed in Qaidam Basin and Hetao area. Temporally, the yearly mean AOD ranged from 0.18 to 0.22, and the declined trend occurred in 2011, and the annual decrease rate was about 0.32%; Because of different intensity and frequency of dust weather, the south of Xinjiang showed a significant interannual variation characteristic; East of the northwest displayed an obviously declining trend from 2011 to 2015, and the yearly mean decrease was about 1.1%. The AOD in north of Xinjiang and Qinghai-Tibet remained stable. The seasonal changes of AOD among different areas over the northwest had the same trend, all gradually declined from spring to autumn, and increased in winter.

TI  - Circulation of DENV2 and DENV4 in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes from Praia, Santiago Island, Cabo Verde
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses, such as Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika (ZIKV), pose a challenge to public health, due to their worldwide distribution and large-scale outbreaks. Dengue fever is currently one of the most important diseases and it is caused by four serotypes of DENV and is mainly transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. It is estimated that 50-100 million cases are reported every year worldwide. More recently, CHIKV and ZIKV, which are also transmitted by Ae. aegypti, have caused epidemics in countries in the Caribbean region, the Pacific region, and Americas. Cabo Verde faced its first dengue outbreak in 2009, with more than 21,000 reported cases and four registered deaths. The epidemic was caused by DENV-3 transmitted by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. In addition, the country faced a Zika outbreak with more than 7,500 notified cases from October 2015 to May 2016. In the present study, we conducted a survey in mosquito samples to detect arboviruses circulating in the local vector population. Collections were performed from November 2014 to January 2015, in the City of Praia, the capital of Cabo Verde, using aspirators and BG-sentinel traps. Samples were examined by multiplex Reverse Transcription-polymerase chain reaction. A total of 161 Ae. aegypti adult females were analyzed (34 pools) and from these samples, eight pools were found positive for DENV-2 and DENV-4. Our results revealed a very high natural infection rate in the vector population and showed two different serotypes co-circulating in the island that differ from the one detected in the 2009 outbreak in Cabo Verde.

TI  - Retrieving Precise Three-Dimensional Deformation on the 2014 M6.0 South Napa Earthquake by Joint Inversion of Multi-Sensor SAR
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We reconstructed the three-dimensional (3D) surface displacement field of the 24 August 2014 M6.0 South Napa earthquake using SAR data from the Italian Space Agency's COSMO-SkyMed and the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1A satellites. Along-track and cross-track displacements produced with conventional SAR interferometry (InSAR) and multiple-aperture SAR interferometry (MAI) techniques were integrated to retrieve the east, north, and up components of surface deformation. The resulting 3D displacement maps clearly delineated the right-lateral shear motion of the fault rupture with a maximum surface displacement of approximately 45 cm along the fault's strike, showing the east and north components of the trace particularly clearly. These maps also suggested a betterconstrained model for the South Napa earthquake. We determined a strike of approximately 338 and dip of 85 by applying the Okada dislocation model considering a single patch with a homogeneous slip motion. Using the distributed slip model obtained by a linear solution, we estimated that a peak slip of approximately 1.7 m occurred around 4 km depth from the surface. 3D modelling using the retrieved 3D maps helps clarify the fault's nature and thus characterize its behaviour.

TI  - Arctic regional methane fluxes by ecotope as derived using eddy covariance from a low-flying aircraft
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic terrestrial and sub-sea permafrost region contains approximately 30% of the global carbon stock, and therefore understanding Arctic methane emissions and how they might change with a changing climate is important for quantifying the global methane budget and understanding its growth in the atmosphere. Here we present measurements from a new in situ flux observation system designed for use on a small, low-flying aircraft that was deployed over the North Slope of Alaska during August 2013. The system combines a small methane instrument based on integrated cavity output spectroscopy (ICOS) with an air turbulence probe to calculate methane fluxes based on eddy covariance. We group surface fluxes by land class using a map based on LandSat Thematic Mapper (TM) data with 30m resolution. We find that wet sedge areas dominate the methane fluxes with a mean flux of 2.1 mu gm(-2) s(-1) during the first part of August. Methane emissions from the Sagavanirktok River have the second highest at almost 1 mu gm(-2) s(-1). During the second half of August, after soil temperatures had cooled by 7 degrees C, methane emissions fell to between 0 and 0.5 mu gm(-2) s(-1) for all areas measured. We compare the aircraft measurements with an eddy covariance flux tower located in a wet sedge area and show that the two measurements agree quantitatively when the footprints of both overlap. However, fluxes from sedge vary at times by a factor of 2 or more even within a few kilometers of the tower demonstrating the importance of making regional measurements to map out methane emissions spatial heterogeneity. Aircraft measurements of surface flux can play an important role in bridging the gap between ground-based measurements and regional measurements from remote sensing instruments and models.

TI  - The importance of accurate glacier albedo for estimates of surface mass balance on Vatnajokull: evaluating the surface energy budget in a regional climate model with automatic weather station observations
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A simulation of the surface climate of Vatnajokull ice cap, Iceland, carried out with the regional climate model HIRHAM5 for the period 1980-2014, is used to estimate the evolution of the glacier surface mass balance (SMB). This simulation uses a new snow albedo parameterization that allows albedo to exponentially decay with time and is surface temperature dependent. The albedo scheme utilizes a new background map of the ice albedo created from observed MODIS data. The simulation is evaluated against observed daily values of weather parameters from five automatic weather stations (AWSs) from the period 2001-2014, as well as in situ SMB measurements from the period 1995-2014. The model agrees well with observations at the AWS sites, albeit with a general underestimation of the net radiation. This is due to an underestimation of the incoming radiation and a general overestimation of the albedo. The average modelled albedo is overestimated in the ablation zone, which we attribute to an overestimation of the thickness of the snow layer and not taking the surface darkening from dirt and volcanic ash deposition during dust storms and volcanic eruptions into account. A comparison with the specific summer, winter, and net mass balance for the whole of Vatnajokull (1995-2014) shows a good overall fit during the summer, with a small mass balance underestimation of 0.04m w.e. on average, whereas the winter mass balance is overestimated by on average 0.5m w.e. due to too large precipitation at the highest areas of the ice cap. A simple correction of the accumulation at the highest points of the glacier reduces this to 0.15m w.e. Here, we use HIRHAM5 to simulate the evolution of the SMB of Vatnajokull for the period 1981-2014 and show that the model provides a reasonable representation of the SMB for this period. However, a major source of uncertainty in the representation of the SMB is the representation of the albedo, and processes currently not accounted for in RCMs, such as dust storms, are an important source of uncertainty in estimates of snow melt rate.

TI  - Climate drivers of the Amazon forest greening
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Our limited understanding of the climate controls on tropical forest seasonality is one of the biggest sources of uncertainty in modeling climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. Combining leaf production, litterfall and climate observations from satellite and ground data in the Amazon forest, we show that seasonal variation in leaf production is largely triggered by climate signals, specifically, insolation increase (70.4% of the total area) and precipitation increase (29.6%). Increase of insolation drives leaf growth in the absence of water limitation. For these non-water-limited forests, the simultaneous leaf flush occurs in a sufficient proportion of the trees to be observed from space. While tropical cycles are generally defined in terms of dry or wet season, we show that for a large part of Amazonia the increase in insolation triggers the visible progress of leaf growth, just like during spring in temperate forests. The dependence of leaf growth initiation on climate seasonality may result in a higher sensitivity of these ecosystems to changes in climate than previously thought.

TI  - Incorporating remote sensing-based ET estimates into the Community Land Model version 4.5
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface models bear substantial biases in simulating surface water and energy budgets despite the continuous development and improvement of model parameterizations. To reduce model biases, Parr et al. (2015) proposed a method incorporating satellite-based evapotranspiration (ET) products into land surface models. Here we apply this bias correction method to the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) and test its performance over the conterminous US (CONUS). We first calibrate a relationship between the observational ET from the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) product and the model ET from CLM4.5, and assume that this relationship holds beyond the calibration period. During the validation or application period, a simulation using the default CLM4.5 ("CLM") is conducted first, and its output is combined with the calibrated observational-vs.-model ET relationship to derive a corrected ET; an experiment ("CLMET") is then conducted in which the model-generated ET is overwritten with the corrected ET. Using the observations of ET, runoff, and soil moisture content as benchmarks, we demonstrate that CLMET greatly improves the hydrological simulations over most of the CONUS, and the improvement is stronger in the eastern CONUS than the western CONUS and is strongest over the Southeast CONUS. For any specific region, the degree of the improvement depends on whether the relationship between observational and model ET remains time-invariant a fundamental hypothesis of the Parr et al. (2015) method) and whether water is the limiting factor in places where ET is underestimated. While the bias correction method improves hydrological estimates without improving the physical parameterization of land surface models, results from this study do provide guidance for physically based model development effort.

TI  - Scale dependence of cirrus horizontal heterogeneity effects on TOA measurements - Part I: MODIS brightness temperatures in the thermal infrared
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a study on the impact of cirrus cloud heterogeneities on MODIS simulated thermal infrared (TIR) brightness temperatures (BTs) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) as a function of spatial resolution from 50m to 10 km. A realistic 3-D cirrus field is generated by the 3DCLOUD model (average optical thickness of 1.4, cloudtop and base altitudes at 10 and 12 km, respectively, consisting of aggregate column crystals of D-eff = 20 mu m), and 3-D thermal infrared radiative transfer (RT) is simulated with the 3DMCPOL code. According to previous studies, differences between 3-D BT computed from a heterogenous pixel and 1-D RT computed from a homogeneous pixel are considered dependent at nadir on two effects: (i) the optical thickness horizontal heterogeneity leading to the plane-parallel homogeneous bias (PPHB) and the (ii) horizontal radiative transport (HRT) leading to the independent pixel approximation error (IPAE). A single but realistic cirrus case is simulated and, as expected, the PPHB mainly impacts the low-spatial-resolution results (above similar to 250 m) with averaged values of up to 5-7 K, while the IPAE mainly impacts the high-spatial-resolution results (below similar to 250 m) with average values of up to 1-2 K. A sensitivity study has been performed in order to extend these results to various cirrus optical thicknesses and heterogeneities by sampling the cirrus in several ranges of parameters. For four optical thickness classes and four optical heterogeneity classes, we have found that, for nadir observations, the spatial resolution at which the combination of PPHB and HRT effects is the smallest, falls between 100 and 250 m. These spatial resolutions thus appear to be the best choice to retrieve cirrus optical properties with the smallest cloud heterogeneity-related total bias in the thermal infrared. For off-nadir observations, the average total effect is increased and the minimum is shifted to coarser spatial resolutions.

TI  - Pertussis surveillance and control: exploring variations and delays in testing, laboratory diagnostics and public health service notifications, the Netherlands, 2010 to 2013
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pertussis is most severe among unvaccinated infants (<1 year of age), and still leads to several reported deaths in the Netherlands every year. In order to avoid pertussis-related infant morbidity and mortality, pertussis surveillance data are used to guide pertussis control measures. However, more insight into the accuracy of pertussis surveillance and control, and into the range of healthcare and public health-related factors that impede this are needed. We analysed a unique combination of data sources from one Dutch region of 1.1 million residents, including data from laboratory databases and local public health notifications between 2010 and 2013. This large study (n = 12,090 pertussis tests) reveals possible misdiagnoses, substantial under-notification (18%,412/2,301 laboratory positive episodes) and a delay between patient symptoms and notification to the local public health services (median 34 days, interquartile range (IQR): 27-54). It is likely that the misdiagnoses, under-notification and overall delay in surveillance data are not unique to this area of the Netherlands, and are generalisable to other countries in Europe. In addition to preventive measures such as maternal immunisation, based on current findings, we further recommend greater adherence to testing guidelines, standardisation of test interpretation guidelines, use of automatic notification systems and earlier preventive measures.

TI  - Viral etiology, seasonality and severity of hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infections in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 2007-2014
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionLittle is known about the role of viral respiratory pathogens in the etiology, seasonality or severity of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.MethodsSentinel surveillance for SARI was conducted from December 2007 through February 2014 at 20 hospitals in Egypt, Jordan, Oman, Qatar and Yemen. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from hospitalized patients meeting SARI case definitions and were analyzed for infection with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (AdV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human parainfluenza virus types 1-3 (hPIV1-3). We analyzed surveillance data to calculate positivity rates for viral respiratory pathogens, describe the seasonality of those pathogens and determine which pathogens were responsible for more severe outcomes requiring ventilation and/or intensive care and/or resulting in death.ResultsAt least one viral respiratory pathogen was detected in 8,753/28,508 (30.7%) samples tested for at least one pathogen and 3,497/9,315 (37.5%) of samples tested for all pathogens-influenza in 3,345/28,438 (11.8%), RSV in 3,942/24,503 (16.1%), AdV in 923/9,402 (9.8%), hMPV in 617/9,384 (6.6%), hPIV1 in 159/9,402 (1.7%), hPIV2 in 85/9,402 (0.9%) and hPIV3 in 365/9,402 (3.9%). Multiple pathogens were identified in 501/9,316 (5.4%) participants tested for all pathogens. Monthly variation, indicating seasonal differences in levels of infection, was observed for all pathogens. Participants with hMPV infections and participants less than five years of age were significantly less likely than participants not infected with hMPV and those older than five years of age, respectively, to experience a severe outcome, while participants with a pre-existing chronic disease were at increased risk of a severe outcome, compared to those with no reported pre-existing chronic disease.ConclusionsViral respiratory pathogens are common among SARI patients in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Ongoing surveillance is important to monitor changes in the etiology, seasonality and severity of pathogens of interest.

TI  - A longitudinal MRI study on lymph nodes histiocytosis of a xenograft cancer model
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - \Background Efforts are continuously made to detect and investigate the pivotal processes and interplay between the response of sentinel lymph node and malignant cells from a primary tumor. Conversely, some frequently used tumor animal models, such as human cancer xenografts, rarely feature metastasis. Therefore, lymph node alterations are seldom assessed. We consider that studying lymph node response could contribute to the understanding of host reaction to cancer. In the present study, we explored the presence of regional lymph node alterations in parallel with tumor growth using a pancreatic tumor xenograft model which does not develop metastasis.Methods and findings We established an animal cancer model by the subcutaneous inoculation of PANC-1 (a metastatic human pancreatic cancer cell line) in the left upper flank of athymic nude mice. Tumor animals, along with controls (n=7 / group) were subjected to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in order to follow tumor growth and brachial and axillary lymph nodes alterations over several weeks. Further histological analyses were performed at the end of the study. The individual average of the different lymph nodes sizes was 15 - 40% larger in the tumor animals compared to control animals at week 8 to week 20. The tumor size and lymph node size were not correlated. Histological analysis of the lymph nodes showed paracortical histiocytosis. No metastasis to lymph nodes could be detected by histology. In tumor bearing animals, histiocytosis was associated with isolated apoptotic bodies and migration of human tumoral cells was confirmed by specific immunostaining of human origin markers.Conclusions The lack of metastasis as well as the pathological manifestation of the lymph node alteration in this pre-clinical model established here parallels findings in patients with sinus histiocytosis that is correlated with improved survival.

TI  - On the influence of zonal gravity wave distributions on the Southern Hemisphere winter circulation
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - A mechanistic global circulation model is used to simulate the Southern Hemisphere stratospheric, mesospheric, and lower thermospheric circulation during austral winter. The model includes a gravity wave (GW) parameterization that is initiated by prescribed 2-D fields of GW parameters in the troposphere. These are based on observations of GW potential energy calculated using GPS radio occultations and show enhanced GW activity east of the Andes and around the Antarctic. In order to detect the influence of an observation-based and thus realistic 2-D GW distribution on the middle atmosphere circulation, we perform model experiments with zonal mean and 2-D GW initialization, and additionally with and without forcing of stationary planetary waves (SPWs) at the lower boundary of the model. As a result, we find additional forcing of SPWs in the stratosphere, a weaker zonal wind jet in the mesosphere, cooling of the mesosphere and warming near the mesopause above the jet. SPW wavenumber 1 (SPW1) amplitudes are generally increased by about 10% when GWs are introduced being longitudinally dependent. However, at the upper part of the zonal wind jet, SPW1 in zonal wind and GW acceleration are out of phase, which reduces the amplitudes there.

TI  - Update of the Polar SWIFT model for polar stratospheric ozone loss (Polar SWIFT version 2)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Polar SWIFT model is a fast scheme for calculating the chemistry of stratospheric ozone depletion in polar winter. It is intended for use in global climate models (GCMs) and Earth system models (ESMs) to enable the simulation of mutual interactions between the ozone layer and climate. To date, climate models often use prescribed ozone fields, since a full stratospheric chemistry scheme is computationally very expensive. Polar SWIFT is based on a set of coupled differential equations, which simulate the polar vortex-averaged mixing ratios of the key species involved in polar ozone depletion on a given vertical level. These species are O-3, chemically active chlorine (ClOx), HCl, ClONO2 and HNO3. The only external input parameters that drive the model are the fraction of the polar vortex in sunlight and the fraction of the polar vortex below the temperatures necessary for the formation of polar stratospheric clouds. Here, we present an update of the Polar SWIFT model introducing several improvements over the original model formulation. In particular, the model is now trained on vortex-averaged reaction rates of the ATLAS Chemistry and Transport Model, which enables a detailed look at individual processes and an independent validation of the different parameterizations contained in the differential equations. The training of the original Polar SWIFT model was based on fitting complete model runs to satellite observations and did not allow for this. A revised formulation of the system of differential equations is developed, which closely fits vortexaveraged reaction rates from ATLAS that represent the main chemical processes influencing ozone. In addition, a parameterization for the HNO3 change by denitrification is included. The rates of change of the concentrations of the chemical species of the Polar SWIFT model are purely chemical rates of change in the new version, whereas in the original Polar SWIFT model, they included a transport effect caused by the original training on satellite data. Hence, the new version allows for an implementation into climate models in combination with an existing stratospheric transport scheme. Finally, the model is now formulated on several vertical levels encompassing the vertical range in which polar ozone depletion is observed. The results of the Polar SWIFT model are validated with independent Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) satellite observations and output from the original detailed chemistry model of ATLAS.

TI  - Characterization and productivity profiles of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (L.) breeding habitats across rural and urban landscapes in western and coastal Kenya
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Aedes aegypti, the principal vector for dengue and other emerging arboviruses, breeds preferentially in various man-made and natural container habitats. In the absence of vaccine, epidemiological surveillance and vector control remain the best practices for preventing dengue outbreaks. Effective vector control depends on a good understanding of larval and adult vector ecology of which little is known in Kenya. In the current study, we sought to characterize breeding habitats and establish container productivity profiles of Ae. aegypti in rural and urban sites in western and coastal Kenya.Methods: Twenty sentinel houses in each of four study sites (in western and coastal Kenya) were assessed for immature mosquito infestation once a month for a period of 24 months (June 2014 to May 2016). All water-holding containers in and around the households were inspected for Ae. aegypti larvae and pupae.Results: Collections were made from a total of 22,144 container visits: Chulaimbo (7575) and Kisumu (8003) in the west, and from Msambweni (3199) and Ukunda (3367) on the coast. Of these, only 4-5.6% were positive for Ae. aegypti immatures. In all four sites, significantly more positive containers were located outdoors than indoors. A total of 17,537 Ae. aegypti immatures were sampled from 10 container types. The most important habitat types were buckets, drums, tires, and pots, which produced over 75% of all the pupae. Key outdoor containers in the coast were buckets, drums and tires, which accounted for 82% of the pupae, while pots and tires were the only key containers in the western region producing 70% of the pupae. Drums, buckets and pots were the key indoor containers, producing nearly all of the pupae in the coastal sites. No pupae were collected indoors in the western region. The coastal region produced significantly more Ae. aegypti immatures than the western region both inside and outside the sentinel houses.Conclusions: These results indicate that productive Ae. aegypti larval habitats are abundant outdoors and that only a few containers produce a majority of the pupae. Although the numbers were lower, productive habitats were detected within households. Targeting source reduction efforts towards these productive containers both inside and outside homes is likely to be a cost-effective way to reduce arboviral transmission in these regions.

TI  - Chronotype variation drives night-time sentinel-like behaviour in hunter-gatherers
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sleep is essential for survival, yet it also represents a time of extreme vulnerability to predation, hostile conspecifics and environmental dangers. To reduce the risks of sleeping, the sentinel hypothesis proposes that group-living animals share the task of vigilance during sleep, with some individuals sleeping while others are awake. To investigate sentinel-like behaviour in sleeping humans, we investigated activity patterns at night among Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania. Using actigraphy, we discovered that all subjects were simultaneously scored as asleep for only 18 min in total over 20 days of observation, with a median of eight individuals awake throughout the night-time period; thus, one or more individuals was awake (or in light stages of sleep) during 99.8% of sampled epochs between when the first person went to sleep and the last person awoke. We show that this asynchrony in activity levels is produced by chronotype variation, and that chronotype covaries with age. Thus, asynchronous periods of wakefulness provide an opportunity for vigilance when sleeping in groups. We propose that throughout human evolution, sleeping groups composed of mixed age classes provided a form of vigilance. Chronotype variation and human sleep architecture (including nocturnal awakenings) in modern populations may therefore represent a legacy of natural selection acting in the past to reduce the dangers of sleep.

TI  - Hospital admission rates and emergency department use in relation to glycated hemoglobin in people with diabetes mellitus: a linkage study using electronic medical record and administrative data in Ontario.
T2  - CMAJ open
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) collects extensive data on primary care patients but it currently does not gather reliable information on outcomes in other settings. The objectives of this study were to link electronic medical record (EMR) data from Ontario patients in the CPCSSN with administrative data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), to assess the representativeness of the CPCSSN population, and to identify people with diabetes in the CPCSSN data and describe their emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions over a 2-year period (2010-2012) by HbA1c level.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study linking 2014 Ontario CPCSSN data with ICES administrative data and a retrospective cohort study using the 2014 data extraction linked with data from the Ontario health care registry, hospital discharge abstracts and a database of emergency department visits. Demographics of CPCSSN patients were compared with those of the Ontario population. Patients with a CPCSSN diagnosis of diabetes were compared by HbA1c category for ED visits, hospital admissions and diagnosis of diabetes-related complications.RESULTS: The linkage rate was 99%. We identified 12 358 patients with diabetes, 2356 of whom were missing data on HbAIc, for a final sample of 10 002. Patients with diabetes had a mean age of 64 years. Those with a higher HbA1c were younger, more likely to be male, had a lower income, had more comorbidities and were more likely to live in rural or suburban areas than patients with a lower HbA1c. Over the study period 31.8% of patients had 1 or more ED visits and 13.7% had a hospital admission for a diabetes-related complication. Patients with HbA1c greater than 8 had significantly more hospital admissions, ED visits and diabetes-related complications than patients with a lower HbA1c .INTERPRETATION: The linkage between EMR and administrative data was successful. In this study population, higher HbA1c values were associated with increased ED visits and hospital admissions, with an increasing gradient as HbA1c increased from less than 7% to greater than 8%.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial cancer is the most frequent tumor in the female reproductive system, while the sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for diagnostic efficacy of endometrial cancer is still controversial. This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic value of SLN in the assessment of lymph nodal involvement in endometrial cancer. Forty-four studies including 2,236 cases were identified. The pooled overall detection rate was 83% (95% CI: 80-86%). The pooled sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 87-95%). The bilateral pelvic node detection rate was 56% (95% CI: 48-64%). Use of indocyanine green (ICG) increased the overall detection rate to 93% (95% CI: 89-96%) and robotic-assisted surgery also increased the overall detection rate to 86% (95% CI: 79-93%). In summary, our meta-analysis provides strong evidence that sentinel node mapping is an accurate and feasible method that performs well diagnostically for the assessment of lymph nodal involvement in endometrial cancer. Cervical injection, robot-assisted surgery, as well as using ICG, optimized the sensitivity and detection rate of the technique. Sentinel lymph mapping may potentially leading to a greater utilization by gynecologic surgeons in the future.

TI  - River logjams cause frequent large-scale forest die-off events in southwestern Amazonia
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the dynamics of logjam-induced floods and alluvial deposition in the Bolivian Amazon and the effects these have on forest disturbance and recovery cycles. It expands on previous work by Gullison et al. (1996) who reported a case of catastrophic floods triggered by logjams in the Chimane Forest in the Bolivian Amazon. No further studies have followed up on this observation and no research has been published on the effects of large wood in tropical lowland rivers. The study is based on the analysis of a time series of Landsat imagery (1984-2016) and field evidence. Results show that logjam-induced floods are a major driver of forest disturbance along the Andean piedmont in the Bolivian Amazon. New logjams form on an almost yearly basis, always further upriver, until an avulsion takes place. Logjam-induced floods are characterized here by the sudden deposition of a thick sand layer and the death of forest in a V-shaped area. The Bolivian Amazon offers a unique opportunity for further research on how large wood affects river behavior in lowland tropical settings and how large and frequent forest disturbance events resulting from river logjams affect forest biodiversity and community successions.

TI  - Goats as sentinel hosts for the detection of tick-borne encephalitis risk areas in the Canton of Valais, Switzerland
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is an important tick-borne disease in Europe. Detection of the TBE virus (TBEV) in local populations of Ixodes ricinus ticks is the most reliable proof that a given area is at risk for TBE, but this approach is time-consuming and expensive. A cheaper and simpler approach is to use immunology-based methods to screen vertebrate hosts for TBEV-specific antibodies and subsequently test the tick populations at locations with seropositive animals.Results: The purpose of the present study was to use goats as sentinel animals to identify new risk areas for TBE in the canton of Valais in Switzerland. A total of 4114 individual goat sera were screened for TBEV-specific antibodies using immunological methods. According to our ELISA assay, 175 goat sera reacted strongly with TBEV antigen, resulting in a seroprevalence rate of 4.3%. The serum neutralization test confirmed that 70 of the 173 ELISA-positive sera had neutralizing antibodies against TBEV. Most of the 26 seropositive goat flocks were detected in the known risk areas in the canton of Valais, with some spread into the connecting valley of Saas and to the east of the town of Brig. One seropositive site was 60 km to the west of the known TBEV-endemic area. At two of the three locations where goats were seropositive, the local tick populations also tested positive for TBEV.Conclusion: The combined approach of screening vertebrate hosts for TBEV-specific antibodies followed by testing the local tick population for TBEV allowed us to detect two new TBEV foci in the canton of Valais. The present study showed that goats are useful sentinel animals for the detection of new TBEV risk areas.

TI  - Global evaluation of gross primary productivity in the JULES land surface model v3.4.1
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the ability of the JULES land surface model (LSM) to simulate gross primary productivity (GPP) on regional and global scales for 2001-2010. Model simulations, performed at various spatial resolutions and driven with a variety of meteorological datasets (WFDEI-GPCC, WFDEI-CRU and PRINCETON), were compared to the MODIS GPP product, spatially gridded estimates of upscaled GPP from the FLUXNET network (FLUXNET-MTE) and the CARDAMOM terrestrial carbon cycle analysis. Firstly, when JULES was driven with the WFDEI-GPCC dataset (at 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution), the annual average global GPP simulated by JULES for 2001-2010 was higher than the observation-based estimates (MODIS and FLUXNET-MTE), by 25 and 8 %, respectively, and CARDAMOM estimates by 23 %. JULES was able to simulate the standard deviation of monthly GPP fluxes compared to CARDAMOM and the observation-based estimates on global scales. Secondly, GPP simulated by JULES for various biomes (forests, grasslands and shrubs) on global and regional scales were compared. Differences among JULES, MODIS, FLUXNET-MTE and CARDAMOM on global scales were due to differences in simulated GPP in the tropics. Thirdly, it was shown that spatial resolution (0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees, 1 degrees x 1 degrees and 2 degrees x 2 degrees) had little impact on simulated GPP on these large scales, with global GPP ranging from 140 to 142 PgCyear(-1). Finally, the sensitivity of JULES to meteorological driving data, a major source of model uncertainty, was examined. Estimates of annual average global GPP were higher when JULES was driven with the PRINCETON meteorological dataset than when driven with the WFDEI-GPCC dataset by 3 PgCyear(-1). On regional scales, differences between the two were observed, with the WFDEI-GPCC-driven model simulations estimating higher GPP in the tropics (5 degrees N-5 degrees S) and the PRINCETON-driven model simulations estimating higher GPP in the extratropics (30-60 degrees N).

TI  - Assimilation of snow cover and snow depth into a snow model to estimate snow water equivalent and snowmelt runoff in a Himalayan catchment
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is an important component of water storage in the Himalayas. Previous snowmelt studies in the Himalayas have predominantly relied on remotely sensed snow cover. However, snow cover data provide no direct information on the actual amount of water stored in a snowpack, i.e., the snow water equivalent (SWE). Therefore, in this study remotely sensed snow cover was combined with in situ observations and a modified version of the seNorge snow model to estimate (climate sensitivity of) SWE and snowmelt runoff in the Langtang catchment in Nepal. Snow cover data from Landsat 8 and the MOD10A2 snow cover product were validated with in situ snow cover observations provided by surface temperature and snow depth measurements resulting in classification accuracies of 85.7 and 83.1% respectively. Optimal model parameter values were obtained through data assimilation of MOD10A2 snow maps and snow depth measurements using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Independent validations of simulated snow depth and snow cover with observations show improvement after data assimilation compared to simulations without data assimilation. The approach of modeling snow depth in a Kalman filter framework allows for data-constrained estimation of snow depth rather than snow cover alone, and this has great potential for future studies in complex terrain, especially in the Himalayas. Climate sensitivity tests with the optimized snow model re-vealed that snowmelt runoff increases in winter and the early melt season (December to May) and decreases during the late melt season (June to September) as a result of the earlier onset of snowmelt due to increasing temperature. At high elevation a decrease in SWE due to higher air temperature is (partly) compensated by an increase in precipitation, which emphasizes the need for accurate predictions on the changes in the spatial distribution of precipitation along with changes in temperature.

T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Primary aim of our study was to assess the impact of timing of sentinel node procedure, pre-versus post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, on final pathologic node-negative rate (pN0) in patients with clinically node-negative (cN0) breast cancer. Secondary endpoint was the usability of the sentinel node procedure in patients with clinically node-positive disease that converted to cN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Patients and Methods: Patients were enrolled in two sequentially conducted Dutch phase III trials, studying the impact of two neoadjuvant chemotherapy schedules and use of zoledronic acid on complete pathologic response rate. For the present analyses, patients were excluded if they had not undergone surgical axillary staging.Results: In total 439 patients were included, of whom 230 (52%) had pretreatment cN0. In this group, pN0 status was seen in 58% (N = 23) of patients with a sentinel node biopsy post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to 51% (N = 83) pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including the axillary lymph node dissection whenever performed. In multivariable analysis, timing of sentinel node procedure (pre-versus post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy) was, however, not significantly associated with final pN0/pN0(i+) status, with an odds ratio of 1.18 (95% CI 0.64-2.18) after correction for age, clinical tumor status, histology, grade, hormone-and HER2 receptor. Of patients with clinically node-positive disease only 15% had a final pN0 status, with a false-negative rate of the sentinel node of 30%.Conclusion: In breast cancer patients with cN0 disease, sentinel node procedure performed post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy led to nodal down staging, although not statistically significant after multivariate correction for patient and tumor characteristics.

TI  - Estimation and validation of actual evapotranspiration for wheat crop using SEBAL model over Hisar district, Haryana, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the complex, but essential components of the hydrologic cycle. Advances in remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS) have enabled us to estimate ET spatially. In the present study, both, RS and GIS tools have been utilized to estimate the actual crop ET by surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) model using high spatial resolution satellite image Landsat7 ETM+ for Hisar district, Haryana in north India. Previously calibrated and validated SEBAL model with lysimeter data within the same agroclimatic zone were used in the study. Derived actual ET from lysimeter data validated SEBAL method was again validated using Penman-Montieth (PM) method for the study area located in the same agro-climatic zone. Based on the primary and secondary data analysis, it can be inferred that SEBAL ET is the best spatial ET estimation model for Hisar district or regions having similar agro-climatic conditions. Validation of SEBAL ET with ground-observed lysimeter data showed high coefficient of correlation (R-2 = 0.91). Validation using the PM method also showed high coefficient of correlation (R-2 = 0.835). Other statistical parameters (RMSE = 0.583, NRMSE = 0.236) also showed good agreement between actual SEBAL ETc and PM ETc (crop evapotranspiration). It was also found that any prior knowledge about the crops, their types and cropping seasons is not required for the estimation of actual ET by SEBAL model.

TI  - The MSG-SEVIRI-based cloud property data record CLAAS-2
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds play a central role in the Earth's atmosphere, and satellite observations are crucial for monitoring clouds and understanding their impact on the energy budget and water cycle. Within the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF), a new cloud property data record was derived from geostationary Meteosat Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) measurements for the time frame 2004-2015. The resulting CLAAS-2 (CLoud property dAtAset using SEVIRI, Edition 2) data record is publicly available via the CM SAF website (https://doi.org/10.5676/EUM_SAF_CM/CLAAS/V002). In this paper we present an extensive evaluation of the CLAAS-2 cloud products, which include cloud fractional coverage, thermodynamic phase, cloud top properties, liquid/ice cloud water path and corresponding optical thickness and particle effective radius. Data validation and comparisons were performed on both level 2 (native SEVIRI grid and repeat cycle) and level 3 (daily and monthly averages and histograms) with reference datasets derived from lidar, microwave and passive imager measurements. The evaluation results show very good overall agreement with matching spatial distributions and temporal variability and small biases attributed mainly to differences in sensor characteristics, retrieval approaches, spatial and temporal samplings and viewing geometries. No major discrepancies were found. Underpinned by the good evaluation results, CLAAS-2 demonstrates that it is fit for the envisaged applications, such as process studies of the diurnal cycle of clouds and the evaluation of regional climate models. The data record is planned to be extended and updated in the future.

TI  - Assimilating moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer radiance with the weather research and forecasting data assimilation system
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model relies on the accuracy of the initial field provided by data assimilation. The initial field usually contains large uncertainties, especially for regions where observations are sparse or lacking. Assimilating additional observations is an efficient way to reduce this uncertainty. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) is one of the most critical data sources of various indirect assimilating applications due to its wide swath and remarkable quality. Therefore, assimilating MODIS data into WRF data assimilation (WRFDA) system is meaningful to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts. This study developed a module to directly assimilate the MODIS radiances into the WRFDA based on the 3-D variational data assimilation method and community radiative transfer model. An assimilation experiment was carried out on August 2014, from which the background field has been relatively improved. Specifically, the improvement of the temperature, humidity, and wind speed at the near surface layer is about 0.2 degrees C, 1.2%, and 0.2 m/s, respectively. Additional capabilities and increased potential of MODIS data assimilation based on WRFDA need to be further investigated and tested under various conditions and applications.

TI  - Porcine Urinary Bladder Matrix for Management of Infected Radiation Mastectomy Wound.
T2  - Cureus
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - We present a case report on the successful healing of a Pseudomonas infection wound in a 52-year-old female with morbid obesity, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus and a history oftobacco use, who presented with Stage IIIA (T3, N2, Mo) infiltrating ductal carcinoma. The patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to her bilateral skin-sparing total mastectomies with right axillary sentinel lymphadenectomy. She also had staged reconstruction with temporary breast implants and plans fordeep inferior epigastric perforator flaps. Two months after chest wall and regional nodal radiation therapy, she developed a marked soft tissue reaction to radiation. She underwent over 10 right chest wall open wound radical debridements resulting in a tissue defect of 25 cm in length, by 20 cm in width, by 10 cm in depth. Despite surgical debridement, intravenous antibiotics, hyperbaric oxygen therapy,colistin spray therapy, and heat lamp therapy, the infection failed to resolve and the wound failed to heal. She was left with an open wound that was extremely painful and required chronic pain management with opioids. The patient later was found to have developed a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas infection in her wound. However, the experimental placement of a porcine bladder matrix (ACell©, Inc., Columbia, MD) on the woundresulted in the complete relief of pain just three days after the application of the product.

TI  - Middle to late Holocene paleochannels and migration of the Palar River, Tamil Nadu: Implications of neotectonic activity
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Geomorphic, tectonic and sedimentary investigations have been carried out to understand the landscape evolution of the Palar River basin, Southern Peninsular India. For this purpose, satellite data interpretations coupled with field investigations, fluvial architecture and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating methods were adopted to infer climatic variations and neotectonic deformation that took place during the mid to late Holocene period. Several paleochannels have been identified in the Northern part of the present day Palar River. The distribution pattern of the Palar paleochannels and its present course indicate its migration towards the south, leaving behind the old Palar River streams as paleochannels. Significant changes in the morphological characteristics, channel width and river pattern in the successive paleochannels reveal evidences of channel movement by avulsion largely controlled by reactivation of pre-existing lineaments and intensified NE monsoon. Based on OSL ages, two major phases of migration have been identified that occurred between 4.83 ka to 1.88 ka. First phase occurred between 3.59 ka to 3.26 ka due to intensified monsoon accompanied with small scale neotectonic activity. The second phase took place between 2.42 ka to 1.88 ka which occurred probably due to the rapid upstream avulsion. This rapid avulsion is due to the close proximity of MPA and the reactivation of the pre-existing lineaments. Moreover, the present Palar River basin exhibits evidences of neotectonic activity such as soft sediment deformation structures, anomalous drainage deflections and reactivation of lineaments and faults further indicating that the Palar River is still draining a tectonically active region. Thus, neotctonics and fluctuations in the intensity of monsoon are largely responsible for sculpting the present landscape. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

TI  - Drainage after Modified Radical Mastectomy - A Methodological Mini-Review.
T2  - Cureus
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is a socially relevant group of malignant conditions of the mammary gland, affecting both males and females. Most commonly the surgical approach of choice is a modified radical mastectomy (MRM), due to it allowing for both the removal of the main tumor mass and adjacent glandular tissue, which are suspected of infiltration and multifocality of the process, and a sentinel axillary lymph node removal. Most commonpost-surgical complications following MRM are the formation of a hematoma, the infection of the surgical wound and the formation of a seroma. Thesepost-surgical complications can, at least in part, be attributed to the drainage of the surgical wound. However, the lack of modern and official guidelines provides an ample scope for innovation, but also leads to a need for a randomized comparison of the results. We compared different approaches to wound drainage after MRM, reviewed based on the armamentarium, number of drains, location, type of drainage system, timing of drain removal and no drainage alternatives. Currently, based on the general results, scientific and comparative discussions, seemingly the most affordable methodology with the best patient outcome, with regards to hospital stay and post-operative complications, is the placement of one medial to lateral (pectoro-axillary) drain with low negative pressure. Ideally, the drain should be removed on the second or third postoperative day or when the amount of drained fluid in the last 24 hours reaches below 50 milliliters.

TI  - Variation of sentinel lymphatic channels (SLCs) and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) assessed by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in breast cancer patients
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of detecting the variation of sentinel lymphatic channels (SLCs) and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in breast cancer patients using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).Methods: A total of 46 breast cancer patients were prospectively recruited in the study. All the participants received intradermal and peritumoral injection of microbubbles as contrast agent, and SLCs and SLNs were assessed preoperatively. Blue dye was injected subareolarly and peritumorally during the surgery. The SLNs detected by CEUS and blue dye were sent to the pathology laboratory for histopathological analysis.Results: At least one SLC and SLN were detected by CEUS in all 46 cases. Three types of SLCs were detected, including superficial sentinel lymphatic channels (SSLCs), penetrating sentinel lymphatic channels (PSLCs), and deep sentinel lymphatic channels (DSLCs). Five lymphatic drainage patterns (LDPs) were found, including SSLC, PSLC, SSLC + PSLC, SSLC + DSLC, and SSLC + PSLC + DSLC. Only SSLC was detected on CEUS in 24 cases; only PSLC was detected in 3 cases; both SSLC and PSLC were detected in 8 cases; both SSLC and DSLC were detected in 7 cases; SSLC, PSLC, and DSLC were all detected in the remaining 4 cases. An actual LDP was defined on the combination of CEUS and dissection of the specimen. The accuracy rate of CEUS was 43/46. Interestingly, a bifurcated SLC was found in 8 patients. In 3 patients, a discontinuous SLC and non-enhanced SLN were found by CEUS. Also, no dyed SLNs were detected during the surgery. The axillary lymph nodes turned out tumor involved histologically.Conclusion: CEUS is feasible to assess the variation of SLCs and SLNs preoperatively in breast cancer patients. SLNB is not suggested when a discontinuous SLC and non-enhanced SLN were detected by CEUS.

With the aim of promoting its notification in Navarre, the Sentinel Program was incorporated in 2013 and, with this study, we seek to verify its efficacy.Methods: The study population were voice professionals reported for dysphonia as sentinel events during the years 2013 to 2015 in Navarre. Its effectiveness was validated by the cumulative incidence of 100,000 workers for each of the years and Positive Predictive Value as an indicator of suspicion. The declaration was verified as an occupational disease.Results: In the period April 2013 to December, 110 cases were reported, 71 nominal and 39 non-nominal. The annual incidence increased from 9.0 cases per 100,000 to 13.4. Of the cases investigated, 63 were women and 8 men. The mean age was 40.8 years (38.5-43.1 95% CI). 58 cases (81.7%) corresponded to teachers. In 22 of the 71 nodules (31%) and 9 coincidences were notified as an occupational disease. We found a greater presence of nodules in professionals with extra work use of voice (OR 4.2 IC 1.3-14.3) and better evolution of pathologies other than VN (OR = 2.5 CI 1.1-5.8). The suspicion was confirmed as occupational in 54 cases (positive predictive value 76.1%).Conclusion: The centinel program is effective in reporting dysphonia although it is important to highlight the low declaration as occupational disease of the cases detected.

AB  - OBJETIVO: De las lesiones producidas por el uso profesional de la voz, los nodulos de cuerdas vocales (NCV) se reconocen en Espana como enfermedad profesional desde el ano 2007. Con el objetivo de fomentar su notificacion en Navarra se incorporaron en el ano 2013 al sistema centinela del Instituto de Salud Publica y Laboral de Navarra (ISPLN) las disfonias en personas con uso profesional de la voz. El objetivo de este estudio fue comprobar la eficacia de este programa.METODOS: La poblacion a estudio fueron los profesionales de la voz notificados por disfonia como sucesos centinela durante los anos 2013 al 2015 en Navarra. Se valido la eficacia del sistema mediante el calculo de la incidencia acumulada por 100.000 trabajadores para cada uno de los anos y el valor predictivo positivo como indicador de sospecha. Se comprobo la declaracion como enfermedad profesional.RESULTADOS: En el periodo abril 2013 diciembre 2015 se notificaron 110 casos, 71 nominales y 39 no nominales. La incidencia anual se incremento de 9,0 casos por 100.000 a 13,4. De los casos nominales, 63 fueron mujeres y 8 hombres. La media de edad fue 40,8 anos (38,5-43,1 IC 95%). 58 casos (81,7%) correspondieron a docentes. En 22 de los 71 casos se diagnosticaron nodulos (31%) y hubo 9 casos con partes de enfermedad profesional. Encontramos mayor presencia de nodulos en profesionales con uso extralaboral de la voz (OR 4,2 IC 1,3-14,3) y mejor evolucion de las patologias diferentes a NCV (OR=2,5 IC 1,1-5,8). Se confirmo la sospecha como laboral en 54 casos (Valor Predictivo Positivo 76,1%).CONCLUSIONES: El sistema centinela es eficaz para la notificacion de disfonias, aunque es importante destacar la baja declaracion como enfermedad profesional de los casos detectados.

TI  - Improving the Xin'anjiang hydrological model based on mass-energy balance
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Conceptual hydrological models are preferable for real-time flood forecasting, among which the Xin'anjiang (XAJ) model has been widely applied in humid and semi-humid regions of China. Although the relatively simple mass balance scheme ensures a good performance of runoff simulation during flood events, the model still has some defects. Previous studies have confirmed the importance of evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture content (SMC) in runoff simulation. In order to add more constraints to the original XAJ model, an energy balance scheme suitable for the XAJ model was developed and coupled with the original mass balance scheme of the XAJ model. The detailed parameterizations of the improved model, XAJ-EB, are presented in the first part of this paper. XAJ-EB employs various meteorological forcing and remote sensing data as input, simulating ET and runoff yield using a more physically based mass-energy balance scheme. In particular, the energy balance is solved by determining the representative equilibrium temperature (RET), which is comparable to land surface temperature (LST). The XAJ-EB was evaluated in the Lushui catchment situated in the middle reach of the Yangtze River basin for the period between 2004 and 2007. Validation using ground-measured runoff data proves that the XAJ-EB is capable of reproducing runoff comparable to the original XAJ model. Additionally, RET simulated by XAJ-EB agreed well with moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-retrieved LST, which further confirms that the model is able to simulate the mass-energy balance since LST reflects the interactions among various processes. The validation results prove that the XAJ-EB model has superior performance compared with the XAJ model and also extends its applicability.

TI  - Evaluation of ACCMIP ozone simulations and ozonesonde sampling biases using a satellite-based multi-constituent chemical reanalysis
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atmospheric Chemistry Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP) ensemble ozone simulations for the present day from the 2000 decade simulation results are evaluated by a state-of-the-art multi-constituent atmospheric chemical reanalysis that ingests multiple satellite data including the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) for 2005-2009. Validation of the chemical reanalysis against global ozonesondes shows good agreement throughout the free troposphere and lower stratosphere for both seasonal and year-to-year variations, with an annual mean bias of less than 0.9 ppb in the middle and upper troposphere at the tropics and midlatitudes. The reanalysis provides comprehensive spatiotemporal evaluation of chemistry-model performance that compliments direct ozonesonde comparisons, which are shown to suffer from significant sampling bias. The reanalysis reveals that the ACCMIP ensemble mean overestimates ozone in the northern extratropics by 6-11 ppb while underestimating by up to 18 ppb in the southern tropics over the Atlantic in the lower troposphere. Most models underestimate the spatial variability of the annual mean lower tropospheric concentrations in the extratropics of both hemispheres by up to 70 %. The ensemble mean also overestimates the seasonal amplitude by 25-70% in the northern extratropics and overestimates the inter-hemispheric gradient by about 30% in the lower and middle troposphere. A part of the discrepancies can be attributed to the 5-year reanalysis data for the decadal model simulations. However, these differences are less evident with the current sonde network. To estimate ozonesonde sampling biases, we computed model bias separately for global coverage and the ozonesonde network. The ozonesonde sampling bias in the evaluated model bias for the seasonal mean concentration relative to global coverage is 40-50% over the western Pacific and east Indian Ocean and reaches 110% over the equatorial Americas and up to 80% for the global tropics. In contrast, the ozonesonde sampling bias is typically smaller than 30% for the Arctic regions in the lower and middle troposphere. These systematic biases have implications for ozone radiative forcing and the response of chemistry to climate that can be further quantified as the satellite observational record extends to multiple decades.

TI  - Design and implementation of a prototype head and neck phantom for the performance evaluation of gamma imaging systems
T2  - EJNMMI PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A prototype anthropomorphic head and neck phantom has been designed to simulate the adult head and neck anatomy including some internal organs and tissues of interest, such as thyroid gland and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). The design of the head and neck phantom includes an inner jig holding the simulated SLNs and thyroid gland. The thyroid gland structure was manufactured using three-dimensional (3D) printing taking into consideration the morphology and shape of a healthy adult thyroid gland.Result: The head and neck phantom was employed to simulate a situation where there are four SLNs distributed at two different vertical levels and at two depths within the neck. Contrast to noise ratio (CNR) calculations were performed for the detected SLNs at an 80 mm distance between both pinhole collimators (0.5 and 1. 0 mm diameters) and the surface of the head and neck phantom with a 100 s acquisition time. The recorded CNR values for the simulated SLNs are higher when the hybrid gamma camera (HGC) was fitted with the 1.0 mm diameter pinhole collimator. For instance, the recorded CNR values for the superficially simulated SLN (15 mm depth) containing 0.1 MBq of 99mTc using 0.5 and 1.0 mm diameter pinhole collimators are 6.48 and 16.42, respectively (similar to 87% difference). Gamma and hybrid optical images were acquired using the HGC for the simulated thyroid gland. The count profiles through the middle of the simulated thyroid gland images provided by both pinhole collimators were obtained. The HGC could clearly differentiate the individual peaks of both thyroid lobes in the gamma image produced by the 0.5-mm pinhole collimator. In contrast, the recorded count profile for the acquired image using the 1.0-mm-diameter pinhole collimator showed broader peaks for both lobes, reflecting the degradation of the spatial resolution with increasing the diameter of the pinhole collimator.Conclusions: This anthropomorphic head and neck phantom provides a valuable tool for assessing the imaging ability of gamma cameras used for imaging the head and neck region. The standardisation of test phantoms for SFOV gamma systems will provide an opportunity to collect data across various medical centres. The phantom described is cost effective, reproducible, flexible and anatomically representative.

TI  - Estimating daily surface NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations from satellite data - a case study over Hong Kong using land use regression models
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use regression (LUR) models have been used in epidemiology to determine the fine-scale spatial variation in air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in cities and larger regions. However, they are often limited in their temporal resolution, which may potentially be rectified by employing the synoptic coverage provided by satellite measurements. In this work a mixed-effects LUR model is developed to model daily surface NO2 concentrations over the Hong Kong SAR during the period 2005-2015. In situ measurements from the Hong Kong Air Quality Monitoring Network, along with tropospheric vertical column density (VCD) data from the OMI, GOME-2A, and SCIAMACHY satellite instruments were combined with fine-scale land use parameters to provide the spatiotemporal information necessary to predict daily surface concentrations. Cross-validation with the in situ data shows that the mixed-effects LUR model using OMI data has a high predictive power (adj. R-2 = 0.84), especially when compared with surface concentrations derived using the MACC-II reanalysis model dataset (adj. R-2 = 0.11). Time series analysis shows no statistically significant trend in NO2 concentrations during 2005-2015, despite a reported decline in NOx emissions. This study demonstrates the utility in combining satellite data with LUR models to derive daily maps of ambient surface NO2 for use in exposure studies.

TI  - Optimizing sentinel surveillance in temporal network epidemiology
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - To help health policy makers gain response time to mitigate infectious disease threats, it is essential to have an efficient epidemic surveillance. One common method of disease surveillance is to carefully select nodes (sentinels, or sensors) in the network to report outbreaks. One would like to choose sentinels so that they discover the outbreak as early as possible. The optimal choice of sentinels depends on the network structure. Studies have addressed this problem for static networks, but this is a first step study to explore designing surveillance systems for early detection on temporal networks. This paper is based on the idea that vaccination strategies can serve as a method to identify sentinels. The vaccination problem is a related question that is much more well studied for temporal networks. To assess the ability to detect epidemic outbreaks early, we calculate the time difference (lead time) between the surveillance set and whole population in reaching 1% prevalence. We find that the optimal selection of sentinels depends on both the network's temporal structures and the infection probability of the disease. We find that, for a mild infectious disease (low infection probability) on a temporal network in relation to potential disease spreading (the Prostitution network), the strategy of selecting latest contacts of random individuals provide the most amount of lead time. And for a more uniform, synthetic network with community structure the strategy of selecting frequent contacts of random individuals provide the most amount of lead time.

TI  - Tracing the influence of land-use change on water quality and coral reefs using a Bayesian model
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems can be degraded by poor water quality. Tracing the causes of poor water quality back to land-use change is necessary to target catchment management for coastal zone management. However, existing models for tracing the sources of pollution require extensive data-sets which are not available for many of the world's coral reef regions that may have severe water quality issues. Here we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model that uses freely available satellite data to infer the connection between land-uses in catchments and water clarity in coastal oceans. We apply the model to estimate the influence of land-use change on water clarity in Fiji. We tested the model's predictions against underwater surveys, finding that predictions of poor water quality are consistent with observations of high siltation and low coverage of sediment-sensitive coral genera. The model thus provides a means to link land-use change to declines in coastal water quality.

TI  - Combined Magnetomotive ultrasound, PET/CT, and MR imaging of <SUP>68</SUP>Ga-labelled superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in rat sentinel lymph nodes <i>in vivo</i>
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Current methods for intra-surgical guidance to localize metastases at cancer surgery are based on radioactive tracers that cause logistical challenges. We propose the use of a novel ultrasound-based method, magnetomotive ultrasound (MMUS) imaging that employ a nanoparticle-based contrast agent that also may be used for pre-operative PET/MRI imaging. Since MMUS is radiation free, this eliminates the dependence between pre-and intra-operative imaging and the radiation exposure for the surgical staff. This study investigates a hypothetical clinical scenario of pre-operative PET imaging, combined with intra-operative MMUS imaging, implemented in a sentinel lymph node (SLN) rat model. At one-hour post injection of Ga-68-labelled magnetic nanoparticles, six animals were imaged with combined PET/CT. After two or four days, the same animals were imaged with MMUS. In addition, ex-vivo MRI was used to evaluate the amount of nanoparticles in each single SLN. All SLNs were detectable by PET. Four out of six SLNs could be detected with MMUS, and for these MMUS and MRI measurements were in close agreement. The MRI measurements revealed that the two SLNs undetectable with MMUS contained the lowest nanoparticle concentrations. This study shows that MMUS can complement standard pre-operative imaging by providing bedside real-time images with high spatial resolution.

We also compare the epidemiology between human cases of high-and low-pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N9) (n = 51) in Guangdong. Case fatality and severity were similar. Touching sick or dead poultry was the most important risk factor for HPAI A(H7N9) infections and should be highlighted for the control of future influenza A(H7N9) epidemics.

TI  - A weekly Arctic sea-ice thickness data record from merged CryoSat-2 and SMOS satellite data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-ice thickness on a global scale is derived from different satellite sensors using independent retrieval methods. Due to the sensor and orbit characteristics, such satellite retrievals differ in spatial and temporal resolution as well as in the sensitivity to certain sea-ice types and thickness ranges. Satellite altimeters, such as CryoSat-2 (CS2), sense the height of the ice surface above the sea level, which can be converted into sea-ice thickness. Relative uncertainties associated with this method are large over thin ice regimes. Another retrieval method is based on the evaluation of surface brightness temperature (TB) in L-band microwave frequencies (1.4 GHz) with a thickness-dependent emission model, as measured by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. While the radiometer-based method looses sensitivity for thick sea ice (> 1 m), relative uncertainties over thin ice are significantly smaller than for the altimetry-based retrievals. In addition, the SMOS product provides global sea-ice coverage on a daily basis unlike the altimeter data. This study presents the first merged product of complementary weekly Arctic sea-ice thickness data records from the CS2 altimeter and SMOS radiometer. We use two merging approaches: a weighted mean (WM) and an optimal interpolation (OI) scheme. While the weighted mean leaves gaps between CS2 orbits, OI is used to produce weekly Arctic-wide sea-ice thickness fields. The benefit of the data merging is shown by a comparison with airborne electromagnetic (AEM) induction sounding measurements. When compared to airborne thickness data in the Barents Sea, the merged product has a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of about 0.7m less than the CS2 product and therefore demonstrates the capability to enhance the CS2 product in thin ice regimes. However, in mixed first-year (FYI) and multiyear (MYI) ice regimes as in the Beaufort Sea, the CS2 retrieval shows the lowest bias.

TI  - Enhancement of spectral quality of archival aerial photographs using satellite imagery for detection of land cover
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Archival aerial photographs are often the only reliable source of information about the area. However, these data are single-band data that do not allow unambiguous detection of particular forms of land cover. Thus, the authors of this article seek to develop a method of coloring panchromatic aerial photographs, which enable increasing the spectral information of such images. The study used data integration algorithms based on pansharpening, implemented in commonly used remote sensing programs: ERDAS, ENVI, and PCI. Aerial photos and Landsat multispectral data recorded in 1987 and 2016 were chosen. This study proposes the use of modified intensity-hue-saturation and Brovey methods. The use of these methods enabled the addition of red-green-blue (RGB) components to monochrome images, thus enhancing their interpretability and spectral quality. The limitations of the proposed method relate to the availability of RGB satellite imagery, the accuracy of mutual orientation of the aerial and the satellite data, and the imperfection of archival aerial photographs. Therefore, it should be expected that the results of coloring will not be perfect compared to the results of the fusion of recent data with a similar ground sampling resolution, but still, they will allow a more accurate and efficient classification of land cover registered on archival aerial photographs.

TI  - Investigating Rhone River plume (Gulf of Lions, France) dynamics using metrics analysis from the MERIS 300m Ocean Color archive (2002-2012)
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In coastal environments, river plumes are major transport mechanisms for particulate matter, nutriments and pollutants. Ocean color satellite imagery is a valuable tool to explore river turbid plume characteristics, providing observations at high temporal and spatial resolutions of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration over a long time period, covering a wide range of hydro-meteorological conditions. We propose here to use the MERIS-FR (300m) Ocean Color archive (2002-2012) in order to investigate Rhone River turbid plume patterns generated by the two main forcings acting on the north-eastern part of the Gulf of Lions (France): wind and river freshwater discharge. Results are exposed considering plume metrics (area of extension, south-east-westernmost points, shape, centroid, SPM concentrations) extracted from satellite data using an automated image-processing tool. Rhone River turbid plume SPM concentrations and area of extension are shown to be mainly driven by the river outflow while wind direction acts on its shape and orientation. This paper also presents the region of influence of the Rh delta ne River turbid plume over monthly and annual periods, and highlights its interannual variability.

TI  - Functional Freedom: A Psychological Model of Freedom in Decision-Making.
T2  - Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The freedom of a decision is not yet sufficiently described as a psychological variable. We present a model of functional decision freedom that aims to fill that role. The model conceptualizes functional freedom as a capacity of people that varies depending on certain conditions of a decision episode. It denotes an inner capability to consciously shape complex decisions according to one's own values and needs. Functional freedom depends on three compensatory dimensions: it is greatest when the decision-maker is highly rational, when the structure of the decision is highly underdetermined, and when the decision process is strongly based on conscious thought and reflection. We outline possible research questions, argue for psychological benefits of functional decision freedom, and explicate the model's implications on current knowledge and research. In conclusion, we show that functional freedom is a scientific variable, permitting an additional psychological foothold in research on freedom, and that is compatible with a deterministic worldview.

TI  - Spatial and seasonal distributions of frontal activity over the French continental shelf in the Bay of Biscay
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The frontal activity in coastal regions remains a research field where a large number of open questions needs to be addressed to quantify the potential impact of these processes on dependent systems (e.g. biogeochemical activity). Spatial and seasonal distributions of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fronts (similar to 1-100 km) in the vicinity of main French rivers, Gironde and Loire, are explored over the continental shelf North of 45 degrees N in the Bay of Biscay. A high resolution (1 km spatial and daily temporal resolutions) dataset of 11 years' (2003-2013) remotely sensed SST by MODIS sensor onboard Aqua and Terra satellites has been investigated and compared with coastal numerical model experiments. The detection and characterization fronts with fluctuating amplitudes is achieved through the Singularity Analysis (i.e. the process of calculating the degree of regularity or irregularity of a function at each point in a domain). Seasonality of frontal activity in the Bay of Biscay is then described based on the long-term satellite SST archive and coastal operational model simulations. The identified hot spots of higher frontal occurrences correspond on one hand to previously observed features (e.g. tidal fronts) but also reveal new features. These are investigated to identify fine-scale dynamical drivers. In winter, density fronts are prominent in a coastal strip where freshwater influence is important. In spring, this strip diminishes as plumes detach from the coast, while tidal fronts become apparent in other regions. In summer, tidal fronts in Ushant region and internal wave activity along the shelf break dominate. In autumn, coastal density fronts due to freshwater inputs reappear as these inputs increase, and reduced stratification causes a weakening of the Ushant and shelf break fronts. Additional information and an effort to dynamically interpret these fronts, based on a systematic investigation of the whole seasonal cycle and including modeling insights from coastal operational oceanography, complement the description of frontal activity in the Bay of Biscay.

TI  - Size-dependent validation of MODIS MCD64A1 burned area over six vegetation types in boreal Eurasia: Large underestimation in croplands
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollutants emitted from wildfires in boreal Eurasia can be transported to the Arctic, and their subsequent deposition could accelerate global warming. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD64A1 burned area product is the basis of fire emission products. However, uncertainties due to the "moderate resolution" (500 m) characteristic of the MODIS sensor could be introduced. Here, we present a size-dependent validation of MCD64A1 with reference to higher resolution (better than 30 m) satellite products (Landsat 7 ETM+, RapidEye, WorldView-2, and GeoEye-1) for six ecotypes over 12 regions of boreal Eurasia. We considered the 2012 boreal Eurasia burning season when severe wildfires occurred and when Arctic sea ice extent was historically low. Among the six ecotypes, we found MCD64A1 burned areas comprised only 13% of the reference products in croplands because of inadequate detection of small fires (<100 ha). Our results indicate that over all ecotypes, the actual burned area in boreal Eurasia (15,256 km(2)) could have been similar to 16% greater than suggested by MCD64A1 (13,187 km(2)) when applying the correction factors proposed in this study. This implies the effects of wildfire emissions in boreal Eurasia on Arctic warming could be greater than currently estimated.

TI  - Unmanned aerial system nadir reflectance and MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted surface reflectances intercompared over Greenland
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Albedo is a fundamental parameter in earth sciences, and many analyses utilize the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)/albedo (MCD43) algorithms. While derivative albedo products have been evaluated over Greenland, we present a novel, direct comparison with nadir surface reflectance collected from an unmanned aerial system (UAS). The UAS was flown from Summit, Greenland, on 210 km transects coincident with the MODIS sensor overpass on board the Aqua and Terra satellites on 5 and 6 August 2010. Clear-sky acquisitions were available from the overpasses within 2 h of the UAS flights. The UAS was equipped with upward-and downward-looking spectrometers (300-920 nm) with a spectral resolution of 10 nm, allowing for direct integration into the MODIS bands 1, 3, and 4. The data provide a unique opportunity to directly compare UAS nadir reflectance with the MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted surface reflectance (NBAR) products. The data show UAS measurements are slightly higher than the MODIS NBARs for all bands but agree within their stated uncertainties. Differences in variability are observed as expected due to different footprints of the platforms. The UAS data demonstrate potentially large sub-pixel variability of MODIS reflectance products and the potential to explore this variability using the UAS as a platform. It is also found that, even at the low elevations flown typically by a UAS, reflectance measurements may be influenced by haze if present at and/or below the flight altitude of the UAS. This impact could explain some differences between data from the two platforms and should be considered in any use of airborne platforms.

TI  - The Arctic-Subarctic sea ice system is entering a seasonal regime: Implications for future Arctic amplification
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss of Arctic sea ice is a conspicuous example of climate change. Climate models project ice-free conditions during summer this century under realistic emission scenarios, reflecting the increase in seasonality in ice cover. To quantify the increased seasonality in the Arctic-Subarctic sea ice system, we define a non-dimensional seasonality number for sea ice extent, area, and volume from satellite data and realistic coupled climate models. We show that the Arctic-Subarctic, i.e. the northern hemisphere, sea ice now exhibits similar levels of seasonality to the Antarctic, which is in a seasonal regime without significant change since satellite observations began in 1979. Realistic climate models suggest that this transition to the seasonal regime is being accompanied by a maximum in Arctic amplification, which is the faster warming of Arctic latitudes compared to the global mean, in the 2010s. The strong link points to a peak in sea-ice-related feedbacks that occurs long before the Arctic becomes ice-free in summer.

TI  - Sea-ice deformation in a coupled ocean-sea-ice model and in satellite remote sensing data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A realistic representation of sea-ice deformation in models is important for accurate simulation of the sea-ice mass balance. Simulated sea-ice deformation from numerical simulations with 4.5, 9, and 18 km horizontal grid spacing and a viscous-plastic (VP) sea-ice rheology are compared with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite observations (RGPS, RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System) for the time period 1996-2008. All three simulations can reproduce the large-scale ice deformation patterns, but small-scale sea-ice deformations and linear kinematic features (LKFs) are not adequately reproduced. The mean sea-ice total deformation rate is about 40% lower in all model solutions than in the satellite observations, especially in the seasonal sea-ice zone. A decrease in model grid spacing, however, produces a higher density and more localized ice deformation features. The 4.5 km simulation produces some linear kinematic features, but not with the right frequency. The dependence on length scale and probability density functions (PDFs) of absolute divergence and shear for all three model solutions show a power-law scaling behavior similar to RGPS observations, contrary to what was found in some previous studies. Overall, the 4.5 km simulation produces the most realistic divergence, vorticity, and shear when compared with RGPS data. This study provides an evaluation of high and coarse-resolution viscous-plastic sea-ice simulations based on spatial distribution, time series, and power-law scaling metrics.

TI  - Multi-source hydrological soil moisture state estimation using data fusion optimisation
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable estimation of hydrological soil moisture state is of critical importance in operational hydrology to improve the flood prediction and hydrological cycle description. Although there have been a number of soil moisture products, they cannot be directly used in hydrological modelling. This paper attempts for the first time to build a soil moisture product directly applicable to hydrology using multiple data sources retrieved from SAC-SMA (soil moisture), MODIS (land surface temperature), and SMOS (multi-angle brightness temperatures in H-V polarisations). The simple yet effective local linear regression model is applied for the data fusion purpose in the Pontiac catchment. Four schemes according to temporal availabilities of the data sources are developed, which are pre-assessed and best selected by using the well-proven feature selection algorithm gamma test. The hydrological accuracy of the produced soil moisture data is evaluated against the Xinanjiang hydrological model's soil moisture deficit simulation. The result shows that a superior performance is obtained from the scheme with the data inputs from all sources (NSE = 0.912, r = 0.960, RMSE = 0.007 m). Additionally, the final daily-available hydrological soil moisture product significantly increases the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency by almost 50% in comparison with the two most popular soil moisture products. The proposed method could be easily applied to other catchments and fields with high confidence. The misconception between the hydrological soil moisture state variable and the real-world soil moisture content, and the potential to build a global routine hydrological soil moisture product are discussed.

TI  - New perspective on spring vegetation phenology and global climate change based on Tibetan Plateau tree-ring data
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenological responses of vegetation to climate, in particular to the ongoing warming trend, have received much attention. However, divergent results from the analyses of remote sensing data have been obtained for the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the world's largest high-elevation region. This study provides a perspective on vegetation phenology shifts during 1960-2014, gained using an innovative approach based on a well-validated, process-based, tree-ring growth model that is independent of temporal changes in technical properties and image quality of remote sensing products. Twenty composite site chronologies were analyzed, comprising about 3,000 trees from forested areas across the TP. We found that the start of the growing season (SOS) has advanced, on average, by 0.28 d/y over the period 1960-2014. The end of the growing season (EOS) has been delayed, by an estimated 0.33 d/y during 1982-2014. No significant changes in SOS or EOS were observed during 1960-1981. April-June and August-September minimum temperatures are the main climatic drivers for SOS and EOS, respectively. An increase of 1 degrees C in April-June minimum temperature shifted the dates of xylem phenology by 6 to 7 d, lengthening the period of tree-ring formation. This study extends the chronology of TP phenology farther back in time and reconciles the disparate views on SOS derived from remote sensing data. Scaling up this analysis may improve understanding of climate change effects and related phenological and plant productivity on a global scale.

TI  - Detection of African swine fever virus in the tissues of asymptomatic pigs in smallholder farming systems along the Kenya-Uganda border: implications for transmission in endemic areas and ASF surveillance in East Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The persistence of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in endemic areas, with small-scale but regular outbreaks in domestic pigs, is not well understood. ASFV has not been detected using conventional diagnosis in these pigs or adjacent populations of resistant African wild pigs, that could act as potential carriers during the outbreaks. However, such data are crucial for the design of evidence-based control strategies. We conducted cross-sectional (1107 pigs) and longitudinal (100 pigs) monitoring of ASFV prevalence in local pigs in Kenya and Uganda. The horizontal survey revealed no evidence of ASFV in the serum or blood using either conventional or real-time PCR. One pig consistently tested positive using ELISA, but negative using PCR assays on blood. Interestingly, the isotype of the antibodies from this animal were strongly IgA biased relative to control domestic pigs and warthogs, suggesting a role for mucosal immunity. The tissues from this pig were positive by PCR following post-mortem. Internal organ tissues of 44 healthy pigs (28 sentinel pigs and 16 pigs from slaughter slabs) were tested with four different PCR assays; 15.9 % were positive for ASFV suggesting that healthy pigs carrying ASFV exist in the swine population in the study area. P72 and p54 genotyping of ASFV revealed very limited diversity: all were classified in genotype IX at both loci, as were virtually all viruses causing recent ASF outbreaks in the region. Our study suggests that carrier pigs may play a role in ASF disease outbreaks, although the triggers for outbreaks remain unclear and require further investigation. This study significantly increases scientific knowledge of the epidemiology of ASF in the field in Africa, which will contribute to the design of effective surveillance and control strategies.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Relatively little is known about the causes of landfire assembly in Golestan Province that are subject to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The present study investigated how the landfire hazard is influenced by the environmental and anthropogenic parameters in the fire-prone Hyrcanian forest. The MODIS hotspot data of the past 15 years were collected and analyzed in Golestan Province. The frequencies and distributions of landfires were investigated with 13 environmental and anthropogenic factors selected to construct landfire hazard maps by BLR and ANN methods. The comparison between MODIS active fire detections collected between 2000 and 2015 of the Golestan Province and landfire hazard areas, as predicted by the BLR and ANN, showed satisfactory results for ANN. The results of this study confirmed that anthropogenic variables were important predictors of landfire hazard and showed nonlinear relationships. Vegetation moisture, climate, and topography were also significant variables in the study area.

AB  - Forest is one of nature's mechanisms that sequester the carbon from the atmosphere and store it in its reservoirs. Carbon sequestration is a process of capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and storage by forestland to reduce the accumulation of it in the atmosphere. This process is essential to reduce the overheated of the earth that caused the climate change effects. This research introduces a geospatial application that can be used to estimate forest carbon sequestration. The aim of this research is to utilize remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) in estimating the carbon sequestration capacity in Taman Botani Negara. The objectives of this research are to extract vegetation index and associate parameters in carbon sequestration estimation from the Landsat TM data and subsequently, to estimate the net primary productivity (NPP) and carbon sequestration in Taman Botani Negara. Two satellite imageries of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) of years 2004 and 2006 were used to extract vegetation indices (i.e., Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Simple Ratio Vegetation Index (SRVI)) and suseuently to derive fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), absorbed incident photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and net primary production (NPP) estimation from the Landsat TM data. These vegetation indices were then included in GIS modelling operation to estimate carbon sequestration. The result revealed that the contribution between each factors thus, contributed to the final estimation of carbon sequestration. Even though the forest area were reduced from July 2004 to March 2006, the carbon sequestration increased from 6014.271 kg/ha to 6467.768 kg/ha respectively. This is due to the high NPP value in March 2006 compared to July 2004. This research concluded that the integration of RS and GIS can be utilized in estimating carbon sequestration in Taman Botani Negara and able to produce acceptable results using appropriate data and modeling methods.

TI  - Quarrying and its effect on vegetation cover for a sustainable development using high-resolution satellite image and GIS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Huge vegetal losses caused by unsustainable quarrying practices have limited the role played by vegetation cover in mitigating the global impact of climate change. There is a need for a holistic study that will employ remotely sensed data in GIS domain to determine the extent of the effect of quarrying activities on vegetation cover in the study area. The need for extraordinary details with high accuracy and enhanced imagery has necessitated the use of Geo-Eye-1 satellite imagery with 1-m resolution for 2015. The study was carried out in Ebonyi State where 27 quarry sites were studied in six local government areas where mining activities were operated. The study employed geographical information system, Garmin eTrex GPS receiver and global positioning system. Geographical information was processed using ArcGIS to map the patterns and extent of land use. The findings from the study showed that the visual interpretation of the satellite image confirmed that white patches on the imagery were areas affected by intensified quarrying activities. The very dark green colours were interpreted as forest with no observed human activities. The supervised classification of land use also showed that quarrying activities occupied 0.1% of the study area with a total of 402.855 ha of green cover lost in Ebonyi State due to quarrying operations. Quarrying practices have destroyed arable lands, economic trees and forests in the area. This implies that there is a need for policies to be enforced with strict adherence to sustainable quarrying guidelines and consistent monitoring.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In marble industry, it is of vital importance to determine the damaged discs on time to prevent possible industrial injuries. Therefore, in this study, it is proposed to classify the status of the cutting discs that are used while cutting the natural stones. To classify the deflections of the discs, 673 different experiments are performed. Cutting discs corresponding to four different damage classes (undamaged disc, less damaged disc, much damaged disc, and broken disc) are employed in the tests. Eight different parameters (cutting forces (F-x, F-y, F-z), noise, peripheral speed of the disc, current, voltage, power consumption) are measured and recorded in the experiments. For each experiment, mean values of different measured data are studied. Artificial neural networks are employed as classifiers. In the first stage, all of these mean values corresponding to eight parameters are selected as the input vectors of the artificial neural networks, whereas in the second stage, the dimension of input vector is decreased by leaving out the parameters one by one. In this stage, it is aimed to determine the most important parameter that caries much more information about the cutting process.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is one of the most devastating cancer types affecting women. For critical decision making regarding the fate of cancerous breast tissue, the assessment of axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement is required. However, such ALN involvement is difficult to predict without surgical intervention. Therefore, an easy predictive test using protein markers may be a desirable approach. In this study, we performed a whole proteome analysis to reveal the presence of a putative biomarker panel using primary breast tumor tissue. Materials and Methods: Proteins were extracted from tumor tissues and were subjected to two dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis. The resulting gel images were used for inter-gel spot comparisons using PDQuest Advance software. The paterns thus obtained were used for differentiating invasive tumor types from non-invasive ones. Results: The analysis of 2D gel images revealed the presence of 24 conserved protein spots whose intensities were moderately regulated high on the gels. Those protein spots were used to create a conserved 2D pattern spanning a pH range of 4 to 8.CONCLUSION: Protein spots generating a preserved model among pattern between primary breast cancer and its axillary lymph node indicated that a robust and highly reliable proteomic approach, e.g., 2DE may be used to differentiate metastatic forms of breast cancer from non-metastatic ones.

TI  - Aftershocks, groundwater changes and postseismic ground displacements related to pore pressure gradients: Insights from the 2012 Emilia-Romagna earthquake
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - During the 2012 Emilia-Romagna (Italy) seismic sequence, several time-dependent phenomena occurred, such as changes in the groundwater regime and chemistry, liquefaction, and postseismic ground displacements. Because time-dependent phenomena require time-dependent physical mechanisms, we interpreted such events as the result of the poroelastic response of the crust after the main shock. In our study, we performed a two-dimensional poroelastic numerical analysis calibrated with Cosmo-SkyMed interferometric data and measured piezometric levels in water wells. The simulation results are consistent with the observed postseismic ground displacement and water level changes. The simulations show that crustal volumetric changes induced by poroelastic relaxation and the afterslip along the main shock fault are both required to reproduce the amplitude (approximately 4 cm) and temporal evolution of the observed postseismic uplift. Poroelastic relaxation also affects the aftershock distribution. In fact, the aftershocks are correlated with the postseismic Coulomb stress evolution. In particular, a considerably higher fraction of aftershocks occurs when the evolving poroelastic Coulomb stress is positive. These findings highlight the need to perform calculations that adequately consider the time-dependent poroelastic effect when modeling postseismic scenarios, especially for forecasting the temporal and spatial evolution of stresses after a large earthquake. Failing to do so results in an overestimation of the afterslip and an inaccurate definition of stress and strain in the postseismic phase.

TI  - Application of Repeat-Pass TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight Interferometric Coherence to Monitor Pasture Biophysical Parameters: Limitations and Sensitivity Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the potential and limitations of repeat-pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) to retrieve the biophysical parameters of intensivelymanaged pastures. We used a time series of eight acquisitions from the TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight (TSX-ST) mode. The ST mode is different from conventional Stripmap mode; therefore, we adjusted the Doppler phase correction for interferometric processing. We analyzed the three interferometric pairs with an 11-day temporal baseline, and among these three pairs found only one gives a high coherence. The results show that the high coherence in different paddocks is due to the cutting of the grass in the month of June, however the temporal decorrelation in other paddocks is mainly due to the grass growth and high sensitivity of the X-band SAR signals to the vegetation cover. The InSAR coherence (over coherent paddocks) shows a good correlation with SAR backscatter (R-dB(2) = 0.65, p < 0.05) and grassland biophysical parameters (R-Height(2) = 0.55, p < 0.05, R-Biomass(2) = 0.75, p < 0.05). It is thus possible to detect different management practices (e.g., grazing, mowing/cutting) using SAR backscatter (dB) and coherence information from high spatial short baseline X-band imagery; however, the rate of decorrelation over vegetated areas is high. Initial findings from the June pair show the possibility of change detection due to the grass growth, grazing, and mowing events by using

TI  - Modeling Managed Grassland Biomass Estimation by Using Multitemporal Remote Sensing Data-A Machine Learning Approach
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 80% of agricultural land in Ireland is grassland, which is a major feed source for the pasture based dairy farming and livestock industry. Many studies have been undertaken globally to estimate grassland biomass by using satellite remote sensing data, but rarely in systems like Ireland's intensively managed, but small-scale pastures, where grass is grazed as well as harvested for winter fodder. Multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models were developed to estimate the grassland biomass (kg dry matter/ha/day) of two intensively managed grassland farms in Ireland. For the first test site (Moorepark) 12 years (2001-2012) and for second test site (Grange) 6 years (2001-2005, 2007) of in situ measurements (weekly measured biomass) were used for model development. Five vegetation indices plus two raw spectral bands (RED=red band, NIR=Near Infrared band) derived from an 8-day MODIS product (MOD09Q1) were used as an input for all three models. Model evaluation shows that the ANFIS (R-Moorepark(2) = 0.85, RMSEMoorepark = 11.07; R-Grange(2) = 0.76, RMSEGrange = 15.35) has produced improved estimation of biomass as compared to the ANN and MLR. The proposed methodology will help to better explore the future inflow of remote sensing data from spaceborne sensors for the retrieval of different biophysical parameters, and with the launch of new members of satellite families (ALOS-2, Radarsat2, Sentinel, TerraSAR-X, TanDEM-X/L) the development of tools to process large volumes of image data will become increasingly important.

TI  - Drivers of fire occurrence in a mountainous Brazilian cerrado savanna: Tracking long-term fire regimes using remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a natural disturbance in savannas, and defines vegetation physiognomy and structure, often influencing species diversity. Fire activity is determined by a wide range of factors, including long and short term climatic conditions, climate seasonality, wind speed and direction, topography, and fuel biomass. In Brazil, fire shapes the structure and composition of cerrado savannas, and the impact of fire on vegetation dynamics is well explored, but the drivers of variation in fire disturbance across landscapes and over time are still poorly understood. We reconstructed 31 years of fire occurrence history in the Serra do Cipo region, a highly-diverse cerrado landscape, located in the southern portion of the Espinhaco mountain range, state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. We mapped burn scars using a time series of Landsat satellite images from 1984 to 2014. Our questions were 1) How does fire occurrence vary in time and space across the Serra do Cipo cerrado landscape? 2) Which climatic drivers may explain the spatial and inter-annual variation in fire occurrence on this landscape? 3) Is fire occurrence in this cerrado landscape moisture-limited or fuel-limited? We evaluated the inter-annual variation and distribution of burned areas, and used linear models to explain this variation in terms of rainfall amount (determinant of fuel load production), seasonal rainfall distribution (determinant of dry fuel availability), abnormality of precipitation (Standardized Precipitation Index - SPI), and vegetation type (Enhanced Vegetation Index - EVI). Contrary to our expectations, annual rainfall volume was weakly and negatively correlated with burned area, and the strongest predictor of burned area was drought during the ignition season. The length of the dry season and the distribution of rain along the season determined ignition probability, increasing fire occurrence during the driest periods. We conclude that the mountain cerrado vegetation at Serra do Cipo has a moisture-dependent fire regime, in contrast to the fuel-dependent fire regimes described for African savannas. These findings imply that savannas at different continents may have different recovery and resilience capabilities when subjected to changes in the fire regime, caused by direct anthropogenic activities or indirectly through climatic changes. The possible effects of these changes on cerrado landscapes are still unknown, and future studies should investigate if currently observed fire regimes have positive or negative impacts on vegetation diversity, recovery, resilience and phenology, thus helping managers to include fire management as conservation measure.

TI  - Aerosol distribution over Brazil with ECHAM-HAM and CAM5-MAM3 simulations and its comparison with ground-based and satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate representation of the impacts of natural and anthropogenic aerosols in the climate system presents a challenge in General Circulation Models. This paper analyzes the performance of the aerosol component of two Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCM): the Europe Centre Hamburg Model - Hamburg Aerosol Model (ECHAM-HAM), and the Community Atmosphere Model - Modal Aerosol Model (CAM5-MAM3) and their comparison with aerosol observations. We analyzed the spatial distribution of aerosols over Brazil represented in terms of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) simulated by these models. The model results are compared to measurements from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground station, and satellite observations provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). While both the models provide AODs at 550 nm, only HAM provides the Angstrom exponent that is compared with AERONET measurements. The comparison between the model simulations and the satellite observations of AOD show that the models can reproduce the spatial and temporal distributions, however models underestimate AOD for the four cities and for almost every South American continent during all seasons. During the dry season, characterized by intense biomass burning, CAM5-MAM3 shows inconsistent, but comparatively better results that ECHAM-HAM, with negative biases over Northern and Northeastern regions of Brazil. The Angstrom parameter is reasonably reproduced by ECHAM-HAM, except for Cuiaba, indicating that the particle size distribution is correctly represented in most cities.

TI  - Evaluation of the bearing capacity of near-surface soils using integrated methods: A case study of Otukpa, Ogbadibo Lga, Benue state, North-Central Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The load bearing capacity of soils in Otukpa area of Benue state, Nigeria was evaluated by characterizing the geotechnical, geophysical and structural properties of the soil. The evaluation was necessary because aside the area holding good prospect for future increase in human population, sparsely distributed low-weight buildings in the area have cracks and other signs of failure. Remote sensing/GIS, geophysical and geotechnical approaches were integrated to achieve the objective. 2-D tomography and processed remotely sensed data confirmed the presence of areas of strength especially to the north. Stratigraphy of the northern portion consist of four layers; loose top soil (0-0.26m), compact clayey sand (0.26m-3.33m), dry clayey sand (3.33m-74.21m) and saturated clayey sands (74.21m-201.58m) While the stratigraphy in the south is slightly different; compact topsoil (0-1.2m), loose sand (1.2m-10.81m), compact sand (10.82m-19.71m) and compact clay sand (19.71m-56.03m). The plastic limit range from 11-17% with average specific gravity of 2.64g/cm(3). Permeability ranges from 7.8x10(-6)m/sec to 3.36x10(-4)m/sec while volume compressibility under 250kN ranges from 7.27x10(-5)m(2)/kN to 1.3x10(-4)m(2)/kN and the rate of consolidation under 250kN is within 12.43 m(2)/year to 1.33m(2)/year. MDD peaks at 1.85g/cm(3) at an OMC of 12.11% and is lowest at 1.67g/cm(3) at an OMC of 11.99%. UCS ranges from 31-45kN/m(2) while shear strength is between 258.81kN/m(2) to 338 kN/m(2). Due to the variability of engineering properties of soils, the southern part of the area is preferred for locating the buildings. Generally, careful foundation design in the area is necessary.

TI  - Long-term changes in seagrass coverage and potential links to climate-related factors: the case of Inhambane Bay, southern Mozambique
T2  - Western Indian Ocean Journal of Marine Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in seagrass coverage in Inhambane Bay (southern Mozambique) from 1992 to 2013 were assessed using SPOT 5 and Landsat imagery mapping methods with support of extensive groundtruthing. Over a 21-year period, the total seagrass area was reduced from 12,076 ha to 6,199 ha (51% of the original area). 2001 was the year when seagrass occupied the smallest area in Inhambane Bay with 5,641 ha, apparently related to the impacts of tropical Cyclone Eline with winds of around 200 km/h, and lasting for 29 days with widespread damage on human and natural infrastructure, However, a steady seagrass recovery was observed between 2001 and 2004, where 958 ha of seagrass was restored naturally. Eight seagrass species occur in Inhambane Bay forming six seagrass community types. The three largest communities were Thalassia hemprichii/Halodule uninervis with 2,305.5 ha, followed by Thalassodendron ciliatum/Cymodocea serrulata with 2,280.3 ha, and Halodule uninervis with 1,393.9 ha. The loss of seagrass occurred mainly in the T. hemprkhii/H. uninervis and H. uninervis communities. A specific study on T hemprichii conducted at Barra Peninsula and Ilha dos Porcos showed that the total seagrass biomass varied between 947.08 +/- 31.09 g DWm(-2) and 1636.82 +/- 80.52 g DWm(-2), respectively, being low at Barra Peninsula, where seagrass meadows have lower shoot density and appear to be more exposed to climate-related events such as cyclones compared to Ilha dos Porcos. This monitoring method creates a basis for better management and conservation, and a continuation of these types of evaluation actions to predict trends and impacts on marine habitats are recommended.

TI  - In vivo and ex vivo sentinel node mapping does not identify the same lymph nodes in colon cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COLORECTAL DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of lymph nodes and pathological analysis is crucial for the correct staging of colon cancer. Lymph nodes that drain directly from the tumor area are called "sentinel nodes" and are believed to be the first place for metastasis. The purpose of this study was to perform sentinel node mapping in vivo with indocyanine green and ex vivo with methylene blue in order to evaluate if the sentinel lymph nodes can be identified by both techniques.Patients with colon cancer UICC stage I-III were included from two institutions in Denmark from February 2015 to January 2016. In vivo sentinel node mapping with indocyanine green during laparoscopy and ex vivo sentinel node mapping with methylene blue were performed in all patients.Twenty-nine patients were included. The in vivo sentinel node mapping was successful in 19 cases, and ex vivo sentinel node mapping was successful in 13 cases. In seven cases, no sentinel nodes were identified. A total of 51 sentinel nodes were identified, only one of these where identified by both techniques (2.0%). In vivo sentinel node mapping identified 32 sentinel nodes, while 20 sentinel nodes were identified by ex vivo sentinel node mapping. Lymph node metastases were found in 10 patients, and only two had metastases in a sentinel node.Placing a deposit in relation to the tumor by indocyanine green in vivo or of methylene blue ex vivo could only identify sentinel lymph nodes in a small group of patients.

M3  - Article
AB  - Scholars have adapted college student identity development models to examine and highlight the unique, laborious, and varied experiences of marginalized populations. However, researchers have minimally explored the perspectives of nontheistic and nonreligious college students using poststructural methodologies. I followed a post-intentional phenomenological study design (N = 10) to explore how being agnostic or holding a worldview inclusive of agnosticism might take shape for some undergraduate students in college. Findings suggest that, while constructing their identities, students in this study moved through tentative manifestations as reflected by external to internal influences (resources and family), internal processing (identities and labels), and internal to external influences (interpersonal relations and college involvement).

TI  - A multi-temporal approach in MaxEnt modelling: A new frontier for land use/land cover change detection
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover change, a major driver of the distribution and functioning of ecosystems, is characterized by a high diversity of patterns of change across space and time. Thus, a large amount of information is necessary to analyse change and develop plans for proper management of natural resources. In this work we tested MaxEnt algorithm in a completely remote land-cover classification and change analysis. In order to provide an empirical example, we selected south-eastern Italian Alps, manly Trentino-South Tyrol, as test region. We classified two Landsat images (1976 and 2001) in order to forecast probability of occurrence for tmsampled locations and to determine the best subset of predictors (spectral bands). A difference map for each land cover class, representing the difference between 1976 and 2001 probability of occurrence values, was built. In order to better address the patterns of change analysis, we put together difference maps and topographic variables. The latter are considered, at least in the study area, as the main environmental drivers of land-use change, in connection with climate change. Our results indicate that the selected algorithm, applied to land cover classes, can provide reliable data, especially when referring to classes with homogeneous texture properties and surface reflectance. The performed models had satisfactory predictive performance, showing relatively clear patterns of difference between the two considered time steps. The development of a methodology that, in the absence of field data, allow to obtain data on land use change dynamics, is of extreme importance for land planning and management.

T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is considered to be a major natural disaster which affects many parts of the world. Geographical Information System (GIS) can be used to visualize the extent of flood and also to analyze the risk of disasters. The objective of this study is to generate a flood hazard map using satellite image data from Landsat 5. To characterize the land cover types it was used an innovative Semi-automated Classification Processing (SCP) tool. An experimental study was conducted on the downstream of Prut River Romania, more exactly nearby Carja (Romania) village situated on the right bank and Gotesti (Moldova) village situated on the left bank of Prut river. To monitor the effects of flood was used the supervised classification of two Landsat 5 images acquired on 2010 when a severe flood was affected the above mentioned area. This research presents a very rapid and affordable method of flood monitoring that could be very useful for the emergency management plan of the local authorities.

TI  - VEGETATION HOMOGENEOUS REGIONS USING NDVI VARIABILITY
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification techniques, such as cluster analysis, used in biological areas, in the plants and animals classification keys, are also useful for defining homogeneous regions, for climate data or for identification or monitoring of vegetation. The objective of the research was to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamic of NDVI (Normalized Vegetation Index Difference) of vegetation groups of Rio Grande do Sul, clustering homogeneous regions based on NDVI temporal variability and to analyze the pattern of NDVI annual variability of the different groups. For this NDVI data from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) series, derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer / National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (AVHRR/NOAA) over the period from January 1982 to December 2008 were used. Six groups were defined, which were compared to environmental macrozoning. The results showed that the variability of NDVI, obtained from GIMMS/AVHRR series, allows clustering homogeneous regions in order to identify and map the main vegetation groups that occur in the Rio Grande do Sul State. Vegetation groups are characterized by a typical seasonal pattern, however, with amplitude variations of NDVI between them, which allow to monitor phenological changes in vegetation due to its temporal dynamics.

The local hydrological cycle is expected to be influenced or changed during the past fifteen years through the project. Jiefangzha Irrigation Region, the second large partition of the Hetao Irrigation District, was selected as the typical area to explore the relationship between agricultural water consumption, water distribution, cropping pattern and changing groundwater level. In this paper, the SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System) model and the ESTARFM (Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model) algorithm were applied to produce daily field-scale evapotranspiration (ET) based on Landsat and MODIS data from 2000 to 2015 at intervals. The results indicate that the cropping pattern had changed greatly, while the water table descended through the years. The total agriculture ET stayed relatively stable, with the average annual consumption of 8.9 x 10(8) m(3). The temporal variation of agriculture ET was not obviously sensitive to the adjustment of cropping pattern. There was no significant difference in April-October ET for different crops, in spite of the clear distinction of ET in each crop-specific growing season. The spatial distribution of agricultural ET did not change in spite of the great adjustment of cropping pattern during fifteen years, which has a close inverse correlation with the groundwater depth. Groundwater depth descended from 1.76 m to 2.33 m during the operation period of the water-saving project, which might reduce the soil evaporation and have a positive effect on soil salinization effectively. Meanwhile, the net irrigation water use efficiency was improved from 0.59 to 0.66. These effects indicate the positive impact of the implemented water-saving renovation project on water management and environment. However, the actual crop coefficient K-c,K-a decreased slightly with the gradually increasing reference evapotranspiration, indicating possible drought stress as an effect of the continuing reduction of the availability of net irrigation water and declining groundwater table.

TI  - First Assessment of Sentinel-1A Data for Surface Soil Moisture Estimations Using a Coupled Water Cloud Model and Advanced Integral Equation Model over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture over the Tibetan Plateau is important for understanding the regional water cycle and climate change. In this paper, the surface soil moisture in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau is estimated from time-series VV-polarized Sentinel-1A observations by coupling the water cloud model (WCM) and the advanced integral equation model (AIEM). The vegetation indicator in the WCM is represented by the leaf area index (LAI), which is smoothed and interpolated from Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI eight-day products. The AIEM requires accurate roughness parameters, which are parameterized by the effective roughness parameters. The first halves of the Sentinel-1A observations from October 2014 to May 2016 are adopted for the model calibration. The calibration results show that the backscattering coefficient (sigma degrees) simulated from the coupled model are consistent with those of the Sentinel-1A with integrated Pearson's correlation coefficients R of 0.80 and 0.92 for the ascending and descending data, respectively. The variability of soil moisture is correctly modeled by the coupled model. Based on the calibrated model, the soil moisture is retrieved using a look-up table method. The results show that the trends of the in situ soil moisture are effectively captured by the retrieved soil moisture with an integrated R of 0.60 and 0.82 for the ascending and descending data, respectively. The integrated bias, mean absolute error, and root mean square error are 0.006, 0.048, and 0.073 m(3)/m(3) for the ascending data, and are 0.012, 0.026, and 0.055 m(3)/m(3) for the descending data, respectively. Discussions of the effective roughness parameters and uncertainties in the LAI demonstrate the importance of accurate parameterizations of the surface roughness parameters and vegetation for the soil moisture retrieval. These results demonstrate the capability and reliability of Sentinel-1A data for estimating the soil moisture over the Tibetan Plateau. It is expected that our results can contribute to developing operational methods for soil moisture retrieval using the Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites.

TI  - Mapping of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> Abundance at a Local Scale in Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the growing risk of arbovirus outbreaks in Europe, there is a clear need to better describe the distribution of invasive mosquito species such as Aedes albopictus. Current challenges consist in simulating Ae. albopictus abundance, rather than its presence, and mapping its simulated abundance at a local scale to better assess the transmission risk of mosquito-borne pathogens and optimize mosquito control strategy. During 2014-2015, we sampled adult mosquitoes using 72 BG-Sentinel traps per year in the provinces of Belluno and Trento, Italy. We found that the sum of Ae. albopictus females collected during eight trap nights from June to September was positively related to the mean temperature of the warmest quarter and the percentage of artificial areas in a 250 m buffer around the sampling locations. Maps of Ae. albopictus abundance simulated from the most parsimonious model in the study area showed the largest populations in highly artificial areas with the highest summer temperatures, but with a high uncertainty due to the variability of the trapping collections. Vector abundance maps at a local scale should be promoted to support stakeholders and policy-makers in optimizing vector surveillance and control.

TI  - An optical remote sensing approach for ecological monitoring of red and green <i>Noctiluca scintillans</i>
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An ecosystem disruptive bloom of red Noctiluca scintillans (hereafter Noctiluca) was observed in coastal waters of the north-western Bay of Bengal during April 2014. Based on the principle of phytoplankton group/species specific remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), a technique of detecting green Noctiluca and diatom was developed earlier using Rrs at 443, 488, and 531 nm of Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer-Aqua (MODIS). This was appropriately modified to detect bloom of red Noctiluca in coastal waters of the Bay of Bengal. Additional Rrs data at longer wavelengths viz. 667 and 678 nm were included in the existing algorithm, and the spectral shapes were accounted to detect the bloom of red Noctiluca. The classification scheme discriminates red Noctiluca from the green form of the same species and diatom. Phytoplankton group/species products were generated using the modified approach and validated with the reported events of red and green Noctiluca blooms in the Indian coastal waters. The present study also highlights two specific results based on MODIS retrieved time-series phytoplankton group/species image analysis: first, the observation of coexistence of diatom, red, and green Noctiluca in coastal waters of the northwestern Bay of Bengal, and the second, phytoplankton community shift resulting in red/green Noctiluca proliferation following diatom.

TI  - De Novo Upper Extremity Lymphedema After Elective Hand Surgery in Breast Cancer Survivors
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The safety of elective hand surgery in breast cancer (BC) survivors is controversial because of concerns of developing upper extremity lymphedema. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of developing lymphedema after elective hand surgery among patients that underwent ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and/or radiation therapy (RT).Method: A retrospective cohort of BC patients treated with ALND, SLNB, and/or RT was identified (1997-2012). Patients with subsequent ipsilateral elective hand surgery were included if greater than 1 year of follow-up and no preexisting lymphedema. The primary outcome was lymphedema after hand surgery. Comparisons between patients with and without lymphedema were made to identify potential lymphedema risk factors. Dichotomous and continuous variables were compared with Fisher exact and Student t tests, respectively.Results: The analysis included 103 patients, of which 4 (3.8%) had documented lymphedema after hand surgery. Lymphedema developed early and was self-limited. Lymphedema was not related to age and type of hand surgery. Tourniquet time was longer in the nonlymphedema group. The lymphedema group all received adjuvant chemotherapy and RT with either ALND or SLNB. Patients with lymphedema had a shorter interval between hand surgery and completion of BC surgery (2.1 vs 6.2 years) and RT (2.0 vs 3.3 years).Conclusions: Lymphedema is uncommon after elective hand surgery among survivors and was not associated with tourniquet use. The combination of adjuvant therapies and axillary procedures and a short temporal relationship of these to hand surgery may increase lymphedema risk.

TI  - GAME DEMANDS OF SEVEN-A-SIDE SOCCER IN YOUNG PLAYERS
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the activity patterns and physiological demands of 7-a-side youth soccer matches across 2 chronological age categories (U12 and U14). Twenty-two soccer players of a national youth soccer academy were investigated. Players of each age category performed 2 training matches (2 +/- 25 minutes) and were monitored by global positioning system and heart rate monitor units. Players of both categories covered similar total distance (5,348 +/- 307 m), at similar mean heart rate values (86 +/- 4% of maximum). However, the number of high-intensity runs (82.5 +/- 17.4 vs. 69.7 +/- 15.2) and total distance covered during sprints (264 +/- 207 vs. 128 +/- 74 m) were significantly (p <= 0.05) higher in U14 compared with U12. The results suggest a highly demanding nature of 7-a-side soccer for skilled players, with physical maturity possibly influencing the match-related high-intensity performance at these ages.

TI  - Glacier inventory and recent glacier variations in the Andes of Chile, South America
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The first satellite-derived inventory of glaciers and rock glaciers in Chile, created from Landsat TM/ETM+ images spanning between 2000 and 2003 using a semi-automated procedure, is presented in a single standardized format. Large glacierized areas in the Altiplano, Palena Province and the periphery of the Patagonian icefields are inventoried.The Chilean glacierized area is 23 708 +/- 1185 km(2), including similar to 3200 km(2) of both debris-covered glaciers and rock glaciers. Glacier distribution varies as a result of climatic gradients with latitude and elevation, with 0.8% occurring in the Desert Andes (17 degrees 30'-32 degrees S); 3.6% in the Central Andes (32-36 degrees S), 6.2% in the Lakes District and Palena Province (36-46 degrees S), and 89.3% in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego (46-56 degrees S). Glacier outlines, across all glacierized regions and size classes, updated to 2015 using Landsat 8 images for 98 complexes indicate a decline in areal extent affecting mostly clean-ice glaciers (-92.3 +/- 4.6 km(2)), whereas debris-covered glaciers and rock glaciers in the Desert and Central Andes appear nearly unchanged in their extent. Glacier attributes estimated from this new inventory provide valuable insights into spatial patterns of glacier shrinkage for assessing future glacier changes in response to climate change.

T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the difficulty in discriminating soybean and corn in mappings obtained by the time series of satellite images, this study aimed to apply the data mining techniques to separate soybean and corn. Pure pixels selection from Landsat-8 were extracted and used to build a standard spectro-temporal EVI profile for both crops. These profiles were obtained with the Timesat software and, further incorporated in the Weka software. Five out of eleven variables of the standard spectro-temporal EVI profile for each crop were found through the decision tree, a data mining technique. These five variables were sufficient to achieve the separation of soybean and corn crops with an accuracy of 96.3% and a kappa index of 0.92.

TI  - Obtaining rubber plantation age information from very dense Landsat TM & ETM plus time series data and pixel-based image compositing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the age of rubber tree plantations (Hevea brasiliensis) is of great interest to plantation managers and land-use decision makers as it enables, among others, reliable forecasts of resource availability. The acquisition of age information with field campaigns, however, is time consuming, laborious and expensive. We present an approach that facilitates rapid assessment of rubber plantation age at regional scales applying very dense Landsat times series (LTS) satellite data over China's second largest rubber planting area - Xishuangbanna. We aggregated 270 Landsat TM and ETM + surface reflectance images into annual best-available-pixel composites of minimum Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). The annual composites were classified into vegetated and non-vegetated pixels applying a global NDMI threshold of 0. As it is common practice in Xishuangbanna to clear the land before a new plantation is established, the last year in which a pixel located in a rubber plantation, was classified as non-vegetated, was recorded as the year of plantation establishment. The resultant plantation age map was validated using a stratified random sample of 184 data points, collected by visual interpretation of historical Landsat data. A Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.5 years was achieved. We estimate that in 2015 50% of Xishuangbanna's rubber plantations had an age suitable for latex tapping (8-25 years), 27% were too young to be tapped (<8 years) and 24% had already reached an age of reduced latex productivity (>25 years) and will be presumably harvested for wood in the near future. The proposed technique enables acquisitions of accurate rubber plantation age information from Landsat time series and NDMI over large areas with the potential of providing insights into land cover dynamics and allowing for the development of improved management strategies and local decision support activities.

TI  - Using an Emergency Department Syndromic Surveillance System to Evaluate Reporting of Potential Rabies Exposures, Illinois, 2013-2015
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Mandatory reporting of potential rabies exposures and initiation of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) allow local health authorities to monitor PEP administration for errors. Our objectives were to use an emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance system to (1) estimate reporting compliance for exposure to rabies in suburban Cook County, Illinois, and (2) initiate interventions to improve reporting and reassess compliance.Methods: We queried ED records from 45 acute care hospitals in Cook County and surrounding areas from January 1, 2013, through June 30, 2015, for chief complaints or discharge diagnoses pertaining to rabies, PEP, or contact with a wild mammal (eg, bat, raccoon, skunk, fox, or coyote). We matched patients with 1 ED visit for potential rabies exposure to people with potential rabies exposure reported to the Cook County Department of Public Health. We considered nonmatches to have unreported exposures. We then initiated active surveillance in July 2015, disseminated education on reporting requirements in August and September 2015, and reassessed reporting completeness from July 2015 through February 2016.Results: Of 248 patients with rabies-related ED visits from January 2013 through June 2015, 63 (25.4%) were reported. After interventions were implemented to increase reporting compliance, 53 of 98 (54.1%) patients with rabies-related ED visits from July 2015 through February 2016 were reported. Patients with ED visits for potential rabies exposure were twice as likely to be reported postintervention than preintervention (risk ratio = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.8). The volume of potential rabies exposure cases reported to the health department from July 2015 through February 2016 increased by 252% versus the previous year.Conclusions: Potential rabies exposures and PEP initiation are underreported in suburban Cook County. ED syndromic surveillance records can be used to estimate reporting compliance and conduct active surveillance.

TI  - Bimodal fire regimes unveil a global-scale anthropogenic fingerprint
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: While fire is recognized as an integral part of the Earth system, the ability of humans to shape fire regimes both spatially and temporally remains poorly understood. Our goals were to identify the extent of fire regimes exhibiting two annual fire seasons and to investigate the environmental correlates of such regimes at the global scale.Location: All areas of the globe exhibiting relevant fire activity, at 0.5 degrees spatial resolution.Time period: 2002-2012.Major taxa studied: (not applicable).Methods: The modality of fire seasonality at the global scale was classified using a 10-year record of satellite-derived fire activity and model fitting of circular statistical distributions. The main environmental correlates controlling global fire regimes were then analysed over bimodal and unimodal areas using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.Results: About 25% of the global land surface with relevant fire activity has two significantly distinct fire seasons per year, with at least one of these seasons occurring under sub-optimal fire weather conditions. In these bimodal areas, population density and the fraction of fires occurring in actively managed land, especially in croplands and pastures, are significantly higher than in neighbouring unimodal areas. Results reveal that through these land-use and management practices humans have a strong influence on global patterns of fire seasonality.Main conclusions: We identified a bimodal seasonality pattern, previously unreported at the global scale, and show that it reveals an anthropogenic fingerprint on fire regimes. Insights into where and when fire is actively employed as a land management tool enhance our understanding of the role of fire in the Earth system, and highlight the need to better understand how fire practices may change in the future.

TI  - A new optimized algorithm for automating endmember pixel selection in the SEBAL and METRIC models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In typical surface energy balance (SEB) models such as surface energy balance for land (SEBAL) and mapping evapotranspiration (ET) at high resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC), calibration of sensible heat flux (H) requires identification of endmember (i.e. hot and cold) pixels. Such pixel selection is typically done manually, which makes it labor intensive to apply SEBAL or METRIC over large spatial areas or long time series. In this paper, we introduce a new automated approach that uses an exhaustive search algorithm (ESA) to identify endmember pixels for use in these models. The fully automated models were applied on 134 near cloud-free Landsat images with each image covering one of four flux measurement sites covering a distinct land cover type in humid Florida or relatively drier Oklahoma. Observed land surface temperatures (T-s) at automatically identified hot and cold pixels were within 0.25% of manually identified pixels (both coefficient of determination, R-2, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE, >= 0.98, and root mean squared error, RMSE, <= 1.31 K). The new fully automated model performed better and demonstrated better consistency than an existing semi-automated method that used a statistical approach to subset coldest and hottest pixels within an image. Daily ET estimates derived from the automated SEBAL and METRIC models were in good agreement with their manual counterparts (e.g., NSE >= 0.94 and RMSE <= 0.35 mm day(-1)). Automated and manual pixel selection resulted in similar estimates of observed ET across all sites. The proposed automated pixel selection approach greatly reduces time demands (e.g. approximately one image per hour vs. hundreds of image per hour) for applying SEBAL and METRIC and allows for their more widespread and frequent use. This automation can also reduce potential bias introduced by an inexperienced operator and extends the domain of the models to new users. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveEvaluate the association of military sexual trauma (MST) screen status with eating disorder diagnoses among veterans within 1- and 5-years after initiating Veterans Health Administration (VHA) care, and whether the association varied by sex.MethodRetrospective cohort study of US Afghanistan/Iraq veterans who used VHA services between FY 2004 and 2014 (N=595,525). This study used VHA administrative data to assess the presence of eating disorder diagnoses in medical records within 1- and 5-years of initiating VHA care, and whether a positive screen for MST was associated with eating disorders.ResultsThree percent (n=18,488) screened positive for MST. At 1- and 5-year follow up, 0.1% (n= 513, 74% female), and 0.2% (n=504, 71% female) were diagnosed with an eating disorder, respectively. In regression models adjusted for demographic variables, military service, and psychiatric comorbidities, the presence of an eating disorder diagnosis was nearly two times higher among those with a positive screen for MST in the 1-year (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.57-2.40) and 5-year (AOR=1.86, 95%CI=1.49-2.32) cohorts. The increased likelihood conferred by MST for an eating disorder diagnosis was differentially stronger among male veterans than female veterans in the 1-year cohort only (AOR = 2.13, 95%CI = 1.01-4.50).DiscussionVeterans with a positive screen for MST, especially male veterans, had a nearly two-fold increased likelihood of having an eating disorder diagnosis. Screening for eating disorders may be important in both male and female veterans who report MST.

TI  - Adjuvant intraoperative radiotherapy for selected breast cancers in previously irradiated women: Evidence for excellent feasibility and favorable outcomes.
T2  - Reports of practical oncology and radiotherapy : journal of Greatpoland Cancer Center in Poznan and Polish Society of Radiation Oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present report provides preliminary outcomes with intraoperative radiotherapy delivered to women with breast cancer included in a re-irradiation program.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From October 2010 to April 2014, thirty women were included in a re-irradiation protocol by exploiting IORT technique. The median time between the two irradiations was 10 years (range 3-50). All patients underwent conservative surgery, sentinel lymph node excision and IORT with electron beam delivered by a mobile linear accelerator. Primary endpoint was esthetic result and consequential/late toxicity; secondary endpoints were local control (LC), disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: With a median follow up of 47 months (range 10-78), we analyzed 29 patients (1 lost at follow up). Twenty-seven patients (90%) had presented breast cancer local relapse or a new primary cancer in the same breast after a previous conservative surgery plus radiation treatment; three patients (10%) had previously received irradiation with mantle field for Hodgkin Lymphoma. Esthetic result was excellent in 3 pts (10%), good in 12 pts (41%), fair in 8 pts (28%) and poor in 6 pts (21%). 12 (41%) patients showed subcutaneous fibrosis at the last follow-up. LC, DFS and OS at five years was 92.3%, 86.3% and 91.2%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Although we analyzed a small number of patients, our results are satisfactory and this approach is feasible even if it could not be considered the standard treatment. Further clinical trials exploring IORT are needed to identify possible subgroups of patients that might be suitable for this type of approach.

TI  - Breast Cancer Surgery in Images.
T2  - Chirurgia (Bucharest, Romania : 1990)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - As a picture speaks more than a thousand words, we tried to reflect, at least in part, on our surgical day-to-day practice on the 2nd Oncological Surgery Department of "Prof. Dr. Al. Trestioreanu" Bucharest Institute of Oncology in the field of breast cancer. And how could we not talk about imaging in breast cancer, when one of the reasons for low breast cancer mortality at present is early detection, which is performed through imaging investigations. Mammographic screening is recognized as a success in this area (Fig. 1), but moreover, mammary ultrasound, a newer addition to this domain, also allows the detection of infraclinical cancers (Fig. 2). The localization of these infraclinical lesions can be obtained preoperatively by mammographic technique using a harpoon (Fig. 3). Under ultrasound guidance we can not only puncture cysts (Fig. 4), but also perform mammary biopsies for suspicious lesions.

TI  - Substance use disorders and the risk of suicide mortality among men and women in the US Veterans Health Administration
T2  - ADDICTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and AimsLimited information is available regarding links between specific substance use disorders (SUDs) and suicide mortality; however, the preliminary evidence that is available suggests that suicide risk associated with SUDs may differ for men and women. This study aimed to estimate associations between SUDs and suicide for men and women receiving Veterans Health Administration (VHA) care.DesignA cohort study using national administrative health records.SettingNational VHA system, USA.ParticipantsAll VHA users in fiscal year (FY) 2005 who were alive at the beginning of FY 2006 (n=4863086).MeasurementsThe primary outcome of suicide mortality was assessed via FY 2006-2011 National Death Index (NDI) records. Current SUD diagnoses were the primary predictors of interest, and were assessed via FY 2004-2005 VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) records.FindingsIn unadjusted analyses, a diagnosis of any current SUD and the specific current diagnoses of alcohol, cocaine, cannabis, opioid, amphetamine and sedative use disorders were all associated significantly with increased risk of suicide for both males and females [hazard ratios (HRs)] ranging from 1.35 for cocaine use disorder to 4.74 for sedative use disorder for men, and 3.89 for cannabis use disorder to 11.36 for sedative use disorder for women]. Further, the HR estimates for the relations between any SUD, alcohol, cocaine and opioid use disorders and suicide were significantly stronger for women than men (P<0.05). After adjustment for other factors, most notably comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, associations linking SUDs with suicide were attenuated markedly and the greater suicide risk among females was observed for only any SUD and opioid use disorder (P<0.05).ConclusionsCurrent substance use disorders (SUDs) signal increased suicide risk, especially among women, and may be important markers to consider including in suicide risk assessment strategies. None the less, other co-occurring psychiatric disorders may partially explain associations between SUDs and suicide, as well as the observed excess suicide risk associated with SUDs among women.

TI  - 100 Years of Competition between Reduction in Channel Capacity and Streamflow during Floods in the Guadalquivir River (Southern Spain)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduction in channel capacity can trigger an increase in flood hazard over time. It represents a geomorphic driver that competes against its hydrologic counterpart where streamflow decreases. We show that this situation arose in the Guadalquivir River (Southern Spain) after impoundment. We identify the physical parameters that raised flood hazard in the period 1997-2013 with respect to past years 1910-1996 and quantify their effects by accounting for temporal trends in both streamflow and channel capacity. First, we collect historical hydrological data to lengthen records of extreme flooding events since 1910. Next, inundated areas and grade lines across a 70 km stretch of up to 2 km wide floodplain are delimited from Landsat and TerraSAR-X satellite images of the most recent floods (2009-2013). Flooded areas are also computed using standard two-dimensional Saint-Venant equations. Simulated stages are verified locally and across the whole domain with collected hydrological data and satellite images, respectively. The thoughtful analysis of flooding and geomorphic dynamics over multi-decadal timescales illustrates that non-stationary channel adaptation to river impoundment decreased channel capacity and increased flood hazard. Previous to channel squeezing and pre-vegetation encroachment, river discharges as high as 1450 m(3).s(-1) (the year 1924) were required to inundate the same areas as the 790 m(3).s(-1) streamflow for recent floods (the year 2010). We conclude that future projections of one-in-a-century river floods need to include geomorphic drivers as they compete with the reduction of peak discharges under the current climate change scenario.

TI  - Predicting the end of lava flow-forming eruptions from space
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the volcanological community places great emphasis on forecasting the onset of volcanic eruptions, knowing when an effusive eruption will end is just as important in terms of mitigating hazards. Wadge (J Volcanol Geotherm Res 11: 139-168, 1981) postulated that the onset of an episodic, lava flow-forming basaltic eruption is characterized by a rapid increase in effusion rate to a maximum, before decaying over a longer period of time until the eruption ends. We used thermal infrared remote-sensing data acquired byNASA'sMODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to derive time-averaged discharge rate (TADR) time series using the method of Harris et al. (J Geophys Res 102(B4): 7985-8003, 1997) for 104 eruptions at 34 volcanoes over the last 15 years. We found that 32 eruptions followed the pattern described by Wadge (J Volcanol Geotherm Res 11: 139-168, 1981). Based on the MODIS-derived maximum lava discharge rate and a decay constant that best fits the exponential waning phase (updated as each new MODIS TADR observation is added to the time series), the time at which the discharge equals zero, and thus the point at which effusion ends, can be predicted. The accuracy of the prediction improves with the number of data points so that, in the ideal case, the end of effusion can be retro-casted before half of the eruption duration has passed. This work demonstrates the possibility of predicting when an eruption will end using satellite-derived TADR time series acquired in near real time during that eruption. This prediction can be made after an eruption has reached its maximum lava discharge rate and the waning phase of the Wadge trend has begun. This approach therefore only applies to the case of eruption from a chamber undergoing an elastic release of energy during lava flow emplacement, and we provide examples of eruptions where it would not be applicable.

TI  - Evaluation of a state based syndromic surveillance system for the classification and capture of non-fatal occupational injuries and illnesses in New Jersey
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThis preliminary study evaluates a real-time syndromic surveillance system to track occupationally-related emergency room visits throughout New Jersey.MethodsEmergency Department (ED) chief complaint fields were evaluated from 79 of 80 hospitals in NJ in 2014, using work-related keywords and ICD-9 E-codes, to determine its ability to capture non-fatal work-related injuries. Sensitivity analysis and descriptive statistics, were used to evaluate and summarize the occupational injuries identified.ResultsOverall, 11919 (0.3%) possible work-related ED visits were identified from all ED visits. Events with the greatest number of ED visits were slips, trips, and falls (1679, 14%). Nature of injury included cuts, lacerations (1041, 9%). The part of the body most affected was the back (1414, 12%). This work-related classifier achieved a sensitivity of 5.4%, a specificity of 99.8%, and a PPV of 2.8%.ConclusionsThis evaluation demonstrated that the syndromic surveillance reporting system can yield real-time knowledge of work-related injuries.

TI  - Meningococcal disease in the Middle East and Africa: Findings and updates from the Global Meningococcal Initiative
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION
M3  - Review
AB  - The Global Meningococcal Initiative (GMI) has recently considered current issues in Middle Eastern and African countries, and produced two recommendations: (i) that vaccination of attendees should be considered for some types of mass-gathering events, as some countries mandate for the Hajj, and (ii) vaccination of people with human immunodeficiency virus should be used routinely, because of increased meningococcal disease (MD) risk. Differences exist between Middle Eastern and African countries regarding case and syndrome definitions, surveillance, and epidemiologic data gaps. Sentinel surveillance provides an overview of trends and prevalence of different capsular groups supporting vaccine selection and planning, whereas cost-effectiveness decisions require comprehensive disease burden data, ideally counting every case. Surveillance data showed importance of serogroup B MD in North Africa and serogroup W expansion in Turkey and South Africa. Success of MenAfriVac (R) in the African "meningitis belt" was reviewed; the GMI believes similar benefits may follow development of a low-cost meningococcal pentavalent vaccine, currently in phase 1 clinical trial, by 2022. The importance of carriage and herd protection for controlling invasive MD and the importance of advocacy and awareness campaigns were also highlighted. (C) 2017 The Authors.

M3  - Article
AB  - The patterns of phase portraits of vegetation (agrophytocenosis, woody vegetation) constructed using two-dimensional space radiation temperature values and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were studied. The analysis of the phenological variability of vegetation in the south of the Krasnoyarsk Territory and the Republic of Khakassia during growing seasons of 2003 and 2006 was carried out. Distinctive features of the phase portraits of agrophytocenosis and woody vegetation were revealed. The possibility of determining the boundaries of phenological states in phytocenosis, an area of the transformation from one state into another was shown. Based on the complex analysis of the reflective and radiative properties of the plant samples, the algorithm for calculating the start and end of the growing season was developed.

TI  - Using sea-ice deformation fields to constrain the mechanical strength parameters of geophysical sea ice
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the ability of viscous-plastic (VP) sea-ice models with an elliptical yield curve and normal flow rule to reproduce the shear and divergence distributions derived from the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS). In particular, we reformulate the VP elliptical rheology to allow independent changes in the ice compressive, shear and isotropic tensile strength parameters (P*; S*; and T*, respectively) in order to study the sensitivity of the deformation distributions to changes in the ice mechanical strength parameters. Our 10 km VP simulation with standard ice mechanical strength parameters P* = 527.5 kN m(-2), S* = 56.9 kN m(-2), and T* = 50 kN m(-2) (ellipse aspect ratio of e=2) does not reproduce the large shear and divergence deformations observed in the RGPS deformation fields, and specifically lacks well-defined, active linear kinematic features (LKFs). Probability density functions (PDFs) for the shear and divergence of are nonetheless not Gaussian. Reducing the ice compressive strength (with constant S* and T*) or increasing the ice shear strength (with constant P* and T*) both results in shear and divergence PDFs in better agreement with RGPS distributions. The isotropic tensile strength of sea ice does not significantly affect the shear and divergence distributions. When considering additional metrics such as the ice drift error, mean ice thickness fields, and spatial scaling of the total deformations, our results suggest that reducing the ice compressive strength P* (while keeping S* constant, i.e. reducing the ellipse aspect ratio) is a better solution than increasing the shear strength to improve simulations of the Arctic seaice cover with the VP elliptical rheology.

TI  - Open to death: A moderating role of openness to experience in terror management
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on terror management theory demonstrates that people respond to reminders of mortality with defenses aimed at maintaining their self-esteem and defending cultural worldviews. We posited that being open to experience should allow individuals to process death more receptively (i.e., with curiosity), attenuating the need to bolster self-esteem or defend worldviews, because death is a novel experience. Across three studies, dispositional openness moderated reactions to mortality salience. Individuals low in openness to experience responded to mortality salience with increased self-esteem striving (Study 1) and worldview defense (Study 2), and this functioned to decrease the subsequent availability of death-related thought (Study 2). Individuals high in openness to experience did not exhibit these same defense tendencies. Study 3 examined a possible mechanism for the attenuated effects observed among high openness individuals: increased curiosity in response to mortality salience was found to decrease worldview defense, but only for those high in openness. Together this research depicts openness as a resource facilitating reduced defensiveness following mortality salience. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Florida manatee (<i>Trichechus manatus latirostris</i>) immunoglobulin heavy chain suggests the importance of clan III variable segments in repertoire diversity
T2  - DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Manatees are a vulnerable, charismatic sentinel species from the evolutionarily divergent Afrotheria. Manatee health and resistance to infectious disease is of great concern to conservation groups, but little is known about their immune system. To develop manatee-specific tools for monitoring health, we first must have a general knowledge of how the immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) chain locus is organized and transcriptionally expressed. Using the genomic scaffolds of the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris), we characterized the potential IgH segmental diversity and constant region isotypic diversity and performed the first Afrotherian repertoire analysis. The Florida manatee has low V(D)J combinatorial diversity (3744 potential combinations) and few constant region isotypes. They also lack clan III V segments, which may have caused reduced VH segment numbers. However, we found productive somatic hypermutation concentrated in the complementarity determining regions. In conclusion, manatees have limited IGHV clan and combinatorial diversity. This suggests that clan III V segments are essential for maintaining IgH locus diversity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sustainable energy development in Nigeria: Wind, hydropower, geothermal and nuclear (Vol. 1)
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - In Nigeria, lack of adequate power supply has been recurrently cited as a hindrance to economic growth. This article provides an in-depth review on the wind, hydropower, geothermal and nuclear energy options in Nigeria, for a sustainable development of its power sector. The potential, current developmental stages, and prospects of each of the aforementioned energy conversion techniques, in the Nigerian context, are presented. The study reveals that although available data for each considered renewable energy option suggest renewable energy holds some potential, these data are not sufficient to make definitive global assessments of the country's prospects in this sector. Ground measured wind data are sparse and not consistent with satellite data. Hydropower resource databases have not been updated in a very long time. Geothermal records are only available for locations where oil explorations were previously performed. While these data might be useful for some local assessments, using them for global quantitative estimations would be misleading. A countrywide resource mapping across all technologies is required for a reliable outlook of sustainable energy development in Nigeria.

TI  - Breaks in MODIS time series portend vegetation change: verification using long-term data in an arid grassland ecosystem
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequency and severity of extreme climatic events are forecast to increase in the 21st century. Predicting how managed ecosystems may respond to climatic extremes is intensified by uncertainty associated with knowing when, where, and how long effects of extreme events will be manifest in an ecosystem. In water-limited ecosystems with high inter-annual variability in rainfall, it is important to be able to distinguish responses that result from seasonal fluctuations in rainfall from long-term directional increases or decreases in precipitation. A tool that successfully distinguishes seasonal from directional biomass responses would allow land managers to make informed decisions about prioritizing mitigation strategies, allocating human resource monitoring efforts, and mobilizing resources to withstand extreme climatic events. We leveraged long-term observations (2000-2013) of quadrat-level plant biomass at multiple locations across a semiarid landscape in southern New Mexico to verify the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series derived from 250-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data as a proxy for changes in aboveground productivity. This period encompassed years of sustained drought (2000-2003) and record-breaking high rainfall (2006 and 2008) followed by subsequent drought years (2011 through 2013) that resulted in a restructuring of plant community composition in some locations. Our objective was to decompose vegetation patterns derived from MODIS NDVI over this period into contributions from (1) the long-term trend, (2) seasonal cycle, and (3) unexplained variance using the Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) model. BFAST breakpoints in NDVI trend and seasonal components were verified with field-estimated biomass at 15 sites that differed in species richness, vegetation cover, and soil properties. We found that 34 of 45 breaks in NDVI trend reflected large changes in mean biomass and 16 of 19 seasonal breaks accompanied changes in the contribution to biomass by perennial and/or annual grasses. The BFAST method using satellite imagery proved useful for detecting previously reported ground-based changes in vegetation in this arid ecosystem. We demonstrate that time series analysis of NDVI data holds potential for monitoring landscape condition in arid ecosystems at the large spatial scales needed to differentiate responses to a changing climate from responses to seasonal variability in rainfall.

TI  - Where are we now? A multicountry qualitative study to explore access to pre-antiretroviral care services: a precursor to antiretroviral therapy initiation
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To explore barriers and facilitators to accessing postdiagnosis HIV care in five sub-Saharan African countries.Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 77 people living with HIV (PLHIV) in pre-antiretroviral therapy care or not-yet-in care and 46 healthcare workers. Participants were purposely selected from health and demographic surveillance sites in Karonga (Malawi), Manicaland (Zimbabwe), uMkhanyakude (South Africa), Kisesa (Tanzania) and Rakai and Kyamulibwa (Uganda). Thematic content analysis was conducted, guided by the constructs of affordability, availability and acceptability of care.-Results Affordability: Transport and treatment costs were a barrier to HIV care, although some participants travelled to distant clinics to avoid being seen by people who knew them or for specific services. Broken equipment and drug stock-outs in local clinics could also necessitate travel to other facilities. Availability: Some facilities did not offer full HIV care, or only offered all services intermittently. PLHIV who frequently travelled complained that care was seldom available to them in places they visited. Acceptability: Severe pain or sickness was a key driver for accessing postdiagnosis care, whereas asymptomatic PLHIV often delayed care-seeking. A belief in witchcraft was a deterrent to accessing clinical care following diagnosis. Changing antiretroviral therapy guidelines generated uncertainty among PLHIV about when to start treatment and delayed postdiagnosis care. PLHIV reported that healthcare workers' knowledge, attitudes and behaviours, and their ability to impart health education, also influenced whether they accessed HIV care.Conclusion Despite efforts to decentralise services over the past decade, many barriers to accessing HIV care persist. There is a need to increase sustained access to care for PLHIV not yet on treatment, with initiatives that encompass biomedical aspects of care alongside considerations for individual and collective challenges they faced. A failure to do so may undermine efforts to achieve universal access to antiretroviral therapy.

TI  - Key landscape and biotic indicators of watersheds sensitivity to forest disturbance identified using remote sensing and historical hydrography data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is one of the most critical resources derived from natural systems. While it has long been recognized that forest disturbances like fire influence watershed streamflow characteristics, individual studies have reported conflicting results with some showing streamflow increases postdisturbance and others decreases, while other watersheds are insensitive to even large disturbance events. Characterizing the differences between sensitive (e.g. where streamflow does change postdisturbance) and insensitive watersheds is crucial to anticipating response to future disturbance events. Here, we report on an analysis of a national[scale, gaged watershed database together with high[resolution forest mortality imagery. A simple watershed response model was developed based on the runoff ratio for watersheds (n = 73) prior to a major disturbance, detrended for variation in precipitation inputs. Post[disturbance deviations from the expected water yield and streamflow timing from expected (based on observed precipitation) were then analyzed relative to the abiotic and biotic characteristics of the individual watershed and observed extent of forest mortality. The extent of the disturbance was significantly related to change in post[disturbance water yield (p< 0.05), and there were several distinctive differences between watersheds exhibiting post[disturbance increases, decreases, and those showing no change in water yield. Highly disturbed, arid watersheds with low soil: water contact time are the most likely to see increases, with the magnitude positively correlated with the extent of disturbance. Watersheds dominated by deciduous forest with low bulk density soils typically show reduced yield post[disturbance. Postdisturbance streamflow timing change was associated with climate, forest type, and soil. Snowy coniferous watersheds were generally insensitive to disturbance, whereas finely textured soils with rapid runoff were sensitive. This is the first national scale investigation of streamflow postdisturbance using fused gage and remotely sensed data at high resolution, and gives important insights that can be used to anticipate changes in streamflow resulting from future disturbances.

TI  - Enhancing Communication to Improve Patient Safety and to Increase Patient Satisfaction.
T2  - The health care manager
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - With the continuous rise of sentinel and adverse events due to ineffective communication, it is time for health care organizations to start implementing a focus on enhancing effective communication in which will, in turn, improve patient safety and experience, boosting the bottom line. This article identifies and discusses different communication protocols that can be used to enhance the consistency of more efficient and effective communication within a health care organization to overall improve patient care and patient satisfaction. The rising importance of patient satisfaction and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems scores required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are causing a shift in how hospitals evaluate and manage their health care organizations today. Following the situation-background-assessment-recommendation and acknowledge-introduce-duration-explain-thank protocols, as well as proper and effective training and educational programs, enhances more effective communication in health care organizations which improves patient safety and increases patient satisfaction.

TI  - Comparison of spatiotemporal prediction models of daily exposure of individuals to ambient nitrogen dioxide and ozone in Montreal, Canada
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In previous studies investigating the short-term health effects of ambient air pollution the exposure metric that is often used is the daily average across monitors, thus assuming that all individuals have the same daily exposure. Studies that incorporate space-time exposures of individuals are essential to further our understanding of the short-term health effects of ambient air pollution.Objectives: As part of a longitudinal cohort study of the acute effects of air pollution that incorporated subject specific information and medical histories of subjects throughout the follow-up, the purpose of this study was to develop and compare different prediction models using data from fixed-site monitors and other monitoring campaigns to estimate daily, spatially-resolved concentrations of ozone (O-3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) of participants' residences in Montreal, 1991-2002.Methods: We used the following methods to predict spatially-resolved daily concentrations of O-3 and NO2 for each geographic region in Montreal (defined by three-character postal code areas): (1) assigning concentrations from the nearest monitor; (2) spatial interpolation using inverse-distance weighting; (3) back-extrapolation from a land-use regression model from a dense monitoring survey, and; (4) a combination of a land-use and Bayesian maximum entropy model. We used a variety of indices of agreement to compare estimates of exposure assigned from the different methods, notably scatterplots of pairwise predictions, distribution of differences and computation of the absolute agreement intraclass correlation (ICC). For each pairwise prediction, we also produced maps of the ICCs by these regions indicating the spatial variability in the degree of agreement.Results: We found some substantial differences in agreement across pairs of methods in daily mean predicted concentrations of O-3 and NO2. On a given day and postal code area the difference in the concentration assigned could be as high as 131 ppb for O-3 and 108 ppb for NO2. For both pollutants, better agreement was found between predictions from the nearest monitor and the inverse-distance weighting interpolation methods, with ICCs of 0.89 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89, 0.89) for O-3 and 0.81 (95%CI: 0.80, 0.81) for NO2, respectively. For this pair of methods the maximum difference on a given day and postal code area was 36 ppb for O-3 and 74 ppb for NO2. The back-extrapolation method showed a higher degree of disagreement with the nearest monitor approach, inverse-distance weighting interpolation, and the Bayesian maximum entropy model, which were strongly constrained by the sparse monitoring network. The maps showed that the patterns of agreement differed across the postal code areas and the variability depended on the pair of methods compared and the pollutants. For O-3, but not NO2, postal areas showing greater disagreement were mostly located near the city centre and along highways, especially in maps involving the back-extrapolation method.Conclusions: In view of the substantial differences in daily concentrations of O-3 and NO2 predicted by the different methods, we suggest that analyses of the health effects from air pollution should make use of multiple exposure assessment methods. Although we cannot make any recommendations as to which is the most valid method, models that make use of higher spatially resolved data, such as from dense exposure surveys or from high spatial resolution satellite data, likely provide the most valid estimates.

AB  - The internal thoracic (IT) nodal basin is a first-echelon drainage pathway in the breast, accounting for up to a quarter of its lymphatic drainage, primarily from the deep structures of the breast. The presence of internal thoracic node (ITN) metastases upstages the breast cancer (BC) patient to a minimum of clinical stage III disease. Medial tumors, deep tumors, young age, axillary nodal metastases, tumors of a high nuclear grade, lymphovascular invasion, and triple-negative hormone receptor status are predisposing factors for ITN metastases from primary BC. It has been observed that medial tumors carry a worse prognosis than lateral tumors when all other factors are equal, indicating that understaging of ITN has a significant impact on patient outcomes. Despite the established prognostic significance of IT adenopathy in BC, this nodal basin is not routinely staged due to the difficulty in accessing it and due to the controversy regarding its management. Since the initial ITN studies in the 1960s, improvement in imaging techniques and the availability of minimally invasive biopsy techniques have fueled renewed interest in ITNs and their clinical significance in BC. Radiologists who image and diagnose BC can offer more accurate staging assessments by consistently evaluating the IT nodal chain in the BC patient. In this article, the authors discuss current knowledge of the ITNs in BC and review ITN anatomy. The imaging appearance of pathologic ITNs using various modalities, potential mimics of IT adenopathy, and image-guided sampling techniques are described. A succinct discussion of the clinical management of ITN-positive BC and its challenges is also included. (C) RSNA, 2017 . radiographics. rsna. org

TI  - Urbanization and the thermal environment of Chinese and US-American cities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization induced change of the thermal environment of cities is analyzed using MODIS LST and DMSP/OLS nighttime light data sets (2001 - 2012) to a) extend previous studies on individual megacities to a city size spectrum; b) investigate the heterogeneous surface thermal environment associated with the urbanization processes in terms of nighttime light intensity and city size; and c) provide insights in predicting how urban ecosystems will respond to urbanization for both a developing and a developed country (China and US-America), and on global scale. The following results are obtained: i) Nighttime light intensities of both countries (and globally) increase with increasing city size. ii) City size dependent annual or seasonal mean temperature tendencies show the urban effect by decreasing daytime and increasing nighttime mean temperatures (particularly in China) while variability can be related to climate fluctuations. iii) Daytime/nighttime seasonal warming tendencies (inferred from regional downscaling within city clusters) show the high light intensity regions to be stable while in low light intensity regions fluctuations prevail.

TI  - Impact of the 2008 Olympic Games on urban thermal environment in Beijing, China from satellite images
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Beijing has suffered from a rapid development of urbanization in recent years especially since the successful bidding of the 2008 Olympic Games on July 13, 2001 in Moscow. To identify the influence of this paramount sporting event on development of the urban heat island (UHI) effect, this paper examined the spatial expansion of the urban size and UHI effect in Beijing from the years 1999, 2004 to 2008 and 2008 to 2013 using Landsat satellite images. These time spans indicated the process of urbanization in Beijing before and after hosting the 2008 Olympic Games. A new method was proposed to delineate the whole urban boundaries in Beijing governmental area by combining the Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical information Science (GIS) technologies. The spatial expansion intensity and directions both for urban size and UHI effect were computed and analyzed. By 2013, the urban size of Beijing expanded to more than twice its size in 2008. The sprawl directions for the urban size and the areas with a severe UHI effect were the same, whereas the areas with a severe UHI effect were not enlarged with the increasing urban size. This indicated that the urban development in Beijing after hosting the games was more reasonable which makes the Beijing city be more livable. Statistically, the UHI effect was mitigated when the ratio of areas with water-pervious surfaces to the whole urban region was more than 35%. The urban thermal environment has been improved by increasing the areas of the water-pervious surfaces since hosting the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Decline in HIV-1 Drug Resistance in Heavily Antiretroviral-Experienced Patients Is Associated with Optimized Prescriptions in a Treatment Roll-Out Program in Mexico
T2  - AIDS RESEARCH AND HUMAN RETROVIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - A decrease in the rate of acquired antiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance (ADR) over time has been documented in high-income settings, but data on the determinants of this phenomenon are lacking. We tested the hypothesis that in heavily ARV-experienced patients in the Mexican ARV therapy (ART) roll-out program, the drop in ADR would be associated with changes in ARV drug usage. Genotypic resistance tests obtained from 974 HIV-infected patients with virological failure and at least 2 previously failed ARV regimens from throughout the country were analyzed for the presence of nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitor (PI) resistance-associated mutations (RAMs). Patients were divided into two groups according to their first ART start date: 488 patients initiated ART before mid-2003 (group 1) and 486 after mid-2003 (group 2). The rate of RAMs, median resistance score of several sentinel ARVs, and composition of ART drugs in patient's entire treatment history were compared between both groups. Patients in group 2 were less likely to have >3 thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAMs) and >3 PI-mRAMs [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=0.37; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=0.25-0.54; p<.001 and aOR=0.53; 95% CI=0.36-0.77; p=.001, respectively] and had a significantly lower resistance score for zidovudine, tenofovir, ritonavir-boosted (r)-lopinavir, r-atazanavir, and r-darunavir than group 1 patients. A significantly lower proportion of patients in group 2 used monotherapy, bitherapy, thymidine analogue-containing regimens, nonboosted PI-containing regimens, and low resistance barrier PI-containing regimens. In Mexican ARV-experienced patients, the occurrence of TAM and PI-mRAM has significantly declined over time. This can be explained by treatment optimization in the national ART roll-out program in recent years.

TI  - Extrapolated Georeferencing of High-Resolution Satellite Imagery Based on the Strip Constraint
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground control points (GCPs) are necessary in order to achieve precise georeferencing of high-resolution satellite (HRS) imagery. However, measuring GCPs is costly, laborious, and time consuming. In some remote areas, we cannot even obtain well-defined GCPs. In this study, a strip constraint model is established. Based on the bias-compensated rational function model and the strip constraint model, a feasible extrapolated georeferencing approach for HRS imagery is presented. The presented approach remains effective even when the intermediate images in the strip are unavailable. Experimental results of the two ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) nadir datasets show that the direct georeferencing accuracy of the ZY-3 nadir images reaches only 9 to 12 pixels. With four GCPs in the first image, the georeferencing accuracy of the other images in the strip is improved to better than 2 pixels through extrapolated georeferencing.

TI  - Power Sensitivity Analysis of Multi-Frequency, Multi-Polarized, Multi-Temporal SAR Data for Soil-Vegetation System Variables Characterization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge of spatial and temporal variability of soil water content and others soil-vegetation variables (leaf area index, fractional cover) assumes high importance in crop management. Where and when the cloudiness limits the use of optical and thermal remote sensing techniques, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has proven to have several advantages (cloud penetration, day/night acquisitions and high spatial resolution). However, measured backscattering is controlled by several factors including SAR configuration (acquisition geometry, frequency and polarization), and target dielectric and geometric properties. Thus, uncertainties arise about the more suitable configuration to be used. With the launch of the ALOS Palsar, Cosmo-Skymed and Sentinel 1 sensors, a dataset of multi-frequency (X, C, L) and multi-polarization (co- and cross-polarizations) images are now available from a virtual constellation; thus, significant issues concerning the retrieval of soil-vegetation variables using SAR are: (i) identifying the more suitable SAR configuration; (ii) understanding the affordability of a multi-frequency approach. In 2006, a vast dataset of both remotely sensed images (SAR and optical/thermal) and in situ data was collected in the framework of the AgriSAR 2006 project funded by ESA and DLR. Flights and sampling have taken place weekly from April to August. In situ data included soil water content, soil roughness, fractional coverage and Leaf Area Index (LAI). SAR airborne data consisted of multi-frequency and multi-polarized SAR images (X, C and L frequencies and HH, HV, VH and VV polarizations). By exploiting this very wide dataset, this paper, explores the capabilities of SAR in describing four of the main soil-vegetation variables (SVV). As a first attempt, backscattering and SVV temporal behaviors are compared (dynamic analysis) and single-channel regressions between backscattering and SVV are analyzed. Remarkably, no significant correlations were found between backscattering and soil roughness (over both bare and vegetated plots), whereas it has been noticed that the contributions of water content of soil underlying the vegetation often did not influence the backscattering (depending on canopy structure and SAR configuration). Most significant regressions were found between backscattering and SVV characterizing the vegetation biomass (fractional cover and LAI). Secondly, the effect of SVV changes on the spatial correlation among SAR channels (accounting for different polarization and/or frequencies) was explored. An inter-channel spatial/temporal correlation analysis is proposed by temporally correlating two-channel spatial correlation and SVV. This novel approach allowed a widening in the number of significant correlations and their strengths by also encompassing the use of SAR data acquired at two different frequencies.

TI  - Balance between site fidelity and habitat preferences in colony site selection by herons and egrets
T2  - JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat selection in avian species is a hierarchical process driven by different factors acting at multiple scales. Habitat preferences and site fidelity are two main factors affecting how colonial birds choose their breeding locations. Although these two factors affect how colonial species choose their habitats, previous studies have only focused on one factor at a time to explain the distribution of species at regional scales. Here we used 28 yr of colony location data of herons and egrets around Ibaraki prefecture in Japan in order to analyze the relative importance of habitat preferences and colony site fidelity for selecting breeding locations. We used Landsat satellite images together with a ground survey-based map to create land-use maps for past years and determine the habitats surrounding the herons and egrets colonies. Combining the estimated colony site fidelity with the habitat data, we used a random forest algorithm to create habitat selection models, which allowed us to analyze the changes in the importance of those factors over the years. We found high levels of colony site fidelity for each year of study, with its relative importance as a predictor for explaining colony distribution increasing drastically in the most recent five years. The increase in collective site fidelity could have been caused by recent changes in the population size of grey herons Ardea cinerea, a key species for colony establishment. We observed a balance between habitat preferences and colony site fidelity: habitat preferences were a more powerful predictor of colony distribution until 2008, when colony site fidelity levels were lower. Considering changes in the relative importance of these factors can lead to a better understanding of the habitat selection process and help to analyze bird species' responses to environmental changes.

TI  - Coverage of high biomass forests by the ESA BIOMASS mission under defense restrictions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnitude of the global terrestrial carbon pool and related fluxes to and from the atmosphere are still poorly known. The European Space Agency P-band radar BIOMASS mission will help to reduce this uncertainty by providing unprecedented information on the distribution of forest above-ground biomass (AGB), particularly in the tropics where the gaps are greatest and knowledge is most needed. Mission selection was made in full knowledge of coverage restrictions over Europe, North and Central America imposed by the US Department of Defense Space Objects Tracking Radar (SOTR) stations. Under these restrictions, only 3% of AGB carbon stock coverage is lost in the tropical forest biome, with this biome representing 66% of global AGB carbon stocks in 2005. The loss is more significant in the temperate (72%), boreal (37%) and subtropical (29%) biomes, with these accounting for approximately 12%, 15% and 7%, respectively, of the global forest AGB carbon stocks. In terms of global carbon cycle modelling, there is minimal impact in areas of high AGB density, since mainly lower biomass forests in cooler climates are affected. In addition, most areas affected by the SOTR stations are located in industrialized countries with well-developed national forest inventories, so that extensive information on AGB is already available. Hence the main scientific objectives of the BIOMASS mission are not seriously compromised. Furthermore, several space sensors that can estimate AGB in lower biomass forests are in orbit or planned for launch between now and the launch of BIOMASS in 2021, which will help to fill the gaps in mission coverage.

TI  - Predicting Vascular Plant Diversity in Anthropogenic Peatlands: Comparison of Modeling Methods with Free Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands are ecosystems of great relevance, because they have an important number of ecological functions that provide many services to mankind. However, studies focusing on plant diversity, addressed from the remote sensing perspective, are still scarce in these environments. In the present study, predictions of vascular plant richness and diversity were performed in three anthropogenic peatlands on Chiloe Island, Chile, using free satellite data from the sensors OLI, ASTER, and MSI. Also, we compared the suitability of these sensors using two modeling methods: random forest (RF) and the generalized linear model (GLM). As predictors for the empirical models, we used the spectral bands, vegetation indices and textural metrics. Variable importance was estimated using recursive feature elimination (RFE). Fourteen out of the 17 predictors chosen by RFE were textural metrics, demonstrating the importance of the spatial context to predict species richness and diversity. Non-significant differences were found between the algorithms; however, the GLM models often showed slightly better results than the RF. Predictions obtained by the different satellite sensors did not show significant differences; nevertheless, the best models were obtained with ASTER (richness: R-2 = 0.62 and %RMSE = 17.2, diversity: R-2 = 0.71 and % RMSE = 20.2, obtained with RF and GLM respectively), followed by OLI and MSI. Diversity obtained higher accuracies than richness; nonetheless, accurate predictions were achieved for both, demonstrating the potential of free satellite data for the prediction of relevant community characteristics in anthropogenic peatland ecosystems.

TI  - Enteric <i>Salmonella</i> in humans and food in the Middle East and North Africa: protocol of a systematic review
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Non-typhoidal Salmonella is considered one of the leading causes of foodborne disease worldwide. This protocol provides methods that will be used to synthesise available epidemiological data on non-typhoidal enteric Salmonella in humans and food in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and to characterise the morbidity of human salmonellosis in this region.Methods and analysis A systematic review will be conducted based on the Cochrane Collaboration handbook and will be reported following the items outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We will search PubMed, Embase, CAB Direct and Global Health Library (WHO) databases in order to identify relevant reports. Additionally, the literature search will be supplemented by checking references of the included reports and the identified reviews. Furthermore, we will hand-search conference proceedings and Ministry of Health's website of each country of the MENA region. We will use comprehensive search criteria with no time and no language restrictions. We will extract data on report and study characteristics, biological assay characteristics, individuals' demographic characteristics and on primary and secondary outcomes of interest. If appropriate, meta-analysis will be conducted in order to estimate pooled prevalence measures using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models. We will conduct meta-regression analysis to explore the effect of study-level characteristics as potential sources of heterogeneity.Ethics and dissemination The results of the systematic review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant conferences.

TI  - Suitability Assessment of Satellite-Derived Drought Indices for Mongolian Grassland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Mongolia, drought is a major natural disaster that can influence and devastate large regions, reduce livestock production, cause economic damage, and accelerate desertification in association with destructive human activities. The objective of this article is to determine the optimal satellite-derived drought indices for accurate and real-time expression of grassland drought in Mongolia. Firstly, an adaptability analysis was performed by comparing nine remote sensing-derived drought indices with reference indicators obtained from field observations using several methods (correlation, consistency percentage (CP), and time-space analysis). The reference information included environmental data, vegetation growth status, and region drought-affected (RDA) information at diverse scales (pixel, county, and region) for three types of land cover (forest steppe, steppe, and desert steppe). Second, a meteorological index (PED), a normalized biomass (NorBio) reference indicator, and the RDA-based drought CP method were adopted for describing Mongolian drought. Our results show that in forest steppe regions the normalized difference water index (NDWI) is most sensitive to NorBio (maximum correlation coefficient (MAX_R): up to 0.92) and RDA (maximum CP is 87%), and is most consistent with RDA spatial distribution. The vegetation health index (VHI) and temperature condition index (TCI) are most correlated with the PED index (MAX_R: 0.75) and soil moisture (MAX_R: 0.58), respectively. In steppe regions, the NDWI is most closely related to soil moisture (MAX_R: 0.69) and the VHI is most related to the PED (MAX_R: 0.76), NorBio (MCC: 0.95), and RDA data (maximum CP is 89%), exhibiting the most consistency with RDA spatial distribution. In desert steppe areas, the vegetation condition index (VCI) correlates best with NorBio (MAX_R: 0.92), soil moisture (MAX_R: 0.61), and RDA spatial distribution, while TCI correlates best with the PED (MAX_R: 0.75) and the RDA data (maximum CP is 79%). The VHI is a combination of constructed VCI and TCI, and can be used instead of them. Finally, the mode method was adopted to identify appropriate drought indices. The best two indices (VHI and NDWI) can be utilized to develop a combination drought model for accurately monitoring and quantifying drought in the future. Additionally, the new framework can be adopted to investigate and analyze the suitability of satellite-derived drought indices and determine the most appropriate index/indices for other countries or areas.

TI  - Mapping urban land cover from high spatial resolution hyperspectral data: An approach based on simultaneously unmixing similar pixels with jointly sparse spectral mixture analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing data exploitation, spectral mixture analysis is commonly used to detect land cover materials and their corresponding proportions present in the observed scene. In recent years, high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral images have shown their potential for deriving accurate land cover maps. In this paper, a new spectral mixture analysis model for mapping urban environments using high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral data is proposed. First, non-local self-similarity is exploited to partition the scene into groups of similar pixels. The spectral signals of the pixels in each of these groups are assumed to be comprised of the same endmembers, but with different abundance values. Then, the similar pixels in each group are simultaneously unmixed using a jointly sparse spectral mixture analysis method. The proposed method was applied to map land cover in Pavia city, northern Italy, using airborne ROSIS data. An overall classification accuracy of 97.24% was achieved for the Vegetation - Impervious surface - Soil model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed jointly sparse spectral mixture analysis model is well suited for mapping land cover in urban environments using high resolution hyperspectral data.

TI  - Relationships Between Long-Term Trend of Satellite-Derived Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> and Hypoxia Off the Changjiang Estuary
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Changjiang Estuary is one of the largest estuaries in the world, where hypoxia frequently occurs during the summer season. Recent routine surveys in the observed area found that the low dissolved oxygen (DO) in the summer bottom water was not rapidly expanding with increasing nutrient loads in Changjiang diluted waters. Based on the remote sensing data and in situ data, we examined the historic seasonal hypoxia observations for the bottom waters of the Changjiang Estuary and investigated the short- and long-term effects that runoff had on variations in DO and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). Our analysis indicated that the recent areal variation in hypoxia was due to the changing Chl-a distribution and stratification conditions. The correspondence between hypoxia and surface Chl-a concentration showed that remotely sensed Chl-a larger than 3.0 mg L-1 was an essential condition for the formation of hypoxia off the Changjiang Estuary. The trend of Chl-a concentration was significantly impacted by the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), and the inter-annual variation of Chl-a was weakly affected by global-scale climate variability. After the TGD impoundment, the sediment loading in the Changjiang runoff and suspended sediments in Changjiang Estuary in August decreased, and the high Chl-a concentration moved landward. These shifted the hypoxia from its optimal forming conditions.

TI  - Research progress on the autonomous flowering time pathway in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
T2  - PHYSIOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF PLANTS
M3  - Review
AB  - The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth phase is a pivotal and complicated process in the life cycle of flowering plants which requires a comprehensive response to multiple environmental aspects and endogenous signals. In Arabidopsis, six regulatory flowering time pathways have been defined by their response to distinct cues, namely photoperiod, vernalization, gibberellin, temperature, autonomous and age pathways, respectively. Among these pathways, the autonomous flowering pathway accelerates flowering independently of day length by inhibiting the central flowering repressor FLC. FCA, FLD, FLK, FPA, FVE, FY and LD have been widely known to play crucial roles in this pathway. Recently, AGL28, CK2, DBP1, DRM1, DRM2, ESD4, HDA5, HDA6, PCFS4, PEP, PP2A-B'gamma, PRMT5, PRMT10, PRP39-1, REF6, and SYP22 have also been shown to be involved in the autonomous flowering time pathway. This review mainly focuses on FLC RNA processing, chromatin modification of FLC, post-translational modification of FLC and other molecular mechanisms in the autonomous flowering pathway of Arabidopsis.

TI  - Estimation of FAPAR over Croplands Using MISR Data and the Earth Observation Land Data Assimilation System (EO-LDAS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically-Active Radiation (FAPAR) is an important parameter in climate and carbon cycle studies. In this paper, we use the Earth Observation Land Data Assimilation System (EO-LDAS) framework to retrieve FAPAR from observations of directional surface reflectance measurements from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer(MISR) instrument. The procedure works by interpreting the reflectance data via the semi-discrete Radiative Transfer (RT) model, supported by a prior parameter distribution and a dynamic regularisation model and resulting in an inference of land surface parameters, such as effective Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll concentration and fraction of senescent leaves, with full uncertainty quantification. The method is demonstrated over three agricultural FLUXNET sites, and the EO-LDAS results are compared with eight years of in situ measurements of FAPAR and LAI, resulting in a total of 24 site years. We additionally compare three other widely-used EO FAPAR products, namely the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Full Resolution, the MISR High Resolution (HR) Joint Research Centre Two-stream Inversion Package (JRC-TIP) and MODIS MCD15 FAPAR products. The EO-LDAS MISR FAPAR retrievals show a high correlation with the ground measurements (r(2) > 0.8), as well as the lowest average RMSE (0.14), in line with the MODIS product. As the EO-LDAS solution is effectively interpolated, if only measurements that are coincident with MISR observations are considered, the correlation increases (r(2) > 0.85); the RMSE is lower by 4-5%; and the bias is 2% and 7%. The EO-LDAS MISR LAI estimates show a strong correlation with ground-based LAI (average r(2) = 0.76), but an underestimate of LAI for optically-thick canopies due to saturation (average RMSE = 2.23). These results suggest that the EO-LDAS approach is successful in retrieving both FAPAR and other land surface parameters. A large part of this success is based on the use of a dynamic regularisation model that counteracts the poor temporal sampling from the MISR instrument.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Aboveground Biomass in Changbai Mountain Region Using ICESat/GLAS and Landsat/TM Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the magnitude and spatial distribution of forest aboveground biomass (AGB, in Mg.ha(-1)) is crucial to improve our understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Landsat/TM (Thematic Mapper) and ICESat/GLAS (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite, Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) data were integrated to estimate the AGB in the Changbai Mountain area. Firstly, four forest types were delineated according to TM data classification. Secondly, different models for prediction of the AGB at the GLAS footprint level were developed from GLAS waveform metrics and the AGB was derived from field observations using multiple stepwise regression. Lastly, GLAS-derived AGB, in combination with vegetation indices, leaf area index (LAI), canopy closure, and digital elevation model (DEM), were used to drive a data fusion model based on the random forest approach for extrapolating the GLAS footprint AGB to a continuous AGB map. The classification result showed that the Changbai Mountain region was characterized as forest-rich in altitudinal vegetation zones. The contribution of remote sensing variables in modeling the AGB was evaluated. Vegetation index metrics account for large amount of contribution in AGB ranges <150 Mg.ha(-1), while canopy closure has the largest contribution in AGB ranges >= 150 Mg.ha(-1). Our study revealed that spatial information from two sensors and DEM could be combined to estimate the AGB with an R-2 of 0.72 and an RMSE of 25.24 Mg.ha(-1) in validation at stand level (size varied from similar to 0.3 ha to similar to 3 ha).

TI  - New Language and Old Problems in Breast Cancer Radiotherapy.
T2  - Chirurgia (Bucharest, Romania : 1990)
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - New developments in breast cancer radiotherapy make possible new standards in treatment recommandations based on international guidelines. Developments in radiotherapy irradiation techniques from 2D to 3D-Conformal RT and to IMRT (Intensity Modulated Arc Therapy) make possible to reduce the usual side effects on the organs at risk as: skin, lung, miocard, bone, esophagus and brahial plexus. Dispite of all these progresses acute and late side effects are present. Side effects are as old as the radiotherapy was used. New solutions are available now by improving irradiation techniques. New techniques as sentinel node procedure (SNP) or partial breast irradiation (PBRT) and immediate breast reconstruction with silicon implants (IBRIS) make necessary new considerations regarding the target volume delineations. A new language for definition of gross tumor volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV) based on the new diagnostic methods as PET/CT,nonaparticle MRI will have real impact on target delineation and irradiation techniques. "The new common language in breast cancer therapy" would be the first step to improve the endresults and finally the quality of life of the patients.

TI  - Metastable Phase Transformation of Beta Titanium Alloys by Slip Mechanism
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF METALS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive studies of the metastable structures in beta Ti alloys have investigated the ambiguity of the unstable phase. Their microstructural characteristics have been observed to have a modulated structure, and spot satellites of diffraction in TEM, however the formation mechanisms have not been successfully interpreted because of the resolution limit of the nano lattice structure. High resolution TEM was performed to observe the metastable nano structure and for analysis of the relationship between the nano lattice and spot satellites. A metastable structure was formed just before a precipitation by overlapping a new lattice onto the beta matrix, inducing a modulated structure as a kind of Moire fringe. The new lattice structure of the 3a phase had 3 times the distance of the beta lattice parameter and had lattice relationships with the beta/omega/3a phases of beta(112)/omega(1100)/3a[1/3(112)] and beta(222)/omega(1101)/3a[1/3(222)]. It was unreasonable to interpret the 3a phase as a definite precipitation of the omega phase, because only the limited zone axes of < 113 > and < 110 > were present in the TEM diffraction results of the metastable structures. Other zone axes, such as < 100 > or < 111 > etc., were not able to break the distinct metastable features of the spot satellites. Rather than precipitation, the 3a phase was activated by the slip of < 113 >/(112) and < 110 >/(112) in the TEM diffraction. It exhibited 3 times the distance of the beta lattice parameter, which could not be achieved by typical precipitation.

TI  - Low-Volume Lymph Node Metastases in Endometrial Carcinoma
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the histopathologic characteristics of patients with endometrial carcinoma with low-volume metastases (micrometastases and isolated tumor cells) compared with macrometastases.Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients with endometrial carcinoma.Results: Among 350 robotic-assisted hysterectomies for endometrial cancer, 187 (53%) underwent attempted sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. At least 1 SLN was detected in 185, a 99% overall detection rate; 108 (58%) also had non-SLNs removed. Among 91 patients with SLNs and non-SLNs from the ipsilateral hemipelvis, both were negative in 74 (81%) and positive in 7 (8%), and 10 (11%) had a positive SLN with negative non-SLNs. Among 17 patients with SLNs and non-SLNs from the contralateral hemipelvis, both were negative in 12 (71%), both were positive in 3 (18%), and 2 patients (12%) had negative SLNs with contralateral positive non-SLNs. Among 79 patients with only a SLN dissection, 4 (5%) were positive; among 69 patients with only a non-SLN dissection, 14 (20%) had positive lymph nodes. Among 24 patients with metastatic SLNs, 9 (38%) had isolated tumor cells, 3 (13%) had micrometastases, and 12 (50%) had macrometastases. Among the 40 total patients with metastatic lymph nodes, low-volume metastases represented the largest metastatic deposit in one third of patients, all of which had SLN dissection. All 12 with low-volume metastases had endometrioid histology compared with less than half (46%) of those with macrometastases (P < 0.01). Grade 1 carcinoma was present in 7 (58%) of the patients with low-volume metastases compared with 4 (14%) of those with macrometastases (P < 0.01) Furthermore, significantly more patients with low-volume metastases versus macrometastases had less than 50% myometrial invasion (67% vs 4%, P < 0.001).Conclusions: Low-volume disease was present in one third of patients with nodal metastases, the largest metastatic deposit only in patients who had SLN dissection; these patients were significantly more likely to have grade 1 endometrioid carcinoma with less than 50% myometrial invasion, traditional "low-risk'' features.

TI  - Use of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with micrometastatic breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the current prognostic tool for clinically node-negative breast cancer patients. If the SLN reveals macrometastasis, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is recommended. However, the use of ALND in patients with micrometastasis is debated. The objective of this study was to assess the utilization of ALND in the treatment of micrometastatic breast cancer.Methods: An IRB approved, retrospective study of a pooled dataset of breast cancer patients with micrometastatic disease on SLN biopsy was performed. Patients diagnosed from 1999-2016 were identified via query of a single-institution National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) breast cancer database as well as a prospective tumor board.Results: A total of 91 patients were diagnosed with micrometastatic nodal disease. The median age at diagnosis was 56 y (range: 31-85); median follow-up time was 47 mo (range: 0-203 mo). 42/91(46.2%) patients had ALND of which 37/42 (88.1%) were a second operation; 3/42(7.1%) patients had additional positive nodes found at ALND. 44/91 (48.4%) patients received radiation. 7/91 (7.7%) patients had a recurrence, 5/7 local, including one axillary (2.1%; patient declined ALND).Conclusions: Given that the risk of lymphedema after ALND ranges between 20%-53%, the morbidity of ALND may far exceed the likelihood of detecting further nodal involvement in women with micrometastatic disease: 7.1% in this series.

AB  - Nam, Jost, and van Bavel (2013) found that conservatives were more likely than liberals to avoid dissonance-arousing situations (viz., writing counter-attitudinal essays in a high-choice situation). A close replication of this original research was unsuccessful, as both liberals and conservatives avoided writing counter-attitudinal essays to similar degrees. We conducted an additional experiment that aimed to conceptually replicate Nam et al. (2013), and to examine whether people whose ideology is threatened might be more likely to avoid dissonance-arousing situations. Again, liberals and conservatives were equally likely to avoid writing counter-attitudinal essays. Threat had no effect on these decisions. A meta-analysis of Nam et al.'s (2013) two studies, the two studies presently reported, and a third supplemental study provide no evidence for asymmetry in dissonance avoidance.

TI  - Spontaneous pneumothorax in diffuse cystic lung diseases
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PULMONARY MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewDiffuse cystic lung diseases (DCLDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders with varying pathophysiologic mechanisms that are characterized by the presence of air-filled lung cysts. These cysts are prone to rupture, leading to the development of recurrent spontaneous pneumothoraces. In this article, we review the epidemiology, clinical features, and management DCLD-associated spontaneous pneumothorax, with a focus on lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, and pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis.Recent findingsDCLDs are responsible for approximately 10% of apparent primary spontaneous pneumothoraces. Computed tomography screening for DCLDs (Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis) following the first spontaneous pneumothorax has recently been shown to be cost-effective and can help facilitate early diagnosis of the underlying disorders. Patients with DCLD-associated spontaneous pneumothorax have a very high rate of recurrence, and thus pleurodesis should be considered following the first episode of spontaneous pneumothorax in these patients, rather than waiting for a recurrent episode. Prior pleurodesis is not a contraindication to future lung transplant.SummaryAlthough DCLDs are uncommon, spontaneous pneumothorax is often the sentinel event that provides an opportunity for diagnosis. By understanding the burden and implications of pneumothoraces in DCLDs, clinicians can facilitate early diagnosis and appropriate management of the underlying disorders.

TI  - Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer (FLORIS) for ESA FLEX Mission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) mission has been selected as ESA's 8th Earth Explorer mission. The primary objectives of the mission are to provide global estimates of vegetation fluorescence, actual photosynthetic activity, and vegetation stress. FLEX will fly in tandem formation with Sentinel-3 providing ancillary data for atmospheric characterization and correction, vegetation related spectral indices, and land surface temperature. The purpose of this manuscript is to present its scientific payload, FLORIS, which is a push-broom hyperspectral imager, flying on a medium size platform. FLORIS will measure the vegetation fluorescence in the spectral range between 500 nm and 780 nm at medium spatial resolution (300 m) and over a swath of 150 km. It accommodates an imaging spectrometer with a very high spectral resolution (0.3 nm), to measure the fluorescence spectrum within two oxygen absorption bands (O-2A and O-2B), and a second spectrometer with lower spectral resolution to derive additional atmospheric and vegetation parameters. A compact opto-mechanical solution is the current instrument baseline. A polarization scrambler is placed in front of a common dioptric telescope serving both spectrometers to minimize the polarization sensitivity. The telescope images the ground scene onto a double slit assembly. The radiation is spectrally dispersed onto the focal planes of the grating spectrometers. Special attention has been given to the mitigation of stray-light which is a key factor to reach good accuracy of the fluorescence measurement. The absolute radiometric calibration is achieved by observing a dedicated Sun illuminated Lambertian diffuser, while the spectral calibration in flight is performed by means of vicarious techniques. The thermal stabilization is achieved by using two passive radiators looking directly to the cold space, counterbalanced by heaters in a closed loop system. The focal planes are based on custom developed CCDs. The opto-mechanical design is robust, stable vs. temperature and easy to align. The optical quality is very good as recently demonstrated by the latest tests of an elegant breadboard. The scientific data products comprise the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance measurements as well as fluorescence estimates and higher-level products related to the health status of the vegetation addressing a wide range of applications from agriculture to forestry and climate.

TI  - Predictive factors of axillary metastasis in patients with breast cancer and positive sentinel lymph node biopsy.
T2  - Revista do Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the risk factors for the presence of non-sentinel axillary metastatic disease in patients with breast cancer and positive sentinel node biopsy. Methods: retrospective cross-sectional study of women with breast cancer operated at the Cancer Institute of Ceara between 2002 and 2012 and submitted to sentinel lymph node biopsy.RESULTS: Among 946 breast cancer patients, 331 underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, which was positive in 83. These patients underwent axillary lymphadenectomy and 39 (46%) had metastases in other axillary lymph nodes. The variables that were significant for additional axillary disease included Ki67>14 (p=0.043), angiolymphatic invasion (p=0.01) and tumor size (p=0.027). No association was observed with estrogen, progesterone, tumor grade and Her-2 receptors.DISCUSSION: the presence of angiolymphatic invasion and tumor size have also been related to additional axillary metastasis in other studies. In addition to these variables, the same predictive effect was observed when we evaluated Ki67. The validation of these results may allow the customization of breast cancer treatment, which may reduce its morbidity.CONCLUSION: angiolymphatic invasion, tumor size (T3/T4) and Ki67>14 were factors predictive of axillary metastasis involvement in addition to the sentinel lymph node.

TI  - Evaluation of the Multi-Scale Ultra-High Resolution (MUR) Analysis of Lake Surface Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining accurate and timely lake surface water temperature (LSWT) analyses from satellite remains difficult. Data gaps, cloud contamination, variations in atmospheric profiles of temperature and moisture, and a lack of in situ observations provide challenges for satellite-derived LSWT for climatological analysis or input into geophysical models. In this study, the Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) analysis of LSWT is evaluated between 2007 and 2015 over a small (Lake Oneida), medium (Lake Okeechobee), and large (Lake Michigan) lake. The advantages of the MUR LSWT analyses include daily consistency, high-resolution (similar to 1 km), near-real time production, and multi-platform data synthesis. The MUR LSWT versus in situ measurements for Lake Michigan (Lake Okeechobee) have an overall bias (MUR LSWT-in situ) of -0.20 degrees C (0.31 degrees C) and a RMSE of 0.86 degrees C (0.91 degrees C). The MUR LSWT versus in situ measurements for Lake Oneida have overall large biases (-1.74 degrees C) and RMSE (3.42 degrees C) due to a lack of available satellite imagery over the lake, but performs better during the less cloudy 15 July-30 September period. The results of this study highlight the importance of calculating validation statistics on a seasonal and annual basis for evaluating satellite-derived LSWT.

TI  - Vegetation Indices for Discrimination of Soybean Areas: A New Approach
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to map areas cultivated with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in Parana state, Brazil, using mono- and multitemporal MODerate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. We applied the vegetation index perpendicular crop enhancement index (PCEI) and threshold determination for the automation of soybean area discrimination by geo-object (GEOBIA). For this mapping, vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI], enhanced vegetation index [EVI], and crop enhancement index [CEI]) and the development of the PCEI were used with the aid of time-series images from the TERRA/MODIS system-sensor. A support analysis, based on geo-objects and a decision tree based on data mining, was used to determine the new vegetation index. "Classification" and "merge region" algorithms and feature extraction were used for classification. To evaluate the precision of the classifications, the Kappa (.) and overall accuracy (OA) parameters were applied. Regarding the ground line, R and R-2 were above 0.92 and 0.84, respectively (p < 0.01). The test results indicate that the proposed methodology is efficient for mapping soybean distribution, with 0.80 for the Kappa parameter, an appropriate crop spatial distribution, and no over-or underestimation of areas. Th us, this study allows automated mapping of areas cultivated with soybean crops at large scales.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Characteristics of Actual Evapotranspiration in Jinghe Watershed, Xinjiang
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The Jinghe watershed is an important part of the North Slope Economic Development Belt of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang. The meteorological data of the period from 1953 to 2015 and the Landsat 5 TM images of the years 1998, 2007 and 2011 of the region were analyzed for spatio-temporal variation of the actual evapotranspiration, its characteristics and periodicity with the help of the Penman-Monteith formula, SEBAL model, Morlet wavelet analysis model and M-K mutation test model. Results show: (1) Temporal and spatial distribution of evapotranspiration is influenced by meteorological factors and underlying surface in the Jinghe watershed. The evapotranspiration of the past 60 years as a whole exhibits a significant declining trend with fluctuation in the year 1967 and 1994. In terms of temporal evapotranspiration variation rate, the four seasons follows an order of summer > spring > fall > winter. (2) The mean annual evapotranspiration dropped about 150. 654 mm (17. 361%). after the sudden change in 1982. The variation of the actual evapotranspiration consisted of three oscillation periods, each lasted for around 29 years, which indicates that in the 15 years to follow the mean annual evapotranspiration tends to ascend first by a small margin and then descend. And (3) spatial distribution of the evapotranspiration is significantly related to the type of land use, and it declines with the type of surface land use follows an order of waters > cultivated land > forest land > grass land > unused land.

TI  - Evaluation of the performance of TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) estimation over Iran
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the evaluation of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA v7) over Iran. The evaluation was conducted for a 16-year period extending between 1998 and 2013 using the rain gauge observation stations. The spatial and temporal variations of precipitation were well captured by the multi-satellite product TMPA. In spite of the consistent spatial and temporal patterns, the absolute values differed by season and region. The high performance of satellite database as compared with rain gauge observations was found over Zagros Mountains range in western parts of the country, where rainfall is mainly associated with synoptic scale atmospheric circulation patterns, in contrast with other regions of the country where convective events and complex orography play key roles. The product captured the wet and dry seasons well, but the performance increased throughout the wet period. In terms of the probability of detection rainy day events, TMPA had good performance in the western parts of the country with regard to rain gauge-based observations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Geomorphological Changes along the Nile Delta Coastline between 1945 and 2015 Detected Using Satellite Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes geomorphologic changes along the Nile Delta coastline between 1945 and 2015. The study used topographic maps produced by the Egyptian Geological Survey in 1945 and Landsat satellite imagery taken between 1973 and 2015. The study found that the coastline's geomorphology greatly changed during this time period, especially at Damietta and Rosetta promontories, which were highly eroded after construction of the Aswan High Dam. Other stretches of the coastline also eroded, while some accretion occurred along the coastline down-drift from the promontories. The trend has been erosion of the beaches along the Nile promontories and accretion within the embayments between the promontories, resulting in an overall smoothing of the coastline. A portion of the eroded material has accreted in the form of spits or shoals near the inlets. The principal causal factors of coastline change were the impacts of the Aswan High Dam, sea-level rise, land subsidence, storms, and coastal protection devices. Efforts to stop erosion have had mixed results. Seawalls built along the city of Alexandria have maintained the coastline, while other coastal protection devices have not impeded erosion. Areas of cultivated land are highly susceptible to saltwater intrusion due to sea-level rise and the fact that much of the delta is at or near sea level.

TI  - Long-term trends in vegetation phenology and productivity over Namaqualand using the GIMMS AVHRR NDVI3g data from 1982 to 2011
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation monitoring of arid and semi-arid environments using remotely sensed vegetation indices over long periods of time is essential to improve the understanding of the processes related to change. In this paper, 30 years of biweekly AVHRR NDVI3g (1982-2011) were used to examine the spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation productivity and phenology across Namaqualand, a winter-rainfall desert of South Africa. We applied a previously developed threshold based method, TIMESAT, to extract phenological metrics such as the start, peak, end and length of the growing season and estimates of productivity such as the small and large integral of NDVI. The results confirm that the vegetation in Namaqualand is strongly influenced by rainfall and that it varies considerably along rainfall gradients. A clear pattern of vegetation seasonality is observed where the growing cycle starts in autumn (March-April) and extends through the wet winter months with peak growth occurring in late-winter (August). The analysis of trends over the 30 years suggests that there has been a shift in vegetation phenology over Namaqualand to an earlier start, later end and consequently an increase in the length of the growing season, especially in the northern parts of the region. Vegetation productivity, as reflected in the small and large integrals, has also increased over many areas in Namaqualand. Although it is difficult to attribute the changes to any one factor, increases in temperature, changes in land use practices and an increase in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 are advised as possible reasons for the observed changes. Continued monitoring using finer spatial scale vegetation indices is essential to track the progression of these trends in the future. (C) 2017 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nationalism and patriotism in the work of Antonio Machado
T2  - HISTORIA Y POLITICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The unquestionable political signification of Antonio Machado's literary work has not been accompanied by parallel scholarly attention to this dimension of his writing. The copious bibliography on Machado has not abounded in reflections on the political aspects of his work comparable to considerations of its literary, philosophical or even religious features. This observation is also applicable to the topic of patriotism and nationalism. The remarkable political influence that Antonio Machado exerted during the period of the Second Republic and, especially, the Spanish Civil War, and his significance as an anti-Francoist symbol throughout the Dictatorship must not conceal the fact that Machado's political preparation and the resultant consistency of his political worldview were not characterized by their soundness.

TI  - Calibration of METRIC Model to Estimate Energy Balance over a Drip-Irrigated Apple Orchard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A field experiment was carried out to calibrate and evaluate the METRIC (Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution Internalized with Calibration) model for estimating the spatial and temporal variability of instantaneous net radiation (Rn-i), soil heat flux (G(i)), sensible heat flux (H-i), and latent heat flux (LEi) over a drip-irrigated apple (Malus domestica cv. Pink Lady) orchard located in the Pelarco valley, Maule Region, Chile (35 degrees 25 ' 20 '' LS; 71 degrees 23 ' 57 '' LW; 189 m.a.s.l.). The study was conducted in a plot of 5.5 hectares using 20 satellite images (Landsat 7 ETM+) acquired on clear sky days during three growing seasons (2012/2013, 2013/2014 and 2014/2015). Specific sub-models to estimate G(i), leaf area index (LAI) and aerodynamic roughness length for momentum transfer (Z(om)) were calibrated for the apple orchard as an improvement to the standard METRIC model. The performance of the METRIC model was evaluated at the time of satellite overpass using measurements of H-i and LEi obtained from an eddy correlation system. In addition, estimated values of Rn-i, G(i) and LAI were compared with ground-truth measurements from a four-way net radiometer, soil heat flux plates and plant canopy analyzer, respectively. Validation indicated that LAI, Z(om) and G(i) were estimated using the calibrated functions with errors of +2%, +6% and +3% while those were computed using the standard functions with error of +59%, +83%, and +12%, respectively. In addition, METRIC using the calibrated functions estimated H-i and LEi with error of +5% and +16%, while using the original functions estimated H-i and LEi with error of +29% and +26%, respectively.

TI  - Using Landsat Time Series to Understand How Management and Disturbances Influence the Expansion of an Invasive Tree
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive plant management is both challenging and expensive and as such strategic and well-informed decisions may contribute for a more effective management. Remote sensing time series can inform decision-making, improving management strategies. Acacia longifolia is one of the most widespread invasive plants in Portuguese coastal areas. We used this species to test a new approach to assess how different management practices and disturbances may influence invasive plants' distribution. The Mann-Kendall statistical test was applied to a 15-year time series (2000-2015) of Landsat TM/ETM+ derived normalized difference vegetation index to detect statistically significant vegetation trends. These maps were interpreted together with a land-cover map derived from a combined rule-based and supervised classification of a Landsat OLI image from November 27th 2013; this interpretation was then complemented with information about management practices and disturbances allowing to identify the processes influencing the current distribution of A. longifolia. The overall accuracy of the classification was 0.785 (Kappa 0.753) and A. longifolia was detected in 9% (8691 ha) of the study area. Of the nine processes of land cover change identified, "vegetation cover intensification" and "vegetation recovery after removal" were the main drivers of expansion. Pine forests were vulnerable to invasion but offered resistance to conversion into A. longifolia monospecific stands, while herbaceous and shrub habitats seemed less resistant to invasion. Some interventions aiming to control A. longifolia were shown to aggravate the invasion. This approach facilitates monitoring the invasion and allows managers to allocate resources to areas where management may be most effective.

TI  - Mapping social dynamics on Facebook: The Brexit debate
T2  - SOCIAL NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays users get informed and shape their opinion through social media. However, the disintermediated access to contents does not guarantee quality of information. Selective exposure and confirmation bias, indeed, have been shown to play a pivotal role in content consumption and information spreading. Users tend to select information adhering (and reinforcing) their worldview and to ignore dissenting information. This pattern elicits the formation of polarized groups - i.e., echo chambers where the interaction with like-minded people might even reinforce polarization. In this work we address news consumption around Brexit in UK on Facebook. In particular, we perform a massive analysis on more than I million users interacting with Brexit related posts from the main news providers between January and July 2016. We show that consumption patterns elicit the emergence of two distinct communities of news outlets. Furthermore, to better characterize inner group dynamics, we introduce a new technique which combines automatic topic extraction and sentiment analysis. We compare how the same topics are presented on posts and the related emotional response on comments finding significant differences in both echo chambers and that polarization influences the perception of topics. Our results provide important insights about the determinants of polarization and evolution of core narratives on online debating. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Submesoscale tidal eddies in the wake of coral islands and reefs: satellite data and numerical modelling
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS

CP  - 48th International Liege Colloquium on Ocean Dynamics

AB  - Interaction of tidal flow with a complex topography and bathymetry including headlands, islands, coral reefs and shoals create a rich submesoscale field of tidal jets, vortices, unsteady wakes, lee eddies and free shear layers, all of which impact marine ecology. A unique and detailed view of the submesoscale variability in a part of the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, Australia, that includes a number of small islands was obtained by using a "stereo" pair of 2-m-resolution visible-band images that were acquired just 54 s apart by the WorldView-3 satellite. Near-surface current and vorticity were extracted at a 50-m-resolution from those data using a cross-correlation technique and an optical-flow method, each yielding a similar result. The satellite-derived data are used to test the ability of the second-generation Louvain-la-Neuve ice-ocean model (SLIM), an unstructured-mesh, finite element model for geophysical and environmental flows, to reproduce the details of the currents in the region. The model succeeds in simulating the large-scale (> 1 km) current patterns, such as the main current and the width and magnitude of the jets developing in the gaps between the islands. Moreover, the order of magnitude of the vorticity and the occurrence of some vortices downstream of the islands are correctly reproduced. The smaller scales (< 500 m) are resolved by the model, although various discrepancies with the data are observed. The smallest scales (< 50 m) are unresolved by both the model- and image-derived velocity fields. This study shows that high-resolution models are able to a significant degree to simulate accurately the currents close to a rugged coast. Very-high-resolution satellite oceanography stereo images offer a new way to obtain snapshots of currents near a complex topography that has reefs, islands and shoals, and is a potential resource that could be more widely used to assess the predictive ability of coastal circulation models.

TI  - SYNOPTIC EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE IN RIO DE JANEIRO
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aimed to evaluate land surface temperature using MOD11A2 (Terra satellite) with spatial resolution of one kilometre, compares its findings with land surface temperature data gathered by conventional meteorological stations, and, finally, investigates relations between land surface temperature and synoptic systems events that occurred in Rio de Janeiro State between January until December of 2009. The highest surface temperatures recorded by the MOD11A2 product, derived from the MODIS sensor, were found in the Metropolitana, Baixadas Litoraneas, Norte Fluminense and Noroeste Fluminense regions of Rio de Janeiro State and were recorded during the summer, winter and spring seasons. Autumn was the only exception, and this was due to the influence of the coastal environment. The following synoptic systems interfered with the estimated surface temperature produced by the MOD11A2 product for Rio de Janeiro State in 2009: the Madden Julian Oscillation and South Atlantic Convergence Zone in the summer; and Frontal Systems, the South Atlantic Convergence Zone, the Madden Julian Oscillation and the Upper Tropospheric Cyclonic Vortex in spring. The land use and occupation types with the highest surface temperature are: forest, urban area and pasture land in the summer; forest, urban area, agriculture and pasture land in autumn; and urban area and agriculture during spring. The MOD11A2 product showed a drastic decrease of the surface temperature for all land types during winter, especially for forested land.

TI  - Examining Lagrangian surface transport during a coastal upwelling in the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We employ in-situ surface drifters and satellite derived sea surface temperature data to examine the impact that an upwelling event may have on mixing and Lagrangian transport of surrounding surface waters. The test area is located near the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland where easterly winds are known to trigger intense coastal upwellings. The analysis is based on the comparison of motions of three drifters that follow the currents in the uppermost layer with a thickness of 2 m with MODIS-based sea surface temperature data and high-quality open sea wind time series. The presence of an upwelling event superseded the classic Ekman-type drift of the surface layer and considerably slowed down the average speed of surface currents in the region affected by the upwelled cold water jet and its filaments. The drifters tended to stay amidst the surrounding surface waters. The properties of mixing were evaluated using the daily rate of temperature change along several transects. The upwelled cooler water largely kept its identity during almost the entire duration of the upwelling event. Intense mixing started at a later stage of the upwelling and continued after the end of the event when the winds that have driven the entire process began to subside. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Lake Basaka Expansion: Challenges for the Sustainability of the Matahara Irrigation Scheme, Awash River Basin (Ethiopia)
T2  - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Matahara Sugar Estate (MSE), after nearly 60years of irrigation, is experiencing the effects of waterlogging and salinization in some fields. The problem is believed to be the result of the expansion of (saline and alkaline) Lake Basaka towards the plantation fields. The objective of this study was to determine the geometry of the lake (area and shape) in roughly the past half- century (1957-2015) from both Landsat images and local information and then assess its negative effects on MSE's soil and water quality. Monthly groundwater (GW) depth was monitored using piezometer tubes. Water and soil samples were collected from each of the piezometer locations and analysed for important physico-chemical parameters. The results indicate that the lake expanded approximately 47.3km(2) in the past half-century. The soil quality was found to be very poor in plantation sections with very shallow GW depth and severe salinity conditions. The lake, as revealed by the results, is intruding into the groundwater system of MSE on the Abadir side. Assuming continuation of the past trends, the lake is expected to inundate parts of MSE in the next few years and, hence, challenge the production and productivity of MSE significantly. The lake has the potential to join the Awash River, thereby impacting all downstream irrigation developments in the basin and the livelihood of the people depending on the water resources. As the area is situated in the uppermost part of Main Ethiopian Rift Valley, other factors are expected to exacerbate its expansion even in the future. Overall, the study results present the potential damage caused by the lake to MSE and provides valuable information for the reclamation measures to be taken for the sustainability of MSE.

TI  - Fractal Feature Analysis and Information Extraction of Woodlands Based on MODIS NDVI Time Series
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The quick and accurate extraction of information on woodland resources and distributions using remote sensing technology is a key step in the management, protection, and sustainable use of woodlands. This paper presents a low-cost and high-precision extraction method for large woodland areas based on the fractal features of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data for Beijing, China. The blanket method was used for computing the upper and lower fractal signals of each pixel in the NDVI time series images. The fractal signals of woodlands and other land use/land cover types at corresponding scales were analyzed and compared, and the attributes of woodlands were enhanced at the fifth lower fractal signal. The spatial distributions of woodlands were extracted using the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis technique (ISODATA), and an accuracy assessment of the extracted results was conducted using the China Land Use and Land Cover Data Set (CLUCDS) from the same period. The results showed that the overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, and error coefficient were 90.54%, 0.74, and 8.17%, respectively. Compared with the extracted results for woodlands using the MODIS NDVI time series only, the average error coefficient decreased from 30.2 to 7.38% because of these fractal features. The method developed in this study can rapidly and effectively extract information on woodlands from low spatial resolution remote sensing data and provide a robust operational tool for use in further research.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, shorelines throughout the Barataria Basin of the northern Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana were heavily oiled for months with Macondo-252 oil, potentially impacting estuarine species. The Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) has been identified as a sentinel species for the study of site-specific effects of crude oil contamination on biological function. In November and December 2010, 4-5 months after the Macondo well was plugged and new oil was no longer spilling into the Gulf waters, Gulf killifish were collected across the Barataria Basin from 14 sites with varying degrees of oiling. Fish collected from oiled sites exhibited biological indications of exposure to oil, including increase in cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) mRNA transcript and protein abundances in liver tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed increases in gill, head kidney, and intestinal CYP1A protein at heavily oiled sites. Intestinal CYP1A protein was a sensitive indicator of exposure, indicating that intestinal tissue plays a key role in biotransformation of AHR ligands and that ingestion is a probable route of exposure, warranting additional consideration in future studies.

TI  - Testing the detection and discrimination potential of the new Landsat 8 satellite data on the challenging water hyacinth (<i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>) in freshwater ecosystems
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting and monitoring the spatial distribution, configuration and propagation rates of aquatic water weeds (i.e. water hyacinth) in freshwater ecosystems, is arguably important to water resources managers, hydrologists and policy makers, for sustainable water resources management and planning purposes. The principal objective of this work was to develop a model that can satisfactorily detect and map the spatial distribution and configuration of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in freshwater ecosystems, using both visible, near-infrared and thermal band information derived from the Landsat 8 multispectral sensor. Statistical analysis was done, using two machine learning classification ensembles, which are the Discriminant Analysis (DA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). Our results have shown that the spatial distribution and configuration of water hyacinth can be accurately detected and mapped with an overall classification accuracy of 95% using Landsat 8 data. The results have further shown that the different growing stages (i.e. young, intermediate and old water hyacinth) could be spectrally detected and mapped, using the new Landsat 8 sensor. In addition, the findings of this study have demonstrated that Landsat 8 bands 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11 are the most influential in detecting and mapping water hyacinth in freshwater ecosystems. Furthermore, allocation of agreement results showed that the DA classification algorithm outperformed PLS-DA in the detection and mapping the distribution and spatial configuration of water hyacinth in freshwater ecosystems. Overall, the derived water hyacinth maps provide critical information required for the development of effective and robust water hyacinth control and eradication programmes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - <i>In situ</i> preservation of parathyroid glands: advanced surgical tips for prevention of permanent hypoparathyroidism in thyroid surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUON
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypoparathyroidism (HPT) is one of the most frequent and severe complications of thyroid surgery. It is caused by intraoperative damage, devascularization or accidental removal of the parathyroid glands (PTGs). The incidence of postoperative HPT is directly proportional to surgery extent and surgeon's experience.After 40 years of experience in thyroid surgery, the first author summarizes the already known surgical steps in thyroid surgery and adds some useful practical tips for in situ preservation of PTGs.Our surgical technique focuses on meticulous capsular dissection and preservation of the middle thyroid, Kocher's vein trunk, as well as vein branches that accompany the posterior branch of the superior thyroid artery and inferior thyroid artery trunk. Ligation of all blood vessels should be as close as possible to the thyroid capsule. Identified PTGs should be de-attached from the thyroid capsule on the vascular pedicle without significant dislocation. PTGs preservation during central neck dissection (CND) can be facilitated by using methylene blue dye for sentinel lymph nodes biopsy. PTGs are not colored in blue, unlike central lymph nodes, which facilitates central neck dissection and reduces the possibility of accidental removal of PTGs.After several thousands of preserved PTGs using this original technique, a total prevalence of permanent HPT in the first author's series is less than 0.5%.Following given key points and recommendations to surgical in situ preservation of PTGs, a surgeon can provide good outcome for patients after total thyroidectomy (with or without central neck dissection), regarding HPT as one of the most severe complications of thyroid surgery.

TI  - Characterization of the northern Red Sea's oceanic features with remote sensing data and outputs from a global circulation model
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) and surface wind ( SW) are considered the most important components in air-sea interactions. This study examines the relationships between SST, SW and various oceanic variables in the northern Red Sea (NRS) during the period of 2000-2014. The current study is the first attempt to identify the SST fronts and their relationship with the dominant circulation patterns. SST fronts are mapped using the Cayula and Cornillon algorithms. The analysis is performed with available remote sensing and reanalyzed data together with 1/12 degrees HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) outputs. Seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (STL) is applied for trend analysis, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is run for the atmospheric parameters. The SST, SW speed and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) changes show insignificant trends during the period of 2000-2014. Meridional SST fronts are more significant during the month of January, and fronts that are perpendicular to the sea's axis occur from February to May. Distinct monthly and spatial variations are present in all the examined parameters, although these variations are less pronounced for the wind direction. The SST is mainly controlled by the air temperature and sea level pressure. Significant correlations exist between the SST and the studied parameters (alongshore wind stress rather than the cross-shore wind stress, surface circulation, MLD, and Chl-a). Surface winds generally flow southeastward parallel to the Red Sea's axis explaining that alongshore wind stress is highly correlated with the studied parameters.

TI  - Understanding the influence of patient demographics on disease severity, treatment strategy, and survival outcomes in merkel cell carcinoma: a surveillance, epidemiology, and end-results study.
T2  - Oncoscience
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify trends in patient presentation and outcomes data that may guide the development of clinical algorithms on Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC).METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study searching in the National Cancer Institute's SEER registry for documented MCC cases from 1986-2013. No exclusion criteria were applied. We hereby identified 7,831 original MCC entries. Demographics, staging, and socioeconomic characteristics were identified and treatment modality likelihoods and survival data were calculated via logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier statistical modeling.RESULTS: Concerning tumor localization, 44.5% (n= 3,485) were located on the head and neck, and 47.8% were located on the trunk and extremities (n= 3,742). Male and younger patients are more likely to receive radiation than surgery with no differences seen among patient race. Caucasians and "Other" races both showed higher overall survival than African American patients. States with higher median household income levels demonstrated survival advantage. Income quartiles yielded no differences in surgical or radiotherapy interventions. Moreover, patients who forego radiotherapy had a poorer overall survival.LIMITATIONS: Generalizability of SEER data, potential intrinsic coding inconsistencies, and limited information on patient comorbidities, sentinel lymph node and surgical margin status are major limitations. There is no information regarding medical intervention such as systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Recoding efforts are inconclusive regarding variables such as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, mutations, or immunosuppression status, which are well-documented for other cancers within the database.CONCLUSION: MCC lesions of the head and neck region, lower income quartiles, and African American race are associated with higher mortality. MCC patients have a median household income that is significantly higher than national values with no significant difference in subsequent treatment modalities (surgery or radiotherapy) based on socioeconomic markers. A lack of radiotherapy is associated with higher mortality.

TI  - Understanding the Impact of Urbanization on Surface Urban Heat Islands-A Longitudinal Analysis of the Oasis Effect in Subtropical Desert Cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We quantified the spatio-temporal patterns of land cover/land use (LCLU) change to document and evaluate the daytime surface urban heat island (SUHI) for five hot subtropical desert cities (Beer Sheva, Israel; Hotan, China; Jodhpur, India; Kharga, Egypt; and Las Vegas, NV, USA). Sequential Landsat images were acquired and classified into the USGS 24-category Land Use Categories using object-based image analysis with an overall accuracy of 80% to 95.5%. We estimated the land surface temperature (LST) of all available Landsat data from June to August for years 1990, 2000, and 2010 and computed the urban-rural difference in the average LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for each city. Leveraging non-parametric statistical analysis, we also investigated the impacts of city size and population on the urban-rural difference in the summer daytime LST and NDVI. Urban expansion is observed for all five cities, but the urbanization pattern varies widely from city to city. A negative SUHI effect or an oasis effect exists for all the cities across all three years, and the amplitude of the oasis effect tends to increase as the urban-rural NDVI difference increases. A strong oasis effect is observed for Hotan and Kharga with evidently larger NDVI difference than the other cities. Larger cities tend to have a weaker cooling effect while a negative association is identified between NDVI difference and population. Understanding the daytime oasis effect of desert cities is vital for sustainable urban planning and the design of adaptive management, providing valuable guidelines to foster smart desert cities in an era of climate variability, uncertainty, and change.

TI  - Preoperative Serum Human Epididymis Protein 4 Levels in Early Stage Endometrial Cancer <i>A Prospective Study</i>
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) and cancer antigen 125 markers with pathological prognostic factor to complete the preoperative clinical panel and help the treatment planning.Methods: This prospective multicenter study was conducted in 2 gynecologic oncology centers between 2012 and 2014 (Institute for Maternal and Child Health IRCCS Burlo Garofolo in Trieste and Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome, Italy). We enrolled 153 patients diagnosed with clinical early (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages I-II) type I endometrial cancer.Results: Human epididymis protein 4 levels seemed to be strictly related to age (P < 0.001) and menopausal status (P < 0.002). Compared with myometrial invasion (MI), the HE4 values were significantly higher in case of invasion of greater than 50% of the thickness: MI of greater than 50%, median of 94.85 pmol/L (38.3-820.8 pmol/L), versus MI of less than 50%, median of 65.65 pmol/L (25.1-360.2 pmol/L), (P < 0.001). The HE4 levels increase significantly with increasing tumor size: diameter of larger than 2 cm, median of 86.9 pmol/L (35.8-820.8 pmol/L), versus diameter of smaller than 2 cm, median of 52.2 pmol/L (33.3-146.8 pmol/L), (P < 0.001). In our population, HE4 did not correlate with the histological grade, endometrial cancer type I versus type II (P=0.86), the lymphovascular infiltration (P=0.12), and the cervical invasion (P = 0.6). We established a new variable, considering 3 high-risk tumor features: MI of greater than 50% and/or histologicalG3 and/or type II. Humanepididymis protein 4 levels significantly increase in high-risk tumors (high risk HE4, 93.6 pmol/L vs low-medium risk, 65.5 pmol/L; P < 0.001).Conclusions: A preoperative HE4 evaluation could help stratify patients with deep invasion and/or metastatic disease and is correlated with other relevant prognostic factors to be considered to tailor an adequate surgical strategy.

TI  - A new spectral similarity water index for the estimation of leaf water content from hyperspectral data of leaves
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The variability of leaf water content has considerable significance for plant-environment interactions, ecosystem functioning and crop growth. This paper describes a methodology used to create spectral similarity water indices (SWIs) to accurately retrieve leaf water content based on the similarity between the leaf reflectance spectra and the specific water absorption spectrum. The abilities of six common distance metrics to capture spectral features were tested using two in situ datasets (LOPEX93 and PANAMA) and one simulation dataset (PROSPECT). These three datasets were also used to determine the most appropriate spectral intervals and to verify the performance of SWIs against six frequently used spectral indices that were specifically designed to estimate vegetation water content. Our results demonstrate that the Spectral Angle Cosine (SAC) is the most effective metric to capture useful spectral information pertinent to the equivalent water thickness (EWT), and three spectral intervals (9701150, 1330-1350 and 1584-1760 nm) are suitable for the retrieval of leaf water content. The SWIs were then created based on the SAC distances in these three spectral intervals respectively. The results demonstrate that SWISAC indices are better indicators of leaf water content and more tolerant to species differences than the six spectral indices, including the Shortwave Angle Normalized Index (SANI), Shortwave Angle Slope Index (SASI), Moisture Stress Index (MSI), Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Maximum Difference Water Index (MDWI). In addition, the most accurate estimates of EWT were achieved from a single SAC distance with nRMSE of 4.08% ((R) over bar (2) = 0.98), 3.63% ((R) over bar (2) = 0.95) and 8.11% ((R) over bar (2) = 0.80) for PROSPECT, LOPEX93 and PANAMA, respectively. Models that combine two SAC distances from the near-infrared and shortwave infrared regions produce an even better overall performance. Spectral similarity metrics may be a new effective tool to capture useful spectral information pertinent to leaf biochemical components, not only EWT but also other components such as chlorophyll and nitrogen content and they have potential to be adapted to canopy level observations.

TI  - Latitude Variability of Acoustic-Gravity Waves in the Upper Atmosphere Based on Satellite Data
T2  - GEOMAGNETISM AND AERONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on satellite measurements, we investigated the properties of acoustic-gravity waves in different geographical areas of the Earth's upper atmosphere. To study wave activity at high latitudes, we used the concentration of neutral particles measured by the low-altitude polar satellite Dynamic Explorer 2 and measurements from the equatorial satellite Atmosphere Explorer-E for analysis of waves at low latitudes. In the range of heights 250-400 km, there are observed latitudinal variations of amplitudes, together with variations in the morphological and spectral properties of acoustic-gravity waves. In the polar regions of thermosphere, the wave amplitudes amount to 3-10% in terms of relative variations of density and do not exceed 3% at low and middle latitudes. At low latitudes, regular fluctuations induced by the solar terminator are clearly seen with a predominant wave mode moving synchronously with terminator. Moreover, at low and middle latitudes, there are observed sporadic local wave packets of small amplitudes (1-2%) that can have origins of various natures. We also investigated the relation between some of the observed wave trains and the earthquakes.

TI  - Urban vegetation phenology analysis using high spatio-temporal NDVI time series
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of current products can partially reach the requirement of high spatial and temporal resolution needed in urban applications. Fortunately, the new generation of satellite in a form of constellation, e.g. Europe's Sentinel2, China's HJ-1A/B and GF-1/6, is expected to provide more frequent observations (< 1 week) with a higher spatial resolution (< 30 m). Consequently, a proper method should be selected to construct high spatio-temporal time-series NDVI and to derive phenological features for urban applications. In this study, a high spatio-temporal NDVI product for urban scale vegetation time series is conducted based on HJ-1A/B data. Three related issues, i.e. the optimal filter, time series decomposition, phenological features derivation are addressed. In addition, the effect of spatial and temporal resolution on the phenological features extraction is also discussed according to the comparison between the derived NDVI product and that extracted from MODIS. The results show that the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filter is the best filter for the reconstruction of HJ NDVI time series. There is some difference for phenology derivation using "season" and "season + trend" depending on the absence/presence of breakpoints in the curve. The spatial details of phenological features can be built by the high-spatial time-series NDVI, showing a great potential in urban applications. Compared with the MODIS NDVI time series, HJ NDVI time series can get more detail information than overall phenological features because of its high spatiotemporal resolution.

TI  - Assessment of Virus Interference in a Test-negative Study of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The observational test-negative study design is used to estimate vaccine effectiveness against influenza virus infection. An important assumption of the test-negative design is that vaccination does not affect the risk of infection with another virus. If such virus interference occurred, detection of other respiratory viruses would be more common among influenza vaccine recipients and vaccine effectiveness estimates could differ. We evaluated the potential for virus interference using data from the Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project.Methods: From 2010 to 2013, outpatients presenting to clinics in 13 US jurisdictions with acute respiratory infections were tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses. We investigated whether virus interference might affect vaccine effectiveness estimates by first evaluating the sensitivity of estimates using alternative control groups that include or exclude patients with other respiratory virus detections by age group and early/middle/late stage of influenza seasons. Second, we evaluated the association between influenza vaccination receipt and other respiratory virus detection among influenza test-negative patients.Results: Influenza was detected in 3,743/10,650 patients (35%), and overall vaccine effectiveness was 47% (95% CI: 42%, 52%). Estimates using each control group were consistent overall or when stratified by age groups, and there were no differences among early, middle, or late phase during influenza season. We found no associations between detection of other respiratory viruses and receipt of influenza vaccination.Conclusions: In this 3-year test-negative design study in an outpatient setting in the United States, we found no evidence of virus interference or impact on influenza vaccine effectiveness estimation.

TI  - A Slip Gap of the 2016 M<sub>w</sub> 6.6 Muji, Xinjiang, China, Earthquake Inferred from Sentinel-1 TOPS Interferometry
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We use Sentinel-1A/1B Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans (TOPS) data to map coseismic and postseismic displacements for the 25 November 2016 M-w 6.6 Muji earthquake in southwestern Xinjiang, China. Two tracks (T27 and T107) of the TOPS data captured the coseismic deformation area with a maximum line-of-sight deformation of similar to 0.25 m in the descending track (T107). The inverted best-fitting coseismic slip model in this study shows that the mainshock was a right-lateral strike-slip rupture on the western segment of the Muji fault, with an optimal dip angle of 80 degrees +/- 4 degrees. Two separated slip zones exist in the coseismic slip model, with the maximum slip of 1.6 m located in the western slip zone. The total geodetic moment is 9.87 x 10(18) N.m, equivalent to an earthquake of M-w 6.6. Our model shows that a patch between the two slip zones remained unruptured during the mainshock, indicating a potential future seismic risk. Aftershocks recorded in the first 45 days after the mainshock delineate the modeled rupture patches well. The components of the regional Global Positioning System velocities parallel to the Muji fault have been inverted to obtain an interseismic slip rate of similar to 10 mm/yr on this structure. The recent large strike-slip earthquakes in this area, that is, the 2015 M-w 7.2 Tajikistan earthquake (left-lateral) and 2016 M-w 6.6 Muji earthquake (right-lateral), may be an indicator of conjugate fault systems at the west boundary between the Indian and Eurasian plates in response to north-south convergence produced by the collision of the two plates.

TI  - Evaluation of AMSR-E retrieval by detecting soil moisture decrease following massive dryland re-vegetation in the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of soil moisture, however varied in space and time, is critical for planning land use in water-limited drylands. Although satellite observations provide soil moisture instantaneously at large scale, few studies have addressed the application of satellite soil moisture retrieval in dryland areas with changing land use. In this study, we propose a method to evaluate the spatiotemporal variance of satellite retrieval based on the evaluation of soil moisture retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The operation period of this instrument (June 2002 to October 2011) covers the re-vegetation of the semi-arid Loess Plateau. Our study found that AMSR-E retrievals posted by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) capture the spatiotemporal variance of soil moisture in the Loess Plateau, as well as the in-situ measured soil moisture decrease following the massive re-vegetation-despite it differing from the in-situ measurement in spatial scale. Soil moisture decrease in response to the massive re-vegetation occurred in a transition zone of grass-forest ecosystems with annual precipitation between 450 and 550 mm. Our study suggests that current AMSR-E JAXA retrievals are an essential alternative to field measurement and model simulation, because they can identify the location and spatial extent of areas where soil moisture is sensitive to climate change and managed re-vegetation. To avoid the overconsumption of soil water and limited plant growth in transition zone, managers of dryland areas should pay special attention to species selection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Testing the potential of Sentinel-1A TOPS interferometry for the detection and monitoring of landslides at local scale (Veneto Region, Italy)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent Sentinel-1 mission, started by the European Space Agency in April 2014, provides the scientific community with new capabilities for the monitoring of the Earth surface. In particular, the Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans imaging technique used in the Interferometric Wide swath acquisition mode permits to acquire data over very wide areas (250 km of swath extension) at 20-m spatial resolution, with 12-day revisit time, making it suitable for ground displacement monitoring applications. With more than 1 year of synthetic aperture radar images available, it is now possible to carry out monitoring activities of slow moving phenomena such as landslides at both regional and local scales. In this work, the potential of Sentinel-1A for the monitoring of shallow (from 2 to 6 m of depth) landslides occurring in the North-Eastern Italian Pre-Alps was tested. Two stacks of Sentinel-1A scenes acquired in both ascending and descending orbits were processed using the Permanent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique. The results, analysed in terms of PS density and quality, were compared with the ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT PSI database available from the Italian National Cartographic Portal to assess the capabilities of Sentinel-1A in detecting and monitoring landslides in respect to the previous satellite missions. The results of this work show the great potential of Sentinel-1A in the continuous monitoring of landslide-prone territories even at local scale. The achievable results can provide information that is useful to delineate the spatial and temporal evolution of landslides and precisely assess their rates of deformation.

TI  - <i>Surface Deformation of North-Central Oklahoma Related to the 2016 M</i><sub>w</sub> <i>5.8 Pawnee Earthquake from SAR Interferometry Time Series</i>
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 3 September 2016 M-w 5.8 Pawnee earthquake shook a large area of north-central Oklahoma and was the largest instrumentally recorded earthquake in the state. We processed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) from the Copernicus Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B and Canadian RADARSAT-2 satellites with interferometric SAR analysis for the area of north-central Oklahoma that surrounds Pawnee. The interferograms do not show phase discontinuities that would indicate surface ruptures during the earthquake. Individual interferograms have substantial atmospheric noise caused by variations in radar propagation delays due to tropospheric water vapor, so we performed a time-series analysis of the Sentinel-1 stack to obtain a more accurate estimate of the ground deformation in the coseismic time interval and the time variation of deformation before and after the earthquake. The time-series fit for a step function at the time of the Pawnee shows about 3 cm peak-to-peak amplitude of the coseismic surface deformation in the radar line of sight with a spatial pattern that is consistent with fault slip on a plane trending east-southeast. This fault, which we call the Sooner Lake fault, is parallel to the west-northwest nodal plane of the U.S. Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center moment tensor solution. We model the fault plane by fitting hypoDD-relocated aftershocks aligned in the same trend. Our preferred slip model on this assumed fault plane, allowing only strike-slip motion, has no slip shallower than 2.3 km depth, an area of moderate slip extending 7 km along strike between 2.3 and 4.5 km depth (which could be due to aftershocks and afterslip), and larger slip between 4.5 and 14 km depth extending about 12 km along strike. The large slip below the 4.5 km depth of our relocated hypocenter indicates that the coseismic rupture propagated down-dip. The time-series results do not show significant deformation before or after the earthquake above the high atmospheric noise level within about 40 km of the earthquake rupture.

TI  - Forecast of wheat yield throughout the agricultural season using optical and radar satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to estimate the capabilities of forecasting the yield of wheat using an artificial neural network combined with multi-temporal satellite data acquired at high spatial resolution throughout the agricultural season in the optical and/or microwave domains. Reflectance (acquired by Formosat-2, and Spot 4-5 in the green, red, and near infrared wavelength) and multi-configuration backscattering coefficients (acquired by TerraSAR-X and Radarsat-2 in the X- and C-bands, at co- (abbreviated HH and VV) and cross-polarization states (abbreviated HV and VH)) constitute the input variable of the artificial neural networks, which are trained and validated on the successively acquired images, providing yield forecast in near real-time conditions. The study is based on data collected over 32 fields of wheat distributed over a study area located in southwestern France, near Toulouse. Among the tested sensor configurations, several satellite data appear useful for the yield forecasting throughout the agricultural season (showing coefficient of determination (R-2) larger than 0.60 and a root mean square error (RMSE) lower than 9.1 quintals by hectare (q ha(-1))): C-vH, C-Hv, or the combined used of X-HH and C-HH, C-HH and C-Hv, or green reflectance and C-HH. Nevertheless, the best accurate forecast (R-2 = 0.76 and RMSE= 7.0 q ha(-1)) is obtained longtime before the harvest (on day 98, during the elongation of stems) using the combination of co- and cross-polarized backscattering coefficients acquired in the C-band (C-vv and C-vH). These results highlight the high interest of using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data instead of optical ones to early forecast the yield before the harvest of wheat. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Comparing Sentinel-2A and Landsat 7 and 8 Using Surface Reflectance over Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The new Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Imager instrument has a set of bands with very similar spectral windows to the main bands of the Landsat Thematic Mapper family of instruments. While these should, in principle, give broadly comparable measurements, any differences are a function not only of the differences in the sensor responses, but also of the spectral characteristics of the target pixels. In order to test for and quantify differences between these sensors, a large set of coincident imagery was assembled for the Australian landscape. Comparisons were carried out in terms of surface reflectance, and also in terms of biophysical quantities estimated from the reflectances. Small but consistent differences were found, and suitable adjustment equations fitted to enable transformation of Sentinel-2A reflectance values to more closely match Landsat-7 or Landsat-8 values. This is useful if trying to take models and thresholds fitted from Landsat and use them with Sentinel-2. The fitted adjustment equations were also compared against those fitted globally for NASA's Harmonized Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 product, and found to be substantially different, raising the possibility that such adjustments need to be fitted on a regional basis.

TI  - Rainfall validates MODIS-derived NDVI as an index of spatio-temporal variation in green biomass across non-montane semi-arid and arid Central Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - As satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is related to vegetation biomass, it may provide a proxy for habitat quality across extensive species ranges where ground-truth data are scarce. However, NDVI may have limited accuracy in sparsely-vegetated arid and semi-arid environments due to signal contamination by substrate reflectance. To validate NDVI as a vegetation proxy in the low altitude deserts of Central Asia, we examine its response to precipitation across the migratory corridor of Asian Houbara Chlamydotis macqueenii, a threatened gamebird occupying deserts from the Middle East to China. Restricting NDVI data by altitude (masking higher elevations unoccupied by n = 61 satellite tracked houbara) and 2009 Globcover land cover (excluding cropland and built-up area), we relate moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data to Global Precipitation Climatology Project precipitation data across five World Wildlife Fund semi-arid ecoregions (totaling 4.06 million km(2)). We examine this both spatially (per 1 cell, mean annual NDVI and mean precipitation over 16 years, 2000-2015); and temporally (annual NDVI and annual precipitation) using separate temporal General Linear Models per cell and an overall Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) (including cell ID as a random effect). We sought to explain spatial variation in the NDVI-precipitation relation among temporal per degree-cell models, in terms of the slope (strength) and adjusted (adj.) R-2 (explanatory power), using inter-annual mean NDVI (2000-2015) and Gridded Livestock of the World livestock density. NDVI increases with precipitation, both spatially (adj. R-2 = 0.58, p < 0.001) and temporally (mean adj. R-2 across n = 244,1 cells = 0.44; GLMM across cells p < 0.001). More vegetated regions show a stronger temporal response of vegetation biomass for a given precipitation increment (slope of NDVI to precipitation in per cell temporal models increases with inter-annual mean NDVI; adj. R-2 = 0.38, p < 0.001), reinforcing the conclusion that NDVI provides a proxy for vegetation abundance. The slope of this relation did not differ among ecoregions. Although livestock density is generally assumed to degrade vegetation and weaken the NDVI-precipitation relationship, explanatory power (adj. R-2 of per cell NDVI-precipitation models) is weakly, but positively, related to livestock density (adj. R-2 = 0.02, p = 0.011). This may be because we assess livestock at a coarse grain, at scales where overall stocking density is positively associated with vegetation abundance, but may also indicate that livestock are not degrading vegetation at regional landscape-scales despite potential localized effects. The strong signature of rainfall shows MODIS NDVI offers a potentially powerful proxy for spatial and temporal variation in arid and semi-arid vegetation at a resolution of 1 and 1 year over the houbara's breeding and wintering range, and probably also at finer spatial resolutions. NDVI can therefore be used in analyses relating (a) staging and wintering site selection to variation in habitat among potential wintering locations, and (b) variation within and between localities to demographic carry-over effects.

T2  - BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining realistic land-surface states for initial and boundary conditions is important for the numerical weather prediction of many atmospheric phenomena. Here we investigate model sensitivity to land use and snow cover for a persistent wintertime cold-air pool in northern Utah during 1-8 January 2011. A Weather Research and Forecast model simulation using the 1993 United States Geological Survey land-use and North American Mesoscale model reanalysis snow-cover datasets is compared to an improved configuration using the modified 2011 National Land Cover Database and a more realistic representation of snow cover. The improved surface specification results in an increase (decrease) in urban land cover (Great Salt Lake surface area), and changes to the snow-cover initialization, depth, extent, and albedo. The results obtained from the model simulations are compared to observations collected during the Persistent Cold-Air Pool Study. The changes in land use and snow cover and the resulting impacts on the surface albedo and surface heat fluxes contributed to near-surface air temperature increases of 1-2 degrees C in urban areas and decreases of 2-4 degrees C in areas surrounding the Great Salt Lake. Although wind speeds in the boundary layer were overestimated in both simulations, shallow thermally-driven and terrain-forced flows were generally lessened in intensity and breadth in response to the decreased areal extent of the Great Salt Lake and increases in the urban footprint.

TI  - Size-resolved particulate matter concentrations derived from 4.4 km-resolution size-fractionated Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aerosol optical depth over Southern California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is significant public health interest in gaining a better understanding of the health effects associated with particulate matter (PM) of differing sizes and compositions. Unfortunately the PM monitoring data needed for such studies are limited. Satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been used to overcome this limitation, but existing techniques using AOD to estimate surface concentrations of PMhave limited ability to differentiate particle size and type, and the spatial resolution is often too coarse to evaluate PM variability on local scales. Fortunately there has been a significant breakthrough in aerosol product from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument onboard the NASA Terra satellite. Recent computational advances have made it possible to derive a "local mode" MISR aerosol product at a spatial resolution of 4.4 km that maintains the quality of the 17.6 km resolution Version 22 operational aerosol product. MISR is uniquely capable of providing total AOD as well as AOD fractionated by size (small, medium, and large), enabling estimation of size-resolved surface PM concentrations.Total and size-fractionated AOD from the MISR 4.4 km aerosol product were used to develop spatio-temporal models to estimate surface concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and PM2.5 chemical species over Southern California. We found, and confirmed by leave-one-site-out cross validation, that PM2.5 was best estimated with a spatio-temporal model of AOD small + medium that also included adjustment for relative humidity and wind speed (R-2 = 0.67, CV R-2= 0.51), while PM10 was best estimated from AOD large with adjustment for dew point and wind speed (R-2 = 0.76, CV R-2 = 0.44). Total AOD was most strongly associated with PM2.5 components SO4 2 ( R-2= 0.74, CV R-2= 0.69) and NO3(-)(R-2= 0.72, CV R-2= 0.39). The best fitting models were applied to all available MISR aerosol retrievals over the region, generating surfaces of estimated size-resolved PM concentrations that will be a great asset to the environmental science and public health communities.

TI  - Using super-high resolution satellite imagery to census threatened albatrosses
T2  - IBIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is the first to utilize 30-cm resolution imagery from the WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite to count wildlife directly. We test the accuracy of the satellite method for directly counting individuals at a well-studied colony of Wandering Albatross Diomedea exulans at South Georgia, and then apply it to the closely related Northern Royal Albatross Diomedea sanfordi, which is near-endemic to the Chatham Islands and of unknown recent population status due to the remoteness and limited accessibility of the colonies. At South Georgia, satellite-based counts were comparable to ground-based counts of Wandering Albatross nests, with a slight over-estimation due to the presence of non-breeding birds. In the Chatham Islands, satellite-based counts of Northern Royal Albatross in the 2015/2016 season were similar to ground-based counts undertaken on the Forty-Fours islands in 2009/2010, but much lower than ground-based counts undertaken on The Sisters islands in 2009/2010, which is of major conservation concern for this endangered albatross species. We conclude that the ground-breaking resolution of the newly available WV-3 satellite will provide a step change in our ability to count albatrosses and other large birds directly from space without disturbance, at potentially lower cost and with minimal logistical effort.

TI  - Sexual health in the community: Services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities
T2  - DISABILITY AND HEALTH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sexuality is a central dimension of overall health and well-being. People with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) continue to experience disparities in healthcare, particularly regarding access to sexual health related services. Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) waivers are ideally situated to provide sexual and reproductive healthcare in accessible settings.Objective: This preliminary study analyzed national Medicaid HCBS waivers to determine how they provide sexuality services for people with IDD.Methods: 111 FY 2015 HCBS 1915(c) waivers for people with IDD from 46 states and the District of Columbia were analyzed to determine which waivers were providing services related to sexuality. Expenditure and utilization data were analyzed to determine service allotment.Results: Currently, less than 12% of waivers include any kind of sexuality services, and those services provided are predominantly reactive, rather than proactive. Reactive services focused on interrupting sexually inappropriate behaviors through assessments and plans, intervention and therapy, and supervision. Meanwhile, proactive services promoted the healthy sexuality of people with IDD by providing sexuality education related to sexuality awareness, reproduction, and victimization avoidance.Conclusions: The limited availability of Medicaid HCBS sexuality service provision not only hints at a lack of understanding of sexuality for people with IDD, but also presents an opportunity to perform increased evaluations on current service offerings in order to justify future expanded offerings in other states.

TI  - Mapping Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Using RapidEye Satellite Data: The Example of Lake Kummerow (Germany)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) is sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and plays an important role as a long-term indictor for the trophic state of freshwater lakes. Variations in water level height, nutrient condition, light availability and water temperature affect the growth and species composition of SAV. Detailed information about seasonal variations in littoral bottom coverage are still unknown, although these effects are expected to mask climate change-related long-term changes, as derived by snapshots of standard monitoring methods included in the European Water Framework Directive. Remote sensing offers concepts to map SAV quickly, within large areas, and at short intervals. This study analyses the potential of a semi-empirical method to map littoral bottom coverage by a multi-seasonal approach. Depth-invariant indices were calculated for four Atmospheric & Topographic Correction (ATCOR2) atmospheric corrected RapidEye data sets acquired at Lake Kummerow, Germany, between June and August 2015. RapidEye data evaluation was supported by in situ measurements of the diffuse attenuation coefficient of the water column and bottom reflectance. The processing chain was able to differentiate between SAV and sandy sediment. The successive increase of SAV coverage from June to August was correctly monitored. Comparisons with in situ and Google Earth imagery revealed medium accuracies (kappa coefficient = 0.61, overall accuracy = 72.2%). The analysed time series further revealed how water constituents and temporary surface phenomena such as sun glint or algal blooms influence the identification success of lake bottom substrates. An abundant algal bloom biased the interpretability of shallow water substrate such that a differentiation of sediments and SAV patches failed completely. Despite the documented limitations, mapping of SAV using RapidEye seems possible, even in eutrophic lakes.

TI  - Minimizing the Residual Topography Effect on Interferograms to Improve DInSAR Results: Estimating Land Subsidence in Port-Said City, Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate detection of land subsidence rates in urban areas is important to identify damage-prone areas and provide decision-makers with useful information. Meanwhile, no precise measurements of land subsidence have been undertaken within the coastal Port-Said City in Egypt to evaluate its hazard in relationship to sea-level rise. In order to address this shortcoming, this work introduces and evaluates a methodology that substantially improves small subsidence rate estimations in an urban setting. Eight ALOS/PALSAR-1 scenes were used to estimate the land subsidence rates in Port-Said City, using the Small BAse line Subset (SBAS) DInSAR technique. A stereo pair of ALOS/PRISM was used to generate an accurate DEM to minimize the residual topography effect on the generated interferograms. A total of 347 well distributed ground control points (GCP) were collected in Port-Said City using the leveling instrument to calibrate the generated DEM. Moreover, the eight PALSAR scenes were co-registered using 50 well-distributed GCPs and used to generate 22 interferogram pairs. These PALSAR interferograms were subsequently filtered and used together with the coherence data to calculate the phase unwrapping. The phase-unwrapped interferogram-pairs were then evaluated to discard four interferograms that were affected by phase jumps and phase ramps. Results confirmed that using an accurate DEM (ALOS/PRISM) was essential for accurately detecting small deformations. The vertical displacement rate during the investigated period (2007-2010) was estimated to be -28 mm. The results further indicate that the northern area of Port-Said City has been subjected to higher land subsidence rates compared to the southern area. Such land subsidence rates might induce significant environmental changes with respect to sea-level rise.

TI  - A Risk Model for the Lyme Disease <i>Vector Ixodes scapularis</i> (Acari: Ixodidae) in the Prairie Provinces of Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lyme disease is emerging in Canada due to geographic range expansion of the tick vector Ixodes scapularis Say. Recent areas of emergence include parts of the southeastern Canadian Prairie region. We developed a map of potential risk areas for future I. scapularis establishment in the Canadian Prairie Provinces. Six I. scapularis risk algorithms were developed using different formulations of three indices for environmental suitability: temperature using annual cumulative degree-days > 0 degrees C (DD > 0 degrees C; obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data as an index of conditions that allow I. scapularis to complete its life cycle), habitat as a combined geo-layer of forest cover and agricultural land use, and rainfall. The relative performance of these risk algorithms was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) analysis with data on presence-absence of I. scapularis obtained from recent field surveillance in the Prairie Provinces accumulated from a number of sources. The ROC AUC values for the risk algorithms were significantly different (P<0.01). The algorithm with six categories of DD > 0 degrees C, habitat as a simple dichotomous variable of presence or absence of forest, and normalized rainfall had the highest AUC of 0.74, representing "fair to good" performance of the risk algorithm. This algorithm had good (>80%) sensitivity in predicting positive I. scapularis surveillance sites, but low (50%) specificity as expected in this region where not all environmentally suitable habitats are expected to be occupied. Further prospective studies are needed to validate and perhaps improve the risk algorithm.

T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The objective of this study is to describe the anatomic location of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) of patients with lung carcinoma and to analyze its relationship with the characteristics of the tumor.Patients and methods 98 Stage I lung cancer patients were included in the study. SLN was marked just after performing the thoracotomy by injecting peritumorally 0.25 mCi of nanocolloid of albumin (Nanocol1) labeled with Tc-99 m in 0.3 ml, and later, it was resected. For SLN micrometastasis analysis, CEACAM5, BPIFA1, and CK7 gene expression at mRNA level was studied. Possible relation between tumor characteristics and SLN location was analyzed.Results While most of the SLN were located in hilar area, we find a significantly higher number of SLN located in mediastinal stations when the lesion is in the left upper lobe (LUL). This difference disappears in the group of SLN with a positive result in the micrometastasis study. Regarding tumor size, squamous tumors and tumors located in the left lower lobe (LLL) were found significantly larger.Conclusion The location of the SLN in patients with stage I lung cancer is predominantly hilar, being less consistent in the left hemithorax. The tumor size or histological type is not variables that affect this distribution. The distribution of SLNs with a positive result in the analysis of micrometastasis suggests further spread to the hilar areas when the lesion is in the LUL and to the mediastinal zones when it is in the LLL.

TI  - Multitemporal Landsat Missing Data Recovery Based on Tempo-Spectral Angle Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal Landsat images play an important role in remote sensing applications. Unfortunately, missing data caused by cloud cover and sensor-specific problems have seriously limited its application. To improve the usability of Landsat data, several recovery methods have been proposed to fill the missing values. But, current studies mostly focus on spatial dimension and ignore the continuity of data in time dimension. More importantly, multitemporal images have more potential than single image in selecting similar pixels for recovering the missing pixels. In this paper, to recover missing pixels by jointly utilizing multispectral and multitemporal information, tempo-spectral angle mapping (TSAM) is proposed at first to measure tempo-spectral similarity between pixels described in spectral dimension and temporal dimension. Then, a multitemporal replacement method is used to recover missing data with the pixel selected by TSAM. Two new indices are also proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of TSAM. Simulated and actual multitemporal scanline corrector-off and cloud cover-Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images were used to assess the performance of our filling method. The quantitative evaluations suggest that the proposed method can predict the missing values accurately. The recovered results show that our method can keep the continuity of the boundary and is robust for the data with high percentage of missing.

TI  - Past and future effects of climate change on spatially heterogeneous vegetation activity in China
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is a major driver of vegetation activity but its complex ecological relationships impede research efforts. In this study, the spatial distribution and dynamic characteristics of climate change effects on vegetation activity in China from the 1980s to the 2010s and from 2021 to 2050 were investigated using a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The GWR model was based on combined datasets of satellite vegetation index, climate observation and projection, and future vegetation productivity simulation. Our results revealed that the significantly positive precipitation-vegetation relationship was and will be mostly distributed in North China. However, the regions with temperature-dominated distribution of vegetation activity were and will be mainly located in South China. Due to the varying climate features and vegetation cover, the spatial correlation between vegetation activity and climate change may be altered. There will be different dominant climatic factors for vegetation activity distribution in some regions such as Northwest China, and even opposite correlations in Northeast China. Additionally, the response of vegetation activity to precipitation will move southward in the next three decades. In contrast, although the high warming rate will restrain the vegetation activity, precipitation variability could modify hydrothermal conditions for vegetation activity. This observation is exemplified in the projected future enhancement of vegetation activity in the Tibetan Plateau and weakened vegetation activity in East and Middle China. Furthermore, the vegetation in most parts of North China may adapt to an arid environment, whereas in many southern areas, vegetation will be repressed by water shortage in the future.

TI  - Spectral similarity approach for mapping turbidity of an inland waterbody
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity is an important quality parameter of water from its optical property point of view. It varies spatio-temporally over large waterbodies and its well distributed measurement on field is tedious and time consuming. Generally, normalized difference turbidity index (NOT!), or band ratio, or regression analysis between turbidity concentration and band reflectance, approaches have been adapted to retrieve turbidity using multispectral remote sensing data. These techniques usually provide qualitative rather than quantitative estimates of turbidity. However, in the present study, spectral similarity analysis, between the spectral characteristics of spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensing data and spectral library generated on field, was carried out to quantify turbidity in the part of Chilika Lake, Odisha, India. Spatial spectral contextual image analysis, spectral angle mapper (SAM) technique was evaluated for the same. The SAM spectral matching technique has been widely used in geological application (mineral mapping), however, the application of this kind of techniques is limited in water quality studies due to non availability of reference spectral libraries. A spectral library was generated on field for the different concentrations of turbidity using well calibrated instruments like field spectro-radiometer, turbidity meter and hand held global positioning system. The field spectra were classified into 7 classes of turbidity concentration as <5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-25, 25-45, 45-100 and >100 NTU for analysis. Analysis reveal that at each location in the lake under consideration, the field spectra matched with the image spectra with SAM score of 0.8 and more. The observed turbidity at each location was also very much falling in the estimated turbidity class range. It was observed that the spectral similarity approach provides more quantitative estimate of turbidity as compared to NDTI. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - On the Design of Radar Corner Reflectors for Deformation Monitoring in Multi-Frequency InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Trihedral corner reflectors are being increasingly used as point targets in deformation monitoring studies using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques. The frequency and size dependence of the corner reflector Radar Cross Section (RCS) means that no single design can perform equally in all the possible imaging modes and radar frequencies available on the currently orbiting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites. Therefore, either a corner reflector design tailored to a specific data type or a compromise design for multiple data types is required. In this paper, I outline the practical and theoretical considerations that need to be made when designing appropriate radar targets, with a focus on supporting multi-frequency SAR data. These considerations are tested by performing field experiments on targets of different size using SAR images from TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed and RADARSAT-2. Phase noise behaviour in SAR images can be estimated by measuring the Signal-to-Clutter ratio (SCR) in individual SAR images. The measured SCR of a point target is dependent on its RCS performance and the influence of clutter near to the deployed target. The SCR is used as a metric to estimate the expected InSAR displacement error incurred by the design of each target and to validate these observations against theoretical expectations. I find that triangular trihedral corner reflectors as small as 1 m in dimension can achieve a displacement error magnitude of a tenth of a millimetre or less in medium-resolution X-band data. Much larger corner reflectors (2.5 m or greater) are required to achieve the same displacement error magnitude in medium-resolution C-band data. Compromise designs should aim to satisfy the requirements of the lowest SAR frequency to be used, providing that these targets will not saturate the sensor of the highest frequency to be used. Finally, accurate boresight alignment of the corner reflector can be critical to the overall target performance. Alignment accuracies better than 4 degrees in azimuth and elevation will incur a minimal impact on the displacement error in X and C-band data.

TI  - New MPEG-7 Scalable Color Descriptor Based on Polar Coordinates for Multispectral Earth Observation Image Analysis
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuously expanding high-resolution and very high resolution multispectral image collections, provided by remote sensing satellites, require specific methods and techniques for data analysis and understanding. Even though there are several patch-based approaches for image classification and indexing, none of them are integrated within a standard. Having the goal to develop an MPEG-7 compliant descriptor for patch-based multispectral earth observation image classification and indexing, we propose a new feature extraction method able to extract maximum information from all the available spectral bands that Sentinel 2, the last generation of remote sensing satellites, provides. Using the polar coordinate transformation of the reflectance values, we obtain illumination invariant features, which can be used along with the scalable color descriptor present in MPEG-7 standard. Also, our method proves to enhance land cover classification of the areas affected by clouds and their shadows and provide similar classification results compared with the homogeneous texture descriptor (HTD), spectral histogram (SH), concatenated HTD with SH features, spectral indices (SIs), and bag-of-words-based descriptors, such as bag-of-SIs and bag-of-spectral-values on cloud-free areas.

TI  - MODIS VCF should not be used to detect discontinuities in tree cover due to binning bias. A comment on Hanan et al. (2014) and Staver and Hansen (2015)
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In their recent paper, Staver and Hansen (Global Ecology and Biogeography, 2015, 24, 985-987) refute the case made by Hanan et al. (Global Ecology and Biogeography, 2014, 23, 259-263) that the use of classification and regression trees (CARTs) to predict tree cover from remotely sensed imagery (MODIS VCF) inherently introduces biases, thus making the resulting tree cover unsuitable for showing alternative stable states through tree cover frequency distribution analyses. Here we provide a new and equally fundamental argument for why the published frequency distributions should not be used for such purposes. We show that the practice of pre-average binning of tree cover values used to derive cover values to train the CART model will also introduce errors in the frequency distributions of the final product. We demonstrate that the frequency minima found at tree covers of 8-18%, 33-45% and 55-75% can be attributed to numerical biases introduced when training samples are derived from landscapes containing asymmetric tree cover distributions and/or a tree cover gradient. So it is highly likely that the CART, used to produce MODIS VCF, delivers tree cover frequency distributions that do not reflect the real world situation.

TI  - The superparamagnetic iron oxide tracer: a valid alternative in sentinel node biopsy for breast cancer treatment
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Union has determined that from 2016 breast cancer patients should be treated in Specialist Breast Units that achieve the minimum standards for the mandatory quality indicators as defined by Eusoma. The existing standard for axillary lymph node staging in breast cancer is sentinel node biopsy (SNB), performed using Technetium-sulphur colloid (Tc-99m) alone or with blue dye. The major limits of radioisotope consist in the problems linked to radioactivity, in the shortage of tracer and nuclear medicine units. Among existing alternative tracers, SentiMag (R), which uses superparamagnetic iron oxide particles, can represent a valid option for SNB. We conducted a paired, prospective, multicentre study to evaluate the non-inferiority of SentiMag (R) vs. Tc-99m. The primary end point was the detection rate (DR) per patient. The study sample consists of 193 women affected by breast carcinoma with negative axillary assessment. The concordance rate per patients between Tc-99m and SentiMag (R) was 97.9%. The DR per patient was 99.0% for Tc-99m and 97.9% for SentiMag (R). SentiMag (R) appears to be non-inferior to the radiotracer and safe. While Tc-99m remains the standard, SentiMag (R) DR appears adequate after a minimum learning curve. In health care settings where nuclear medicine units are not available, SentiMag/Sienna+(R) allows effective treatment of breast cancer patients.

TI  - Medication incidents in primary care medicine: a prospective study in the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network (<i>Sentinella)</i>
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To describe the type, frequency, seasonal and regional distribution of medication incidents in primary care in Switzerland and to elucidate possible risk factors for medication incidents.Design Prospective surveillance study.Setting Swiss primary healthcare, Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network.Participants Patients with drug treatment who experienced any erroneous event related to the medication process and interfering with normal treatment course, as judged by their physician. The 180 physicians in the study were general practitioners or paediatricians participating in the Swiss Federal Sentinel reporting system in 2015.Outcomes Primary: medication incidents; secondary: potential risk factors like age, gender, polymedication, morbidity, care-dependency, previous hospitalisation.Results The mean rates of detected medication incidents were 2.07 per general practitioner per year (46.5 per 1 00 000 contacts) and 0.15 per paediatrician per year (2.8 per 1 00 000 contacts), respectively. The following factors were associated with medication incidents (OR, 95% CI): higher age 1.004 per year (1.001;1.006), care by community nurse 1.458 (1.025;2.073) and care by an institution 1.802 (1.399;2.323), chronic conditions 1.052 (1.029;1.075) per condition, medications 1.052 (1.030;1.074) per medication, as well as Thurgau Morbidity Index for stage 4:1.292 (1.004;1.662), stage 5:1.420 (1.078;1.868) and stage 6:1.680 (1.178;2.396), respectively. Most cases were linked to an incorrect dosage for a given patient, while prescription of an erroneous medication was the second most common error.Conclusions Medication incidents are common in adult primary care, whereas they rarely occur in paediatrics. Older and multimorbid patients are at a particularly high risk for medication incidents. Reasons for medication incidents are diverse but often seem to be linked to communication problems.

T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2009, Oklahoma has experienced a soar in induced seismicity, a side effect of extensive saltwater injection into subsurface sedimentary rocks. The seismic hazard entailed by these regional-scale injection operations is, however, difficult to assess. The 3 September 2016 M-w 5.8 Pawnee earthquake is the largest since the increase of seismic activity. The event was preceded by an m(b) 3.2 foreshock two days prior, and changes in injection rates have been reported on wastewater disposal wells located less than 10 km from the epicenter, suggesting that the earthquake may have been induced. Using Sentinel-1 spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar, we unambiguously show that the earthquake produced peak-to-peak line-of-sight displacement of 3 cm at the surface. Kinematic inversion of geodetic and seismological data shows that the main seismic rupture occurred between a depth of 4 and 9 km, over a length of 8 km, with slip reaching at least 40 cm. The causative fault is entirely buried within the Precambrian basement, that is, well beneath the Paleozoic sedimentary pile where injection is taking place. Potentially seismogenic faults in the basement of Oklahoma being poorly known, the risk of M-w >= 6 events triggered by fluid injection remains an open question.

TI  - Modeling Surface Runoff and Water Fluxes over Contrasted Soils in the Pastoral Sahel: Evaluation of the ALMIP2 Land Surface Models over the Gourma Region in Mali
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface processes play an important role in the West African monsoon variability. In addition, the evolution of hydrological systems in this region, and particularly the increase of surface water and runoff coefficients observed since the 1950s, has had a strong impact on water resources and on the occurrence of floods events. This study addresses results from phase 2 of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) Land Surface Model Intercomparison Project (ALMIP2), carried out to evaluate the capability of different state-of-the-art land surface models to reproduce surface processes at the mesoscale. Evaluation of runoff and water fluxes over the Mali site is carried out through comparison with runoff estimations over endorheic watersheds as well as evapotranspiration (ET) measurements. Three remote-sensing-based ET products [ALEXI, MODIS, and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM)] are also analyzed. It is found that, over deep sandy soils, surface runoff is generally overestimated, but the ALMIP2 multimodel mean reproduces in situ measurements of ET and water stress events rather well. However, ALMIP2 models are generally unable to distinguish among the two contrasted hydrological systems typical of the study area. Employing as input a soil map that explicitly represents shallow soils improves the representation of water fluxes for the models that can account for their representation. Shallow soils are shown to be also quite challenging for remote-sensing-based ET products, even if their effect on evaporative loss was captured by the diagnostic thermal-based ALEXI. A better representation of these soils, in soil databases, model parameterizations, and remote sensing algorithms, is fundamental to improve the estimation of water fluxes in this part of the Sahel.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo implement a dynamic contrast-based multi-echo MRI sequence in assessment of rectal cancer and evaluate associations between histopathologic data and the acquired dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) -MRI parameters.Materials and MethodsThis pilot study reports results from 17 patients with resectable rectal cancer. Dynamic contrast-based multi-echo MRI (1.5T) was acquired using a three-dimensional multi-shot EPI sequence, yielding both DCE- and DSC-data following a single injection of contrast agent. The Institutional Review Board approved the study and all patients provided written informed consent. Quantitative analysis was performed by pharmacokinetic modeling on DCE data and tracer kinetic modeling on DSC data. Mann-Whitney U-test and receiver operating characteristics curve statistics was used to evaluate associations between histopathologic data and the acquired DCE- and DSC-MRI parameters.ResultsFor patients with histologically confirmed nodal metastasis, the primary tumor demonstrated a significantly lower K-trans and peak change in R2* R2*-peak(enh), than patients without nodal metastasis, showing a P-value of 0.010 and 0.005 for reader 1, and 0.043 and 0.019 for reader 2, respectively.ConclusionThis study shows the feasibility of acquiring DCE- and DSC-MRI in rectal cancer by dynamic multi-echo MRI. A significant association was found between both K-trans and R2*-peak(enh) in the primary tumor and histological nodal status of the surgical specimen, which may improve stratification of patients to intensified multimodal treatment.

TI  - Spatial and temporal changes in desertification in the southern region of the Tengger Desert from 1973 to 2009
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The sandy land in the southern region of the Tengger Desert is adjacent to cities and towns, and land desertification poses a threat to the livelihood and production of local residents. To determine dynamic changes in local desertification, five periods (1973, 1987, 1992, 2001, and 2009) of remote sensing data are studied by remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS). The desert contraction area is primarily centered around three units (Wuwei, Gulang, and Jingtai) and nearby regions of Zhongwei City. The primary desert expansion areas include the west side of Helan Mountain (WSHM), the Central Mountainous Area (CMA), and the eastern and western Zhongwei units far from towns. From 1973 to 2009, the degree of change in the contracting part of the primary desert expansion unit showed an increasing trend; in brief, most of the desert (especially after 2001) has been developing in a direction in which desertification has been gradually controlled. The primary desert expansion areas are less affected by human activity, but they are primarily controlled by natural factors (especially wind and terrain). The desert contraction areas occur around the towns and nearby regions with frequent human activity; desertification is primarily controlled by human factors. With rapid economic development (especially after 2000), the scale of the cultivated area, town, and ecological protection engineering has gradually expanded, and the latter two are primarily built on a previous desert, which is the root cause of the reduction in the desert areas around the towns and the shrinkage toward north of border. Therefore, reasonable and effective human activity in the southern region of the Tengger Desert is playing a crucial role in preventing desertification.

TI  - Enhanced forest cover mapping using spectral unmixing and object-based classification of multi-temporal Landsat imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially-explicit tree species distribution maps are increasingly valuable to forest managers and researchers in light of the effects of climate change and invasive pests on forest resources. Traditional forest classifications are limited to broad classes of forest types with variable accuracy. Advanced remote sensing techniques, such as spectral unmixing and object-based image analysis, offer novel forest mapping approaches by quantifying proportional species composition at the pixel level and utilizing ancillary environmental data for forest classifications. This is particularly useful in the Northeastern region of the United States where species composition is often mixed.Here we employed a hierarchical forest mapping approach using spectral unmixing of multi-temporal Landsat imagery to quantify percent basal area for ten common tree species/genera across northern New York and Vermont. Basal area maps were then refined using an object-based ruleset to produce a thematic forest classification. Validation with 50 field inventory plots covering a range of species compositions indicated that the quality of percent basal area mapping largely reflected the number of "pure" (>80% BA) endmember plots available for calibration, with more common species mapped at a higher accuracy (i.e. Acer saccharum, adj. r(2) = 0.44, compared to Populus sp., adj. r(2) = 0.24). The resulting thematic forest classification mapped 15 forest classes (nine species/genus level and six common species assemblages) with overall accuracy = 42%, KHAT = 33%, fuzzy accuracy = 86% at the pixel level, and 38%, KHAT = 29%, fuzzy accuracy = 84% at the object level.Using the validation plots to compare existing forest classification products, this hierarchical approach provided more class detail (11 represented classes) and higher accuracy than the National Forest Type Map (six represented classes, overall accuracy 18%, fuzzy accuracy 70%), LANDFIRE (five represented classes, overall accuracy 28%, fuzzy accuracy 80%) and National Land Cover Database (three represented classes, overall accuracy = 56%).These results show that more detailed and accurate forest mapping is possible using a combination of multi-temporal imagery, spectral unmixing, and rule-based classification techniques. Improved large-scale forest mapping has important implications for natural resource management and other modeling applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the 2010 Russian wildfires using GOSAT data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the summer of 2010, more than 6 hundred wildfires broke out in western Russia because of an unprecedented intense heat wave that resulted from strong atmospheric blocking. The present study evaluated the CO2 emissions using GOSAT (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite) data from July 23 to August 18, 2010 for western Russia. The results demonstrated that the GOSAT CAI (Cloud and Aerosol Imager) was well-suited for the identification of smoke plumes and that the GOSAT FTS (Fourier Transform Spectrometer) TIR (Thermal InfraRed) could be used to calculate the height of the plumes at approximately 800 hPa (1.58 km). Using GOSAT data, we estimated that the 2010 fires in western Russia emitted 255.76 Tg CO2. We also calculated the CO2 emissions by employing the Biomass Burning Model (BBM) for the same study site and obtained a similar result of 261.82-302.48 Tg CO2. The present study proposes a new method for the evaluation of CO2 emissions from a wildfire using remote sensing data, which could be used to improve the knowledge of the burning of biomass at a regional or a continental scale, to reduce the uncertainties in modeling greenhouse gases emissions, and to further understand how wildfires impact the atmospheric carbon cycle and global warming.

TI  - Oceanographic determinants of ocean sunfish (<i>Mola mola</i>) and bluefin tuna (<i>Thunnus orientalis</i>) bycatch patterns in the California large mesh drift gillnet fishery
T2  - FISHERIES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The reduction of incidental capture of non-target species in a fishery (bycatch) is a key objective of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) and critical to the conservation of many marine species. Predicting bycatch events can inform targeted ecosystem-based management approaches to reduce risk. Here, the probability of ocean sunfish (Mola mola) and bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) bycatch in the California large-mesh drift gillnet fishery is predicted using a suite of remotely-sensed environmental variables. Generalized additive models (GAMS) were used to model bycatch probability for these species in 8045 observed sets from 1990 to 2011, and predictive capabilities were assessed using k-fold cross validation. Bycatch probabilities for both species were elevated in regions of cool sea surface temperatures (<17 degrees C), likely related to seasonal upwelling dynamics in the California Current, a major eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem. Mola bycatch occurred primarily in late fall, at moderate eddy kinetic energy values (0.006-0.008 m(2)/s(2)) and in areas of high seafloor rugosity. Bluefin tuna bycatch rates were higher west of the Southern California Bight, also in late fall, and appear to be associated with the seasonal upwelling frontal zone. These models can be used with near-real time satellite data by both fishers and managers for bycatch avoidance, providing a tool for more dynamic ocean management strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Noble heathens: Jon Jonsson Aoils and the problem of Iceland's pagan past
T2  - NATIONS AND NATIONALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - In the course of the nineteenth century, traditional Christian conceptions of Europe's pre-Christian paganisms made way for a more favourable image of the noble heathen', inspired by Romantic primitivism and the quest for national authenticity. Poets and philologists in Scandinavia turned to medieval manuscripts containing the remnants of the worldview of the Vikings (asatru), and cultivated them as a repository of topoi and motifs for patriotic art. In this essay, I investigate how this positive reassessment of paganism tied into the national historiography of Iceland, and how it influenced the idea of an Icelandic Golden Age'. For this purpose, the oeuvre of Jon Jonsson Aoils, Iceland's most prolific historian of the early twentieth century, will be scrutinised. This essay demonstrates how Aoils envisioned asatru's role in the formation of Iceland's national character, and addresses the problem of reconciling a glorified pagan past with the nation's contemporary Christian identity. In so doing, it contributes to our understanding of the complex ways in which processes of national identity formation can affect and transform long-held ideas on religious and spiritual matters.

TI  - The monitoring and analysis of the coastal lowland subsidence in the southern Hangzhou Bay with an advanced time-series InSAR method
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series InSAR analysis (e.g., permanent scatterers (PSInSAR)) has been proven as an effective technology in monitoring ground deformation over urban areas. However, it is a big challenge to apply this technology in coastal regions due to the lack of man-made targets. An distributed scatterers interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DSInSAR) is developed to solve the problem of insufficient samples and low reliability in monitoring coastal lowland subsidence, by applying a spatially adaptive filter and an eigendecomposition algorithm to estimating the optimal phase of statistically homogeneous distributed scatterers (DSs). Twenty-four scenes of COSMO-SkyMed images acquired between 2013 and 2015 are used to retrieve the land subsidence over the Shangyu District on south coast of the Hangzhou Bay, Zhejiang Province, China. The spatial pattern of the land subsidence obtained by the PS-InSAR and the DSInSAR coincides with each other, but the density of the DSs is three point five times higher than the permanent scatterers (PSs). Validated by precise levelling data over the same period, the DSInSAR method achieves an accuracy of +/- 5.0 mm/a which is superior to the PS-InSAR with +/- 5.5 mm/a. The land subsidence in the Shangyu District is mainly distributed in the urban areas, industrial towns and land reclamation zones, with a maximum subsidence rate-30.2 mm/a. The analysis of geological data, field investigation and historical reclamation data indicates that human activities and natural compaction of reclamation material are major causes of the detected land subsidence. The results demonstrate that the DSInSAR method has a great potential in monitoring the coastal lowland subsidence and can be used to further investigate subsidence-related environmental issues in coastal regions.

TI  - Late Neoproterozoic basement rocks of Meatiq area, Central Eastern Desert, Egypt: Petrography and remote sensing characterizations
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Meatiq dome is one of the mysteries of the basement rocks in Central Eastern Desert (CED) of Egypt. Its mode of formation, and tectonic evolution are still controversial and not fully understood. Satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool for geologic applications, especially in inaccessible regions of the Earth's surface. In this study, three proposed Landsat-8 band ratios (6/2, 6/7, (6/4*4/3)), (6/7, 6/4, 4/2), and (7/5, 7/6, 5/3) are successfully used for detailed geological mapping of the different lithological rock units exposed in Meatiq dome area in the CED. Landsat-8 Principal component (PC) images is also used for refinement the boundaries between the widely-exposed rock units in the study area. Fourteen spectral bands of Advanced Space borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data are successfully used to emphasize the distribution of some rock forming minerals (i.e. muscovite, quartz, ferrous oxides, ferrous silicates and hydroxyl-bearing minerals) in the lithological rock units of Meatiq dome area. ASTER muscovite index (B7/B6) and quartz index (B14/B12), ferrous iron index (B5/B3), ferrous silicates index (B5/B4), mafic index (B12/B13) and hydroxyl-bearing minerals index ((B7/B6)*(B4/ B6)) discriminate muscovite bearing rocks, Granitoids, and other felsic rocks, amphibolite and other mafic rocks.The proposed image processing methods effectively discriminates between four granitic varieties existed in Meatiq area.

TI  - The Forest Spatial Dynamics in the Bururi Forest Nature Reserve, Burundi
T2  - Tropicultura
M3  - Article
AB  - The studied forest is a protected area located in Southern Burundi, close to Burur city and to agricultural villages. The effective protection of this forest started in 1980 but the protected area delimitation occurred in 2000. The forest spatial dynamic is analyzed to assess the effectiveness of this protection status. The study combines six Landsat multispectral satellite images analysis with field observations. Forest area and perimeter analysis highlights its dynamic in two phases: the first one is mainly characterised by deforestation and savannah development around agricultural lands but also by forest regrowth processes between 1986 and 2001. The second phase (2001-2011) of the forest dynamic is characterized by the increase of its surface and perimeter following the transformation of savannah zones. The anthropogenic effect limitation linked to the protected area delimitation, agricultural activities disturbance during socio-political instability period and to the increasing number of forest-rangers, would have influenced the surface and perimeter gain between 2001 and 2011. Local population implication in forest protection could further limit human pressure and promote degraded zones regeneration. Thus, agropastoral practices innovation in neighboring villages of the protected zone could contribute to limit these anthropogenic disturbances.

TI  - The response of vegetation growth to shifts in trend of temperature in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Though many studies have focused on the causes of shifts in trend of temperature, whether the response of vegetation growth to temperature has changed is still not very clear. In this study, we analyzed the spatial features of the trend changes of temperature during the growing season and the response of vegetation growth in China based on observed climatic data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 1984 to 2011. An obvious warming to cooling shift during growing season from the period 1984-1997 to the period 1998-2011 was identified in the northern and northeastern regions of China, whereas a totally converse shift was observed in the southern and western regions, suggesting large spatial heterogeneity of changes of the trend of growing season temperature throughout China. China as a whole, a significant positive relationship between vegetation growth and temperature during 1984 to 1997 has been greatly weakened during 1998-2011. This change of response of vegetation growth to temperature has also been confirmed by Granger causality test. On regional scales, obvious shifts in relationship between vegetation growth and temperature were identified in temperate desert region and rainforest region. Furthermore, by comprehensively analyzing of the relationship between NDVI and climate variables, an overall reduction of impacts of climate factors on vegetation growth was identified over China during recent years, indicating enhanced influences from human associated activities.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Properties and Associated Direct Radiative Forcing over the Yangtze River Basin during 2001-2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal variation of aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD(550)), angstrom ngstrom exponent at 470-660 nm (AE(470-660)), water vapor content (WVC), and shortwave (SW) instantaneous aerosol direct radiative effects (IADRE) at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) in clear skies obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) are quantitatively analyzed over the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) in China during 2001-2015. The annual and seasonal frequency distributions of AE(470-660) and AOD(550) reveal the dominance of fine aerosol particles over YRB. The regional average AOD(550) is 0.49 +/- 0.31, with high value in spring (0.58 +/- 0.35) and low value in winter (0.42 +/- 0.29). The higher AOD(550) (>= 0.6) is observed in midstream and downstream regions of YRB and Sichuan Basin due to local anthropogenic emissions and long-distance transport of dust particles, while lower AOD(550) (<= 0.3) is in high mountains of upstream regions. The IADRE is estimated using a linear relationship between SW upward flux and coincident AOD(550) from CERES and MODIS at the satellite passing time. The regional average IADRE is -35.60 +/- 6.71 Wm(-2), with high value (-40.71 +/- 6.86 Wm(-2)) in summer and low value (-29.19 +/- 7.04 Wm(-2)) in winter, suggesting a significant cooling effect at TOA. The IADRE at TOA is lower over Yangtze River Delta (YRD) (<=-30 Wm(-2)) and higher in midstream region of YRB, Sichuan Basin and the source area of YRB (>=-45 Wm(-2)). The correlation coefficient between the 15-year monthly IADRE and AOD(550) values is 0.63, which confirms the consistent spatiotemporal variation patterns over most of the YRB. However, a good agreement between IADRE and AOD is not observed in YRD and the source area of YRB, which is probably due to the combined effects of aerosol and surface properties.

TI  - Assessment of SMAP soil moisture for global simulation of gross primary production
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, high-quality soil moisture data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite measurements are evaluated from a perspective of improving the estimation of the global gross primary production (GPP) using a process-based ecosystem model, namely, the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS). The SMAP soil moisture data are assimilated into BEPS using an ensemble Kalman filter. The correlation coefficient (r) between simulated GPP from the sunlit leaves and Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) measured by Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 is used as an indicator to evaluate the performance of the GPP simulation. Areas with SMAP data in low quality (i.e., forests), or with SIF in low magnitude (e.g., deserts), or both are excluded from the analysis. With the assimilated SMAP data, the r value is enhanced for Africa, Asia, and North America by 0.016, 0.013, and 0.013, respectively (p<0.05). Significant improvement in r appears in single-cropping agricultural land where the irrigation is not considered in the model but well captured by SMAP (e.g., 0.09 in North America, p<0.05). With the assimilation of SMAP, areas with weak model performances are identified in double or triple cropping cropland (e.g., part of North China Plain) and/or mountainous area (e.g., Spain and Turkey). The correlation coefficient is enhanced by 0.01 in global average for shrub, grass, and cropland. This enhancement is small and insignificant because nonwater-stressed areas are included.

TI  - Epidemics and aetiology of hand, foot and mouth disease in Xiamen, China, from 2008 to 2015
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past 8 years, human enteroviruses (HEVs) have caused 27 227 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in Xiamen, including 99 severe cases and six deaths. We aimed to explore the molecular epidemiology of HFMD in Xiamen to inform the development of diagnostic assays, vaccines and other interventions. From January 2009 to September 2015, 5866 samples from sentinel hospitals were tested using nested reverse transcription PCR that targeted the HEV 5' untranslated region and viral protein 1 region. Of these samples, 4290 were tested positive for HEV and the amplicons were sequenced and genotyped. Twenty-two genotypes were identified. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackieviruses A16, A6 and A10 (CA16, CA6 and CA10) were the most common genotypes, and there were no changes in the predominant lineages of these genotypes. EV71 became the most predominant genotype every 2 years. From 2013, CA6 replaced CA16 as one of the two most common genotypes. The results demonstrate the vast diversity of HFMD pathogens, and that minor genotypes are able to replace major genotypes. We recommend carrying-out long-term monitoring of the full spectrum of HFMD pathogens, which could facilitate epidemic prediction and the development of diagnostic assays and vaccines.

TI  - Recent changes of global ocean transparency observed by SeaWiFS
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 18th Pacific-Asian Marginal Seas (PAMS)
CL  - Naha, JAPAN
AB  - The water transparency usually quantized by the Secchi Disk depth, is a key index of water quality, and influences light penetration for phytoplankton photosynthesis. Although in situ measurements have provided century-long datasets in different regions, the seasonal and interannual variations as well as the long-term changes of ocean transparency at the global scale are still poorly understood. In the present study, based on the semi-analytic algorithm, the time series of the monthly global ocean transparency over Sept. 1997 to Nov. 2010 were retrieved from the satellite data observed by the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS). The seasonal and interannual variations of global ocean transparency were identified from the SeaWiFS-derived water transparency. Large seasonal variation amplitude occurred at the front zones between subtropical gyres and high latitude oceans. Moreover, ocean transparency increased in the Northern Hemisphere, while it decreased in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in the Southern Ocean from Sept. 1997 to Nov. 2010. The global mean ocean transparency decreased rapidly with a rate of 0.85 m yr(-1) (p=0.001) between 1997 and 1999, followed by a small increase with a rate of 0.04 m yr(-1) (p=0.05) over 2000-2010, which might be linked to changes of sea surface temperature with rapid decrease over 1998-1999 and slight increase over 2000-2010. These changes of water transparency may alter the available light for phytoplankton photosynthesis, and influence the thermal evolution of the upper ocean.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, remote sensing, field and petrographic investigation were integrated for lithological mapping of different granitic masses in Aja complex of Ha'il, Saudi Arabia. The Landsat-8 data were processed to spectrally discriminate variations within rock types using band combinations, band ratioing and principal component analysis (PCA) techniques. Results showed that band combination of the principal components could potentially distinguish the different rock units of Aja complex than any other transform. Field observations and petrographic identification were performed to validate remotely sensing data and to map different rock units. Alkali granites were accurately recorded on the peripheries of Aja Mountain. The present study demonstrates that remote sensing techniques could provide useful tools for mapping economic rock types, particularly in well-exposed arid regions.

TI  - Teaching resident physicians the power of implicit bias and how it impacts patient care utilizing patients who have experienced incarceration as a model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over 2 million adults in the United States are incarcerated and over 650,000 return to the community each year. This disparate population is known to have an elevated burden of chronic disease and lower socioeconomic status. Medical residency training about care of incarcerated or previously incarcerated patients is significantly lacking in the United States. Curriculum can be developed and implemented in residency programs to help physicians learn how to work with this population, be sensitive to their unique needs, and achieve positive health outcomes. This article describes a method for educating the educators based on a workshop presented at a peer-reviewed national conference during the fall of 2016. Attendees participated in exercises addressing assumptions, expectations, bias, and worldview and increased their ability for self-reflection when interacting with patients who are or have experienced incarceration. In this session, strategies were identified that engaged the patient with the goal to aid in patient retention and compliance. Future steps include development of a formal curriculum for training in this area, incorporation into existing community medicine rotations or electives, and establishment of structured transition clinics where residents can be exposed to this population on a more regular basis and improve their overall health outcomes.

TI  - A Prospective Cohort Study Comparing Colorimetric and Fluorescent Imaging for Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Endometrial Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This prospective cohort study aimed to assess sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping using isosulfan blue (ISB) compared with ISB plus indocyanine green (ICG) and near-infrared imaging (NIR) for patients with endometrial cancer.In this study, 200 patients with endometrial cancer underwent SLN assessments and were randomized to ISB + ICG (n = 180) or ISB alone (n = 20). Blue dye determinations were recorded for all 200 cases followed by NIR imaging of ICG for 180 randomized subjects. All the patients underwent robotically assisted hysterectomy with pelvic +/- aortic lymphadenectomy.The mean age of the patients was 64.5 +/- 8.4 years, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 33 +/- 7.6 kg/m(2). The histologies were endometrioid G1 (43%), G2 (30%), G3 (7%), and type 2 (20%). The mean time from dye injection to initiation of mapping was 13.4 +/- 6.2 min, and the time to removal of SLN was 17.4 +/- 11.2 min. Detection of SLN for the 20 ISB control cases did not differ from that for the 180 ISB + ICG cases (p > 0.05). The rates of SLN detection for ISB + ICG/NIR (n = 180) versus ISB (n = 200) were as follows: bilateral (83.9 vs. 40%), unilateral (12.2 vs. 36%), and none (3.9 vs. 24%) (p < 0.001). The median SLN per case was 2 (range 0-4). Positive SLNs were found in 21.1% (n = 38) of the ISB + ICG cases compared with 13.5% (n = 27) of the ISB cases (p = 0.056). The false-negative rate for SLN biopsy was 2.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.1-14.7%). In 61% (25/41) of the node-positive cases, SLN was the only positive lymph node (LN). Isolated tumor cells were found in 39.5% (15/38) of the SLN metastasis cases compared with 26.7% (4/15) of the non-SLN metastasis cases (p = 0.528).In this prospective study, ISB + ICG and NIR detected more SLNs and more LN metastases than ISB alone. Assessment of SLN with ICG + ISB/NIR imaging had excellent sensitivity for detection of metastasis and no safety issues.

TI  - Opportunistic Biopsy of Internal Mammary Lymph Nodes During Immediate Breast Reconstruction After Mastectomy for Breast Malignancies
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was designed to explore the clinicopathological factors associated with internal mammary lymph node (IMN) metastasis in radiologically IMN-negative breast malignancies and to discuss the clinical value of opportunistic biopsy during immediate breast reconstruction using free flaps, where the internal mammary vessels are the recipient.We retrospectively reviewed patients who received curative total mastectomy for breast malignancy followed by immediate reconstruction using transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) free flap. Suspicious lymph nodes encountered during dissection of the third intercostal space for the recipient vessels were biopsied. Clinicopathological variables and the clinical impact associated with IMN metastasis were analyzed.Among 269 patients who underwent immediate reconstruction using a TRAM free flap, suspicious lymph nodes were identified and biopsied in 54 (20.1%) patients, and IMN metastasis was confirmed in 12 (22.2%) of these (4.5% of all reconstructions). Five patients were positive despite negative axillary lymph nodes and 11 underwent therapeutic plan modifications. Multivariate analysis revealed that IMN metastasis was independently associated with medial tumor location, invasive tumor > 2 cm, and positive human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 status (P < 0.05).Aggressive IMN evaluation and biopsy in a subset of patients during immediate breast reconstruction using a TRAM free flap provided an additional opportunity for accurate breast cancer staging and appropriate adjuvant treatment, while minimizing unnecessary complications.

TI  - Is intraoperative touch imprint cytology indicated in the surgical treatment of early breast cancers?
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Intraoperative touch imprint cytology (TIC) of the sentinel lymph node(s) (SLN(s)) in the treatment of breast cancer has significantly reduced the number of axillary block dissections (ABD) required during second surgeries. Based on recent studies, ABD was not considered necessary if the presence of tumor cells/micrometastasis was confirmed in the SLN(s) or in the case of macrometastases in a patient group meeting the inclusion criteria for the ACOSOG Z0011 study. Our aim was to determine the sensitivity and usefulness of TIC with regard to these results.Methods: TICs of the SLN(s) were examined in 1168 patients operated on for breast cancer. The method was also analyzed retrospectively based on the guidelines for the Z0011 study. During TIC, new samples were cut every 250 pm; impression smears were evaluated after being stained with hematoxylin eosin.Results: TIC confirmed metastasis in 202 cases (202/1168, 17.29%). Metastasis was confirmed in SLN(s) in 149 additional cases during a final histological examination. The sensitivity of TIC was found to be 57.18%, and its specificity was 99.63%. An analysis was then performed except for cases that met the inclusion criteria for the Z0011 study and with metastasis smaller than 2 mm (micrometastasis/isolated tumor cells) considered to be positive during intraoperative cytology. The sensitivity of the method decreased to 34.23%, while its specificity was still high at 99.76%.Conclusions: Based on the new guidelines for ABD, imprint cytology cannot be considered a beneficial and cost-effective intervention in the surgical treatment of early breast cancer.

TI  - Trends in reports of driving following illicit drug consumption among regular drug users in Australia, 2007-2013: Has random roadside drug testing had a deterrent effect?
T2  - ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Driving following illicit drug consumption ('drug-driving') is a potential road safety risk. Roadside drug testing (RDT) is conducted across Australia with the dual aims of prosecuting drivers with drugs in their system and deterring drug-driving. We examined trends over time in self-reported past six-month drug-driving among sentinel samples of regular drug users and assessed the impact of experiences of RDT on drug-driving among these participants.Methods: Data from 1913 people who inject drugs (PWID) and 3140 regular psychostimulant users (RPU) who were first-time participants in a series of repeat cross-sectional sentinel studies conducted in Australian capital cities from 2007 to 2013 and reported driving in the past six months were analysed. Trends over time were assessed using the x(2) test for trend. Multivariable logistic regressions assessed the relationship between experiences of RDT and recent drug-driving, adjusting for survey year, jurisdiction of residence and sociodemographic and drug use characteristics.Results: The percentage of participants reporting recent (past six months) drug-driving decreased significantly over time among both samples (PWID: 83% [2007] vs. 74% [2013], p < 0.001; RPU: 72% vs. 56%, p < 0.001), but drug-driving remained prevalent. Lifetime experience of RDT increased significantly over time (PWID: 6% [2007] vs. 32% [2013], p < 0.001; RPU: 2% vs. 11%, p < 0.001). There were no significant associations between experiencing RDT and drug-driving among either PWID or RPU.Conclusion: Although there is some evidence that drug-driving among, key risk groups of regular drug users is declining in Australia, possibly reflecting a general deterrent effect of RDT, experiencing RDT appears to have no specific deterrent effect on drug-driving. Further intervention, with a particular focus on changing attitudes towards drug-driving, may be needed to further reduce this practice among these groups.

TI  - The environmental envelope of fires in the Colombian Caribbean
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is an important disturbance agent for terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions where its occurrence is controlled by multiple biophysical and anthropogenic variables. We assessed the temporal and spatial patterns of active fire detections (MODIS product MCD14ML) in the Caribbean region of Colombia between 2003 and 2015, using time series, cross-correlation, hot spot and density techniques. We also assessed the environmental envelope of active fires by evaluating the effect of multiple biophysical and anthropogenic variables on fire presence/absence using generalized linear models (GLMs). Results show that fires follow a clear intra-annual cycle, with 86% of fire events taking place during the region's main dry season (December March). There is also inter-annual variability related to the Tropical North Atlantic (TNA) quasi-decadal climatic oscillation. Active fires exhibit a distinctive spatial pattern, with regional hotspots. The set of variables that best explain fire presence/absence include biophysical (TNA, temperature annual range, dry quarter precipitation), anthropogenic (minimum distance to towns and roads) and composite (NDVI) variables. The extensive and ongoing land cover transformation of this region, from forest to pasture and agriculture, will likely increase the extent of burned areas and future carbon fire emissions to the atmosphere.

TI  - Mapping Development Pattern in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration Using DMSP/OLS Nighttime Light Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial inequality of urban development may cause problems like inequality of living conditions and the lack of sustainability, drawing increasing academic interests and societal concerns. Previous studies based on statistical data can hardly reveal the interior mechanism of spatial inequality due to the limitation of statistical units, while the application of remote sensing data, such as nighttime light (NTL) data, provides an effective solution. In this study, based on the DMSP/OLS NTL data, the urbanization type of all towns in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration was analyzed from the aspects of development level and speed. Meanwhile, spatial cluster analysis of development level by local Moran's I was used to explore spatial inequality, and the trend was discussed by comparing the development characteristics on both sides of the transition line of different development levels (inequality boundary). The results showed that the development level of the whole region increased dramatically as the mean DN value increased by 65.99%, and 83.72% of the towns showed a positive development during 2000-2012. The spatial distribution of urbanization types showed that Beijing and Tianjin were at a high urbanization level with rapid speed of development, with the southern region having a medium development level and the northwestern region lagging behind. The spatial cluster analysis also revealed a gradually intensifying trend of inequality as the number of towns with balanced development reduced by 319 during 2000-2012, while the towns in the high-high areas increased by 99 and those in the low-low areas increased by 229. Moreover, the development speed inside the inequality boundary was obviously higher than that outside, indicating an increasingly serious situation for spatial inequality of urban development in the whole region.

TI  - Mapping vegetation heights in China using slope correction ICESat data, SRTM, MODIS-derived and climate data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation height is an important parameter for biomass assessment and vegetation classification. However, vegetation height data over large areas are difficult to obtain. The existing vegetation height data derived from the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data only include laser footprints in relatively flat forest regions (<5). Thus, a large portion of ICESat data over sloping areas has not been used. In this study, we used a new slope correction method to improve the accuracy of estimates of vegetation heights for regions where slopes fall between 5 and 15. The new method enabled us to use more than 20% additional laser data compared with the existing vegetation height data which only uses ICESat data in relatively flat areas (slope < 5) in China. With the vegetation height data extracted from ICESat footprints and ancillary data including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived data (canopy cover, reflectances and leaf area index), climate data, and topographic data, we developed a wall to wall vegetation height map of China using the Random Forest algorithm. We used the data from 416 field measurements to validate the new vegetation height product. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and RMSE of the new vegetation height product were 0.89 and 4.73 m respectively. The accuracy of the product is significantly better than that of the two existing global forest height products produced by Lefsky (2010) and Simard et al. (2011), when compared with the data from 227 field measurements in our study area. The new vegetation height data demonstrated clear distinctions among forest, shrub and grassland, which is promising for improving the classification of vegetation and above-ground forest biomass assessment in China.

TI  - Bathymetry of the Coral Reefs of Weizhou Island Based on Multispectral Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow water depth measurements using multispectral images are crucial for marine surveying and mapping. At present, relevant studies either depend on the use of other auxiliary data (such as field water depths or water column data) or contain too many unknown variables, thus making these studies suitable only for images that contain enough visible wavebands. To solve this problem, a Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA) approach is proposed in this paper for estimating the water depths around Weizhou Island by developing a QAA to estimate the diffuse attenuation coefficients and simplifying the parameterization of the bathymetric model. The approach contains an initialization sub-approach and a novel global adjustment sub-approach. It is not only independent of other auxiliary data but also greatly reduces the number of unknowns. Experimental results finally demonstrated that the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) were 1.01 m and 0.77 m for the ZY-3 image and the WorldView-3 (WV-3) image, respectively, so the approach is competitive to other QAA bathymetric methods. Besides, the global adjustment sub-approach was also seen to be superior to common smoothing filters: if the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is as low as 42, i.e., ZY-3, it can smooth the water depths and improve the accuracies, otherwise can avoid the over-smoothing of water depths.

TI  - A Satellite-Derived Climatological Analysis of Urban Heat Island over Shanghai during 2000-2013
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island is generally conducted based on ground observations of air temperature and remotely sensing of land surface temperature (LST). Satellite remotely sensed LST has the advantages of global coverage and consistent periodicity, which overcomes the weakness of ground observations related to sparse distributions and costs. For human related studies and urban climatology, canopy layer urban heat island (CUHI) based on air temperatures is extremely important. This study has employed remote sensing methodology to produce monthly CUHI climatology maps during the period 2000-2013, revealing the spatiotemporal characteristics of daytime and nighttime CUHI during this period of rapid urbanization in Shanghai. Using stepwise linear regression, daytime and nighttime air temperatures at the four overpass times of Terra/Aqua were estimated based on time series of Terra/Aqua-MODIS LST and other auxiliary variables including enhanced vegetation index, normalized difference water index, solar zenith angle and distance to coast. The validation results indicate that the models produced an accuracy of 1.6-2.6 degrees C RMSE for the four overpass times of Terra/Aqua. The models based on Terra LST showed higher accuracy than those based on Aqua LST, and nighttime air temperature estimation had higher accuracy than daytime. The seasonal analysis shows daytime CUHI is strongest in summer and weakest in winter, while nighttime CUHI is weakest in summer and strongest in autumn. The annual mean daytime CUHI during 2000-2013 is 1.0 and 2.2 degrees C for Terra and Aqua overpass, respectively. The annual mean nighttime CUHI is about 1.0 degrees C for both Terra and Aqua overpass. The resultant CUHI climatology maps provide a spatiotemporal quantification of CUHI with emphasis on temperature gradients. This study has provided information of relevance to urban planners and environmental managers for assessing and monitoring urban thermal environments which are constantly being altered by natural and anthropogenic influences.

TI  - Response of <i>Larix chinensis</i> to temperature change and its response mechanism in Qinling Mountains
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the MODIS NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and air temperature data over the span of 2000 to 2015, the characteristics of response of Larix chinensis to air temperature variation were investigated and the mechanism of response was explored in this paper. The results showed that: (1) The average annual NDVI of L. chinensis was positively correlated with the annual average temperature, and 96.30% of the correlations were positive with 31.42% being significant. It meant that the annual temperature was conductive to the growth of L. chinensis. (2) On the monthly scale, the monthly mean NDVI response of L. chinensis distribution region to monthly mean air temperature was mostly positive, with the characteristics of synchronism and hysteretic nature, and the lag time was around 1-3 months. The NDVI in August was negatively correlated with the temperature of previous period, the current temperature and accumulated temperature, and most of the correlations were significantly negative. (3) The annual maximum NDVI of L. chinensis was negatively correlated with the air temperature in different periods, which indicated that the rise of temperature was not conducive to the maximum NDVI growth of L. chinensis to a certain extent. (4) The analysis of correlation between annual maximum NDVI and the mean air temperature from August of previous year to current July showed that the number of negative pixels was much more than that of positive pixels. Furthermore, when the annual mean temperature from previous August to current July was within the range of -0.4-0.8 degrees C, the response of maximum NDVI to air temperature reached the peak. On the other hand, if the temperature was lower than -0.4 degrees C or higher than 0.8 degrees C, the percentage of negative pixel number increased and the growth of L. chinensis would be inhibited somewhat.

TI  - Multi-level monitoring of subtle urban changes for the megacities of China using high-resolution multi-view satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Megacities have evolved at an unprecedented rate under the pressure of urban population growth and economic development, particularly in the developing countries. For instance, many cities in China are experiencing a large number of rapid but subtle changes resulting from urban infrastructure construction. Information concerning such small changes is imperative for understanding the local environment and human activity, and can also provide key insights for urban planners. Undoubtedly, high-resolution remotely sensed data should play an essential role for the monitoring of such subtle changes, due to the improved observation capacity of the spatial details. However, few studies have investigated high-resolution data for change detection at a large geographic scale, due to the multi-temporal heterogeneity of the data, e.g., spatial mis-registration, parallax distortion for high architectures, and the different viewing angles. In this study, we attempted to fill this gap and resolve these problems by the use of multi-view ZY-3 satellite data, which are used to generate multi-temporal orthographic images through photogrammetric derivation. In the meantime, we present a general framework for precise urban change analysis in a multi-level ( pixel, grid, and city block) approach. Two typical Chinese megacities-Beijing and Wuhan-are chosen in the experiments. The results confirm the accuracy of the proposed multi-level method for monitoring subtle urban changes, achieving Kappa coefficients of similar to 0.8 at the pixel level and a correctness of 93-95% at the grid level. The landscape analysis further indicates that the rapid urban construction led to greater fragmentation and spatial heterogeneity of buildings and decreased minimum distance between building patches ( by similar to 1.0 m between 2012 and 2013). Moreover, the performances of ZY-3 and Landsat for the monitoring of subtle urban changes are compared, revealing that the high-resolution sensor-ZY-3 ( 2.5 m)-is essential for precisely detecting subtle urban changes, whereas the Landsat data ( 30 m) are not sensitive to most of the subtle changes that occur in the urban areas.

TI  - A Novel Building Type Classification Scheme Based on Integrated LiDAR and High-Resolution Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building type information is crucial to many urban studies, including fine-resolution population estimation, urban planning, and management. Although scientists have developed many methods to extract buildings via remote sensing data, only a limited number of them focus on further classification of the extracted results. This paper presents a novel building type classification scheme based on the integration of building height information from LiDAR, textural, spectral, and geometric information from high-resolution remote sensing images, and super-object information from the integrated dataset. Building height information is firstly extracted from LiDAR point clouds using a progressive morphological filter and then combined with high-resolution images for object-oriented segmentation. Multi-resolution segmentation of the combined image is performed to collect super-object information, which provides more information for classification in the next step. Finally, the segmentation results, as well as their super-object information, are inputted into the random forest classifier to obtain building type classification results. The classification scheme proposed in this study is tested through applications in two urban village areas, a type of slum-like land use characterized by dense buildings of different types, heights, and sizes, in Guangzhou, China. Segment level classification of the study area and validation area reached accuracies of 80.02% and 76.85%, respectively, while the building-level results reached accuracies of 98.15% and 87.50%, respectively. The results indicate that the proposed building type classification scheme has great potential for application in areas with multiple building types and complex backgrounds. This study also proves that both building height information and super-object information play important roles in building type classification. More accurate results could be obtained by incorporating building height information and super-object information and using the random forest classifier.

TI  - Occupancy dynamics of the Wood Warbler <i>Phylloscopus sibilatrix</i> assessed with habitat and remote sensing data
T2  - IBIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of population dynamics and species-habitat interactions is important for many ecological and conservation issues. We analysed the occupancy dynamics of the Wood Warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix, a forest interior passerine that has suffered long-term declines in many European countries. Considering a broad range of habitat descriptors, including LiDAR-based variables characterizing forest structure, we identified environmental factors influencing the probabilities of occupancy, colonization, extinction and detection, and mapped these probabilities at a landscape scale. We used presence-absence data collected between 1999 and 2013 in a robust-design protocol with replicated surveys within each primary sampling season (i.e. breeding season). To analyse occupancy dynamics, we fitted dynamic occupancy models with covariates describing topography, forest extent and structure, soil, seed masting (as a proxy for rodent abundance) and weather conditions during settlement. Initial occupancy was positively related to slope, forest cover and the proportion of broadleaf forest, and negatively related to forest edge length, canopy height variation and soil nutrients. Colonization probability was positively associated with slope and negatively with canopy height variation and soil nutrients. Extinction probability was negatively related to slope, positively related to forest edge length and was lowest at intermediate vegetation heights. Detection probability decreased during the season and was positively related to forest cover. This study provides insights into the settlement dynamics of a declining forest species by identifying potential drivers of the processes underlying occupancy dynamics, instead of simply modelling species abundance or occurrence. Forest-related covariates were of overwhelming importance for the settlement dynamics of the Wood Warbler. Conservation measures should focus on providing and maintaining the species' preferred forest structure, specifically in extended forests. In Switzerland, forests located on slopes and on nutrient-poor soils should be prioritized for conservation. Finally, comparing findings derived from the relatively coarse scale of this study with those from the small scale of individual territories suggests that conservation recommendations deduced from large-scale monitoring schemes alone may be incomplete, and vice versa.

TI  - Patterns in the natural transmission of the parasitic dinoflagellate <i>Hematodinium perezi</i> in American blue crabs, <i>Callinectes sapidus</i> from a highly endemic area
T2  - MARINE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The dinoflagellate Hematodinium perezi is a highly pathogenic endoparasite that infects blue crabs Callinectes sapidus and other decapods. Annual outbreaks of the parasite along the eastern seaboard of the USA indicate that transmission occurs at high rates; however, the timing and incidence of new infections are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns and factors associated with the natural transmission of Hematodinium in juvenile crabs from a highly endemic site. A novel field experiment, using naive crabs as sentinels, was implemented to measure transmission. Over 965 juvenile crabs (instars C3-C10) collected from a non-endemic site were deployed for set periods of 3, 7, 10, and 14 days at a highly endemic site. Prevalence was 5.1% after a 3-day deployment and 88% after a 10-day deployment. This corresponded to a daily incidence of new infections of 1.7 and 8.8%, in the population, respectively. New infections progressed very quickly; 50% of infected crabs developed heavy infections after only 14 days. The influence of host molting on the transmission of the parasite was investigated by tagging 467 crabs using cyanoacrylate glue and small plastic tags. After 7-, 10-, and 14-day deployments, sentinel crabs were assessed and infections were found not to be associated with host molting. Lastly, two storm events, with high rainfall, strong winds, and lower temperatures, disrupted the natural transmission of H. perezi to sentinel crabs, essentially halting transmission in the coastal system. These sentinel studies indicate that transmission can occur rapidly and at very high levels in endemic sites and that it can be quickly modulated by changes in environmental conditions following storm events. Infections by Hematodinium may increase host mortality and thus may be a threat to blue crab populations in endemic areas.

TI  - Mast cells mediate early neutrophil recruitment and exhibit anti-inflammatory properties <i>via</i> the formyl peptide receptor 2/lipoxin A<sub>4</sub> receptor
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEIn recent years, studies have focused on the resolution of inflammation, which can be achieved by endogenous anti-inflammatory agonists such as Annexin A1 (AnxA1). Here, we investigated the effects of mast cells (MCs) on early LPS-induced neutrophil recruitment and the involvement of the AnxA1-formyl peptide receptor 2/ALX (FPR2/ALX or lipoxin A4 receptor) pathway.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHIntravital microscopy (IVM) was used to visualize and quantify the effects of LPS (10 mu g per mouse i.p.) on murine mesenteric cellular interactions. Furthermore, the role that MCs play in these inflammatory responses was determined in vivo and in vitro, and effects of AnxA1 mimetic peptide Ac2-26 were assessed.KEY RESULTSLPS increased both neutrophil endothelial cell interactions within the mesenteric microcirculation andMC activation (determined by IVM and ruthenium red dye uptake), which in turn lead to the early stages of neutrophil recruitment. MC recruitment of neutrophils could be blocked by preventing the pro-inflammatory activation (using cromolyn sodium) or enhancing an anti-inflammatory phenotype (using Ac2-26) in MCs. Furthermore, MCs induced neutrophil migration in vitro, and MC stabilization enhanced the release of AnxA1 from neutrophils. Pharmacological approaches (such as the administration of FPR pan-antagonist Boc2, or the FPR2/ALX antagonist WRW4) revealed neutrophil FPR2/ALX to be important in this process.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONSData presented here provide evidence for a role of MCs, which are ideally positioned in close proximity to the vasculature, to act as sentinel cells in neutrophil extravasation and resolution of inflammation via the AnxA1-FPR2/ALX pathway.

This paper presents an improved interval type 2 fuzzy c-means (IT2FCM*) approach to analyse the spatial and temporal changes in the geomorphology of the Beidagang wetland in North China from 1975 to 2015 based on long-term Landsat data. Unlike traditional type 1 fuzzy c-means methods, the IT2FCM* algorithm based on interval type-2 fuzzy set has an ability to better handle the spectral uncertainty. Four indexes were adopted to validate the separability of classes with the IT2FCM* algorithm. These four validity indexes showed that IT2FCM* obtained better results than traditional methods. Additionally, the accuracy of the classification results was assessed based on the confusion matrix and kappa coefficient, which were high for the analysis of wetland landscape changes. Based on the analysis of separability of classes with the IT2FCM* algorithm using four validity indexes, the classification results, and the membership value images, the long-term series of satellite datasets were processed using the IT2FCM* method, and the study area was classified into six classes. Because water resources and vegetation are two key wetland components, the water resource dynamics and vegetation dynamics, based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were analysed in detail according to the spatiotemporal classification results. The results show that the changes in vegetation types have historically been associated with water resource variations and that water resources play an important role in the evolution of vegetation types.

TI  - The relationship of red blood cell transfusion to intestinal mucosal injury in premature infants
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine the incidence of intestinal mucosal injury before and after transfusions in premature infants.Study design: Urine was collected throughout the hospital stay of 62 premature infants and specimens obtained within 24 h before and after transfusion were assayed for intestinal fatty acid binding protein (iFABP). A urinary iFABP: creatinine ratio (iFABP(u): Cr-u) of 2.0 pg/nmol was considered elevated.Result: Forty-nine infants were transfused. iFABPu: Cru was elevated following 71 (75.6%) of 94 transfusions for which urine was available. In 51 (71.8%) of these, iFABP(u): Cru was also elevated prior to the transfusion. Among four cases of transfusion-associated NEC, iFABP(u) was elevated following every sentinel transfusion and prior to three of them.Conclusion: Subclinical intestinal mucosal injury is frequent following blood transfusions in premature infants and, when present, usually precedes transfusion. This suggests that transfusion may not be a primary mediator of intestinal injury so much as anemia and its associated conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS): evaluation and treatment of odontostomatological problems
T2  - MEDICINA DEL LAVORO
M3  - Article
AB  - The Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is a breathing disorder characterized by repeated episodes of apnea/hypopnea occurring during sleep and caused by the obstruction of the upper airway. As OSAS can have a significant impact on quality of life, an early diagnosis and a multi-specialized recognition become important. Therapeutic proposals include the Mandibular Advancement Devices (MADs), intraoral devices that induce a mandibular advancement during the night to eliminate snoring and apnea. Italian guidelines on dental aspects of OSAS in adults and children focus primarily on anamnestic and clinical methods by which the dentist, in a role of epidemiological sentinel, can first identify a patient with OSAS and then participate in the therapeutic process using specific orthodontic intraoral devices.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aim To report the first case of a Richter syndrome where small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) progressed to a CD3+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).Methods Macrodissection of small and large cell lymphomatous components was performed. This was followed by flow cytometric analysis along with molecular B-cell immunoglobulin (heavy and light chains) and T-cell receptor (gamma and beta chains) gene rearrangement studies to investigate a clonal relationship between the components.Results The immunophenotypic profile was similar between small and large cell components of the lymphoma by flow cytometry. Furthermore, shared clonal peaks were observed between both components based on molecular B-cell and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies, confirming a clonal relationship.Conclusions Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/SLL may rarely undergo Richter transformation to a DLBCL demonstrating lineage infidelity. This is a potentially important diagnostic pitfall and such cases should not be confused with a de novo T-cell lymphoma.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The ARIA initiative was started during a World Health Organization workshop in 1999. The initial goals were to propose a new classification for allergic rhinitis, to promote the concept of multi-morbidity in asthma and rhinitis and to develop guidelines with stakeholders for world-wide use. ARIA is now focused on the implementation of emerging technologies for individualized and predictive medicine. MASK: MACVIA-Aria Sentinel Network uses mobile technology to develop care pathways that enable management by a multidisciplinary group or by patients themselves. An App for iOS and Android uses a visual analogue scale to assess symptom control and work productivity, as well as a clinical decision support system; it is associated with an interoperable tablet for health professionals. The escalation strategy uses recommendations of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing. The aim of ARIA's new approach is to provide an active and healthy life to people affected by rhinitis, regardless of age, gender or socioeconomic status, in order to reduce social and health inequalities caused by the disease.

TI  - The relationship between Suspended Particulate Matter and Turbidity at a mooring station in a coastal environment: consequences for satellite-derived products
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - From a data set of observations of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) concentration, Turbidity in Formazin Turbidity Unit (FTU) and fluorescence-derived chlorophyll-a at a mooring station in Liverpool Bay, in the Irish Sea, we investigate the seasonal variation of the SPM: Turbidity ratio. This ratio changes from a value of around 1 in winter (minimum in January-February) to 2 in summer (maximum in May-June). This seasonal change can be understood in terms of the cycle of turbulence and of the phytoplankton population that affects the nature, shape and size of the particles responsible for the Turbidity. The data suggest a direct effect of delayed effect, likely due to aggregation of particles, in July and August. Based on the hypothesis that only SPM concentration varies, but not the mass-specific backscattering coefficient of particles b(bp)*, semi-analytical algorithms aiming at retrieving SPM from satellite radiance ignore the seasonal variability of b(bp)* which is likely to be inversely correlated to the SPM: Turbidity ratio. A simple sinusoidal modulation of the relationship between Turbidity and SPM with time helps to correct this effect at the location of the mooring. Without applying a seasonal modulation to b(bp)*, there is an underestimation of SPM in summer by the Ifremer semi-analytical algorithm (Gohin et al., 2015) we tested. SPM derived from this algorithm, as expected from any semi-analytical algorithm, appears to be more related to in situ Turbidity than to in situ SPM throughout the year. (C) 2017 The Authors.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 3 million population residing in the holy city Varanasi and sub-urban areas is exposed to very high level of fine particulate matter (PM2,5) from various sources. Continuous monitoring by Central Pollution Control Board started only in 2015; therefore what was the pollution level in the past and how it has changed over the years are not known. We use MODIS aerosol products to infer PM2.5 and examine 15-year climatology. Data shows a rapid (1.5-3% per year) increase in PM2.5 in the last 15 years and high (87% days in a year) persistence of PM2,5 above the national air quality standard. It translates to a burden of 5700 (2800-7500) annual premature deaths (0.16% of the population), of which 29%, 18%, 33%, 19% and remaining 1% are attributed to ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute lower respiratory infection and lung cancer respectively. If the region achieves the Indian (WHO) air quality standard, 1900 (3800) premature deaths can be avoided every year. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Characterisation of Hydrological Response to Rainfall at Multi Spatio-Temporal Scales in Savannas of Semi-Arid Australia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall is the main driver of hydrological processes in dryland environments and characterising the rainfall variability and processes of runoff generation are critical for understanding ecosystem function of catchments. Using remote sensing and in situ data sets, we assess the spatial and temporal variability of the rainfall, rainfall-runoff response, and effects on runoff coefficients of antecedent soil moisture and ground cover at different spatial scales. This analysis was undertaken in the Upper Burdekin catchment, northeast Australia, which is a major contributor of sediment and nutrients to the Great Barrier Reef. The high temporal and spatial variability of rainfall are found to exert significant controls on runoff generation processes. Rainfall amount and intensity are the primary runoff controls, and runoff coefficients for wet antecedent conditions were higher than for dry conditions. The majority of runoff occurred via surface runoff generation mechanisms, with subsurface runoff likely contributing little runoff due to the intense nature of rainfall events. MODIS monthly ground cover data showed better results in distinguishing effects of ground cover on runoff that Landsat-derived seasonal ground cover data. We conclude that in the range of moderate to large catchments (193-36,260 km(2)) runoff generation processes are sensitive to both antecedent soil moisture and ground cover. A higher runoff-ground cover correlation in drier months with sparse ground cover highlighted the critical role of cover at the onset of the wet season (driest period) and how runoff generation is more sensitive to cover in drier months than in wetter months. The monthly water balance analysis indicates that runoff generation in wetter months (January and February) is partially influenced by saturation overland flow, most likely confined to saturated soils in riparian corridors, swales, and areas of shallow soil. By March and continuing through October, the soil "bucket" progressively empties by evapotranspiration, and Hortonian overland flow becomes the dominant, if not exclusive, flow generation process. The results of this study can be used to better understand the rainfall-runoff relationships in dryland environments and subsequent exposure of coral reef ecosystems in Australia and elsewhere to terrestrial runoff.

TI  - Assessment of Land Use-Cover Changes and Successional Stages of Vegetation in the Natural Protected Area Altas Cumbres, Northeastern Mexico, Using Landsat Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Loss of vegetation cover is a major factor that endangers biodiversity. Therefore, the use of geographic information systems and the analysis of satellite images are important for monitoring these changes in Natural Protected Areas (NPAs). In northeastern Mexico, the Natural Protected Area Altas Cumbres (NPAAC) represents a relevant floristic and faunistic patch on which the impact of loss of vegetation cover has not been assessed. This work aimed to analyze changes of land use and coverage (LULCC) over the last 42 years on the interior and around the exterior of the area, and also to propose the time of succession for the most important types of vegetation. For the analysis, LANDSAT satellite images from 1973, 1986, 2000, 2005 and 2015 were used, they were classified in seven categories through a segmentation and maximum likelihood analysis. A cross-tabulation analysis was performed to determine the succession gradient. Towards the interior of the area, a significant reduction of tropical vegetation and, to a lesser extent, temperate forests was found, as well as an increase in scrub cover from 1973 to 2015. In addition, urban and vegetation-free areas, as well as modified vegetation, increased to the exterior. Towards the interior of the NPA, the processes of perturbation and recovery were mostly not linear, while in the exterior adjacent area, the presence of secondary vegetation with distinct definite time of succession was evident. The analysis carried out is the first contribution that evaluates LULCC in this important NPA of northeastern Mexico. Results suggest the need to evaluate the effects of these modifications on species.

TI  - Impact of <i>RASSF1A</i> gene methylation on the metastatic axillary nodal status in breast cancer patients
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypermethylation of CpG islands is a hallmark of cancer and occurs at an early stage in breast tumorigenesis. To gain insight into the epigenetic switches, that may promote and/or contribute to the initial neoplastic events during breast carcinogenesis, the present study focused on the DNA methylation profile of invasive breast carcinoma. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of Ras association domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) promoter methylation status in operable breast cancer, and to analyze the utility of this biomarker regarding its association with metastatic and nonmetastatic axillary nodal status. For this purpose, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from 116 breast cancer patients with known axillary nodal status were subjected to assessment of RASSF1A promoter methylation status by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting assay, and the results were subsequently validated by bisulfite sequencing. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to model the dependence of distinct levels of methylation status of the RASSFIA promoter on the nodal status. Promoter region CpG hypermethylation was identified by MSP in 97 (83.6%) of 116 primary breast tumors, while hypermethylation of RASSF1A was confirmed by MS-HRM in 107 (92.2%) of 116 cases of breast cancer. Based on the results of the multinomial logistic regression model, there was no significant difference between the frequency of RASSF1A promoter methylation and axillary lymph node status of patients in general. However, upon adjustment of pN stage, an association was identified between pN0 lymph node-negative status (without axillary metastases) and percentage of RASSFIA methylation in two groups of heterogeneous methylated alleles with <= 50% methylated (P<0.05) and >50% methylated alleles (P<0.0001). If a patients' nodal status changes from pN- to pN+ then the risk of having >50% methylated alleles increases by 7%. The present study revealed a specific phenomenon, suggesting that the presence of heterogeneous methylated alleles in the RASSF1A gene is significantly associated with lymph node-negative status in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, greater significance with negative axillary nodal status was observed with a higher level of heterogeneous methylated alleles in the RASSF1A gene.

TI  - Clinical utility of the additional use of blue dye for indocyanine green for sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Indocyanine green (ICG) is widely used as a tracer in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) of patients with breast cancer. Whether SLNB performance can be improved by supplementing ICG with methylene blue dye remains controversial. This study compared the performance of SLNB when ICG was used alone or with blue dye.Materials and methods: Consecutive patients with T1-3 primary breast cancer at our hospital were recruited into our study and randomized to undergo SLNB with ICG alone (n = 62) or with the combination of ICG and blue dye (n = 65). We compared the two methods in terms of identification rate, number and detection time of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) removed.Results: SLN identification rate were similar in the absence (95.2%) or presence of blue dye (98.5%, P = 0.578) but significantly, more average nodes were removed when blue dye was used (3.8 +/- 1.5 versus 2.7 +/- 1.2, P = 0.000), and the average time for detecting each SLN was significantly shorter (3.91 +/- 1.87 versus 5.65 +/- 2.95 min; P = 0.000). No patient in the study experienced severe adverse reactions or complications. Recurrence of axillary node was detected in one patient (1.6%) using ICG alone but not in any patients using ICG and blue dye.Conclusions: The efficiency and sensitivity of SLNB can be improved by combining ICG with blue dye.

TI  - Influence of Ecological Factors on Estimation of Impervious Surface Area Using Landsat 8 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of impervious surface area is important to the study of urban environments and social development, but surface characteristics, as well as the temporal, spectral, and spatial resolutions of remote sensing images, influence the estimation accuracy. To investigate the effects of regional environmental characteristics on the estimation of impervious surface area, we divided China into seven sub-regions based on climate, soil type, feature complexity, and vegetation phenology: arid and semi-arid areas, Huang-Huai-Hai winter wheat production areas, typical temperate regions, the Pearl River Delta, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, typical tropical and subtropical regions, and the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Impervious surface area was estimated from Landsat 8 images of five typical cities, including Yinchuan, Shijiazhuang, Shenyang, Ningbo, and Kunming. Using the linear spectral unmixing method, impervious and permeable surface areas were determined at the pixel-scale based on end-member proportions. We calculated the producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and overall accuracy to assess the estimation accuracy, and compared the accuracies among images acquired from different seasons and locations. In tropical and subtropical regions, vegetation canopies can confound the identification of impervious surfaces and, thus, images acquired in winter, early spring, and autumn are most suitable; estimations in the Pearl River Delta, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are influenced by soil, vegetation phenology, vegetation canopy, and water, and images acquired in spring, summer, and autumn provide the best results; in typical temperate areas, images acquired from spring to autumn are most effective for estimations; in winter wheat-growing areas, images acquired throughout the year are suitable; and in arid and semi-arid areas, summer and early autumn, during which vegetation is abundant, are the optimal seasons for estimations. Knowledge of optimal time frames, multi-source data, and intelligent algorithms should be integrated to reduce spectral confusion and improve the estimation of impervious surface area from Landsat 8 OLI imagery.

AB  - Diet and food preferences of the green turtle Chelonia mydas were analyzed based on digestive tract contents of dead specimens caught incidentally by an artisanal gillnet fishery in Sechura Bay, northern Peru. We examined 27 digestive tracts and identified 35 prey items. The sampled turtles were all juveniles (CCL = 53.7 +/- 1.2 cm, range 40.5-67.0 cm). The prey items were grouped into six categories: algae, cnidarians, mollusks, arthropods, chordates and garbage/anthropogenic debris. The items with the highest Frequency of Occurrence values (% FO) were: Caulerpa filiformis (77.8%), Loligo gahi (eggs) (51.9%) and Rhodymenia corallina (44.4%). By weight (% W), the most important items, were L. gahi (eggs) (33.3%), Stomolophus sp. (7.3%) and Aphos porosus (6.5%). According to the Preponderance Index (%IP), the preponderant item was L. gahi (eggs) with 6.1% and 61.2% during winter-spring and summer-autumn, respectively. According to the Resultant Weight index (Rw) of wet items, the most important items were: C. filiformis (13.1%), L. gahi (eggs) (10.5%), R. corallina (7.4%), plastic (7.5%), Gigartina chamissoi (5.1%). Garbage/anthropogenic debris was common in the digestive tracts analyzed. Plastic items had a frequency of occurrence of 44.4%. A greater diversity of food items was observed during summer and autumn. This study shows that juvenile C. mydas forage on a variety of resources. We recommend that conservation plans, land use planning and future management plans in the Sechura Bay include green turtles as a sentinel species for monitoring biodiversity of marine resources and the degree of pollution in the Bay.

TI  - Phenology Plays an Important Role in the Regulation of Terrestrial Ecosystem Water-Use Efficiency in the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem-scale water-use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) to evapotranspiration (ET), is an important indicator of coupled carbon-water cycles. Relationships between WUE and environmental factors have been widely investigated, but the variations in WUE in response to biotic factors remain little understood. Here, we argue that phenology plays an important role in the regulation of WUE by analyzing seasonal WUE responses to variability of photosynthetic phenological factors in terrestrial ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere using MODIS satellite observations during 2000-2014. Our results show that WUE, during spring and autumn is widely and significantly correlated to the start (SOS) and end (EOS) of growing season, respectively, after controlling for environmental factors (including temperature, precipitation, radiation and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration). The main patterns of WUE response to phenology suggest that an increase in spring (or autumn) WUE with an earlier SOS (or later EOS) are mainly because the increase in GPP is relatively large in magnitude compared to that of ET, or due to an increase in GPP accompanied by a decrease in ET, resulting from an advanced SOS (or a delayed EOS). Our results and conclusions are helpful to complement our knowledge of the biological regulatory mechanisms underlying coupled carbon-water cycles.

TI  - Evaluating Heavy-Metal Stress Levels in Rice Using a Theoretical Model of Canopy-Air Temperature and Leaf Area Index Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate analysis of heavy-metal contamination in crops is important with regard to human health, which has been made possible by the development of remote sensing technology. The objective of this study is to develop a theoretical model based on physical energy balance equations and remote sensing data to evaluate heavy-metal stress in rice based on physiological function responses. Heavy-metal stress can induce a series of variations in the physiological functions of plants, and canopy temperature is an indicator of these changes. Air temperature and leaf area index (LAI) can also affect the canopy temperature, and thus, these parameters were included in the model. Three extreme states of heavy-metal stress in rice were analyzed: (1) No stress just after transplant; (2) no stress; and (3) severe stress corresponding to the maximum possible LAI value. The theoretical model was based on the shape of a triangle, and a normalized heavy-metal stress index (HMSI) was proposed to describe the stress levels quantitatively. Validation by field experimentation showed that the HMSI is a reliable indicator of stress levels in rice. Because canopy temperature and LAI values can be obtained easily using remote sensing data, this method was further validated at the regional scale, and the distribution of heavy-metal stress levels across Zhuzhou County, Hunan Province, China, was rapidly determined.

TI  - Employing crowdsourced geographic data and multi-temporal/multi-sensor satellite imagery to monitor land cover change: A case study in an urbanizing region of the Philippines
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change (LCC) can have a significant impact on human and environmental well-being. LCC maps derived from historical remote sensing (RS) images are often used to evaluate the impacts of past LC changes and to construct models to predict future LC changes. Free moderate spatial resolution (-30 m) optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) RS imagery is now becoming increasingly available for this LCC monitoring. However, the classification algorithms used to extract LC information from these images typically require "training data" for classification (i.e. points or polygons with LC class labels), and acquiring this labelled training data can be difficult and time-consuming. Alternatively, crowdsourced geographic data (CGD) has become widely available from online sources like OpenStreetMap (OSM), and it may provide a useful source of training data for LCC monitoring. A major challenge with utilizing CGD for LCC mapping, however, is the presence of class labelling errors, and these errors can vary spatially (e.g. due to differing levels of CGD contributor expertise) and temporally (e.g. due to time lag between CGD creation and RS imagery acquisition). In this study, we investigated a new LCC mapping method which utilizes free Landsat (optical) and PALSAR mosaic (SAR) satellite imagery in combination with labelled LC data extracted from CGD sources (the OSM "landuse" and "natural" polygon datasets). A semi-unsupervised classification approach was employed for the LCC mapping to reduce the effects of class label noise in the CGD. The main motivation and benefit of the proposed method is that it does not require training data to be manually collected, allowing for a faster and more automated assessment of LCC. As a case study, we applied the method to map LCC in the Laguna de Bay area of the Philippines over the 2007-2015 period. The LCC map produced using our proposed approach achieved an overall classification accuracy of 90.2%, providing evidence that CGD and multi-temporal/multi-sensor satellite imagery, when combined, have a great potential for LCC monitoring.

TI  - SNR (Signal-To-Noise Ratio) Impact on Water Constituent Retrieval from Simulated Images of Optically Complex Amazon Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainties in the estimates of water constituents are among the main issues concerning the orbital remote sensing of inland waters. Those uncertainties result from sensor design, atmosphere correction, model equations, and in situ conditions (cloud cover, lake size/shape, and adjacency effects). In the Amazon floodplain lakes, such uncertainties are amplified due to their seasonal dynamic. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the suitability of a sensor to cope with them and assess their impact on the algorithms for the retrieval of constituents. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of the SNR on the Chl-a and TSS algorithms in four lakes located at Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve (Amazonia, Brazil). Two data sets were simulated (noisy and noiseless spectra) based on in situ measurements and on sensor design (MSI/Sentinel-2, OLCI/Sentinel-3, and OLI/Landsat 8). The dataset was tested using three and four algorithms for TSS and Chl-a, respectively. The results showed that the impact of the SNR on each algorithm displayed similar patterns for both constituents. For additive and single band algorithms, the error amplitude is constant for the entire concentration range. However, for multiplicative algorithms, the error changes according to the model equation and the R-rs magnitude. Lastly, for the exponential algorithm, the retrieval amplitude is higher for a low concentration. The OLCI sensor has the best retrieval performance (error of up to 2 mu g/L for Chl-a and 3 mg/L for TSS). For MSI, the error of the additive and single band algorithms for TSS and Chl-a are low (up to 5 mg/L and 1 mu g/L, respectively); but for the multiplicative algorithm, the errors were above 10 mu g/L. The OLI simulation resulted in errors below 3 mg/L for TSS. However, the number and position of OLI bands restrict Chl-a retrieval. Sensor and algorithm selection need a comprehensive analysis of key factors such as sensor design, in situ conditions, water brightness (R-rs), and model equations before being applied for inland water studies.

TI  - Frozen sections in patients undergoing breast conserving surgery at a single ambulatory surgical center: 5 year experience
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate outcomes of our breast frozen section (FS) practice in its first 5 years, including our specialized FS of margins (FSM) procedure for breast conserving therapy (BCT) patients.Methods: One thousand two hundred and forty eight patients undergoing 1303 breast FSM and/or sentinel lymph node (SLN) FS were included. Clinicopathologic features were assessed by chart review.Results: Use of SLN FS declined, from 43.5% of FS cases before to 19.2% of FS cases after 2012. FSM patients had a decline in overall reexcision to 12.3% in 2013-2014 (p = 0.063). There was also decline in reexcision for focally close margins (p < 0.0001) but no change in reexcision for extensively close margins. Reexcision was significantly associated with lobular subtype, multifocality and larger (>= T2) size. False negative FSM cases were most often influenced by extensively close or positive final (reexcised) margins sent for permanent section only (96/148; 64.9%).Conclusions: Despite changing surgical practices, FSM remains a valuable service that reduces reexcision in BCT patients.

T2  - Indian journal of critical care medicine : peer-reviewed, official publication of Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to study the clinical features and outcomes of patients with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All adult patients admitted to our ICU with acute onset neurologic symptoms with focal vasogenic edema on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included in the study. Data were collected on demography, coexisting illness, admission severity of illness, neurological symptoms, blood pressure, treatment initiated, and MRI findings. Outcome data collected included mortality, ICU average length of stay (ALOS), number of ventilator days, and neurological disability at discharge assessed by modified Rankin scale (MRS).RESULTS: Fourteen patients were admitted with PRES. Thirteen patients were female, and their mean age was 31.5 ± 8.3 years. Etiology of PRES included eclampsia (64.2%), lupus nephritis (21.4%), CKD (7.1%), and hypertension (n = 1 [7.1%]). The most common presenting symptom was seizure (92.8%), followed by visual disturbance (42.8%), headache (42.8%), encephalopathy (14.2%), and status epilepticus (14.2%). The Glasgow coma scale on admission was 12.3 ± 2.9. High blood pressure was seen in 12 patients 85.7%; their mean systolic and diastolic pressures were 173 ± 10.2 and 110 ± 8.6 mmHg, respectively. MRI showed that parieto-occipital region was most commonly involved (92.8%), followed by frontal lobe (42.8%). ICU ALOS was 4.35 ± 2.4 days and mean ventilator days was 1.7 ± 2.0 days. One patient (1/14 [7.4%]) died of multiorgan failure and 13 patients were discharged with no residual neurological deficit (MRS, 0).CONCLUSIONS: PRES is a potentially reversible disorder with prompt recognition and control of blood pressure.

TI  - Dynamics of Forest Ecosystems of the Katangese Copper Belt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I. Causes, Spatial transformations and Extent
T2  - Tropicultura
M3  - Article
AB  - The socio-economic development resulting from the emergence of the mining sector in the Democratic Republic of the Congo causes significant changes in the natural ecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate, the deforestation patterns in the Katangese Copper Belt (K.C.B.) caused by the proliferation of mining sites and urban areas using the Landsat images of 2002 and 2015. A 10 km x 10 km square grid was applied to calculate landscape metrics for forest pattern analysis. The results obtained within the K.C.B. show that, the relative area of forests decreases from 49%to 42% between 2002 and 2015. Most squares are characterized by an increase in the number of forest patches and by a reduction of the forest area. Dissection was identified as the dominant spatial transformation process governing the forest cover dynamics. Other processes observed related to anthropogenic effects in landscapes were the suppression and the fragmentation. Aggregation, creation and enlargement dominate those squares situated in private concessions or in which forest conservation initiatives are developed. A link between the overall forest cover declining and the development the urban areas and the mining sites has been mapped. This study can serve as a conceptual framework for the application of policies oriented towards a more sustainable conservation of the Katangese forests, hence inversing the current trends.

TI  - Meteorological Radiation Model (MRM v6.1): Improvements in diffuse radiation estimates and a new approach for implementation of cloud products
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - This work reviews techniques and models for solar radiation simulations and communicates further improvements performed in the Meteorological Radiation Model (MRM) developed at the National Observatory of Athens. The new version (MRM v6.1) considers a forward to-the-ground scattering as a function of solar altitude for the diffuse radiation estimates, while concurrently uses two running codes i.e., with sunshine duration as input (MRM v6.1a) and with cloud products (MRM v6.lb). The new scattering function leads to increase in diffuse radiation, especially for low zenith angles, and to better simulations with the measured diffuse (RMSE=36.3% and MBE=6.5%, against RMSE=42.0% and MBE=22.3% for the latest MRM v6). These changes lead also to better simulations of global radiation (RMSE=8.7% against RMSE=9.5% for MRM v6), while the direct radiation is not affected. The accuracy in the simulations increases significantly for clear-sky conditions, while it shows a small dependence on aerosol amount and solar altitude. Furthermore, in the sub-version MRM v6.1b the calculations for the cloud transmittance have been modified to allow for the inclusion of cloud products as inputs in case of non-availability of sunshine duration data. In this study, MRM v6.lb uses MERRA retrievals of cloud optical depth and cloud fraction for calculations of the cloud transmittance; these parameters usually lead to significant uncertainties in the simulations of the hourly direct and global radiations, especially for large cloud fractions. This indicates the need for high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data of cloudiness for accurate estimations of solar radiation under cloudy conditions and highlights the incapability of radiative transfer models on such simulations. However, on monthly basis both MRM v6.1a and v6.1b provide high accuracy in solar radiation estimates, thus rendering MRM v6.1 as a powerful tool for solar energy applications.

TI  - Genetic parameters of mid-infrared methane predictions and their relationships with milk production traits in Holstein cattle
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many countries have pledged to reduce greenhouse gases. In this context, the dairy sector is one of the identified sectors to adapt production circumstances to address socio-environmental constraints due to its large carbon footprint related to CH4 emission. This study aimed mainly to estimate (1) the genetic parameters of 2 milk mid-infrared-based CH4 proxies [predicted daily CH4 emission (PME, g/d), and log-transformed predicted CH4 intensity (LMI)] and (2) their genetic correlations with milk production traits [milk (MY), fat (FY), and protein (PY) yields] from first-and second parity Holstein cows. A total of 336,126 and 231;400 mid-infrared CH4 phenotypes were collected from 56,957 and 34,992 first-and second-parity cows, respectively. The PME increased from the first to the second lactation (433 vs. 453 g/d) and the LMI decreased (2.93 vs. 2.86). We used 20 bivariate random regression test-day models to estimate the variance components. Moderate heritability values were observed for both CH4 traits, and those values decreased slightly from the first to the second lactation (0.25 0.01 and 0.22 0.01 for PME; 0.18 0.01 and 0.17 0.02 for LMI). Lactation phenotypic and genetic correlations were negative between PME and MY in both first and second lactations (-0.07 vs. -0.07 and -0.19 vs. -0.24, respectively). More close scrutiny revealed that relative increase of PME was lower with high MY levels even reverting to decrease, and therefore explaining the negative correlations, indicating that higher producing cows could be a mitigation option for CH4 emission. The PME phenotypic correlations were almost equal to 0 with FY and PY for both lactations. However, the genetic correlations between PME and FY were slightly positive (0.11 and 0.12), whereas with PY the correlations were slightly negative (-0.05 and -0.04). Both phenotypic and genetic correlations between LMI and MY or PY or FY were always relatively highly negative (from 0.21 to -0.88). As the genetic correlations between PME and LMI were strong (0.71 and 0.72 in first and second lactation), the selection of one trait would also strongly influence the other trait. However, in animal breeding context, PME, as a direct quantity CH4 proxy, would be preferred to LMI, which is a ratio trait of PME with a trait already in the index. The range of PME sire estimated breeding values were 22.1 and 29.41 kg per lactation in first and second parity, respectively. Further studies must be conducted to evaluate the effect of the introduction of PME in a selection index on the other traits already included in this index, such as, for instance, fertility or longevity.

TI  - Areal-Averaged Spectral Surface Albedo in an Atlantic Coastal Area: Estimation from Ground-Based Transmission
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tower-based data combined with high-resolution satellite products have been used to produce surface albedo at various spatial scales over land. Because tower-based albedo data are available at only a few sites, surface albedos using these combined data are spatially limited. Moreover, tower-based albedo data are not representative of highly heterogeneous regions. To produce areal-averaged and spectrally-resolved surface albedo for regions with various degrees of surface heterogeneity, we have developed a transmission-based retrieval and demonstrated its feasibility for relatively homogeneous land surfaces. Here, we demonstrate its feasibility for a highly heterogeneous coastal region. We use the atmospheric transmission measured during a 19-month period (June 2009-December 2010) by a ground-based Multi-Filter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFRSR) at five wavelengths (0.415, 0.5, 0.615, 0.673 and 0.87 mu m) at the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facility (AMF) site located on Graciosa Island. We compare the MFRSR-retrieved areal-averaged surface albedo with albedo derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, and also a composite-based albedo. We demonstrate that these three methods produce similar spectral signatures of surface albedo; however, the MFRSR-retrieved albedo, is higher on average (<= 0.04) than the MODIS-based areal-averaged surface albedo and the largest difference occurs in winter.

AB  - Purpose: Optimal duration of adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer remained to be investigated rigorously for the standard regimens in widespread use in North America (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, AC) and Europe (5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, FEC). Whether six cycles of FEC 100 present an advantage, or not, compared with only four cycles was tested directly in a phase III prospective multicentre trial.Patients and methods: Between 2002 and 2006, 1515 women between 18 and 65 degrees years of age, with node negative N(-) high-risk early-stage breast cancer, were included in the study following breast surgery and axillary lymph node dissection or procedure by sentinel node technique. Inclusion in the study required tumour size T >= 1 cm and at least one of the high-risk factors: T > 2 cm, negative oestrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER- and PR-), Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade II or III and age <= 35 degrees years. Patients were randomly assigned to either six FEC 100 (Arm A) or four FEC 100 (Arm B). The trial was powered to detect an absolute difference >= 6% in disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 degrees years.Results: At 6.1 degrees years median follow-up, with 91 (12%) events recorded in Arm A versus 106 (14%) in Arm B, no statistically significant risk increase was associated with four versus six FEC 100: DFS (hazard ratio (HR) Z 1.18; CI 95% [0.89-1.56], P = .24) and overall survival (OS) (HR Z 1.39; CI 95% [0.91-2.13], P = .12).Conclusion: Differences in chemotherapy duration did not induce notably different outcomes in our cohort of high-risk patients.

TI  - Dry Season Evapotranspiration Dynamics over Human-Impacted Landscapes in the Southern Amazon Using the Landsat-Based METRIC Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although seasonal and temporal variations in evapotranspiration (ET) in Amazonia have been studied based upon flux-tower data and coarse resolution satellite-based models, ET dynamics over human-impacted landscapes are highly uncertain in this region. In this study, we estimate ET rates from critical land cover types over highly fragmented landscapes in the southern Amazon and characterize the ET dynamics during the dry season using the METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration) model. METRIC, a Landsat-based ET model, that generates spatially continuous ET estimates at a 30 m spatial resolution widely used for agricultural applications, was adapted to the southern Amazon by using the NDVI indexed reference ET fraction (ETrF) approach. Compared to flux tower-based ET rates, this approach showed an improved performance on the forest ET estimation over the standard METRIC approach, with R-2 = 0.73 from R-2 = 0.70 and RMSE reduced from 0.77 mm/day to 0.35 mm/day. We used this approach integrated into the METRIC procedure to estimate ET rates from primary, regenerated, and degraded forests and pasture in Acre, Rondonia, and Mato Grosso, all located in the southern Amazon, during the dry season in 2009. The lowest ET rates occurred in Mato Grosso, the driest region. Acre and Rondonia, both located in the southwestern Amazon, had similar ET rates for all land cover types. Dry season ET rates between primary forest and regenerated forest were similar (p > 0.05) in all sites, ranging between 2.5 and 3.4 mm/day for both forest cover types in the three sites. ET rates from degraded forest in Mato Grosso were significantly lower (p < 0.05) compared to the other forest cover types, with a value of 2.03 mm/day on average. Pasture showed the lowest ET rates during the dry season at all study sites, with the dry season average ET varying from 1.7 mm/day in Mato Grosso to 2.8 mm/day in Acre.

TI  - Do vented chest seals differ in efficacy? An experimental evaluation using a swine hemopneumothorax model
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Airways compromise was the second leading cause of potentially preventable death among combat casualties. We investigated the ability of five Food and Drug Administration-approved nonocclusive chest seals (CSs) to seal a bleeding chest wound and prevent tension hemopneumothorax (HPTX) in a swine model.METHODS: Following instrumentation, an open chest wound was created in the left thorax of spontaneously air-breathing anesthetized pigs (n = 26; 43 kg). Autologous fresh blood (226 mL) was then infused into the pleural cavity to produce HPTX. The chest wounds were then sealed with CSs. The sealant strength and venting function of CSs were challenged by infusion of 50 mL more blood directly into the chest wound and incremental air injections into the pleural cavity. Tension HPTX was defined as intrapleural (IP) pressure equal to or more than + 1 mm Hg and more than 20% deviation in physiologic measurements.RESULTS: An open chest wound with HPTX raised IP pressure (similar to -0.7 mm Hg) and caused labored breathing and reductions in PaO2 and SvO(2) (p < 0.01). Sealing the wounds with the CSs restored IP pressure, and improved breathing and oxygenation. Subsequent blood infusion into the wound and IP air injections produced CS-dependent responses. Chest seals with one-way valves (Bolin and SAM) did not evacuate the blood efficiently; pooled blood either detached the CSs from skin and leaked out (75%), or clotted and clogged the valve and led to tension HPTX (25%). Conversely, CSs with laminar venting channels allowed escape of blood and air from the pleural cavity and maintained IP pressure and oxygenation near normal levels. Success rates were 100% for Sentinel and Russell (6/6); 67% for HyFin (4/6); 25% for SAM (1/4); and 0% for Bolin (0/4) CSs (p = 0.002).CONCLUSION: The sealant and valve function of vented CS differedwidely in the presence of bleeding chest wounds. Medics should be equipped withmore effective CSs for treating HPTX in the field. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The comparison of NN, SVR, LSSVR and ANFIS at modeling meteorological and remotely sensed drought indices over the eastern district of Isfahan, Iran
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to employ and compare four methods of neural network (NN), support vector regression (SVR), least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for modeling the time series behavior of the meteorological and the remotely sensed (RS) drought indices of the eastern district of Isfahan during 2000-2014. The data used in the paper are the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the land surface temperature time series of MODIS satellite and the rainfall time series of TRMM satellite. Then, three RS drought indices namely vegetation condition index, NDVI deviation index and temperature vegetation index and three meteorological drought indices namely 3-month SPI, 6-month SPI and 12-month SPI are generated by the data. Afterward, based on the correlation coefficient between the RS and the meteorological drought indices, three indices are chosen as candidate indices for monitoring the drought severity of the study area. After modeling the time series behavior of these indices by the aforementioned methods, the results indicate that the SVR has the highest and the NN has the lowest efficiency among all the methods. In addition, the performance speed of the LSSVR and then the ANFIS is the highest. At the end of the paper, a fuzzy inference system (FIS) is presented based on the candidate indices to monitor the drought severity at spring and summer of 2000-2014. According to the results of the designed FIS, the spring status is normal in all years except 2000 and 2011 (moderate drought) and the summer status is severe drought in all years except 2000, 2010, 2011 and 2014 (moderate drought).

TI  - The risk factors and prevalence of upper extremity impairments and an analysis of effects of lymphoedema and other impairments on the quality of life of breast cancer patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to determine the prevalence and identify the risk factors associated with upper extremity impairments (UEIs) in breast cancer patients and to investigate the degree to which these impairments and other characteristics influence quality of life (QoL). A total of 201 women over the age of 18 who underwent breast cancer treatment at least 6months were included in this cross-sectional study. All of the patients were evaluated for the presence of lymphoedema and any UEIs. UEIs divided into five subgroups: pain, restriction of shoulder range of motion (ROM), numbness and heaviness, loss of strength, and sensory deficit. QoL of the patients was evaluated by SF-36. The prevalence of the upper extremity impairments was as follows: pain 31.8%, restriction of shoulder ROM 23.9%, numbness and heaviness 35.3%, loss of strength 8.5%, and sensory deficit 18.4%. Furthermore, lymphoedema was seen in 41.3% of patients. The multivariate model showed that lymphoedema is the only statistically significant risk factor that affects the development of UEIs (P = 0.001). However, it also revealed that lymphoedema (P = 0.001) and increased age negatively affect QoL, whereas prolongation of the follow-up period has a favourable impact (P = 0.016). Therefore, lymphoedema diminishes QoL via an increased number of UEIs.

TI  - Conditional heavy-tail behavior with applications to precipitation and river flow extremes
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article deals with the right-tail behavior of a response distribution conditional on a regressor vector restricted to the heavy-tailed case of Pareto-type conditional distributions , with heaviness of the right tail characterized by the conditional extreme value index . We particularly focus on testing the hypothesis of constant tail behavior for some and all possible . When considering as a time index, the term trend analysis is commonly used. In the recent past several such trend analyses in extreme value data have been published, mostly focusing on time-varying modeling of location or scale parameters of the response distribution. In many such environmental studies a simple test against trend based on Kendall's tau statistic is applied. This test is powerful when the center of the conditional distribution changes monotonically in , for instance, in a simple location model , , but the test is rather insensitive against monotonic tail behavior, say, . This has to be considered, since for many environmental applications the main interest is on the tail rather than the center of a distribution. Our work is motivated by this problem and it is our goal to demonstrate the opportunities and the limits of detecting and estimating non-constant conditional heavy-tail behavior with regard to applications from hydrology. We present and compare four different procedures by simulations and illustrate our findings on real data from hydrology: weekly maxima of hourly precipitation from France and monthly maximal river flows from Germany.

TI  - Relationship between Remote Sensing Data, Plant Biomass and Soil Nitrogen Dynamics in Intensively Managed Grasslands under Controlled Conditions
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainable use of grasslands in intensive farming systems aims to optimize nitrogen (N) inputs to increase crop yields and decrease harmful losses to the environment at the same time. To achieve this, simple optical sensors may provide a non-destructive, time- and cost-effective tool for estimating plant biomass in the field, considering spatial and temporal variability. However, the plant growth and related N uptake is affected by the available N in the soil, and therefore, N mineralization and N losses. These soil N dynamics and N losses are affected by the N input and environmental conditions, and cannot easily be determined non-destructively. Therefore, the question arises: whether a relationship can be depicted between N fertilizer levels, plant biomass and N dynamics as indicated by nitrous oxide (N2O) losses and inorganic N levels. We conducted a standardized greenhouse experiment to explore the potential of spectral measurements for analyzing yield response, N mineralization and N2O emissions in a permanent grassland. Ryegrass was subjected to four mineral fertilizer input levels over 100 days (four harvests) under controlled environmental conditions. The soil temperature and moisture content were automatically monitored, and the emission rates of N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) were detected frequently. Spectral measurements of the swards were performed directly before harvesting. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and simple ratio (SR) were moderately correlated with an increasing biomass as affected by fertilization level. Furthermore, we found a non-linear response of increasing N2O emissions to elevated fertilizer levels. Moreover, inorganic N and extractable organic N levels at the end of the experiment tended to increase with the increasing N fertilizer addition. However, microbial biomass C and CO2 efflux showed no significant differences among fertilizer treatments, reflecting no substantial changes in the soil biological pool size and the extent of the C mineralization. Neither the NDVI nor SR, nor the plant biomass, were related to cumulative N2O emissions or inorganic N at harvesting. Our results verify the usefulness of optical sensors for biomass detection, and show the difficulty in linking spectral measurements of plant traits to N processes in the soil, despite that the latter affects the former.

TI  - Diagnostic Distinction of Malignant Melanoma and Benign Nevi by a Gene Expression Signature and Correlation to Clinical Outcomes
T2  - CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS & PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Histopathologic examination alone can be inadequate for diagnosis of certain melanocytic neoplasms. Recently, a 23-gene expression signature was clinically validated as an ancillary diagnostic test to differentiate benign nevi from melanoma. The current study assessed the performance of this test in an independent cohort of melanocytic lesions against clinically proven outcomes.Methods: Archival tissue from primary cutaneous melanomas and melanocytic nevi was obtained from four independent institutions and tested with the gene signature. Cases were selected according to pre-defined clinical outcome measures. Malignant lesions were defined as stage I-III primary cutaneous melanomas that produced distant metastases (metastatic to sites other than proximal sentinel lymph node(s)) following diagnosis of the primary lesion. Melanomas that were metastatic at the time of diagnosis, all re-excisions, and lesions with <10% tumor volume were excluded. Benign lesions were defined as cutaneous melanocytic lesions with no adverse long-term events reported.Results: Of 239 submitted samples, 182 met inclusion criteria and produced a valid gene expression result. This included 99 primary cutaneous melanomas with proven distant metastases and 83 melanocytic nevi. Median time to melanoma metastasis was 18 months. Median follow-up time for nevi was 74.9 months. The gene expression score differentiated melanoma from nevi with a sensitivity of 93.8% and a specificity of 96.2%.Conclusions: The results of gene expression testing closely correlate with long-term clinical outcomes of patients with melanocytic neoplasms.

TI  - Estimating missing hourly climatic data using artificial neural network for energy balance based ET mapping applications
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing based evapotranspiration (ET) mapping has become an important tool for water resources management at a regional scale. Accurate hourly climatic data and alfalfa-reference ET (ETr) are crucial inputs for successfully implementing remote sensing based ET models such as Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) and Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL). In Turkey, hourly climatic data may not be available at all locations, either due to cost constraints or due to equipment malfunctioning. In this study, the artificial neural network (ANN) technique was used to estimate missing and unmeasured hourly climatic data and ETr for the agriculturally important semi-humid Bafra plains located in northern Turkey. Modelled and actual climatic data were used to derive ET maps from two Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper images acquired on 2 September 2009 and 4 August 2010. The METRIC algorithm was used to generate ET maps. Accuracy assessment of the METRIC-derived ET maps indicated that climatic data and ETr estimated through ANN could be used for accurately mapping ET, where hourly climatic data are missing or not measured.

TI  - Standardization of whole breast radiotherapy is required for safe omission of axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer patients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to assess the dose distribution and coverage of level I-II axillary lymph nodes during whole breast tangential field radiotherapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery in patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: The level I-II axillary lymph node volumes were retrospectively contoured by a single radiation oncologist based on computed tomography simulation data from 44 patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery without axillary dissection and who received postoperative whole breast RT between January and December 2014. The dose distributions of the whole breast tangential RT fields were reassessed in relation to the axillary level ? and ? lymph node volumes. Results: : The average doses delivered to level I and I axillary lymph nodes were 49.4% (range, 14.2-94.6) and 30.8% (range, 2.6-71.5) of the prescribed radiation dose, respectively. The volumes receiving at least 95% of the prescribed radiation dose were 12.7% (range, 0-67.4%) for level I and 1.4% (range, 0-7.7%) for level II nodes. Compared to thin patients, the average doses delivered to axillary lymph node levels I and II were significantly higher in overweight patients. Conclusion: The radiation dose coverage of axillary lymph nodes by whole breast tangential RT varies greatly among patients. To safely omit axillary lymph node dissection from the treatment of clinically axillary lymph node negative T1-2 breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes, standardization and individualization of whole breast RT are necessary.

TI  - Recurrence Rates Over 20 Years in the Treatment of Malignant Melanoma: Immediate Versus Delayed Reconstruction.
T2  - Plastic and reconstructive surgery. Global open
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Wide local excision (WLE) with a safety margin is the standard of treatment for primary head and neck cutaneous malignant melanoma (HNCMM). Studies have demonstrated inconsistency in recurrence rates following immediate versus delayed reconstruction. The objectives of this study were to assess and compare recurrence rates after WLE of HNCMM followed by immediate or delayed reconstruction in determining recurrence-free survival estimates.METHODS: A consecutive, retrospective analysis of 451 patients undergoing WLE of primary HNCMM followed by reconstruction over a period of 20 years was performed. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on timing of reconstruction (immediate versus delayed). Univariate analyses were performed to assess distributions. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed to estimate recurrence-free survival.RESULTS: Tumor specimen positive margins were comparable between immediate and delayed reconstruction groups (P = 0.129). Univariate analysis demonstrated comparable local melanoma recurrence after immediate or delayed reconstruction (41.4% versus 53.3%; P = 0.399). After adjusting for prognostic factors, multivariate analysis also failed to demonstrate an association between reconstruction timing and local recurrence-free survival (P = 0.167).CONCLUSIONS: In this long-term study, we were not able to demonstrate an association between reconstruction timing and local recurrence-free survival after excision WLE of HNCMM, rendering immediate reconstruction a reliable approach. In addition, the presence of ulceration and a positive sentinel lymph node were positively associated with the risk of recurrence.

TI  - A progressive approach for processing satellite data by operational research
T2  - OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data, together with spatial technologies, have a vital importance in earth sciences to continuously monitor natural and physical processes. However, images taken by earth-observing satellites are often associated with uncertainties due to atmospheric effects (i.e., absorption and scattering by atmospheric gases and aerosols). In this paper, a more adaptable approach for the removal of atmospheric effects from satellite data is introduced within an operational research perspective by utilizing nonparametric regression splines. Regional atmospheric correction models via multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) are applied on a set of satellite images for Alps and Turkey to calculate surface reflectance values. A classical radiative transfer based atmospheric correction method is likewise employed on the same data set. The results are compared in terms of relative differences with respect to surface reflectance data. MARS provides significant improvement in the order of 40 and 37 % for Alps and Turkey, respectively.

TI  - Nationwide Flood Monitoring for Disaster Risk Reduction Using Multiple Satellite Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the contribution to flood disaster risk reduction, it is important to identify and characterize flood areas, locations, and durations. Multiple satellite-based flood mapping and monitoring are an imperative process and the fundamental part of risk assessment in disaster risk management. In this paper, the MODIS-derived synchronized floodwater index (SfWi) was used to detect the maximum extent of a nationwide flood based on annual time-series data of 2015 in order to maximize the application of optical satellite data. The selected three major rivers-i.e., Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna (GBM), transboundary rivers running through the great floodplain delta lying between Bangladesh and eastern India-show that a propensity of flood risk was revealed by the temporal and spatial dynamics of the maximum flood extent during the 2015 monsoon season. Resultant flood maps showed that SfWi-indicated flood areas were small but more accurate than those derived from the single use of the MODIS-derived water index. The return period of SfWi-indicated maximum flood extent was confirmed to be about 20 years based on historical flood records.

TI  - Deconvoluting Kinase Inhibitor Induced Cardiotoxicity
T2  - TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Many drugs designed to inhibit kinases have their clinical utility limited by cardiotoxicity-related label warnings or prescribing restrictions. While this liability is widely recognized, designing safer kinase inhibitors (KI) requires knowledge of the causative kinase(s). Efforts to unravel the kinases have encountered pharmacology with nearly prohibitive complexity. At therapeutically relevant concentrations, KIs show promiscuity distributed across the kinome. Here, to overcome this complexity, 65 KIs with known kinome-scale polypharmacology profiles were assessed for effects on cardiomyocyte (CM) beating. Changes in human iPSC-CM beat rate and amplitude were measured using label-free cellular impedance. Correlations between beat effects and kinase inhibition profiles were mined by computation analysis (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) to identify associated kinases. Thirty kinases met criteria of having (1) pharmacological inhibition correlated with CM beat changes, (2) expression in both human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and adult heart tissue, and (3) effects on CM beating following single gene knockdown. A subset of these 30 kinases were selected for mechanistic follow up. Examples of kinases regulating processes spanning the excitation-contraction cascade were identified, including calcium flux (RPS6KA3, IKBKE) and action potential duration (MAP4K2). Finally, a simple model was created to predict functional cardiotoxicity whereby inactivity at three sentinel kinases (RPS6KB1, FAK, STK35) showed exceptional accuracy in vitro and translated to clinical KI safety data. For drug discovery, identifying causative kinases and introducing a predictive model should transform the ability to design safer KI medicines. For cardiovascular biology, discovering kinases previously unrecognized as influencing cardiovascular biology should stimulate investigation of underappreciated signaling pathways.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is being adapted to gynecologic cancer. Higher SLN mapping rates were reported with indocyanine green (ICG) compared to other dyes. The aim of this film is to share our experience of SLN mapping with ICG in vaginal cancer.Methods: A 40 year-old woman was diagnosed with squamous cell vaginal cancer. About 1.5 cm-sized tumor was located on the posterior vaginal fornix. Preoperatively she was assumed to be stage I vaginal cancer. Beginning of surgery, we performed SLN mapping by ICG injection into 3- and 9-o'clock positions of the vaginal tumor. Concentrated in 1.25 mg/mL, 1 mL of ICG solution was injected into deep stroma and another 1 mL submucosally in both sides. Bilateral SLN identification and lymphadenectomy were done. Afterward, laparoscopic Type C1 Querleu-Morrow radical hysterectomy with vaginectomy was done. A fluorescence endoscope produced by KARL STORZ (Tuttlingen, Germany) was used for ICG detection.Results: To our knowledge, this is the first film report performing SLN mapping with ICG in vaginal cancer. The mapping was successful and we were able to recognize SLN of vaginal cancer. SLNs were located in the bilateral obturator fossa. According to the pathologic diagnosis, the mass size was 15 mm and invasion depth was 1 mm. Subvaginal tissue involvement and pelvic wall extension were absent. Resection margin of the vagina was free from carcinoma. No lymph node metastasis was reported including the bilateral SLNs.Conclusion: For vaginal cancer, SLN mapping can be applied by injecting ICG into the bilateral sides of the vaginal tumor.

TI  - A comparative study on generating simulated Landsat NDVI images using data fusion and regression method-the case of the Korean Peninsula
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat optical images have enough spatial and spectral resolution to analyze vegetation growth characteristics. But, the clouds and water vapor degrade the image quality quite often, which limits the availability of usable images for the time series vegetation vitality measurement. To overcome this shortcoming, simulated images are used as an alternative. In this study, weighted average method, spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) method, and multilinear regression analysis method have been tested to produce simulated Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images of the Korean Peninsula. The test results showed that the weighted average method produced the images most similar to the actual images, provided that the images were available within 1 month before and after the target date. The STARFM method gives good results when the input image date is close to the target date. Careful regional and seasonal consideration is required in selecting input images. During summer season, due to clouds, it is very difficult to get the images close enough to the target date. Multilinear regression analysis gives meaningful results even when the input image date is not so close to the target date. Average R-2 values for weighted average method, STARFM, and multilinear regression analysis were 0.741, 0.70, and 0.61, respectively.

TI  - Ruptured Corpus Luteal Cyst: Prediction of Clinical Outcomes with CT
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the determinant pretreatment CT findings that can predict surgical intervention for patients suffering from corpus luteal cyst rupture with hemoperitoneum.Materials and Methods: From January 2009 to December 2014, a total of 106 female patients (mean age, 26.1 years; range, 17-44 years) who visited the emergency room of our institute for acute abdominal pain and were subsequently diagnosed with ruptured corpus luteal cyst with hemoperitoneum were included in the retrospective study. The analysis of CT findings included cyst size, cyst shape, sentinel clot sign, ring of fire sign, hemoperitoneum depth, active bleeding in portal phase and attenuation of hemoperitoneum. The comparison of CT findings between the surgery and conservative management groups was performed with the Mann-Whitney U test or chi-square test. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine significant CT findings in predicting surgical intervention for a ruptured cyst.Results: Comparative analysis revealed that the presence of active bleeding and the hemoperitoneum depth were significantly different between the surgery and conservative management groups and were confirmed as significant CT findings for predicting surgery, with adjusted odds ratio (ORs) of 3.773 and 1.318, respectively (p < 0.01). On the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis for hemoperitoneum depth, the optimal cut-off value was 5.8 cm with 73.7% sensitivity and 58.6% specificity (Az = 0.711, p = 0.004). In cases with a hemoperitoneum depth > 5.8 cm and concurrent active bleeding, the OR for surgery increased to 5.786.Conclusion: The presence of active bleeding and the hemoperitoneum depth on a pretreatment CT scan can be predictive warning signs of surgery for a patient with a ruptured corpus luteal cyst with hemoperitoneum.

TI  - Aerosol Property Retrieval Algorithm over Northeast Asia from TANSO-CAI Measurements Onboard GOSAT
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of aerosol has resulted in serious limitations in the data coverage and large uncertainties in retrieving carbon dioxide (CO2) amounts from satellite measurements. For this reason, an aerosol retrieval algorithm was developed for the Thermal and Near-infrared Sensor for carbon Observation-Cloud and Aerosol Imager (TANSO-CAI) launched in January 2009 on board the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT). The algorithm retrieves aerosol optical depth (AOD), aerosol size information, and aerosol type in 0.1 degrees grid resolution by look-up tables constructed using inversion products from Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) sun-photometer observation over Northeast Asia as a priori information. To improve the accuracy of the TANSO-CAI aerosol algorithm, we consider both seasonal and annual estimated radiometric degradation factors of TANSO-CAI in this study. Surface reflectance is determined by the same 23-path composite method of Rayleigh and gas corrected reflectance to avoid the stripes of each band. To distinguish aerosol absorptivity, reflectance difference test between ultraviolet (band 1) and visible (band 2) wavelengths depending on AODs was used. To remove clouds in aerosol retrieval, the normalized difference vegetation index and ratio of reflectance between band 2 (0.674 mu m) and band 3 (0.870 mu m) threshold tests have been applied. To mask turbid water over ocean, a threshold test for the estimated surface reflectance at band 2 was also introduced. The TANSO-CAI aerosol algorithm provides aerosol properties such as AOD, size information and aerosol types from June 2009 to December 2013 in this study. Here, we focused on the algorithm improvement for AOD retrievals and their validation in this study. The retrieved AODs were compared with those from AERONET and the Aqua/MODerate resolution Imaging Sensor (MODIS) Collection 6 Level 2 dataset over land and ocean. Comparisons of AODs between AERONET and TANSO-CAI over Northeast Asia showed good agreement with correlation coefficient (R) 0.739 +/- 0.046, root mean square error (RMSE) 0.232 +/- 0.047, and linear regression line slope 0.960 +/- 0.083 for the entire period. Over ocean, the comparisons between Aqua/MODIS and TANSO-CAI for the same period over Northeast Asia showed improved consistency, with correlation coefficient 0.830 +/- 0.047, RMSE 0.140 +/- 0.019, and linear regression line slope 1.226 +/- 0.063 for the entire period. Over land, however, the comparisons between Aqua/MODIS and TANSO-CAI show relatively lower correlation (approximate R = 0.67, RMSE = 0.40, slope = 0.77) than those over ocean. In order to improve accuracy in retrieving CO2 amounts, the retrieved aerosol properties in this study have been provided as input for CO2 retrieval with GOSAT TANSO-Fourier Transform Spectrometer measurements.

AB  - Glaciers' changes are an important indicator of global warming, and the interpretation of satellite images offers a good source of information for such a monitoring. It is important to select areas of interest for the detection of glaciers bodies and in particular to capture also the part covered with debris, which is an open issue in remote sensing of the glaciers.We use enhancing features with a physical meaning and we provide a coarse segmentation of the image of the Lys glacier belonging to the Monte Rosa district in the Alps.The image data correspond to electromagnetic sensing of sunlight as reflected in band of the visible red spectral range, T M3, and in two infrared bands T M4 and T M5, as operated from the thematic mapper (TM) sensor aboard the Landsat satellite in clear sunny days.

TI  - Mapping Typical Urban LULC from Landsat Imagery without Training Samples or Self-Defined Parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) change is one of the most important indicators in understanding the interactions between humans and the environment. Traditionally, when LULC maps are produced yearly, most existing remote-sensing methods have to collect ground reference data annually, as the classifiers have to be trained individually in each corresponding year. This study presented a novel strategy to map LULC classes without training samples or assigning parameters. First of all, several novel indices were carefully selected from the index pool, which were able to highlight certain LULC very well. Following this, a common unsupervised classifier was employed to extract the LULC from the associated index image without assigning thresholds. Finally, a supervised classification was implemented with samples automatically collected from the unsupervised classification outputs. Results illustrated that the proposed method could achieve satisfactory performance, reaching similar accuracies to traditional approaches. Findings of this study demonstrate that the proposed strategy is a simple and effective alternative to mapping urban LULC. With the proposed strategy, the budget and time required for remote-sensing data processing could be reduced dramatically.

TI  - Modeling of a severe dust event and its impacts on ozone photochemistry over the downstream Nanjing megacity of eastern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust aerosols could affect tropospheric photochemistry by interacting with solar radiation or providing reactive surfaces for heterogeneous reactions. This study examines the effects of a typical springtime dust storm (16-18 March, 2014) on ozone photochemistry over the downstream Nanjing megacity in eastern China. The on-line coupled Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model is used, with the inclusion of eight heterogeneous reactions on dust surfaces. Comparisons with satellite data and visibility record indicate that the model is capable of reproducing the onset time and downstream transport of this dust event. Dust particles act as a sink for all these trace gases examined here. The net decreases of O-3, NO2, NO3, N2O5, HNO3, (OH)-O-center dot, HO2 center dot and H2O2 in the atmosphere are estimated as -6.1%, -16.0%, -37.4%, -13.9%, -47.7%, -6.0%, -9.2% and -29.7%, of which more than 80% can be explained by heterogeneous chemistry on dust surfaces. The decreases in ground photolysis rate and (OH)-O-center dot concentration, along with changes in other weather variables induced by dust aerosols (i.e., radiation and temperature) lead to lower photochemical activity and a small decrease of O3 mixing ratio by roughly 0.5%. This study highlights the importance of dust interaction with ozone photochemistry, and also sets the stage for further investigation of the complicated dust impacts on tropospheric aerosol chemistry.

TI  - Generating a series of fine spatial and temporal resolution land cover maps by fusing coarse spatial resolution remotely sensed images and fine spatial resolution land cover maps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of land cover dynamics would benefit greatly from the generation of land cover maps at both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Fine spatial resolution images are usually acquired relatively infrequently, whereas coarse spatial resolution images may be acquired with a high repetition rate but may not capture the spatial detail of the land cover mosaic of the region of interest. Traditional image spatial-temporal fusion methods focus on the blending of pixel spectra reflectance values and do not directly provide land cover maps or information on land cover dynamics. In this research, a novel Spatial-Temporal remotely sensed Images and land cover Maps Fusion Model ( STIMFM) is proposed to produce land cover maps at both fine spatial and temporal resolutions using a series of coarse spatial resolution images together with a few fine spatial resolution land cover maps that pre-and post-date the series of coarse spatial resolution images. STIMFM integrates both the spatial and temporal dependences of fine spatial resolution pixels and outputs a series of fine spatial-temporal resolution land cover maps instead of reflectance images, which can be used directly for studies of land cover dynamics. Here, three experiments based on simulated and real remotely sensed images were undertaken to evaluate the STIMFM for studies of land cover change. These experiments included comparative assessment of methods based on single- date image such as the super-resolution approaches ( e.g., pixel swapping-based super-resolution mapping) and the state-of-the-art spatial-temporal fusion approach that used the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) and the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusionmodel (FSDAF) to predict the fine-resolution images, in which the maximum likelihood classifier and the automated land cover updating approach based on integrated change detection and classification method were then applied to generate the fine-resolution land cover maps. Results show that the methods based on single- date image failed to predict the pixels of changed and unchanged land cover with high accuracy. The land cover maps that were obtained by classification of the reflectance images outputted from ESTARFM and FSDAF contained substantial misclassification, and the classification accuracy was lower for pixels of changed land cover than for pixels of unchanged land cover. In addition, STIMFM predicted fine spatial-temporal resolution land cover maps from a series of Landsat images and a few Google Earth images, to which ESTARFM and FSDAF that require correlation in reflectance bands in coarse and fine images cannot be applied. Notably, STIMFM generated higher accuracy for pixels of both changed and unchanged land cover in comparison with other methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - On the association between land system architecture and land surface temperatures: Evidence from a Desert Metropolis-Phoenix, Arizona, USA
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between the characteristics of the urban land system and land surface temperature (LST) has received increasing attention in urban heat island and sustainability research, especially for desert cities. This research generally employs medium or coarser spatial resolution data and primarily focuses on the effects of a few classes of land-cover composition and pattern at the neighborhood or larger level using regression models. This study explores the effects of land system architecture composition and configuration, both pattern and shape, of fine-grain land-cover classes on LST of single family residential parcels in the Phoenix, Arizona (southwestern USA) metropolitan area. A 1 m resolution land-cover map is used to calculate land architecture metrics at the parcel level, and 6.8 m resolution MODIS/ASTER data are employed to retrieve LST. Linear mixed-effects models quantify the impacts of land configuration on LST at the parcel scale, controlling for the effects of land composition and neighborhood characteristics. Results indicate that parcel-level land-cover composition has the strongest association with daytime and nighttime 1ST, but the configuration of this cover, foremost compactness and concentration, also affects 1ST, with different associations between land architecture and 1ST at nighttime and daytime. Given information on land system architecture at the parcel level, additional information based on geographic and socioeconomic variables does not improve the generalization capability of the statistical models. The results point the way towards parcel-level land-cover design that helps to mitigate the urban heat island effect for warm desert cities, although tradeoffs with other sustainability indicators must be considered.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The bag of visual words (BOW) model has attracted a great deal of attention in high-resolution remote sensing image classification. Related studies based on polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification are also still challenging. This paper presents a new method of PolSAR image classification based on the BOW model and supplemented by an affinity propagation clustering algorithm (AP), as well as a spatial pyramid matching (SPM) technique (AP_SPM_BOW). Its classification effect is analyzed compared to those of BOW models with other clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, meanshift, Gaussian mixture model), as well as the ML classification method by using two types of PolSAR images with different resolutions collected from EMISAR and RADARSAT-2 sensors. These results demonstrate that the proposed AP_SPM_BOW model is not only a stable and effective tool for PolSAR image classification but also more suitable for the analysis of high-resolution PolSAR images. In addition, the use of polarimetric information in BOW models can effectively improve the classification accuracy.

TI  - Response of vegetation phenology to urbanization in the conterminous United States
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of urbanization on vegetation phenology is gaining considerable attention due to its implications for human health, cycling of carbon and other nutrients in Earth system. In this study, we examined the relationship between change in vegetation phenology and urban size, an indicator of urbanization, for the conterminous United States. We studied more than 4500 urban clusters of varying size to determine the impact of urbanization on plant phenology, with the aids of remotely sensed observations since 2003-2012. We found that phenology cycle (changes in vegetation greenness) in urban areas starts earlier (start of season, SOS) and ends later (end of season, EOS), resulting in a longer growing season length (GSL), when compared to the respective surrounding urban areas. The average difference of GSL between urban and rural areas over all vegetation types, considered in this study, is about 9 days. Also, the extended GSL in urban area is consistent among different climate zones in the United States, whereas their magnitudes are varying across regions. We found that a tenfold increase in urban size could result in an earlier SOS of about 1.3 days and a later EOS of around 2.4 days. As a result, the GSL could be extended by approximately 3.6 days with a range of 1.6-6.5 days for 25th similar to 75th quantiles, with a median value of about 2.1 days. For different vegetation types, the phenology response to urbanization, as defined by GSL, ranges from 1 to 4 days. The quantitative relationship between phenology and urbanization is of great use for developing improved models of vegetation phenology dynamics under future urbanization, and for developing change indicators to assess the impacts of urbanization on vegetation phenology.

TI  - Detection and Monitoring of Oil Spills Using Moderate/High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current marine oil spill detection and monitoring methods using high-resolution remote sensing imagery are quite limited. This study presented a new bottom-up and top-down visual saliency model. We used Landsat 8, GF-1, MAMS, HJ-1 oil spill imagery as dataset. A simplified, graph-based visual saliency model was used to extract bottom-up saliency. It could identify the regions with high visual saliency object in the ocean. A spectral similarity match model was used to obtain top-down saliency. It could distinguish oil regions and exclude the other salient interference by spectrums. The regions of interest containing oil spills were integrated using these complementary saliency detection steps. Then, the genetic neural network was used to complete the image classification. These steps increased the speed of analysis. For the test dataset, the average running time of the entire process to detect regions of interest was 204.56 s. During image segmentation, the oil spill was extracted using a genetic neural network. The classification results showed that the method had a low false-alarm rate (high accuracy of 91.42%) and was able to increase the speed of the detection process (fast runtime of 19.88 s). The test image dataset was composed of different types of features over large areas in complicated imaging conditions. The proposed model was proved to be robust in complex sea conditions.

TI  - Landsat 15-m Panchromatic-Assisted Downscaling (LPAD) of the 30-m ReflectiveWavelength Bands to Sentinel-2 20-m Resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat 15-m Panchromatic-Assisted Downscaling (LPAD) method to downscale Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) 30-m data to Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI) 20-m resolution is presented. The method first downscales the Landsat-8 30-m OLI bands to 15-m using the spatial detail provided by the Landsat-8 15-m panchromatic band and then reprojects and resamples the downscaled 15-m data into registration with Sentinel-2A 20-m data. The LPAD method is demonstrated using pairs of contemporaneous Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI images sensed less than 19 min apart over diverse geographic environments. The LPAD method is shown to introduce less spectral and spatial distortion and to provide visually more coherent data than conventional bilinear and cubic convolution resampled 20-m Landsat OLI data. In addition, results for a pair of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A images sensed one day apart suggest that image fusion should be undertaken with caution when the images are acquired under different atmospheric conditions. The LPAD source code is available at GitHub for public use.

TI  - A spatial resolution effect analysis of remote sensing bathymetry
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A spatial resolution effect of remote sensing bathymetry is an important scientific problem. The in situ measured water depth data and images of Dongdao Island are used to study the effect of water depth inversion from different spatial resolution remote sensing images. The research experiments are divided into five groups including QuickBird and WorldView-2 remote sensing images with their original spatial resolution (2.4/2.0 m) and four kinds of reducing spatial resolution (4, 8, 16 and 32 m), and the water depth control and checking points are set up to carry out remote sensing water depth inversion. The experiment results indicate that the accuracy of the water depth remote sensing inversion increases first as the spatial resolution decreases from 2.4/2.0 to 4, 8 and 16 m. And then the accuracy decreases along with the decreasing spatial resolution. When the spatial resolution of the image is 16 m, the inversion error is minimum. In this case, when the spatial resolution of the remote sensing image is 16 m, the mean relative errors (MRE) of QuickBird and WorldView-2 bathymetry are 21.2% and 13.1%, compared with the maximum error are decreased by 14.7% and 2.9% respectively; the mean absolute errors (MAE) are 2.0 and 1.4 m, compared with the maximum are decreased by 1.0 and 0.5 m respectively. The results provide an important reference for the selection of remote sensing data in the study and application of the remote sensing bathymetry.

TI  - Grassland gross carbon dioxide uptake based on an improved model tree ensemble approach considering human interventions: global estimation and covariation with climate
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland ecosystems act as a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and provide vital ecosystem services for many species. However, these low-productivity and water-limited ecosystems are sensitive and vulnerable to climate perturbations and human intervention, the latter of which is often not considered due to lack of spatial information regarding the grassland management. Here by the application of a model tree ensemble (MTE-GRASS) trained on local eddy covariance data and using as predictors gridded climate and management intensity field (grazing and cutting), we first provide an estimate of global grassland gross primary production (GPP). GPP from our study compares well (modeling efficiency NSE = 0.85 spatial; NSE between 0.69 and 0.94 interannual) with that from flux measurement. Global grassland GPP was on average 11 +/- 0.31 Pg C yr(-1) and exhibited significantly increasing trend at both annual and seasonal scales, with an annual increase of 0.023 Pg C (0.2%) from 1982 to 2011. Meanwhile, we found that at both annual and seasonal scale, the trend (except for northern summer) and interannual variability of the GPP are primarily driven by arid/semiarid ecosystems, the latter of which is due to the larger variation in precipitation. Grasslands in arid/semiarid regions have a stronger (33 g C m(-2) yr(-1) /100 mm) and faster (0- to 1-month time lag) response to precipitation than those in other regions. Although globally spatial gradients (71%) and interannual changes (51%) in GPP were mainly driven by precipitation, where most regions with arid/semiarid climate zone, temperature and radiation together shared half of GPP variability, which is mainly distributed in the high-latitude or cold regions. Our findings and the results of other studies suggest the overwhelming importance of arid/semiarid regions as a control on grassland ecosystems carbon cycle. Similarly, under the projected future climate change, grassland ecosystems in these regions will be potentially greatly influenced.

TI  - Distribution characteristics of phytoplankton size structure in the western South China Sea in summer
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - Driven by the southwest monsoon, an offshore jet is usually formed in the western South China Sea (SCS) and sandwiched by a cyclonic eddy in the north and an anticyclonic eddy in the south, which affects the ecosystem of the region. Using in-situ and satellite data in September 2014, we analyzed the impact of this jet with two eddies on phytoplankton size structure in this region. The data showed that picophytoplankton (0.2 similar to 2 mu m) dominated the surface, averaged at 76.7% of the total chlorophyll. The contributions of nanophytoplankton (2 similar to 20 mu m) and microphytoplankton(20 similar to 200 mu m) in the jet area were respectively higher, and had a positive relationship with the total chlorophyll. Comparatively higher percentage of microphytoplankton appeared in the anticyclonic eddy at surface (average 10.3%) than in the cyclonic eddy (average 3.6%). The results suggested that physical processes significantly influenced summertime surface phytoplankton size structure in the western South China Sea. Both the jet and eddies can affect phytoplankton size structure by increasing the contribution of microphytoplankton. Surface horizontal advection of phytoplankton by the northeastward jet formed the coastal upwelling area and was the main source of microphytoplankton in the open sea. The interactions of convergence and divergence in the eddies with the jet formed a chlorophyll front and increased the microphytoplankton component. Upwelling in the center of the cyclonic eddy brought up nutrients, which increased the percentage of the microphytoplankton component.

TI  - Can Clinically Node-Negative Breast Cancer Patients with Suspicious Axillary Lymph Nodes at Ultrasound But Negative Fine-Needle Aspiration Be Approached as Having Node-Negative Disease?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Few data exist to elucidate whether patients with a suspicious axillary lymph node (ALN) at ultrasound but a negative fine-needle aspiration result (FNA group) can be managed as having ultrasound node-negative disease (AUN group). This study compared various ALN statuses between the AUN and FNA groups to guide further ALN management.Patients who had clinical T1-2N0 breast cancer treated with sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy were retrospectively analyzed. The ALN metastasis status, SLN status, and non-SLN metastasis rates in the entire population and the patients with one or two positive SLNs were compared between the AUN and FNA groups.A total of 1007 patients (886 AUN and 121 FNA patients) were eligible for the final analysis: The incidence of ALN metastasis did not differ between the AUN group (16.5%) and the FNA group (21.5%) (P = 0.170). In addition, three or more metastases were found in only 2.4% of the AUN patients and 3.3% of the FNA patients (P = 0.405). The non-SLN metastasis rate was 22.6% (33/146) in the AUN group and 19.2% (5/26) in the FNA group (P = 0.699). For the patients with one or two positive SLNs, the rate of non-SLN metastasis was similar between the AUN group (19.6%, 27/138) and the FNA group (12.5%, 3/24) (P = 0.591).Patients with a suspicious ALN at ultrasound but a negative FNA result had ALN statuses similar to those of the ultrasound node-negative patients, indicating that these patients can be treated as having ultrasound node-negative disease.

TI  - Accuracy comparison of remotely sensed evapotranspiration products and their associated water stress footprints under different land cover types in Korean peninsula
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust spatial information of evapotranspiration from multiple land cover types is deemed critical for several applications in agriculture and water balance studies. Energy balance models, used in association with satellite observations, are beneficial to map spatial variability of evapotranspiration which is mainly governed by different vegetation practices and local environmental conditions. This study utilize the Surface Energy Balance System model to estimate actual evapotranspiration and water scarcity footprints under complex landscape of Korean peninsula using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data for a complete hydrological year of 2012. The modeled evapotranspiration was compared with flux tower measurements obtained from a subhumid cropland and temperate forest sites for the accuracy assessment. This accuracy comparison at daily scale had good agreement yielding reasonable coefficient of determination (0.72, 0.51), bias (0.41 mm day(-1), 1.01 mm day(-1)) and root mean squared error (0.92 mm day(-1), 1.53 mm day(-1)) at two observation (cropland, forest) sites, respectively. Furthermore, the monthly aggregated evapotranspiration from Surface Energy Balance System showed promising results than those of obtained from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer based readymade global evapotranspiration product, i.e., MOD16, when both products were compared with unclosed and closed flux tower measurements. However, the variations in monthly evapotranspiration obtained from both products were significantly controlled by several climate factors and vegetation characteristics. Water stress mapping at regional and monthly scale also revealed strong contrast between the products of two approaches. Highest mean water stress (0.74) was observed for land use areas associated with evergreen forest and under sparsely vegetation condition by using estimated evapotranspiration from Surface Energy Balance System while an extreme mean water stress value of 0.56 by using end product of MOD16 evapotranspiration was raised from cropland regions. Overall, this study revealed the performance and suitability of two distinctive remote sensing approaches for characterizing the footprints of water fluxes in the Korean peninsula and provides a baseline for the policy makers to setup the sustainable use of existing water resources in this and other similar regions.

TI  - Development and validation of an ocean wave retrieval algorithm for VV-polarization Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose is to study the accuracy of ocean wave parameters retrieved from C-band VV-polarization Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, including both significant wave height (SWH) and mean wave period (MWP), which are both calculated from a SAR-derived wave spectrum. The wind direction from in situ buoys is used and then the wind speed is retrieved by using a new C-band geophysical model function (GMF) model, denoted as C-SARMOD. Continuously, an algorithm parameterized first-guess spectra method (PFSM) is employed to retrieve the SWH and the MWP by using the SAR-derived wind speed. Forty-five VV-polarization Sentinel-1 SAR images are collected, which cover the in situ buoys around US coastal waters. A total of 52 subscenes are selected from those images. The retrieval results are compared with the measurements from in situ buoys. The comparison performs good for a wind retrieval, showing a 1.6 m/s standard deviation (STD) of the wind speed, while a 0.54 m STD of the SWH and a 2.14 s STD of the MWP are exhibited with an acceptable error. Additional 50 images taken in China's seas were also implemented by using the algorithm PFSM, showing a 0.67 m STD of the SWH and a 2.21 s STD of the MWP compared with European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis grids wave data. The results indicate that the algorithm PFSM works for the wave retrieval from VV-polarization Sentinel-1 SAR image through SAR-derived wind speed by using the new GMF C-SARMOD.

TI  - Exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> associated with overall and domain-specific disability among adults in six low- and middle-income countries
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Exposure to particulate matter pollution is associated with various cardiopulmonary diseases, which are closely related with disability. The direct relationship between air pollution and disability, however, has not been fully explored.Methods: We used data from 45,625 participants in the Study on global AGEing and adult health in six low-and middle-income countries. The 12-item version of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) was used to measure the disability with six domains (cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities, and participation in society). Participants' community addresses were used to estimate annual concentration of PM2.5 using satellite data. We used linear mixed models to examine the effects of PM2.5 on overall and domain-specific WHODAS scores.Results: Exposure to PM2.5 was significantly associated with greater disability score (a higher score implies a greater disability); each 10 mu g/m(3) increase corresponded to 0.72 (95% CI: 0.22, 1.22) increase in overall disability score. Compared with low PM2.5 level (< 14.33 mu g/m(3)), moderate (14.33-27.83 mu g/m(3)) and high exposure levels (> 27.83 mu g/m(3)) were associated with 3.43 (95% CI: 1.43, 5.43) and 3.72 (95% CI: 1.59, 5.86) increase in disability scores. Among the six domains, cognition, mobility and getting along were found to be associated with PM2.5. Stratified analyses found that women and older subjects were more sensitive to this effect.Conclusion: Exposure to ambient PM2.5 might be one risk factor of disability in the low-and middle-income countries, women and older adults are the vulnerable population; and among the six domains, cognition, mobility and getting along are more relevant to this effect.

TI  - Completion lymph node dissection in patients with melanoma and positive sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - JAAPA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer that represents a significant disease burden, making diagnosis and appropriate control of disease vital for improving morbidity and mortality. The most recent guidelines for melanoma treatment advise performing a sentinel lymph node biopsy for intermediate thickness melanomas, with subsequent completion lymph node dissection (CLND) if sentinel nodes are positive. This guideline is controversial due to the limited availability of data on this topic. CLND is an extensive surgery with known risks and complications and a small survival benefit. However, in patients without significant comorbidities and at low risk for surgery, the survival benefit outweighs the procedural risk. This article reviews CLND and the current recommendations.

TI  - Implementation of Hysterectomy Pathway: Impact on Complications
T2  - WOMENS HEALTH ISSUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Hysterectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States. For women who need hysterectomy, it is important to ensure that minimally invasive hysterectomy procedures are used appropriately to reduce surgical complications and improve value of care. Although we previously demonstrated a reduction in total abdominal hysterectomy rates after the implementation of hysterectomy pathway treatment algorithm in 2012, this study focuses on exploring the effect of pathways implementation on surgical outcomes.Methods: All retrospective medical records for hysterectomy surgeries performed for benign indications at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center hospitals between the fiscal years (FY) 2012 and 2014 were identified. We analyzed the health care outcomes by route of surgery and year using X-2 test for categorical data, and non-parametric approaches for non-normal continuous variables.Results: A total of 6,569 hysterectomies for benign indications were performed between FY 2012 and 2014. In FY 2012, 1,154 patients (59.15%) had a length of stay of 1 day or less, whereas in FY 2014 this number increased to 1,791 (74.53%; p < .0001). Within 3 years of implementing the pathway, surgical site infections had a reduction of 47%, with a considerable trend toward significance (p = .067).Conclusions: Implementation of hysterectomy pathway has been associated with reduction of surgical complications in benign hysterectomy settings. Implementation of clinical pathways offers an opportunity for improving patient outcomes that should be investigated in various health care settings and across procedures.

TI  - A Coastline Detection Method in Polarimetric SAR Images Mixing the Region-Based and Edge-Based Active Contour Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a coastline detection method for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images based on region-based and edge-based active contour models. It can be used to detect coastline accurately and fast. In this method, the region-based and edge-based active contour models are effectively combined by an important property of the likelihood ratio edge detector in polarimetric SAR images, which is proved by theory. Using low-resolution image obtained by multilook processing, we detect accurate and continued coarse coastlines by a region-based level set method. The property of the likelihood ratio edge detector of polarimetric SAR images along the coastline region is then analyzed. The coarse detection result is finally refined using a fast snake active contour model based on the edge property. Polarimetric SAR data acquired by RADARSAT-2 over a Singapore region and TerraSAR-X over a Berkeley region are both used to test the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the coastline is fast and accurately detected in different initial scales. The proposed method greatly reduces the data processing time compared with the coastline detection method based on a single scale.

TI  - Wetland information extraction based on climate division and remote sensing technology in Daxing' an Mountains
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - As to the complexity of wetland remote sensing on high mountain wetlands, an object oriented hierarchical segmentation based on climate division was proposed in this study to extract information of high mountain wetlands. Time series of MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the data of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were deployed to extract wetlands on the basis of climate division, and the temporal-spatial changes and causes of wetlands in Daxing' an Mountains during 2001-2013 were quantitatively analyzed. The object-oriented method with characteristics of MODIS images showed better accuracy than maximum likelihood method and Logistic model with pixels in wetland extraction. The cartographic accuracy of Daxing' an Mountains reached 82% by the object-oriented method, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.74. The Daxing an Mountains wetland area was 414.89 hm(2) in 2001 and then decreased to 340.39 hm(2) in 2013. The area of wetlands increased and decreased differently in various regions. Increased wetland area mainly distributed in Tahe and Huma counties due to higher annual rainfall in 2013, while decreased wetland area mainly concentrated in Gannan and Longjiang counties due to conversion of wetlands into cultivated lands. This study provides technical support for information extraction of spatial and temporal dynamics of mountain wetlands.

TI  - Application of Sentinel 2 MSI Images to Retrieve Suspended Particulate Matter Concentrations in Poyang Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended particulate matter (SPM) is one of the dominant water constituents in inland and coastal waters, and SPM concnetration (CSPM) is a key parameter describing water quality. This study, using in-situ spectral and CSPM measurements as well as Sentinel 2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) images, aimed to develop CSPM retrieval models and further to estimate the CSPM values of Poyang Lake, China. Sixty-eight in-situ hyperspectral measurements and relative spectral response function were applied to simulate Sentinel 2 MIS spectra. Thirty-four samples were used to calibrate and the left samples were used to validate CSPM retrieval models, respectively. The developed models were then applied to two Sentinel 2 MSI images captured in wet and dry seasons, and the derived CSPM values were compared with those derived from MODIS B1 (lambda = 645 nm). Results showed that the Sentinel 2 MSI B4-B8b models achieved acceptable to high fitting accuracies, which explained 81-93% of the variation of CSPM. The validation results also showed the reliability of these six models, and the estimated CSPM explained 77-93% of the variation of measured CSPM with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranging from 36.87% to 21.54%. Among those, a model based on B7 (lambda = 783 nm) appeared to be the most accurate one. The Sentinel 2 MSI-derived CSPM values were generally consistent in spatial distribution and magnitude with those derived from MODIS. The CSPM derived from Sentinel 2 MSI B7 showed the highest consistency with MODIS on 15 August 2016, while the Sentinel 2 MSI B4 (lambda = 665 nm) produced the highest consistency with MODIS on 2 April 2017. Overall, this study demonstrated the applicability of Sentinel 2 MSI for CSPM retrieval in Poyang Lake, and the Sentinel 2 MSI B4 and B7 are recommended for low and high loadings of SPM, respectively.

TI  - Combined effects of climate and land management on watershed vegetation dynamics in an arid environment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key parameter to characterize vegetation dynamics and ecosystem structure that determines the ecosystem functions and services such as clean water supply and carbon sequestration in a watershed. However, linking LAI dynamics and environmental controls (i.e., coupling biosphere, atmosphere, and anthroposphere) remains challenging and such type of studies have rarely been done at a watershed scale due to data availability. The present study examined the spatial and temporal variations of LAI for five ecosystem types within a watershed with a complex topography in the Upper Heihe River Basin, a major inland river in the arid and semi-arid western China. We integrated remote sensing-based GLASS (Global Land Surface Satellite) LAI products, interpolated climate data, watershed characteristics, and land management records for the period of 2001-2012. We determined the relationships among LAI, topography, air temperature and precipitation, and grazing history by five ecosystem types using several advanced statistical methods. We show that long-term mean LAI distribution had an obvious vertical pattern as controlled by precipitation and temperature in a hilly watershed. Overall, watershed-wide mean LAI had an increasing trend overtime for all ecosystem types during 2001-2012, presumably as a result of global warming and a wetting climate. However, the fluctuations of observed LAI at a pixel scale (1 km) varied greatly across the watershed. We classified the vegetation changes within the watershed as 'Improved', 'Stabilized', and 'Degraded' according their respective LAI changes. We found that climate was not the only driver for temporal vegetation changes for all land cover types. Grazing partially contributed to the decline of LAI in some areas and masked the positive climate warming effects in other areas. Extreme weathers such as cold spells and droughts could substantially affect inter-annual variability of LAI dynamics. We concluded that temporal and spatial LAI dynamics were rather complex and were affected by both climate variations and human disturbances in the study basin. Future monitoring studies should focus on the functional interactions among vegetation dynamics, climate variations, land management, and human disturbances. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Influence of previous breast surgery in sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with breast cancer
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to review the feasibility of selective sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with previous surgery for breast cancer, as well as to examine the factors that may interfere with sentinel node detection.Material and methods: A retrospective review was performed on 91 patients with breast cancer and previous breast surgery, and who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy. Patients were divided into two groups according to their previous treatment: aesthetic breast surgery in 30 patients (group I) and breast-conserving surgery in 61 (group II). Lymphoscintigraphy was performed after an intra-tumour injection in 21 cases and a peri-areolar injection in 70 cases. An analysis was made of lymphatic drainage patterns and overall sentinel node detection according to clinical, pathological and surgical variables.Results: The overall detection of the sentinel lymph node in the lymphoscintigraphy was 92.3%, with 7.7% of extra-axillary drainages. The identification rate was similar after aesthetic breast surgery (93.3%) and breast-conserving surgery (91.8%). Sentinel lymph nodes were found in the contralateral axilla in two patients (2.2%), and they were included in the histopathology study. The non-identification rate in the lymphoscintigraphy was 7.7%. There was a significantly higher non-detection rate in the highest histological grade tumours (28.6% grade III, 4.5% grade I and 3.6% grade II).Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with previous breast surgery is feasible and deserves further studies to assess the influence of different aspects in sentinel node detection in this clinical scenario. A high histological grade was significantly associated with a lower detection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. y SEMNIM. All rights reserved.

TI  - Combining multi-source data to explore a mechanism for the effects of micrometeorological elements on nutrient variations in paddy land water
T2  - PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy land plays a key role in global crop production. Thus, paddy land water is a potential source of nitrogen and phosphorus; both nutrients largely contribute to non-point source pollution because they usually vary closely with micrometeorological elements (MEs) during the growth period. However, few studies have focused on the mechanism of co-variation between nutrients and MEs at the field scale. The relationships between nutrients in the paddy land water and MEs as well as soil water content, soil temperature, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are still unclear. In this paper, an in situ experiment was designed to obtain 5 years of meteorological data and nutrient data (nitrogen and phosphorus); the size of the experiment plot is in accordance with the spatial resolution of NDVI data. Multi-source meteorological and satellite data were integrated to explore the mechanism of co-variation. The results show that precipitation, air temperature, and solar radiation are the three MEs significantly affecting the nitrogen concentration in the paddy land water during the growth period. The air temperature is the most important ME influencing the phosphorus concentration. At the same time, the NDVI, as an effective indicator of the photosynthetic potential of rice used to explore the relationship between nutrients, has a prominent influence on soluble nutrients, especially on dissolved phosphorus. These findings could significantly improve our understanding about the responses of paddy land nutrients during the growth period to the surrounding drivers, inclusive of MEs, soil water, soil temperature, and NDVI. Undoubtedly, it is a potentially helpful means to monitor the sources of non-point pollution.

TI  - A Synergy Cropland of China by Fusing Multiple Existing Maps and Statistics
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on cropland extent is critical for scientific research and resource management. Several cropland products from remotely sensed datasets are available. Nevertheless, significant inconsistency exists among these products and the cropland areas estimated from these products differ considerably from statistics. In this study, we propose a hierarchical optimization synergy approach (HOSA) to develop a hybrid cropland map of China, circa 2010, by fusing five existing cropland products, i.e., GlobeLand30, Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI-LC), GlobCover 2009, MODIS Collection 5 (MODIS C5), and MODIS Cropland, and sub-national statistics of cropland area. HOSA simplifies the widely used method of score assignment into two steps, including determination of optimal agreement level and identification of the best product combination. The accuracy assessment indicates that the synergy map has higher accuracy of spatial locations and better consistency with statistics than the five existing datasets individually. This suggests that the synergy approach can improve the accuracy of cropland mapping and enhance consistency with statistics.

TI  - Source model for the Copahue volcano magma plumbing system constrained by InSAR surface deformation observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Copahue volcano straddling the edge of the Agrio-Caviahue caldera along the Chile-Argentina border in the southern Andes has been in unrest since inflation began in late 2011. We constrain Copahue's source models with satellite and airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) deformation observations. InSAR time series from descending track RADARSAT-2 and COSMO-SkyMed data span the entire inflation period from 2011 to 2016, with their initially high rates of 12 and 15 cm/yr, respectively, slowing only slightly despite ongoing small eruptions through 2016. InSAR ascending and descending track time series for the 2013-2016 time period constrain a two-source compound dislocation model, with a rate of volume increase of 13 x 10(6) m(3)/yr. They consist of a shallow, near-vertical, elongated source centered at 2.5 km beneath the summit and a deeper, shallowly plunging source centered at 7 km depth connecting the shallow source to the deeper caldera. The deeper source is located directly beneath the volcano tectonic seismicity with the lower bounds of the seismicity parallel to the plunge of the deep source. InSAR time series also show normal fault offsets on the NE flank Copahue faults. Coulomb stress change calculations for right-lateral strike slip (RLSS), thrust, and normal receiver faults show positive values in the north caldera for both RLSS and normal faults, suggesting that northward trending seismicity and Copahue fault motion within the caldera are caused by the modeled sources. Together, the InSAR-constrained source model and the seismicity suggest a deep conduit or transfer zone where magma moves from the central caldera to Copahue's upper edifice.Plain Language Summary Copahue volcano straddling the edge of the Agrio-Caviahue caldera along the Chile-Argentina border in the southern Andes has been in unrest since inflation began in late 2011. Its asymmetric deformation pattern extending into the caldera observed by radar interferometry suggests a complex magma plumbing system. We constrain models of its plumbing system with satellite and airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) surface displacement observations. Displacement time series from RADARSAT-2 and COSMO-SkyMed satellite data span the entire inflation period from 2011 to 2016, with their initially high rates of 12 and 15 cm/yr, respectively, slowing only slightly through 2016. InSAR observations for the 2013-2016 time period constrain a two-source compound dislocation model, with a rate of volume increase of 13 x 10(6) m(3)/yr. They consist of a shallow, near-vertical, elongated source centered at 2.5 km beneath the summit, and a deeper, shallowly plunging source centered at 7 kmdepth connecting the shallow source to the deeper caldera. The deeper source is located directly beneath the volcano tectonic seismicity with the lower bounds of the seismicity parallel to the plunge of the deep source. This suggests adeep conduit or transfer zone where magma moves from the central caldera to Copahue's upper edifice.

TI  - Monitoring of Subsidence along Jingjin Inter-City Railway with High-Resolution TerraSAR-X MT-InSAR Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR), widely applied for the monitoring of land subsidence, has the advantage of high accuracy and wide coverage. High-resolution SAR data offers a chance to reveal impressive details of large-scale man-made linear features (LMLFs) with Multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) analysis. Despite these advantages, research validating high-resolution MT-InSAR results along high-speed railways with high spatial and temporal density leveling data is limited. This paper explored the monitoring ability of high-resolution MT-InSAR in an experiment along Jingjin Inter-City Railway, located in Tianjin, China. Validation between these MT-InSAR results and a high spatial/temporal density leveling measurement was conducted. A total of 37 TSX images spanning half a year were processed for MT-InSAR analysis. The distance between two consecutive leveling points is 60 m along Jingjin Inter-City railway and the time interval of the study was about one month. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) index of average subsidence rate comparison between MT-InSAR results and leveling data was 3.28 mm/yr, with 34 points, and that of the displacement comparison was 2.90 mm with 464 valid observations. The experimental results along Jingjin Inter-City railway showed a high correlation between these two distinct measurements. These analyses show that millimeter accuracy can be achieved with MT-InSAR analysis when monitoring subsidence along a high-speed railway. We discuss the possible reason for the subsiding center, and the characteristics of both leveling and MT-InSAR results. We propose further planning for the monitoring of subsidence over LMLFs.

TI  - The Sentinel Node with Isolated Breast Tumor Cells or Micrometastases. Benefits and Risks of Axillary Dissection
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has become the standard procedure to identify metastases in axillary nodes in breast cancer. Even after careful SLN examination additional micrometastases and isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are sometimes found, resulting in a need for delayed axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). This study was undertaken to assess prognostic factors identifying additional axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases at delayed ALND. Patients and Methods: To define the impact of late ALND regarding their outcome, 162 breast cancer patients with 169 operated breasts treated between 2010 and 2012 were evaluated, with follow-up through 2016. Data were collected on the patients, histology and biologic profile of the cancer, lymph node involvement, recurrence of breast cancer and adverse effects of ALND. Results: With thorough examination and immunohistochemical stainings twenty-nine of 168 SLN biopsies (28 patients, 17% of the patients) showed micrometastases or ITC, and a full ALND was performed at a later time. During these ALNDs 13 to 31 lymph nodes were removed. Additional ALN metastases were found in three (10%) patients. Two (7%) of the 28 patients with triple-negative cancer deceased of metastatic breast cancer. Three patients (11%) reported adverse effects of ALND requiring physiotherapy due to pain, stiffness, swelling or arm oedema. Tumor factors such as molecular subtype (p=0.002), tumor size (p=0.004), and proliferation index (Ki-67) (p=0.003) correlated with higher numbers of ALN metastases. Conclusion: Since most patients with micrometastases found in the primary operation showed no additional positive lymph nodes, completion ALND may not be required in patients with micrometastases or ITCs in the SLN. In our study, the predictive factors for additional ALN metastases were tumur size, molecular subtype and proliferation index. It is conceivable that the features of the primary tumor, rather than the amount of cancer cells in the SLN, might serve to identify patients in whom ALDN can be avoided.

TI  - Evaluating pixel and object based image classification techniques for mapping plant invasions from UAV derived aerial imagery: <i>Harrisia pomanensis</i> as a case study
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive alien plants (IAPs) not only pose a serious threat to biodiversity and water resources but also have impacts on human and animal wellbeing. To support decision making in IAPs monitoring, semi automated image classifiers which are capable. of extracting valuable information in remotely sensed data are vital. This study evaluated the mapping accuracies of supervised and unsupervised image classifiers for mapping Harrisia pomanensis (a cactus plant commonly known as the Midnight Lady) using two interlinked evaluation strategies i.e. point and area based accuracy assessment. Results of the point-based accuracy assessment show that with reference to 219 ground control points, the supervised image classifiers (i.e. Maxver and Bhattacharya) mapped H. pomanensis better than the unsupervised image classifiers (i.e. K-mediuns, Euclidian Length and Isoseg). In this regard, user and producer accuracies were 82.4% and 84% respectively for the Maxver classifier. The user and producer accuracies for the Bhattacharya classifier were 90% and 95.7%, respectively. Though the Maxver produced a higher overall accuracy and Kappa estimate than the Bhattacharya classifier, the Maxver Kappa estimate of 0.8305 is not significantly (statistically) greater than the Bhattacharya Kappa estimate of 0.8088 at a 95% confidence interval. The area based accuracy assessment results show that the Bhattacharya classifier estimated the spatial extent of H. pomanensis with an average mapping accuracy of 86.1% whereas the Maxver classifier only gave an average mapping accuracy of 65.2%. Based on these results, the Bhattacharya classifier is therefore recommended for mapping H. pomanensis. These findings will aid in the algorithm choice making for the development of a semi-automated image classification system for mapping IAPs.

TI  - Adding tsetse control to medical activities contributes to decreasing transmission of sleeping sickness in the Mandoul focus (Chad)
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundGambian sleeping sickness or HAT (human African trypanosomiasis) is a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense transmitted by riverine species of tsetse. A global programme aims to eliminate the disease as a public health problem by 2020 and stop transmission by 2030. In the South of Chad, the Mandoul area is a persistent focus of Gambian sleeping sickness where around 100 HAT cases were still diagnosed and treated annually until 2013. Pre-2014, control of HAT relied solely on case detection and treatment, which lead to a gradual decrease in the number of cases of HAT due to annual screening of the population.MethodsBecause of the persistence of transmission and detection of new cases, we assessed whether the addition of vector control to case detection and treatment could further reduce transmission and consequently, reduce annual incidence of HAT in Mandoul. In particular, we investigated the impact of deploying 'tiny targets' which attract and kill tsetse. Before tsetse control commenced, a census of the human population was conducted and their settlements mapped. A pre-intervention survey of tsetse distribution and abundance was implemented in November 2013 and 2600 targets were deployed in the riverine habitats of tsetse in early 2014, 2015 and 2016. Impact on tsetse and on the incidence of sleeping sickness was assessed through nine tsetse monitoring surveys and four medical surveys of the human population in 2014 and 2015. Mathematical modelling was used to assess the relative impact of tsetse control on incidence compared to active and passive screening.FindingsThe census indicated that a population of 38674 inhabitants lived in the vicinity of the Man-doul focus. Within this focus in November 2013, the vector is Glossina fuscipes fuscipes and the mean catch of tsetse from traps was 0.7 flies/trap/day (range, 0-26). The catch of tsetse from 44 sentinel biconical traps declined after target deployment with only five tsetse being caught in nine surveys giving a mean catch of 0.005 tsetse/trap/day. Modelling indicates that 70.4% (95% CI: 51-95%) of the reduction in reported cases between 2013 and 2015 can be attributed to vector control with the rest due to medical intervention. Similarly tiny targets are estimated to have reduced new infections dramatically with 62.8% (95% CI: 59-66%) of the reduction due to tsetse control, and 8.5% (95% 8-9%) to enhanced passive detection. Model predictions anticipate that elimination as a public health problem could be achieved by 2018 in this focus if vector control and screening continue at the present level and, furthermore, there may have been virtually no transmission since 2015.ConclusionThis work shows that tiny targets reduced the numbers of tsetse in this focus in Chad, which may have interrupted transmission and the combination of tsetse control to medical detection and treatment has played a major role in reducing in HAT incidence in 2014 and 2015.

CL  - Palermo, ITALY
AB  - This work was designed to evaluate the biological effects of petrochemical contamination on marine mussels. Mytilus galloprovincialis, widely used as sentinel organisms in biomonitoring studies, were caged at the "Augusta-Melilli-Priolo" industrial site (eastern Sicily, Italy), chosen as one of the largest petrochemical areas in Europe, and Brucoli, chosen as reference site. Chemical analyses of sediments at the polluted site revealed high levels of PAHs and mercury, exceeding the national and international guideline limits. In mussels from the polluted site, severe morphological alterations were observed in gills, mainly involved in nutrient uptake and gas exchange. Changes in serotonergic and cholinergic systems, investigated through immunohistochemical, metabolomics and enzymatic approaches, were highlighted in gills, as well as onset of hypoxic adaptive responses with up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor transcript. Overall, the application of a multi-biomarker panel results effective in assessing the biological effects of petrochemical contamination on the health of aquatic organisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing, a powerful tool for analyzing landscape factors, is being used to explore the spatial ecology of vectors of several diseases. This study aims to explore the role of buffer size in identification and quantification of geo-environmental factors from multispatial resolution satellite data and its application along with microcli-matic data to kala-azar vector abundance modeling.Sand fly abundance and microclimatic data were collected from 210 sample sites during the premonsoon and postmonsoon season of 2014 from Muzaffarpur district of Bihar (India). Linear imaging self-scanning sensor (LISS-III; 23.5 m) and advanced wide field sensor (AWiFS; 56 m) imageries were used for generating environmental variables at 300-and 500-m buffer zones. Four analytical models of sand fly density were developed and evaluated for predictive accuracy.A total of 33 geo-environmental and four microclimatic variables were tested for the prediction of sand fly density, of which the best four were maximum temperature, relative humidity, Euclidean nearest-neighbor distance of settlement area to mixed bush-grass land, and surface water body. Predictive accuracy of the LISS-III models was found to be higher than AWiFS models at all buffer sizes.The results show that geo-environmental parameters and microclimatic data are the best predictors for sand fly density modeling. Buffer sizes play an important role in identifying the explanatory variables. Model parameters may be useful in identifying predisposing factors of sand fly habitat suitability at the micro level.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE IN SPORT
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: There are little data on the potential benefits and adverse events of statins among physically fit individuals. Our objective was to examine the associations of statin use with beneficial cardiovascular outcomes and adverse events in active duty military (a surrogate for high level of physical fitness).Design: This is a retrospective propensity score-matched cohort study of healthy active duty military (fiscal years [FY] 2002-2011).Methods: Statin-users received statins during FY 2005 as their only prescription medication. FY 2002-2004 was used to describe baseline characteristics; and FY 2006-2011 were used to capture outcomes. Study outcomes included major acute cardiovascular events (MACE), diabetes mellitus and its complications, kidney diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, obesity, and malignancy.Results: We propensity score matched 837 statin-users to 2488 nonusers. During follow-up, 1.6% statin-users and 1.5% nonusers were diagnosed with MACE (odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-1.98), 12.5% of statin-users and 5.8% of nonusers were diagnosed with diabetes (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.79-3.04), and 1.7% statin- users and 0.7% nonusers were diagnosed with diabetes with complication (OR 2.47, 95% Cl 1.21-5.04). There were no differences in rates of other adverse events.Conclusions: Among healthy physically active individuals, statin use was associated with doubled the odds of diabetes and diabetic complications without countervailing cardiovascular benefits.

TI  - Issues and Possible Improvements in Winter Fires Detection by Satellite Radiances Analysis: Lesson Learned in Two Regions of Northern Italy
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lombardy is a region of Northern Italy characterized by an alpine/continental climate, where, in winter, strong dry winds and scarce plants hydration frequently cause surface fires with a relatively low intensity level. In Liguria, a coastal region of Northwestern Italy, climate and vegetation conditions are different from Lombardy; in both winter and summer, severe forest fires frequently occur. This study is based on the investigation of winter fire regimes characterizing the aforementioned regions, using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. In particular, we compare the RST-FIRES and the well-established MOD14/MYD14 fire detection products in order to assess their performance in detecting winter fires in Northern Italy. The study shows as a result that, despite the advantages offered by self-adaptive algorithms like RST-FIRES at local/regional scale, wildfires occurring in Lombardy during the winter season are challenging to identify by satellite. In Liguria region, where morphological and weather conditions favor flame propagation, they seem to be better detectable from space. This study aims at investigating issues affecting satellite monitoring of winter fires by encouraging the usage of a multiplatform observing system, integrating data provided by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) aboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites, for better supporting fire management activities.

TI  - Accuracy of pre-operative hysteroscopic guided biopsy for predicting final pathology in uterine malignancies
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate concordance (C) between pre-operative hysteroscopic-directed sampling and final pathology in uterine cancers.A retrospective cross-sectional evaluation of prospectively collected data of women who underwent hysterectomy for uterine malignancies and a previous hysteroscopic-guided biopsy was performed. Diagnostic concordance between pre-operative (hysteroscopic biopsy) and postoperative (uterine specimen) histology was evaluated. In endometrioid-endometrial cancers cases Kappa (k) statistics was applied to evaluate agreement for grading (G) between the preoperative and final pathology.A total 101 hysterectomies for uterine malignancies were evaluated. There were 23 non-endometrioid cancers: 7 serous (C:5/7, 71.4%); 10 carcinosarcomas (C:7/10, 70%, remaining 3 cases only epithelial component diagnosed); 3 clear cell (C:3/3, 100%); 3 sarcomas (C:3/3, 100%). In 78 cases an endometrioid endometrial cancer was found. In 63 cases there was a histological C (63/78, 80.8%) between hysteroscopic-guided biopsy and final pathology, while in 15 cases (19.2%) only hyperplasia (with/without atypia) was found preoperatively. Overall accuracy to detect endometrial cancer was 80.2%. In 50 out of 63 endometrial cancers (79.4%) grading was concordant. The overall level of agreement between preoperative and postoperative grading was "substantial" according to Kappa (k) statistics (k 0.64; 95% CI: 0.449-0.83; p < 0.001), as well as for G1 (0.679; 95% CI: 0.432-0.926; p < 0.001) and G3 (0.774; 94% CI: 0.534-1; p < 0.001), while for G2 (0.531; 95% CI: 0.286-0.777; p < 0.001) it was moderate.In our series we found an 80% C between pre-operative hysteroscopic-guided biopsy and final pathology, in uterine malignancies. Moreover, hysteroscopic biopsy accurately predicted endometrial cancer in 80% of cases and "substantially" predicted histological grading. Hysteroscopic-guided uterine sampling could be a useful tool to tailor treatment in patients with uterine malignancies.

TI  - The Effect of the Relativistic Transformation Law of Angles on Laser Ranging of Satellites Moving in Circular Orbits Equipped with a Single Retroreflector
T2  - MOSCOW UNIVERSITY PHYSICS BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - It is shown that due to the relativistic transformation law of angles, a laser pulse reflected from a moving retroreflector propagates not strictly back, but at a small angle to the direction of the laser station. For this reason, the ray located on the periphery of a pulse reaches the receiving telescope of the laser station instead of the central ray of a pulse. As a result, the flux of electromagnetic energy received by the laser station is certainly less than the flux of energy in the vicinity of the central ray. The energy flux attenuation coefficient is assessed on the basis of numerical analysis. It is shown that if the receiving telescope is separated from the laser station in order to be mobile and is moving along the Earth's surface so that the center of each spot formed by a pulse of the reflected light hits the telescope, then the electromagnetic energy flux during laser probing of the satellite will be higher by more than 100 times in comparison with the energy flux received by the stationary telescope of the laser station. From our study it follows that the maximum speed of motion of the centers of spots on the Earth's surface does not exceed 8 km/h.

TI  - An Evidence Synthesis Approach to Estimating the Proportion of Influenza Among Influenza-like Illness Patients
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Estimation of the national-level incidence of seasonal influenza is notoriously challenging. Surveillance of influenza-like illness is carried out in many countries using a variety of data sources, and several methods have been developed to estimate influenza incidence. Our aim was to obtain maximally informed estimates of the proportion of influenza-like illness that is true influenza using all available data.Methods: We combined data on weekly general practice sentinel surveillance consultation rates for influenza-like illness, virologic testing of sampled patients with influenza-like illness, and positive laboratory tests for influenza and other pathogens, applying Bayesian evidence synthesis to estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) of influenza-like illness as a test for influenza virus infection. We estimated the weekly number of influenza-like illness consultations attributable to influenza for nine influenza seasons, and for four age groups.Results: The estimated PPV for influenza in influenza-like illness patients was highest in the weeks surrounding seasonal peaks in influenza-like illness rates, dropping to near zero in between-peak periods. Overall, 14.1% (95% credible interval [CrI]: 13.5%, 14.8%) of influenza-like illness consultations were attributed to influenza infection; the estimated PPV was 50% (95% CrI: 48%, 53%) for the peak weeks and 5.8% during the summer periods.Conclusions: The model quantifies the correspondence between influenza-like illness consultations and influenza at a weekly granularity. Even during peak periods, a substantial proportion of influenza-like illness-61%-was not attributed to influenza. The much lower proportion of influenza outside the peak periods reflects the greater circulation of other respiratory pathogens relative to influenza.

TI  - PROCESS-BASED MODELLING OF THE IMPACTS OF LAND USE CHANGE ON THE WATER BALANCE IN THE CERRADO BIOME (RIO DAS MORTES, BRAZIL)
T2  - ERDKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1980s, the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, exhibits high rates of Cerrado conversion in favour of soybean expansion and cattle ranching. This conversion process becomes obvious in the upper Rio das Mortes macro-catchment. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of future land use changes on the discharge dynamics of the Rio das Mortes River. A single catchment approach was applied with the physically-based water balance simulation model WaSiM 8.5.0 (Schulla and Jaspeper 2007) to simulate land use scenarios. In Scenario 1, only small pasture sites (< 1 km(2)) were converted into the respective land use type surrounding them (i.e. cropland or Cerrado vegetation), whereas in Scenario 2 all pasture sites were converted into cropland and all Cerrado patches were then transformed into pastures. The WaSiM model was calibrated and validated based on discharge data measured at two gauging stations, achieving Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of 0.81 (calibration) and 0.68 (validation). Main problems in modelling arise because of scarce spatial distributed data on subsurface parameter and vegetation parameter (Cerrado biome). Therefore, the use of the numerical groundwater model and manifold calibration runs were essential in this modelling approach to allow the simulation of the high levels of baseflow during the dry season and the transition from the dry to the wet season. The immediate rise of the baseflow in response to the increasing precipitation at beginning of the rainy season is a result of high soil hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recharge. These soil characteristics apparently persist on newly-created pasture and cropland sites, which still exhibit high ksat values after deforestation. Simulated evapotranspiration is comparable to literature values (Eddy flux measurements, MODIS-EVI calculation) and recently done paired micro-catchment studies in this catchment. The scenario analysis indicates that there are only small differences in runoff volume, which is directly related to the precipitation changes. In the scenario 2, groundwater recharge and base flow increase, whereas surface runoff does not. Therefore, the ongoing land use intensification with pasture conversion to cropland, remaining high infiltration and slight increase of evapotranspiration may not change runoff volume and discharge characteristics.

TI  - Assessing the performance of aerial image point cloud and spectral metrics in predicting boreal forest canopy cover
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy cover (CC) is a variable used to describe the status of forests and forested habitats, but also the variable used primarily to define what counts as a forest. The estimation of CC has relied heavily on remote sensing with past studies focusing on satellite imagery as well as Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) using light detection and ranging (lidar). Of these, ALS has been proven highly accurate, because the fraction of pulses penetrating the canopy represents a direct measurement of canopy gap percentage. However, the methods of photogrammetry can be applied to produce point clouds fairly similar to airborne lidar data from aerial images. Currently there is little information about how well such point clouds measure canopy density and gaps.The aim of this study was to assess the suitability of aerial image point clouds for CC estimation and compare the results with those obtained using spectral data from aerial images and Landsat 5. First, we modeled CC for n=1149 lidar plots using field-measured CCs and lidar data. Next, this data was split into five subsets in north-south direction (y-coordinate). Finally, four CC models (AerialSpectral, AerialPointcloud, AerialCombi (spectral + pointcloud) and Landsat) were created and they were used to predict new CC values to the lidar plots, subset by subset, using five-fold cross validation.The Landsat and AerialSpectral models performed with RMSEs of 13.8% and 12.4%, respectively. AerialPointcloud model reached an RMSE of 10.3%, which was further improved by the inclusion of spectral data; RMSE of the AerialCombi model was 9.3%. We noticed that the aerial image point clouds managed to describe only the outermost layer of the canopy and missed the details in lower canopy, which was resulted in weak characterization of the total CC variation, especially in the tails of the data.

TI  - Remote sensing monitoring of land restoration interventions in semi-arid environments with a before-after control-impact statistical design
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration interventions to combat land degradation are carried out in arid and semi-arid areas to improve vegetation cover and land productivity. Evaluating the success of an intervention over time is challenging due to various constraints (e.g. difficult-to-access areas, lack of long-term records) and the lack of standardised and affordable methodologies. We propose a semi-automatic methodology that uses remote sensing data to provide a rapid, standardised and objective assessment of the biophysical impact, in terms of vegetation cover, of restoration interventions. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used as a proxy for vegetation cover. Recognising that changes in vegetation cover are naturally due to environmental factors such as seasonality and inter-annual climate variability, conclusions about the success of the intervention cannot be drawn by focussing on the intervention area only. We therefore use a comparative method that analyses the temporal variations (before and after the intervention) of the NDVI of the intervention area with respect to multiple control sites that are automatically and randomly selected from a set of candidates that are similar to the intervention area. Similarity is defined in terms of class composition as derived from an ISODATA classification of the imagery before the intervention. The method provides an estimate of the magnitude and significance of the difference in greenness change between the intervention area and control areas. As a case study, the methodology is applied to 15 restoration interventions carried out in Senegal. The impact of the interventions is analysed using 250-m MODIS and 30-m Landsat data. Results show that a significant improvement in vegetation cover was detectable only in one third of the analysed interventions, which is consistent with independent qualitative assessments based on field observations and visual analysis of high resolution imagery. Rural development agencies may potentially use the proposed method for a first screening of restoration interventions. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective. To evaluate the therapeutic results and control of occult neck metastasis in patients with T2-4N0 oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma treated with retrograde superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy and daily concurrent radiotherapy.Study Design. Forty-two patients with T2-4N0 tongue cancer (17 with late T2; 13 with T3; and 12 with T4a disease, M0) were treated with intra-arterial chemoradiotherapy. Treatment consisted of retrograde superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy (docetaxel 50-70 mg/m(2), cisplatin 125-175 mg/m(2)) and daily concurrent radiotherapy (50-70 Gy) for 5-7 weeks.Results. The median follow-up for all patients was 46.5 months (range, 8-105 months). Primary-site complete response was achieved in 42 of 42 cases (100%). Three-year overall survival, progression-free survival, and local control rates were 85.0%, 77.8%, and 91.7%, respectively. Delayed neck metastasis was detected in 5 of 42 cases (11.9%). Grade 3 or 4 toxic changes included oral mucositis in 92.9%, neutropenia in 21.4%, and thrombocytopenia in 4.8%. Grade 3 toxicities included anemia in 16.7%, radiation dermatitis in 9.5%, nausea in 4.8%, and fever in 2.4%.Conclusions. Retrograde superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy for T2-4N0 tongue cancer provided good overall survival and local control rates and was effective for occult neck metastasis.

TI  - An improved fast level set method initialized with a combination of k-means clustering and Otsu thresholding for unsupervised change detection from SAR images
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of changes in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is an important challenge due to the effects of speckle noise on these images. In recent years, appropriate methods for SAR-based-change detection have been developed based on the level set methods (LSM). These methods need to set parameters for defining a proper initial contour. Moreover, the gradient information is only employed in the total energy of these methods for segmentation of the difference image. In this study, a novel method has been proposed for unsupervised change detection of multitemporal SAR images based on the improved fast level set method (IFLSM) initialized with a combination of k-means and Otsu techniques. The proposed method utilizes the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) fusion strategy and edge enhancement to achieve a noise-resistant difference image from the mean-ratio and log-ratio images. Afterward, the generated binary change map (CM) by applying a combination of k-means and Otsu techniques on the difference image is used as the initial contour to achieve a final CM on difference image using the IFLSM. To check advantages of the proposed method, experiments are applied on two sets of multitemporal SAR images corresponding to artificial Chitgar Lake (under reconstruction) in Tehran (Iran) taken by TerraSAR-X satellite in 2011 and 2012, and corresponding to San Pablo and Briones reservoirs in California (USA) acquired by ERS-2 satellite in 2003 and 2004. Results of proposed method were compared with results of some well-known unsupervised change detection methods. Experimental results prove the sufficiency of the proposed method in unsupervised change detection in terms of accuracy, implementation time, and computational complexity.

TI  - Optical See-Through Cancer Vision Goggles Enable Direct Patient Visualization and Real-Time Fluorescence-Guided Oncologic Surgery
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The inability to visualize the patient and surgical site directly, limits the use of current near infrared fluorescence-guided surgery systems for real-time sentinel lymph node biopsy and tumor margin assessment.We evaluated an optical see-through goggle augmented imaging and navigation system (GAINS) for near-infrared, fluorescence-guided surgery. Tumor-bearing mice injected with a near infrared cancer-targeting agent underwent fluorescence-guided, tumor resection. Female Yorkshire pigs received hind leg intradermal indocyanine green injection and underwent fluorescence-guided, popliteal lymph node resection. Four breast cancer patients received Tc-99m-sulfur colloid and indocyanine green retroareolarly before undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy using radioactive tracking and fluorescence imaging. Three other breast cancer patients received indocyanine green retroareolarly before undergoing standard-of-care partial mastectomy, followed by fluorescence imaging of resected tumor and tumor cavity for margin assessment.Using near-infrared fluorescence from the dyes, the optical see-through GAINS accurately identified all mouse tumors, pig lymphatics, and four pig popliteal lymph nodes with high signal-to-background ratio. In 4 human breast cancer patients, 11 sentinel lymph nodes were identified with a detection sensitivity of 86.67 +/- 0.27% for radioactive tracking and 100% for GAINS. Tumor margin status was accurately predicted by GAINS in all three patients, including clear margins in patients 1 and 2 and positive margins in patient 3 as confirmed by paraffin-embedded section histopathology.The optical see-through GAINS prototype enhances near infrared fluorescence-guided surgery for sentinel lymph node biopsy and tumor margin assessment in breast cancer patients without disrupting the surgical workflow in the operating room.

TI  - The use of sun elevation angle for stereogrammetric boreal forest height in open canopies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Stereogrammetry applied to globally available high resolution spaceborne imagery (HRSI; <5 m spatial resolution) yields fine-scaled digital surface models (DSMs) of elevation. These DSMs may represent elevations that range from the ground to the vegetation canopy surface, are produced from stereoscopic image pairs (stereopairs) that have a variety of acquisition characteristics, and have been coupled with lidar data of forest structure and ground surface elevation to examine forest height. This work explores surface elevations from HRSI DSMs derived from two types of acquisitions in open canopy forests. We(1) apply an automated mass-production stereogrammetry workflow to along-track HRSI stereopairs, (2) identify multiple spatially coincident DSMs whose stereopairs were acquired under different solar geometry, (3) vertically co-register these DSMs using coincident spaceborne lidar footprints (from ICESat-GLAS) as reference, and (4) examine differences in surface elevations between the reference lidar and the co-registered HRSI DSMs associated with two general types of acquisitions (DSM types) from different sun elevation angles. We find that these DSM types, distinguished by sun elevation angle at the time of stereopair acquisition, are associated with different surface elevations estimated from automated stereogrammetry in open canopy forests. For DSM values with corresponding reference ground surface elevation from spaceborne lidar footprints in open canopy northern Siberian Larix forests with slopes <10 degrees, our results show that HRSI DSMs acquired with sun elevation angles >35 degrees and <25 degrees (during snow-free conditions) produced characteristic and consistently distinct distributions of elevation differences from reference lidar. The former include DSMs of near-ground surfaces with root mean square errors <0.68 m relative to lidar. The latter, particularly those with angles <10 degrees, show distributions with larger differences from lidar that are associated with open canopy forests whose vegetation surface elevations are captured. Terrain aspect did not have a strong effect on the distribution of vegetation surfaces. Using the two DSM types together, the distribution of DSM-differenced heights in forests (mu=6.0m, s=1.4 m) was consistent with the distribution of plotlevel mean tree heights (mu=6.5 m, s=1.2 m). We conclude that the variation in sun elevation angle at time of stereopair acquisition can create illumination conditions conducive for capturing elevations of surfaces either near the ground or associated with vegetation canopy. Knowledge of HRSI acquisition solar geometry and snow cover can be used to understand and combine stereogrammetric surface elevation estimates to co-register and difference overlapping DSMs, providing a means to map forest height at fine scales, resolving the vertical structure of groups of trees from spaceborne platforms in open canopy forests.

TI  - Face Transplantation: Partial Graft Loss of the First Case 10 Years Later
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPLANTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ten years after the first face transplantation, we report the partial loss of this graft. After two episodes of acute rejection (AR) occurred and completely reversed in the first posttransplantation year, at 90 months posttransplantation the patient developed de novo class II donor-specific antibodies, without clinical signs of AR. Some months later, she developed several skin rejection episodes treated with steroid pulses. Despite rapid clinical improvement, some months later the sentinel skin graft underwent necrosis. Microscopic examination showed intimal thickening, thrombosis of the pedicle vessel, and C4d deposits on the endothelium of some dermal vessels of the facial graft. Flow magnetic resonance imaging of the facial graft showed a decrease of the distal right facial artery flow. Three steroid pulses of 500 mg each, followed by intravenous immunoglobulins (2 g/kg), five sessions of plasmapheresis, and three cycles of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2), were administered. Despite rescue therapy with eculizumab, necrosis of the lips and the perioral area occurred, which led to surgical removal of the lower lip, labial commissures, and part of the right cheek in May 2015. In January 2016, the patient underwent conventional facial reconstruction because during the retransplantation evaluation a small-cell lung carcinoma was discovered, causing the patient's death in April 2016.

TI  - Axillary treatment of patients with breast cancer and micrometastatic disease in the sentinel lymph node Our experience
T2  - ANNALI ITALIANI DI CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - ATM: Since the introduction of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with breast cancer, micrometastases are detected frequently in the sln.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 2005 and June 2016, 1244 patients were submitted to surgery for breast cancer. 431 patients cT1-2 NO underwent to sentinel lymph node (SLN) and micrometastases were found in 68 of 431 screen-detected patients. Nearly all patients with both micro and micrometastases had axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).RESULTS: The SLN was negative in 69% of patients (296 of 431), 121 patients (28%) instead turned positive for lymph node metastases and in 14 patients (3%) were identified isolated tumor cells (ITC). SLN micrometastases were detected in 15,7% of patients (68 of 431). All patients with micrometastases underwent a completion ALND. In 85% of cases, therefore, the sentinel node with micrometastases was the only site of nodal disease. Neither loco-regional recurrences or distant metastases occurred in any of the Patients with sln micrometastases.DISCUSSION: There is considerable interest in foregoing axillary dissection (AD) when the sentinel node (SN) is positive in early breast cancer, particularly when axillary involvement is minimal (micrometastases or isolated tumor cells). Several trials are addressing the problem. In breast cancer patients survival is not affected by the presence of micrometastatic lymph node involvement.CONCLUSION: In our experience we always underwent to ALND all patients with micrometastases. In the light of the results we observed our attitude no longer provides for the axillary lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Traditional healers, faith healers and medical practitioners: the contribution of medical pluralism to bottlenecks along the cascade of care for HIV/AIDS in Eastern and Southern Africa
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives There are concerns that medical pluralism may delay patients' progression through the HIV cascade-of-care. However, the pathways of impact through which medical pluralism influence the care of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in African settings remain unclear. We sought to establish the manifestation of medical pluralism among PLHIV, and explore mechanisms through which medical pluralism contributes bottlenecks along the HIV care cascade.Methods We conducted a multicountry exploratory qualitative study in seven health and demographic surveillance sites in six eastern and southern African countries: Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Africa. We interviewed 258 PLHIV at different stages of the HIV cascade-of-care, 48 family members of deceased PLHIV and 53 HIV healthcare workers. Interviews were conducted using shared standardised topic guides, and data managed through NVIVO 8/10/11. We conducted a thematic analysis of healthcare pathways and bottlenecks related to medical pluralism.Results Medical pluralism, manifesting across traditional, faith-based and biomedical health-worlds, contributed to the care cascade bottlenecks for PLHIV through three pathways of impact. First, access to HIV treatment was delayed through the nature of health-related beliefs, knowledge and patient journeys. Second, HIV treatment was interrupted by availability of alternative options, perceived failed treatment and exploitation of PLHIV by opportunistic traders and healers. Lastly, the mixing of biomedical healthcare providers and treatment with traditional and faith-based options fuelled tensions driven by fear of drug-to-drug interactions and mistrust between providers operating in different health-worlds.Conclusion Medical pluralism contributes to delays and interruptions of care along the HIV cascade, and mistrust between health providers. Region-wide interventions and policies are urgently needed in sub-Saharan Africa to minimise potential harm and consequences of medical pluralism for PLHIV. The role of sociocultural beliefs in mediating bottlenecks necessitate adoption of culture-sensitive approaches intervention designs and policy reforms appropriate to the context of sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Increased Resistance of Skin Flora to Antimicrobial Prophylaxis in Patients Undergoing Hip Revision Arthroplasty
T2  - IN VIVO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains a major complication after total joint replacement and is the primary indication for revision arthroplasty. Specifically, coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) can cause low-grade infections. Despite the use of cephalosporin-based antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) and antiseptic treatment at the surgical site, evidence suggests that a significant number of cases of dermal CNS results in low-grade PJI. Thus, this study examined the bacterial colonization and resistance patterns at the surgical site. We hypothesized that the bacteria developed resistance to antibiotics that are frequently used in primary and revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) procedures. Patients and Methods: Ninety patients, including 63 primary and 27 revision THA patients, were enrolled in this study. For each patient, a single swab of the skin at the surgical site was subjected to clinical microbiology to assess bacterial colonization. Furthermore, resistance to a sentinel panel of antibiotics (benzylpenicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, oxacillin, fusidic acid, clindamycin, gentamicin, levofloxacin/moxifloxacin, rifampicin, linezolid and vancomycin) was tested. Results: In 96.7% of the patients, at least one bacterial strain was identified at the surgical site, with CNS strains comprising 93.1% of the total. The sentinel panel showed that 30.7% of the CNS strains exhibited maximal resistance to oxacillin, a commonly used cephalosporin. Additionally, oxacillin resistance increased 1.9-fold (p=0.042) between primary and revision THA. Notably, 8.1% of the CNS stains found on patients undergoing primary THA were resistant to gentamicin, an aminoglycoside, and this rate increased 4.7-fold (p=0.001) for patients undergoing revision THA. Conclusion: CNS strains have significant resistance to standard AMP, particularly in individuals undergoing revision THA.

TI  - Scattering Mechanism Based Snow Cover Mapping Using RADARSAT-2 <i>C</i>-Band Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of snow cover over large areal extent requires the use of remotely sensed satellite data. Conventional snow cover mapping algorithms using SAR data have seldom utilized target scattering information for land cover characterization. In this paper, an approach is proposed for snow cover mapping that utilizes the Touzi eigenvalue-eigenvector-based decomposition parameters viz., the scattering helicities (tau(m); m = 1, 2), the scattering magnitude (alpha(s)), and the entropy (H). The seasonal variation of these parameters is used as an indicator of scattering mechanism dominance in the proposed algorithm. The C-band RADARSAT-2 (FQ20) winter-summer image pairs over the Manali-Dhundi region of Himachal Pradesh, India, located in the western Hindu-Kush Himalayas are used in this paper. The proposed methodology is able to delineate the snow-covered areas suitably. The temporal extent of the cover is also quantified and validated with field campaigns and weather data. Furthermore, the results obtained from the proposed methodology are compared with NDSI-based snow cover maps derived from LANDSAT-8 images.

TI  - Determination of rice paddy parameters in the global gross primary production capacity estimation algorithm using 6 years of JP-MSE flux observation data
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) capacity is defined as GPP under low stress, and the algorithm for its estimation was developed by Thanyapraneedkul etal. (2012) using a light-response curve. The idea behind this algorithm is that the light response curve under low stress is related to chlorophyll content. The parameter is estimated from a vegetation index derived from satellite observations of the green chlorophyll index (C/(green)) for seven vegetation types, including rice paddy. These previous studies included 1 year of data for the flux site and MODIS reflectance data. Recently, long-term data have become publicly available for flux data covering a period of 6 years, and MODIS reflectance data covering a period of more than 16 years.This study determined the parameters in the GPP capacity estimation algorithm for rice paddies using 6 years of Mase paddy flux site data and clear daytime reflectance data observed using MODIS. The fitted parameter-related initial slopes of the light -photosynthesis curves for each year were identical within the fitting error. Using the averaged parameter -related initial slope over 6 years, we were able to determine a linear relationship between agree, and the maximum photosynthesis rate at 2000 PAR (mu mol m-(2) s-(1) ), the slope of which was slightly higher than has been reported previously. Using the parameters for the period 2001-2006, we investigated how GPP capacity varied for irrigated rice paddy. The ratio of the average GPP capacity to the GPP after transplanting until harvesting was 0.91 for the period 2001 to 2006. This result shows that GPP capacity provides a useful first approximation of GPP for irrigated rice paddies as a framework of the global GPP estimation algorithm.

TI  - SAR polarimetric decomposition with ALOS PALSAR-1 for agricultural land and other land use/cover classification: case study in Rajasthan, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has operational applications in crop mapping and monitoring in many countries due to the distinct backscatter signature at various stages of crop growth. Polarimetric analysis of SAR data from different satellites was used for information extraction from different types of scatters in imaged terrain. The scattering processes were analyzed through the received scatter matrix derived from the target decomposition of SAR data. Three decomposition techniques, namely Freeman-Durden, Cloude-Pottier and Touzi decomposition of the ALOS PALSAR-1 data, were used in this study to extract land use/cover information with a specific emphasis on agriculture. The decomposed output parameters from these techniques were classified with supervised classifier of support vector machine (SVM) using region of interest (ROI) selected land use/cover classes. An accuracy assessment for the classified output was carried out using the ROI. The Ramgarh village in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan with the predominance of agricultural land, sand dunes and settlements was chosen as the study area. Freeman-Durden decomposition resulted in the highest overall accuracy of about 85% in the land use/cover classification among the three decomposition techniques adopted in the study. It was also observed that the accuracy of land use/cover mapping derived from Cloude-Pottier and Touzi decompositions improved with the use of eigenvalues in the SVM classification. Higher accuracies in the classification of agriculture land were noted with all the three decomposition techniques. The four parameters of Cloude-Pottier (H, A, alpha, beta) and Touzi (alpha(s), Phi(s), psi, tau) decompositions improved the classification accuracy for all the classes due to eigenvalues. The overall classification accuracy was above 88% for both the decomposition techniques with four parameters. The soil moisture values for agriculture land and sand dunes were validated through soil moisture maps generated using Oh 1992 and 2004 models.

TI  - Sensitivity of mountain glacier mass balance to changes in bare-ice albedo
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Albedo is an important parameter in the energy balance of bare-ice surfaces and modulates glacier melt rates. The prolongation of the ablation period enforces the albedo feedback and highlights the need for profound knowledge on impacts of bare-ice albedo on glacier mass balance. In this study, we assess the mass balance sensitivity of 12 Swiss glaciers with abundant long-term in-situ data on changes in bare-ice albedo. We use pixel-based bare-ice albedo derived from Landsat 8. A distributed mass-balance model is applied to the period 1997-2016 and experiments are performed to assess the impact of albedo changes on glacier mass balance. Our results indicate that glacier-wide mass-balance sensitivities to changes in bare-ice albedo correlate strongly with mean annual mass balances (r(2) = 0.81). Large alpine glaciers react more sensitively to bare-ice albedo changes due to their ablation areas being situated at lower elevations. We find average sensitivities of glacier-wide mass balance of -0.14 m w.e. a(-1) per 0.1 albedo decrease. Although this value is considerably smaller than sensitivity to air temperature change, we stress the importance of the enhanced albedo feedback that will be amplified due to atmospheric warming and a suspected darkening of glacier surface in the near future.

TI  - Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping as a Possible Tool to Radiographically Diagnose Sentinel Headache Associated with Intracranial Aneurysm: Case Report
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel headache (SH) occurs before aneurysm rupture in an estimated 15%-60% of cases of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). By definition, noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain and lumbar puncture are both negative in patients presenting with SH. One of the theories explaining this phenomenon is that microhemorrhage (MH) from the aneurysm wall contribute to iron deposition in the interface between the aneurysm wall and brain parenchyma. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a recently introduced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that has proven capable of localizing the deposition of paramagnetic metals, particularly ferric iron. Thus, the QSM sequence may be able to detect iron deposition secondary to MH.CASE DESCRIPTION: A 76-year-old male presented with the "worst headache of my life." Noncontrast head CT scan and lumbar puncture were negative. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain revealed an anterior communicating artery (A-com) aneurysm measuring 7 mm with a large bleb. T1-weighted imaging (WI), T2-WI, MRA, T2 star-weighted angiography (SWAN), and QSM sequences were obtained. T2-WI, SWAN, and QSM revealed isointense, hypointense, and hyperintense signals, respectively, at the interface of the aneurysm wall and brain tissue. These findings were consistent with deposition of ferric iron at this interface. The A-com aneurysm was treated with coil embolization, and the patient exhibited no postoperative deficits.CONCLUSIONS: The MRI QSM sequence can localize iron deposition resulting from MH within an aneurysmal wall. This sequence may be a promising imaging tool for screening patients presenting with SH.

TI  - REPEATED-SPRINT SEQUENCES DURING FEMALE SOCCER MATCHES USING FIXED AND INDIVIDUAL SPEED THRESHOLDS
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study was to characterize the occurrence of single sprint and repeated-sprint sequences (RSS) during elite female soccer matches, using fixed (20 km.h(-1)) and individually based speed thresholds (>90% of the mean speed from a 20-m sprint test). Eleven elite female soccer players from the same team participated in the study. All players performed a 20-m linear sprint test, and were assessed in up to 10 official matches using Global Positioning System technology. Magnitude-based inferences were used to test for meaningful differences. Results revealed that irrespective of adopting fixed or individual speed thresholds, female players produced only a few RSS during matches (2.3 +/- 2.4 sequences using the fixed threshold and 3.3 +/- 3.0 sequences using the individually based threshold), with most sequences composing of just 2 sprints. Additionally, central defenders performed fewer sprints (10.2 +/- 4.1) than other positions (fullbacks: 28.1 +/- 5.5; midfielders: 21.9 +/- 10.5; forwards: 31.9 +/- 11.1; with the differences being likely to almost certainly associated with effect sizes ranging from 1.65 to 2.72), and sprinting ability declined in the second half. The data do not support the notion that RSS occurs frequently during soccer matches in female players, irrespective of using fixed or individual speed thresholds to define sprint occurrence. However, repeated-sprint ability development cannot be ruled out from soccer training programs because of its association with match-related performance.

TI  - Shifts in community size structure drive temperature invariance of secondary production in a stream-warming experiment
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A central question at the interface of food-web and climate change research is how secondary production, or the formation of heterotroph biomass over time, will respond to rising temperatures. The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) hypothesizes the temperature-invariance of secondary production, driven by matched and opposed forces that reduce biomass of heterotrophs while increasing their biomass turnover rate (production : biomass, or P:B) with warming. To test this prediction at the whole community level, we used a geothermal heat exchanger to experimentally warm a stream in southwest Iceland by 3.8 degrees C for two years. We quantified invertebrate community biomass, production, and P:B in the experimental stream and a reference stream for one year prior to warming and two years during warming. As predicted, warming had a neutral effect on community production, but this result was not driven by opposing effects on community biomass and P:B. Instead, warming had a positive effect on both the biomass and production of larger-bodied, slower-growing taxa (e.g., larval black flies, dipteran predators, snails) and a negative effect on small-bodied taxa with relatively high growth rates (e.g., ostracods, larval chironomids). We attribute these divergent responses to differences in thermal preference between small-vs. large-bodied taxa. Although metabolic demand vs. resource supply must ultimately constrain community production, our results highlight the potential for idiosyncratic community responses to warming, driven by variation in thermal preference and body size within regional species pools.

TI  - Experimental whole-stream warming alters community size structure
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - How ecological communities respond to predicted increases in temperature will determine the extent to which Earth's biodiversity and ecosystem functioning can be maintained into a warmer future. Warming is predicted to alter the structure of natural communities, but robust tests of such predictions require appropriate large-scale manipulations of intact, natural habitat that is open to dispersal processes via exchange with regional species pools. Here, we report results of a two-year whole-stream warming experiment that shifted invertebrate assemblage structure via unanticipated mechanisms, while still conforming to community-level metabolic theory. While warming by 3.8 degrees C decreased invertebrate abundance in the experimental stream by 60% relative to a reference stream, total invertebrate biomass was unchanged. Associated shifts in invertebrate assemblage structure were driven by the arrival of new taxa and a higher proportion of large, warm-adapted species (i.e., snails and predatory dipterans) relative to small-bodied, cold-adapted taxa (e.g., chironomids and oligochaetes). Experimental warming consequently shifted assemblage size spectra in ways that were unexpected, but consistent with thermal optima of taxa in the regional species pool. Higher temperatures increased community-level energy demand, which was presumably satisfied by higher primary production after warming. Our experiment demonstrates how warming reassembles communities within the constraints of energy supply via regional exchange of species that differ in thermal physiological traits. Similar responses will likely mediate impacts of anthropogenic warming on biodiversity and ecosystem function across all ecological communities.

TI  - Landsat-Based Trend Analysis of Lake Dynamics across Northern Permafrost Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are a ubiquitous landscape feature in northern permafrost regions. They have a strong impact on carbon, energy and water fluxes and can be quite responsive to climate change. The monitoring of lake change in northern high latitudes, at a sufficiently accurate spatial and temporal resolution, is crucial for understanding the underlying processes driving lake change. To date, lake change studies in permafrost regions were based on a variety of different sources, image acquisition periods and single snapshots, and localized analysis, which hinders the comparison of different regions. Here, we present a methodology based on machine-learning based classification of robust trends of multi-spectral indices of Landsat data (TM, ETM+, OLI) and object-based lake detection, to analyze and compare the individual, local and regional lake dynamics of four different study sites (Alaska North Slope, Western Alaska, Central Yakutia, Kolyma Lowland) in the northern permafrost zone from 1999 to 2014. Regional patterns of lake area change on the Alaska North Slope (-0.69%), Western Alaska (-2.82%), and Kolyma Lowland (-0.51%) largely include increases due to thermokarst lake expansion, but more dominant lake area losses due to catastrophic lake drainage events. In contrast, Central Yakutia showed a remarkable increase in lake area of 48.48%, likely resulting from warmer and wetter climate conditions over the latter half of the study period. Within all study regions, variability in lake dynamics was associated with differences in permafrost characteristics, landscape position (i.e., upland vs. lowland), and surface geology. With the global availability of Landsat data and a consistent methodology for processing the input data derived from robust trends of multi-spectral indices, we demonstrate a transferability, scalability and consistency of lake change analysis within the northern permafrost region.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nine years of monthly data of MODIS derived chl-a around Makassar Strait of Indonesia were used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of chl-a concentration. The variability was further analyzed by empirical orthogonal function (EOF). The first mode (62.08% of variance) showed variability of seasonal pattern. The second mode (5.75% of variance) showed variability during the Northwest monsoon and the Southeast monsoon. Meanwhile, the third mode (2.72% of variance) and the fourth mode (2.25% of variance) showed variability during the Transition monsoon I and II, respectively.The variability of chl-a along the Borneo Island is influenced by river runoff during the Northwest monsoon, while the variability of chl-a along the Sulawesi Island is induced by strong wind and current during the Southeast monsoon.

TI  - Using Intra-Annual Landsat Time Series for Attributing Forest Disturbance Agents in Central Europe
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The attribution of forest disturbances to disturbance agents is a critical challenge for remote sensing-based forest monitoring, promising important insights into drivers and impacts of forest disturbances. Previous studies have used spectral-temporal metrics derived from annual Landsat time series to identify disturbance agents. Here, we extend this approach to new predictors derived from intra-annual time series and test it at three sites in Central Europe, including managed and protected forests. The two newly tested predictors are: (1) intra-annual timing of disturbance events and (2) temporal proximity to windstorms based on prior knowledge. We estimated the intra-annual timing of disturbances using a breakpoint detection algorithm and all available Landsat observations between 1984 and 2016. Using spectral, temporal, and topography-related metrics, we then mapped four disturbance classes: windthrow, cleared windthrow, bark beetles, and other harvest. Disturbance agents were identified with overall accuracies of 76-86%. Temporal proximity to storm events was among the most important predictors, while intra-annual timing itself was less important. Moreover, elevation information was very effective for discriminating disturbance agents. Our results demonstrate the potential of incorporating dense, intra-annual Landsat time series information and prior knowledge of disturbance events for monitoring forest ecosystem change at the disturbance agent level.

TI  - Impact of mass drug administration for elimination of lymphatic filariasis in Nepal
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundLymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease transmitted by mosquitoes. Nepal has implemented a national effort to eliminate LF by 2020 through mass drug administration (MDA) using diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and albendazole (ALB). We assessed the impact of MDAs on LF in selected districts of Nepal after the recommended six MDA rounds had been completed.Methodology and principal findingsBaseline surveys were conducted in seven districts and mapping data were used as baseline in the other three districts before starting MDA in 2009. LF antigen (Ag) prevalence ranged from 1.06% to 20% among districts included in the baseline and mapping study. The number of people who received DEC and ALB were recorded during each MDA round and population-based cluster surveys were conducted at least once in each district during the life of the program. The reported MDA coverage in five districts was consistently at least 65%. Two districts achieved the targeted coverage in four out of five rounds and the rest three districts achieved the target only in the first round. A pre-transmission assessment survey (pre-TAS) was conducted in one sentinel site and at least one spot check site in each of the districts after five MDA rounds. In pre-TAS, all the sites of five districts (Pyuthan, Argha-khanchi, Kaski, Bhaktapur, and Kathmandu) and all but one spot check site of Lalitpur district had LF Ag < 2% (ranging from 0.0% to 1.99%). Transmission assessment survey (TAS) was conducted in six evaluation units (EUs) consisting of six districts qualified on pre-TAS. Though MDA coverage of 65% was not achieved in three districts (Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur), Nepal government in consultation with World Health Organization (WHO) decided to conduct TAS. All six EUs achieved the LF Ag threshold required to stop MDA in TAS, despite the low reported MDA coverage in those three districts.ConclusionsAlthough Nepal has achieved significant progress towards LF elimination, five rounds of MDA were not sufficient to disrupt the transmission cycle in all districts, probably because of high baseline prevalence.

TI  - Synergetic of PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1A SAR Polarimetry for Retrieving Aboveground Biomass in Dipterocarp Forest of Malaysia
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Space borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have become one of the primary sources for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation of forests. However, studies have indicated that limitations occur when a single sensor system is employed, especially in tropical forests. Hence, there is potential for improving estimates if two or more different sensor systems are used. Studies on integrating multiple sensor systems for estimation of AGB over Malaysia's tropical forests are scarce. This study investigated the use of PALSAR-2 L-band and Sentinel-1A C-band SAR polarizations to estimates the AGB over 5.25 million ha of the lowland, hill, and upper hill forests in Peninsular Malaysia. Polarized images, i.e., HH-HV from PALSAR-2 and VV-VH from Sentinel-1A have been utilized to produce several variables for predictions of the AGB. Simple linear and multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify the best predictor. The study concluded that although limitations exist in the estimates, the combination of all polarizations from both PALSAR-2 and Sentiel-1A SAR data able to increase the accuracy and reduced the root means square error (RMSE) up to 14 Mg ha(-1) compared to the estimation resulted from single polarization. A spatially distributed map of AGB reported the total AGB within the study area was about 1.82 trillion Mg of the year 2016.

TI  - Large-Scale, Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing of Palaeo-River Networks: A Case Study from Northwest India and its Implications for the Indus Civilisation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has considerable potential to contribute to the identification and reconstruction of lost hydrological systems and networks. Remote sensing-based reconstructions of palaeo-river networks have commonly employed single or limited time-span imagery, which limits their capacity to identify features in complex and varied landscape contexts. This paper presents a seasonal multi-temporal approach to the detection of palaeo-rivers over large areas based on long-term vegetation dynamics and spectral decomposition techniques. Twenty-eight years of Landsat 5 data, a total of 1711 multi-spectral images, have been bulk processed using Google Earth Engine((C)) Code Editor and cloud computing infrastructure. The use of multi-temporal data has allowed us to overcome seasonal cultivation patterns and long-term visibility issues related to recent crop selection, extensive irrigation and land-use patterns. The application of this approach on the Sutlej-Yamuna interfluve (northwest India), a core area for the Bronze Age Indus Civilisation, has enabled the reconstruction of an unsuspectedly complex palaeo-river network comprising more than 8000 km of palaeo-channels. It has also enabled the definition of the morphology of these relict courses, which provides insights into the environmental conditions in which they operated. These new data will contribute to a better understanding of the settlement distribution and environmental settings in which this, often considered riverine, civilisation operated.

T2  - Chirurgia (Bucharest, Romania : 1990)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The aim of our study was to evaluate the extent to which the preservation or the section of the intercostobrachial nerve (ICBN) influences the development of postoperatoryparesthesia and to assess whether the development of paresthesiamay change the patient's life quality after surgical treatment for breast carcinoma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a nonrandomized retrospective study including 100 patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection for infiltrating breast carcinoma associated with axillary lymph node metastases. Using a questionnaire we studied the patients general life quality in the postoperative period. For the statistical analysis we used GraphPad Prism, Fisher's exact test and Chi square test. Results: 100 patients were included in our study with a mean age of 59.7 years. In 50 cases, the ICBN was preserved (Group 1),while in the remaining 50 cases the ICBN was sectioned during surgery (Group 2). Significantly more patients from Group 2 complained about postoperative paresthesia (p=0.026). In our series, the management of the ICBN cannot be significantly correlated with the impairment of the patients daily activities (p=0.2), sleeping cycle (p=0.2), and general life quality after surgery (p=0.67). We can conclude that the management of ICBN has a great influence on the development of postoperative paresthesia. Although the paresthesia does not have a negative effect on the patient's life quality in the postoperative period, in our opinion it is important to preserve the ICBN in order to prevent postoperative paresthesia.

TI  - Comparison of satellite images with different spatial resolutions to estimate stand structural diversity in urban forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The structural diversity in urban forests is highly important to protect biodiversity. In particular, fruit trees and bush species, cavity-bearing trees and coarse, woody debris provide habitats for animals to feed, nest and hide. Improper silvicultural practices, intensive recreational use and illegal harvesting lead to a decline in the structural diversity in forests within larger metropolitan cities. It is important to monitor the structural diversity at definite time intervals using effective technologies with a view to instituting the necessary conservation measures. The use of satellite images seems to be appropriate to this end. Here we aimed to identify the associations between the textural features derived from the satellite images with different spatial resolutions and the structural diversity indices in urban forest stands (Shannon-Wiener index, complexity index, dominance index and density of wildlife trees). RapidEye images with a spatial resolution of 5 m x 5 m, ASTER images with a spatial resolution of 15 m x 15 m and Landsat-8 ETM satellite images with a spatial resolution of 30 m x 30 m were used in this study. The first-order (standard deviation of gray levels) and second order (GLCM entropy, GLCM contrast and GLCM correlation) textural features were calculated from the satellite images. When associations between textural features in the images and the structural diversity indices were assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient, very high associations were found between the image textural features and the diversity indices. The highest association was found between the standard deviation of gray levels (SDGL(RAP)) derived from RVIRAP of RapidEye image and the Shannon-Wiener index (H (h)) calculated on the basis of tree height (R (2) = 0.64). The findings revealed that RapidEye satellite images with a spatial resolution of 5 m x 5 m are most suitable for estimating the structural diversity in urban forests.

TI  - Urban Land-Cover Dynamics in Arid China Based on High-Resolution Urban Land Mapping Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has occurred in northwestern China, threatening the sustainability of its fragile dryland ecosystems. A lack of precise urban land-cover information has limited our understanding on the urbanization in the dryland. Here, we examined urban land-cover changes from 2000 to 2014 in 21 major cities that comprise over 50% of the developed land in arid China, using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Operational Land Imager data, and a hybrid classification method. The 15-m resolution urban land-cover products (including impervious surfaces, vegetation, bare soil, and water bodies) had an overall accuracy of 90.37%. Based on these new land use products, we found the urbanization in arid China was characterized by the dramatic expansion of impervious surface (+13.23%) and reduction of bare soil (-13.41%), while the proportions of vegetation (+0.27%) and water (-0.10%) remained stable. The observed dynamic equilibrium of vegetated ratio implies an increasing harmonization of urbanization and greening, which was particularly important for the sustainability of fragile urban ecosystems in arid regions. From an economic perspective, gross domestic product and population were significantly correlated with impervious surfaces, and oasis cities displayed a stronger ability to attract new residents than desert cities.

AB  - This study aims to detect vessels with lengths ranging from about 70 to 300 m, in Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR images with ultrafine strip-map (UFS) mode as fast as possible. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of vessels in GF-3 SAR imagery, an effective vessel detection method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the iterative constant false alarm rate (CFAR) method is employed to detect the potential ship pixels. Secondly, the mean-shift operation is applied on each potential ship pixel to identify the candidate target region. During the mean-shift process, we maintain a selection matrix recording which pixels can be taken, and these pixels are called as the valid points of the candidate target. The l(1) norm regression is used to extract the principal axis and detect the valid points. Finally, two kinds of false alarms, the bright line and the azimuth ambiguity, are removed by comparing the valid area of the candidate target with a pre-defined value and computing the displacement between the true target and the corresponding replicas respectively. Experimental results on three GF-3 SAR images with UFS mode demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

TI  - Sustained progress, but no room for complacency: Results of 2015 HIV estimations in India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background & objectives: Evidence-based planning has been the cornerstone of India's response to HIV/AIDS. Here we describe the process, method and tools used for generating the 2015 HIV estimates and provide a summary of the main results.Methods: Spectrum software supported by the UNAIDS was used to produce HIV estimates for India as a whole and its States/Union Territories. This tool takes into consideration the size and HIV prevalence of defined population groups and programme data to estimate HIV prevalence, incidence and mortality over time as well as treatment needs.Results: India's national adult prevalence of HIV was 0.26 per cent in 2015. Of the 2.1 million people living with HIV/AIDS, the largest numbers were in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka. New HIV infections were an estimated 86,000 in 2015, reflecting a decline by around 32 per cent from 2007. The declining trend in incidence was mirrored in most States, though an increasing trend was detected in Assam, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Sikkim, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh. AIDS-related deaths were estimated to be 67,600 in 2015, reflecting a 54 per cent decline from 2007. There were variations in the rate and trend of decline across India for this indicator also.Interpretation & conclusions: While key indicators measured through Spectrum modelling confirm success of the National AIDS Control Programme, there is no room for complacency as rising incidence trends in some geographical areas and population pockets remain the cause of concern. Progress achieved so far in responding to HIV/AIDS needs to be sustained to end the HIV epidemic.

AB  - Hamtah and Chhota Shigri are two nearby, well monitored glaciers of western Himalaya, lying in the same climatic zone and driven by the same climatic conditions. In this study, topographical characteristics of both the glacier have been explored to understand the role of topography in controlling the glacier response. Further, their topographical characteristics and possible response towards climatic variations have been compared with each other and also with that of the other glaciers in the basin to find out the suitability of these two glaciers to be considered as representative of the region. Multi sensor and multi temporal remote sensing data have been used to carry out to fulfill the objectives. It is found that being in the same climatic zone, the mean accumulation area ratio of Chhota Shigri is 54% and Hamtah is 11% between 1980 and 2014. In comparison to Hamtah, Chhota Shigri glacier has a small upslope area, low compactness ratio indicating the ability of the glacier to receive direct precipitation and solar radiation. The analysis revealed that the Chhota Shigri glacier has a closer resemblance with the other glaciers in the region than Hamtah glacier. Also, the topographical settings of Chhota Shigri glacier are suitable for recording and reflecting year-to-year climatic variations.

TI  - Assigning dates and identifying areas affected by fires in Portugal based on MODIS data
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - An automated procedure is here presented that allows identifying and dating burned areas in Portugal using values of daily reflectance from near-infrared and middle- infrared bands, as obtained from the MODIS instrument. The algorithm detects persistent changes in monthly composites of the so-called (V,W) BurnSensitive Index and the day of maximum change in daily time series of W is in turn identified as the day of the burning event. The procedure is tested for 2005, the second worst fire season ever recorded in Portugal. Comparison between the obtained burned area map and the reference derived from Landsat imagery resulted in a Proportion Correct of 95.6%. Despite being applied only to the months of August and September, the algorithm is able to identify almost two-thirds of all scars that have occurred during the entire year of 2005. An assessment of the temporal accuracy of the dating procedure was also conducted, showing that 75% of estimated dates presented deviations between -5 and 5 days from dates of hotspots derived from the MODIS instrument. Information about location and date of burning events as provided by the proposed procedure may be viewed as complementary to the currently available official maps based on end-of-season Landsat imagery.

TI  - Vegetation anomalies caused by antecedent precipitation in most of the world
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying environmental controls on vegetation is critical to predict the net effect of climate change on global ecosystems and the subsequent feedback on climate. Following a non-linear Granger causality framework based on a random forest predictive model, we exploit the current wealth of multi-decadal satellite data records to uncover the main drivers of monthly vegetation variability at the global scale. Results indicate that water availability is the most dominant factor driving vegetation globally: about 61% of the vegetated surface was primarily water-limited during 1981-2010. This included semiarid climates but also transitional ecoregions. Intraannually, temperature controls Northern Hemisphere deciduous forests during the growing season, while antecedent precipitation largely dominates vegetation dynamics during the senescence period. The uncovered dependency of global vegetation on water availability is substantially larger than previously reported. This is owed to the ability of the framework to (1) disentangle the co-linearities between radiation/temperature and precipitation, and (2) quantify non-linear impacts of climate on vegetation. Our results reveal a prolonged effect of precipitation anomalies in dry regions: due to the long memory of soil moisture and the cumulative, nonlinear, response of vegetation, water-limited regions show sensitivity to the values of precipitation occurring three months earlier. Meanwhile, the impacts of temperature and radiation anomalies are more immediate and dissipate shortly, pointing to a higher resilience of vegetation to these anomalies. Despite being infrequent by definition, hydro-climatic extremes are responsible for up to 10% of the vegetation variability during the 1981-2010 period in certain areas, particularly in water-limited ecosystems. Our approach is a first step towards a quantitative comparison of the resistance and resilience signature of different ecosystems, and can be used to benchmark Earth system models in their representations of past vegetation sensitivity to changes in climate.

TI  - Estimation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow covered area by using cellular automata models
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the need to consider the cryosphere in water resources management for mountainous regions, the purpose of this paper is to model the daily spatially distributed dynamics of snow covered area (SCA) by using calibrated cellular automata models. For the operational use of the calibrated model, the only data requirements are the altitude of each cell of the spatial discretization of the area of interest and precipitation and temperature indexes for the area of interest. For the calibration step, experimental snow covered area data are needed. Potential uses of the model are to estimate the snow covered area when satellite data are absent, or when they provide a temporal resolution different from the operational resolution, or when the satellite images are useless because they are covered by clouds or because there has been a sensor failure. Another interesting application is the simulation of SCA dynamics for the snow covered area under future climatic scenarios. The model is applied to the Sierra Nevada mountain range, in southern Spain, which is home to significant biodiversity, contains important water resources in its snowpack, and contains the most meridional ski resort in Europe.

TI  - Historical and projected trends in landscape drivers affecting carbon dynamics in Alaska
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern climate change in Alaska has resulted in widespread thawing of permafrost, increased fire activity, and extensive changes in vegetation characteristics that have significant consequences for socioecological systems. Despite observations of the heightened sensitivity of these systems to change, there has not been a comprehensive assessment of factors that drive ecosystem changes throughout Alaska. Here we present research that improves our understanding of the main drivers of the spatiotemporal patterns of carbon dynamics using in situ observations, remote sensing data, and an array of modeling techniques. In the last 60 yr, Alaska has seen a large increase in mean annual air temperature (1.7 degrees C), with the greatest warming occurring over winter and spring. Warming trends are projected to continue throughout the 21st century and will likely result in landscape-level changes to ecosystem structure and function. Wetlands, mainly bogs and fens, which are currently estimated to cover 12.5% of the landscape, strongly influence exchange of methane between Alaska's ecosystems and the atmosphere and are expected to be affected by thawing permafrost and shifts in hydrology. Simulations suggest the current proportion of near-surface (within 1 m) and deep (within 5 m) permafrost extent will be reduced by 9-74% and 33-55% by the end of the 21st century, respectively. Since 2000, an average of 678 595 ha/yr was burned, more than twice the annual average during 1950-1999. The largest increase in fire activity is projected for the boreal forest, which could result in a reduction in late-successional spruce forest (8-44%) and an increase in early-successional deciduous forest (25-113%) that would mediate future fire activity and weaken permafrost stability in the region. Climate warming will also affect vegetation communities across arctic regions, where the coverage of deciduous forest could increase (223-620%), shrub tundra may increase (4-21%), and graminoid tundra might decrease (10-24%). This study sheds light on the sensitivity of Alaska's ecosystems to change that has the potential to significantly affect local and regional carbon balance, but more research is needed to improve estimates of land-surface and subsurface properties, and to better account for ecosystem dynamics affected by a myriad of biophysical factors and interactions.

TI  - Assessment of satellite precipitation estimates over the slopes of the subtropical Andes
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A validation of four satellite daily precipitation estimates at a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees is performed over the subtropical Andes, an area of highly complex topography: The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA, 3B42 V7 and RT), the Climate Prediction Center Morphing technique (CMORPH) and the Hydro-Estimator (HYDRO). Remote mountainous regions represent a major challenge for these satellite data products and for studies examining their quality with surface data.For the assessment of the satellite products, a period of seven years from January 1st 2004 to December 31st 2010 was considered. Different statistics were analyzed considering their variability in the study area and identifying their main differences between the warm and cold seasons. The results indicate a decrease in winter errors which coincides with the wet season over the windward side of the Andes. Also, a significant underestimation of precipitation is observed for all estimates throughout the period analyzed.The analysis with respect to terrain height shows a greater dependence of errors with topography for all the algorithms that combine infrared and passive microwave data, HYDRO providing the most stable result. The main limitations of the estimates associated with the type of precipitating event and their location relative to the orography are assessed.Finally, the analysis of two intense precipitation events is presented and allows the assessment of the latest advances in satellite derived estimates with the launch of the Global Precipitation Measurement.

TI  - Recent Advances in Soil Moisture Estimation from Remote Sensing
T2  - WATER
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Monitoring soil moisture dynamics from local to global scales is essential for a wide range of applications. The field of remote sensing of soil moisture has expanded greatly and the first dedicated soil moisture satellite missions (SMOS, SMAP) were launched, and new missions, such as SENTINEL-1 provide long-term perspectives for land surface monitoring. This special issue aims to summarize the recent advances in soil moisture estimation from remote sensing, including recent advances in retrieval algorithms, validation, and applications of satellite-based soil moisture products. Contributions in this special issue exploit the estimation of soil moisture from both microwave remote sensing data and thermal infrared information. The validation of satellite soil moisture products can be very challenging, due to the different spatial scales of in situ measurements and satellite data. Some papers present validation studies to quantify soil moisture uncertainties. On the other hand, soil moisture downscaling schemes and new methods for soil moisture retrieval from GPS are also addressed by some contributions. Soil moisture data are used in fields like agriculture, hydrology, and climate sciences. Several studies explore the use of soil moisture data for hydrological application such as runoff prediction.

TI  - Heating rate profiles and radiative forcing due to a dust storm in the Western Mediterranean using satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze the vertically-resolved radiative impact due to a dust storm in the Western Mediterranean. The dust plume travels around 3-5 km altitude and the aerosol optical depth derived by MODIS at 550 nm ranges from 0.33 to 0.52 at the overpass time (13:05 UT). The aerosol radiative forcing (ARF), forcing efficiency (FE) and heating rate profile (AHR) are determined throughout the dust trajectory in shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) ranges. To do this, we integrate different satellite observations (CALIPSO and MODIS) and detailed radiative transfer modeling. The combined (SW + LW) effect of the dust event induces a net cooling in the studied region. On average, the FE at 22.4 degrees solar zenith angle is -190.3 W m(-2) and -38.1 W m(-2), at surface and TOA, respectively. The corresponding LW/SW offset is 14% and 38% at surface and TOA, respectively. Our results at TOA are sensitive to the surface albedo in the SW and surface temperature in the LW. The absolute value of FE decrease (increase) in the SW (LW) with the surface albedo, resulting in an increasing LW/SW offset, up to 76%. The AHR profiles show a net warming within the dust layer, with a maximum value of 3.3 Kd(-1). The ARF, FE and AHR are also highly sensitive to the dust optical properties in SW and LW. We evaluate this sensitivity by comparing the results obtained using two set of dust properties as input in our simulations: a) the prescribed dust model by Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (OPAC) and; b) the dust optical properties derived from measurements of the size distribution and refractive index. Experimentally derived dust properties present larger SSA and asymmetry parameter in the SW than OPAC dust. Conversely, OPAC dust presents higher AOD in the LW range. These parameters drive the FE and AHR sensitivities in the SW and LW ranges, respectively. Therefore, when measured dust properties are used in our simulations: the ARF in the LW substantially reduces at surface and TOA (up to 57%); the absolute value of SW ARF is reduced by 15% at surface and an enhancement of 31% is observed at TOA; the AHR present less warming in the entire profile with deviations up to 53% within the dust layer, with respect to the results obtained using OPAC.

TI  - History, injury, and psychosocial risk factor commonalities among cases of fatal and near-fatal physical child abuse
T2  - CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
M3  - Article
AB  - Failure to recognize child maltreatment results in chronic exposure to high-risk environments where re-injury or death may occur. We analyzed a series (n = 20) of fatal (n = 10) and near fatal (n = 10) physical child abuse cases from the Commonwealth of Kentucky to identify commonalities and determine whether indicators of maltreatment were present prior to the child's fatal or near-fatal event. We conducted retrospective state record reviews involving children < 4 years of age classified as physical child abuse by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services during a 12 month period. Cases were distributed across 17 counties. IRS approvals were obtained. Three reviewers concurrently abstracted case data from medical, social, and legal documents, and descriptive statistics were analyzed. Median age of subjects was 7.5 months (range 1-32 months); 55% were male. Psychosocial risk factors (PRFs) were present in 100% of cases. Traumatic brain injury (95%) and bruising (90%) were the most common injuries. Of the 14 children with available prior medical records, 9 (64%) had sentinel injuries in the form of prior unexplained bruising; all nine suffered subsequent traumatic brain injury resulting in four deaths. A male was caring for the child at the time of the final event in 70% of cases. Our study identified key commonalities across cases of fatal and near-fatal abuse, highlighting the prevalence of psychosocial risk factors and the significance of prior unexplained bruising as a herald of escalating abuse. Further study is warranted to ascertain the predictive value of our findings in the larger population.

TI  - The net energy budget at the ocean-atmosphere interface of the "Cold Tongue" region
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pacific "Cold Tongue" (PCT) sea surface temperature (SST) experiences significant (>0.58 degrees C) interannual variations forced by the El-Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO) with global impacts on the Earth climate. In this study, we estimate the PCT net heat budget known to be difficult to derive using numerical models. The main goal is to determine how accurately the net heat flux across the surface/atmosphere interface can currently be determined primarily, from satellite observations; these are first evaluated against the nearest available observations inside and outside the PCT of the Tropical Pacific Ocean, using buoy arrays such as the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean/Triangle Trans-Ocean Buoy Network (TAO/TRITON). It was found that the satellite-based estimates of both turbulent and radiative fluxes are in better agreement with the observations than similar estimates from leading numerical models. The monthly mean satellite estimates of PCT SW down arrow during January/July 2009 were 273.07/170.14, for LW down arrow, latent heat and sensible heat they were 378.79/365.54, 95.52/130.31, 9.89/20.67, respectively (all in W/m(2)). The estimated standard deviations for PCT SW down arrow were in the range of 7.2-7.8% of the mean and in the range of 2.0-2.5% for LW down arrow, at daily time scale. Satellite estimates of both PCT LHF and SHF exhibit much higher variability, characterized by standard deviations of 50% from the mean values.

TI  - <i>Geodetic Slip Model of the 3 September 2016 M</i><sub>w</sub> <i>5.8 Pawnee</i>, <i>Oklahoma</i>, <i>Earthquake</i>: <i>Evidence for</i> <i>Fault</i>-<i>Zone Collapse</i>
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 3 September 2016 M-w 5.8 Pawnee earthquake in northern Oklahoma is the largest earthquake ever recorded in Oklahoma. The coseismic deformation was measured with both Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar and Global Positioning System (GPS), with measureable signals of order 1 cm and 1 mm, respectively. We derive a coseismic slip model from Sentinel-1A and Radarsat 2 interferograms and GPS static offsets, dominated by distributed left-lateral strike slip on a primary west-northwest-east-southeast-trending subvertical plane, whereas strike slip is concentrated near the hypocenter (5.6 km depth), with maximum slip of similar to 1 m located slightly east and down-dip of the hypocenter. Based on systematic misfits of observed interferogram line-of-sight (LoS) displacements, with LoS based on shear-dislocation models, a few decimeters of fault-zone collapse are inferred in the hypocentral region where coseismic slip was the largest. This may represent the postseismic migration of large volumes of fluid away from the high-slip areas, made possible by the creation of a temporary high-permeability damage zone around the fault.

TI  - Event-driven strain cycle monitoring of railway bridges using a wireless sensor network with sentinel nodes
T2  - STRUCTURAL CONTROL & HEALTH MONITORING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the increasing traffic volume on the European railway network, the remaining fatigue life of existing steel bridges is a major concern. Several investigations demonstrated that supplementing the assessment with monitoring data enables to achieve more reliable remaining fatigue life estimations. In this paper, an event-driven monitoring system based on a wireless sensor network that consists of two functionally different components was designed and tested. Sentinel nodes, which were mounted on the track, were used for detecting approaching trains and alerting with alarm messages the monitoring nodes. These nodes, which were mounted on the bridge, started strain sensing and data recording after receiving the alarm message and went back to a power saving mode upon completion. An embedded data processing algorithm transformed the recorded raw data into a much smaller data set representing strain cycles. A test deployment on a railway bridge demonstrated that train detection and alarming was fast and reliable. The combination of event-driven monitoring and embedded data processing allowed to extend the battery lifetime of monitoring nodes to several months.

TI  - Optimized Rule-Based Flood Mapping Technique Using Multitemporal RADARSAT-2 Images in the Tropical Region
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is one of the most common natural disasters in Malaysia. Preparing an accurate flood inventory map is the basic step in flood risk management. Flood detection is a complex process because of the limitation of methodological approaches and cloud coverage over tropical areas. An efficient approach is proposed to identify flooded areas using multitemporal RADARSAT-2 imageries. First, multispectral Landsat image was used to extract and subtract permanent water bodies, and this image was later utilized to extract the same information from multitemporal RADARSAT-2 imageries. Next, water bodies during a flood event were extracted from RADARSAT-2 images. Permanent water bodies, shadow, and paddy were detected from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images by analyzing their temporal backscattering values. During feature extraction, rule-based object-oriented technique was applied to classify both SAR and Landsat images. Image segmentation during object-based analysis was performed to distinguish the boundaries of various dimensions and scales of objects. Moreover, a Taguchi-based method was employed to optimize the segmentation parameters. After segmentation, the rules were defined and images were classified to produce an accurate flood inventory map for the 2014 Kelantan flood. A confusion matrix was generated to evaluate the performance of the classification method. The overall accuracy of 86.16% was achieved for RADARSAT-2 using rule-based classification and optimization technique. The resulting flood inventory map using the proposed approach supported the efficiency of the proposed methodology.

TI  - Cool island effect of urban parks and its influencing factors within the Fifth Ring in Beijing
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Parks play a vital part in mitigating the urban heat island. However, the cooling effect of parks and its relationship with the landscape composition have not been well studied so far. In this work, we retrieved the surface temperature in the parks and conducted the analysis of the relationship between the surface temperature and the landscape composition both inside and outside the parks, via buffer zone analysis method and regression method, using the land use data and Landsat 8 image data in 2013. Results showed that the surface temperature in the parks was 28.91 C, while the surface temperature within the Fifth Ring was 30.67 C. The parks in the northwestern and eastern parts had much lower surface temperature than those in the southern and southwestern parts. A negative relationship was found between the surface temperature and the percentage of water bodies in the parks, while a power relationship was found between the surface temperature and the percentage of impervious surface, in the parks. Among the landscape characteristics outside the parks, the percentage of the impervious surface, the patch density of both water bodies and impervious surface exerted great influences on the surface temperature inside parks. The percentage of the impervious surface had an influencing scope of 300 m, while the patch density of water bodies approximately 800 m, the significant (P<0.05) and extremely significant (P<0.01) scope were 500 m and 200 m. The results of stepwise regression showed that the landscape characteristics in the outer scope with a width of 200-400 m controlled the surface temperature in the parks, and the landscape composition within a width of 300 m exerted greater influences on the surface temperature in the parks. These findings can be applied into the park design and urban planning.

TI  - An Urban Heat Island Study of the Colombo Metropolitan Area, Sri Lanka, Based on Landsat Data (1997-2017)
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major impacts associated with unplanned rapid urban growth is the decrease of urban vegetation, which is often replaced with impervious surfaces such as buildings, parking lots, roads, and pavements. Consequently, as the percentage of impervious surfaces continues to increase at the expense of vegetation cover, surface urban heat island (SUHI) forms and becomes more intense. The Colombo Metropolitan Area (CMA), Sri Lanka, is one of the rapidly urbanizing metropolitan regions in South Asia. In this study, we examined the spatiotemporal variations of land surface temperature (LST) in the CMA in the context of the SUHI phenomenon using Landsat data. More specifically, we examined the relationship of LST with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) at three time points (1997, 2007 and 2017). In addition, we also identified environmentally critical areas based on LST and NDVI. We found significant correlations of LST with NDVI (negative) and NDBI (positive) (p < 0.001) across all three time points. Most of the environmentally critical areas are located in the central business district (CBD), near the harbor, across the coastal belt, and along the main transportation network. We recommend that those identified environmentally critical areas be considered in the future urban planning and landscape development of the city. Green spaces can help improve the environmental sustainability of the CMA.

TI  - Proxies for soil organic carbon derived from remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The possibility of carbon storage in soils is of interest because compared to vegetation it contains more carbon. Estimation of soil carbon through remote sensing based techniques can be a cost effective approach, but is limited by available methods. This study aims to develop a model based on remotely sensed variables (elevation, forest type and above ground biomass) to estimate soil carbon stocks. Field observations on soil organic carbon, species composition, and above ground biomass were recorded in the subtropical forest of Chitwan, Nepal. These variables were also estimated using LiDAR data and a WorldView 2 image. Above ground biomass was estimated from the LiDAR image using a novel approach where the image was segmented to identify individual trees, and for these trees estimates of DBH and Height were made. Based on AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) a regression model with above ground biomass derived from LiDAR data, and forest type derived from WorldView 2 imagery was selected to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. The selected model had a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.69. This shows the scope of estimating SOC with remote sensing derived variables in sub-tropical forests. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Hyperspectral and LiDAR Fusion Using Extinction Profiles and Total Variation Component Analysis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification accuracy of remote sensing data can be increased by integrating ancillary data provided by multisource acquisition of the same scene. We propose to merge the spectral and spatial content of hyperspectral images (HSIs) with elevation information from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements. In this paper, we propose to fuse the data sets using orthogonal total variation component analysis (OTVCA). Extinction profiles are used to automatically extract spatial and elevation information from HSI and rasterized LiDAR features. The extracted spatial and elevation information is then fused with spectral information using the OTVCA-based feature fusion method to produce the final classification map. The extracted features have high dimension, and therefore OTVCA estimates the fused features in a lower dimensional space. OTVCA also promotes piece-wise smoothness while maintaining the spatial structures. Both attributes are important to provide homogeneous regions in the final classification maps. We benchmark the proposed approach (OTVCA-fusion) with an urban data set captured over an urban area in Houston/USA and a rural region acquired in Trento/Italy. In the experiments, OTVCA-fusion is evaluated using random forest and support vector machine classifiers. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of OTVCA-fusion to produce accurate classification maps while using fewer features compared with other approaches investigated in this paper.

TI  - Change Detection in Polarimetric SAR Images Using a Geodesic Distance Between Scattering Mechanisms
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel technique to generate the difference image (DI) in change detection analysis for polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data is proposed. Unlike the standard methods, viz., band difference or intensity/amplitude ratioing, the proposed technique utilizes the full vector nature of multitemporal PolSAR data. In this data, a pixel is characterized by a 4 x 4 Kennaugh matrix. The geodesic distance (GD) on an unit sphere is utilized to define the distance between the Kennaugh matrices of the three elementary targets (trihedral, dihedral, and 45 degrees rotated dihedral about the radar line of sight) producing canonical scattering mechanisms and the observed Kennaugh matrix. Three absolute differences of the GD from respective elementary targets are obtained for time instants t(1) and t(2). The DI is then the maximum among the three quantities. The proposed technique is applied to two scenes obtained from the L-band UAVSAR data characterizing changes due to urbanization. The principal component analysis with k-means clustering proposed by Celik is used to obtain the binary change map. The proposed differencing method performs better than the single-channel intensity band ratio and the total power ratio for time instants t(1) and t(2). The detection rate with the proposed technique is 6% and 20% better than the ratio methods for the two data sets, respectively, with the higher kappa value as a measure of performance evaluation.

TI  - Remote sensing for restoration ecology: Application for restoring degraded, damaged, transformed, or destroyed ecosystems
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration monitoring is generally perceived as costly and time consuming, given the assumptions of successfully restoring ecological functions and services of a particular ecosystem or habitat. Opportunities exist for remote sensing to bolster the restoration science associated with a wide variety of injured resources, including resources affected by fire, hydropower operations, chemical releases, and oil spills, among others. In the last decade, the role of remote sensing to support restoration monitoring has increased, in part due to the advent of high-resolution satellite sensors as well as other sensor technology, such as lidar. Restoration practitioners in federal agencies require monitoring standards to assess restoration performance of injured resources. This review attempts to address a technical need and provides an introductory overview of spatial data and restoration metric considerations, as well as an in-depth review of optical (e.g., spaceborne, airborne, unmanned aerial vehicles) and active (e.g., radar, lidar) sensors and examples of restoration metrics that can be measured with remotely sensed data (e.g., land cover, species or habitat type, change detection, quality, degradation, diversity, and pressures or threats). To that end, the present article helps restoration practitioners assemble information not only about essential restoration metrics but also about the evolving technological approaches that can be used to best assess them. Given the need for monitoring standards to assess restoration success of injured resources, a universal monitoring framework should include a range of remote sensing options with which to measure common restoration metrics.

TI  - Estimation of SOS and EOS for Midwestern US Corn and Soybean Crops
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding crop phenology is fundamental to agricultural production, management, planning, and decision-making. This study used 250 m 16-day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time-series data to detect crop phenology across the Midwestern United States, 2007-2015. Key crop phenology metrics, start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS), were estimated for corn and soybean. For such a large study region, we found that MODIS-estimated SOS and EOS values were highly dependent on the nature of input time-series data, analytical methods, and threshold values chosen for crop phenology detection. With the entire sequence of MODIS EVI time-series data as input, SOS values were inconsistent compared to crop emergent dates from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress Reports (CPR). However, when we removed winter EVI images from the time-series data to reduce impacts of snow cover, we obtained much more consistent SOS estimation. Various threshold values (10 to 50% of seasonal EVI amplitude) were applied to derive SOS values. For both corn's and soybean's SOS estimation, a threshold value of 25% generated the best overall agreement with the CPR crop emergent dates. Root-mean-square error (RMSE) values were 4.81 and 5.30 days for corn and soybean, respectively. For corn's EOS estimation, a threshold value of 40% led to a high R-2 value of 0.82 and RMSE value of 5.16 days. We further examined spatial patterns of SOS and EOS for both crops-SOS for corn displayed a clear south-north gradient; the southern portion of the Midwest US has earlier SOS and EOS dates.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction/Objective In August 2010, World Health Organization declared the beginning of the post-pandemic phase of influenza surveillance.The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological and virological characteristics of influenza and correlation between the influenza occurrence and weather conditions.Methods We used surveillance reports of influenza and laboratory data from October 2010 to May 2015. Data for the analysis were collected through sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI), severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), acute respiratory distress syndrome, and by virological surveillance. The nasal and throat swabs from all influenza cases were performed by the PCR laboratory method.Results During the observed period, the highest rates of ILI were registered during the 2010/11 and 2012/13 seasons, with influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 and influenza B being predominant, respectively. The highest weekly age-specific rates of ILI were registered in school-age children (ages 5-14). Out of 1,466 samples collected, 720 (49.1%) were laboratory confirmed as influenza, and influenza A virus was more frequently detected than influenza B. Among confirmed cases of influenza, participation of patients with SARI or ILI was nearly equal (46% vs. 44.1%). There was a weak correlation observed between the decrease in temperature and rainfall and the increase in influenza detection (p = -0.04214 vs. p = -0.01545, respectively, p > 0.05).Conclusion There is a need for continuous surveillance in order to predict seasonal trends and prepare for a timely response to influenza outbreak.

Bootstrap method with median values was applied on the spatial resampling step and showed to be efficient to eliminate extreme sigma(0) values from double bounce by targets on the water, which are undesirable for wind estimation, without the need of postprocess to exclude outliers. An empirical CMOD-IFR2 model was used with wind direction information to initialize the model obtained from QuikSCAT scatterometer. The estimated values were compared with measurements from four anemometers. Modeled wind fields were resampled at the same QuikSCAT spatial resolution with the bootstrap method, and correlation coefficients were found to be greater than 0.75 for all ScanSAR narrow images. The initial spatial resolution probably plays an important issue on the results, as the correlation coefficients for all wide images were almost zero. This hypothesis must be further investigated.

TI  - Accuracy Improvements in the Orientation of ALOS PRISM Images Using IOP Estimation and UCL Kepler Platform Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a study that was conducted to determine the orientation of ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) PRISM (Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping) triplet images, considering the estimation of interior orientation parameters (IOP) of the cameras and using the collinearity equations with the UCL (University College of London) Kepler platform model, which was adapted to use coordinates referenced to the Terrestrial Reference System ITRF97. The results of the experiments showed that the accuracies of 3D coordinates calculated using 3D photogrammetric intersection increased when the IOP were also estimated. The vertical accuracy was significantly better than the horizontal accuracy. The usability of the estimated IOP was tested to perform the bundle block adjustments of another neighbouring PRISM image triplet. The results in terms of 3D photogrammetric intersection were satisfactory and were close to those obtained in the IOP estimation experiment.

TI  - Conceptual models for surface water and groundwater interactions at pond and plug restored meadows
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The pond and plug meadow restoration method, used for incised meadows in the Sierra Nevada Range, takes available alluvium on site to dam the incised channel in several places. Groundwater storage gained from restoration may alter flow paths and surface water availability. Water flowing through the meadow is elevated, usually to an alternate channel, and slowed by floodplain spreading, meanders, and vegetation roughness. Each dam, or plug, creates a pond, filled as the water table rises closer to the meadow surface. Expanded riparian vegetation and slowed water movement increase evapotranspiration (ET) following restoration. Landsat derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) increased by 0.07 (p <0.001) on 30 of 31 meadows. Conceptually a meadow may act as (1) a sponge, storing abundant water from snowmelt or precipitation and releasing water in dry periods; (2) a valve, regulating water outflow from springs recharging the meadow, and/or (3) a drain, allowing water from the meadow to percolate into a regional aquifer. Areas in eight northern California meadows were classified into one or more of these conceptual models using ET, summer pond and groundwater elevations, stream gauges, and climate data. Evaporation from open pond water was 20% to 80% of their summer decline (-0.11 to 1.78 m [-0.36 to 5.84 ft]) and 1% to 7% of total meadow ET. Meadow ET estimates ranged from 0.32 to 0.40 m (1.05 to 1.31 ft). Water from springs captured by historic channel incision can be redirected from discharge to meadow restoration and ET. This study was conducted in a dry period and the data reflect effects of below average precipitation.

TI  - Global Multisensor Automated satellite-based Snow and Ice Mapping System (GMASI) for cryosphere monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synergy of satellite observations in the visible infrared and microwave spectral bands presents an attractive and powerful approach to improve monitoring of the Earth's snow and ice cover. This approach is implemented in the Global Multisensor Automated Snow and Ice Mapping System (GMASI) operated by NOAA NESDIS since 2006. Combined observations in the visible and infrared from the AVHRR sensor onboard METOP satellites and in the microwave spectral bands from SSMIS onboard DMSP satellites allows for providing spatially continuous characterization of the snow and ice distribution on a daily basis. The paper presents a basic description of techniques and algorithms implemented in the system and examines the system performance in the course of the last ten years. It is demonstrated that the GMASI product adequately reproduces spatial patterns of the snow and ice distribution and their seasonal variations. Validation of GMASI daily snow retrievals over the Northern Hemisphere has demonstrated their close correspondence to surface observations of the snow cover with the yearly mean rate of over 94%. Automated maps are found to agree even better to the daily snow and ice cover map produced interactively at NOAA. In this latter case the agreement rates on the snow cover and ice cover distribution amounted correspondingly to 96% and 98%. A larger part of mismatches was due to underestimated snow and ice extent in the automated maps as compared to in situ data and interactive analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing ecological performance thresholds in fire-prone Kakadu National Park, northern Australia
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary fire regimes are recognized as a key threatening process for relatively immobile vertebrates and narrowly dispersing obligate seeder plant taxa in fire-prone Australian savannas. Here, we assess the efficacy of proposed ecological performance threshold metrics for evaluating the current state of fire management for biodiversity conservation outcomes in Australia's premier, and best publicly funded savanna reserve, Kakadu National Park. The assessment draws on available data describing Landsat-scale fire mapping over the period 1997-2015, habitat mapping, and mostly modeled responses of vegetation and faunal attributes. Despite conceptual and technical issues associated with various proposed performance thresholds and mapping products, the assessment demonstrates significant challenges with the current state of the reserve's fire management program. For example, by the end of 2015 it was observed that just 6% of woodland habitat in lowland and 23% in upland situations had remained unburnt for longer than three years and 98% of mapped fires in lowland and 87% in upland habitats were >1 km(2) in extent. Of 14 assessed performance threshold metrics, two were within acceptable thresholds at the end of 2015, and none had improved materially over the decadal assessment period. Given substantial resources evidently required to deliver effective, seasonally intensive, fine-grained adaptive fire management for biodiversity conservation outcomes in fire-prone Australian savannas, we suggest that alternative resourcing opportunities through market-based savanna burning greenhouse gas emissions abatement projects need to be explored.

TI  - Investigating the role of SPECT/CT in dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy for penile cancers
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, most centres use 2-D planar lymphoscintigraphy when performing dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy in penile cancer patients with clinically impalpable inguinal nodes. This study aimed to investigate the role of SPECT/CT following 2-D planar lymphoscintigraphy (dynamic and static) in the detection and localization of sentinel lymph nodes in the groin.A qualitative (visual) review was performed on planar followed by SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy in 115 consecutive patients (age 28-86 years) who underwent injection of Tc-99m-nanocolloid followed by immediate acquisition of dynamic (20 min) and early static scans (5 min) initially and further delayed static (5 min) images at 120 min followed by SPECT/CT imaging. The lymph nodes detected in each groin on planar lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT were compared.A total of 440 and 467 nodes were identified on planar scintigraphy and SPECT/CT, respectively. Overall, SPECT/CT confirmed the findings of planar imaging in 28/115 cases (24%). In the remaining 87 cases (76%), gross discrepancies were observed between planar and SPECT/CT images. SPECT/CT identified 17 instances of skin contamination (16 patients, 13%) and 36 instances of in-transit lymphatic tract activity (24 patients, 20%) that had been interpreted as tracer-avid lymph nodes on planar imaging. In addition, SPECT/CT identified 53 tracer-avid nodes in 48 patients (42%) that were not visualized on planar imaging and led to reclassification of the drainage basins (pelvic/inguinal) of 27 tracer-avid nodes.The addition of SPECT/CT improved the rate of detection of true tracer-avid lymph nodes and delineated their precise (3-D) anatomic localization in drainage basins.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of artemether lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria at sentinel sites in Mozambique, 2015
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to anti-malarial drugs continues to challenge malaria control. We assessed the therapeutic efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL), the first-line treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, in children under five years of age in Mozambique. We conducted a prospective one-arm study to evaluate the clinical and parasitological efficacy of AL over 28 days at four sentinel sites, using the WHO protocol for assessing the efficacy of antimalarial treatment. mspl, msp2 and glurp genes were analysed by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to differentiate recrudescence from re-infection with malaria parasites. Haemoglobin concentration was recorded at baseline and on days 7, 14 and 28. A total of 349 children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were recruited at the four sentinel sites. Adequate clinical and parasitological response to AL on day 28 follow-up varied from 96.3% to 100% after correction by PCR. The drug was well tolerated, and no adverse event related to the drug was reported. AL, the current first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Mozambique, remains highly efficacious at the study sites. Monitoring of the efficacy of the recommended antimalarial drugs should be continued in order to detect any emerging threat to their efficacy.

TI  - Mass Processing of Sentinel-1 Images for Maritime Surveillance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The free, full and open data policy of the EU's Copernicus programme has vastly increased the amount of remotely sensed data available to both operational and research activities. However, this huge amount of data calls for new ways of accessing and processing such "big data". This paper focuses on the use of Copernicus's Sentinel-1 radar satellite for maritime surveillance. It presents a study in which ship positions have been automatically extracted from more than 11,500 Sentinel-1A images collected over the Mediterranean Sea, and compared with ship position reports from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). These images account for almost all the Sentinel-1A acquisitions taken over the area during the two-year period from the start of the operational phase in October 2014 until September 2016. A number of tools and platforms developed at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) that have been used in the study are described in the paper. They are: (1) Search for Unidentified Maritime Objects (SUMO), a tool for ship detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images; (2) the JRC Earth Observation Data and Processing Platform (JEODPP), a platform for efficient storage and processing of large amounts of satellite images; and (3) Blue Hub, a maritime surveillance GIS and data fusion platform. The paper presents the methodology and results of the study, giving insights into the new maritime surveillance knowledge that can be gained by analysing such a large dataset, and the lessons learnt in terms of handling and processing the big dataset.

TI  - Estimation of methane emission from rice paddy soils in Japan using the diagnostic ecosystem model
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is needed to accurately evaluate the methane emission from paddy fields at a national scale for both scientific and political purposes. The existing approaches have shared a common issue with obtaining the realistic information on spatiotemporal variations of crop management. Satellite sensor could possibly detect them, but the methodology to link the satellite observations to the methane emission has not been established. In this study, we enhanced the existing diagnostic satellite-driven paddy ecosystem model, the Biosphere model integrating Eco-physiological And Mechanistic approaches using satellite data for regional Cropland (BEAMS-C) (Sasai et al., 2012), by integrating the methane processes and examined the potential of this approach by comparing the estimated nation-wide methane emission with that by the existing approaches. The carbon flux estimations-had good agreements with the measurements at the Mase paddy flux site. In regional-scaleanalyses in Japan, methane emission averaged from 2001 to 2010 was 15.0 gC m(-2) year (-1), which was similar to the Tire-1 and -2 results. If we have a continuing improvement of the diagnostic approach, it could be one of the most efficient tools for estimating the methane flux at national scales.

AB  - Male mammary Paget's disease (MPD) is extremely rare. Furthermore, MPD with invasion downward into the dermis of the male nipple has been reported rarely. A 56-year-old Japanese man presented with a lump and eczema in the right nipple-areola area. Ultrasonography revealed only a cystic lesion below the right areola. With a diagnosis of MPD with invasion into the dermis associated with ductal carcinoma in situ, mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. MPD with dermal invasion is extremely rare, and only one male case has been reported in the English literature; therefore, the current case is the second case of male MPD with dermal invasion.

TI  - AROSICS: An Automated and Robust Open-Source Image Co-Registration Software for Multi-Sensor Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial co-registration is a mandatory prerequisite when dealing with remote sensing data. Inter-or intra-sensoral misregistration will negatively affect any subsequent image analysis, specifically when processing multi-sensoral or multi-temporal data. In recent decades, many algorithms have been developed to enable manual, semi-or fully automatic displacement correction. Especially in the context of big data processing and the development of automated processing chains that aim to be applicable to different remote sensing systems, there is a strong need for efficient, accurate and generally usable co-registration. Here, we present AROSICS (Automated and Robust Open-Source Image Co-Registration Software), a Python-based open-source software including an easy-to-use user interface for automatic detection and correction of sub-pixel misalignments between various remote sensing datasets. It is independent of spatial or spectral characteristics and robust against high degrees of cloud coverage and spectral and temporal land cover dynamics. The co-registration is based on phase correlation for sub-pixel shift estimation in the frequency domain utilizing the Fourier shift theorem in a moving-window manner. A dense grid of spatial shift vectors can be created and automatically filtered by combining various validation and quality estimation metrics. Additionally, the software supports the masking of, e.g., clouds and cloud shadows to exclude such areas from spatial shift detection. The software has been tested on more than 9000 satellite images acquired by different sensors. The results are evaluated exemplarily for two inter-sensoral and two intra-sensoral use cases and show registration results in the sub-pixel range with root mean square error fits around 0.3 pixels and better.

TI  - Survival of Patients with Serous Uterine Carcinoma Undergoing Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with serous uterine carcinoma undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping compared with patients undergoing standard lymphadenectomy.We retrospectively reviewed all uterine cancer patients treated at our institution from 2005 to 2015. Patients were separated into two cohorts: those who underwent SLN mapping at the time of staging (SLN) and those who underwent routine lymphadenectomy (the non-SLN group). SLN mapping was performed according to institutional protocol, incorporating a surgical algorithm and pathologic ultrastaging.Overall, 248 patients were identified-153 SLN mappings and 95 routine lymphadenectomies (pelvic and/or paraaortic lymph node dissection). No significant difference in age or body mass index was observed between the groups (p = 0.08 and p = 0.9, respectively). Minimally invasive surgery was utilized in 117/153 (77%) SLN patients and 30/95 (32%) non-SLN patients (p = < 0.001). Stage distribution for the SLN and non-SLN cohorts demonstrated 106/153 (69%) and 59/95 (62%) patients with stage I/II disease, respectively, and 47/153 (31%) and 36/95 (38%) patients with stage III/IV disease, respectively (p = 0.3). The median number of nodes removed was 12 (range, 1-50) in the SLN cohort versus 21 (range, 1-75) in the non-SLN cohort (p = < 0.001). Adjuvant chemotherapy alone or with radiation therapy was administered in 122/153 (80%) SLN patients and 79/95 (83%) non-SLN patients; radiotherapy alone was administered in 12/153 (8%) SLN patients and 7/95 (7%) non-SLN patients (p = 0.8). At a median follow-up of 40 months, the 2-year PFS rates were 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68-83%) in the SLN group and 71% (95% CI, 61-79%) in the non-SLN group (p = 0.3).Incorporation of the SLN mapping algorithm into the staging of uterine serous cancer is feasible and does not appear to compromise prognosis. PFS in patients with uterine serous carcinoma undergoing SLN mapping, followed by adjuvant therapy, was similar to PFS in patients undergoing standard lymphadenectomy and adjuvant therapy.

TI  - MODIS - A microscopic traffic model for evaluating Shared Space designed traffic areas
T2  - BAUINGENIEUR
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past years, many cities across Europe have been carrying out policies to promote pedestrian and cyclist movement in the city centers by redesigning the urban road environment. One of these solutions are Shared Space streets, which entail integrating different traffic modes on a single shared surface with no level difference between the vehicular area and the pedestrian one. This type of design is particularly suitable when social and economic activities are present at the edge of the road. This acts like an attractor for pedestrians, who can enjoy the public space, and as a psychological incentive for motorists to drive slowly and prudently because of the presence of vulnerable users within the road. Currently, the design of Shared Space streets in Germany is supported by specific guidelines, but there are no available instruments to evaluate traffic quality and safety in the design phase. In this work, a new microscopic simulation model capable of simulating the movement of road users in Shared Space streets is presented. The proposed approach is based on the Social Force Model and consists of three levels of interactions, namely free flow, long range- and short range collision avoidance. Further, a methodology to evaluate the traffic performance is provided and tested in a real Shared Space street in Hamburg.

TI  - TVDI spatiotemporal pattern of a soybean growing area in humid subtropical climate
T2  - BRAGANTIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The most southern Brazilian state, Rio Grande do Sul, is characterized by high crop yield and is, currently, the third leading soybean producer in the country. Therefore, agriculture is very important to the economy of the region. Because agriculture is highly dependent on variable weather parameters, the present study aimed to test the Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) as a regional indicator of water status under the climate and soybean crop management conditions that predominate in northwestern Rio Grande do Sul. For this, soybean crop seasons with contrasting yields were selected: 2004-2005 (yield 0.5 t.ha(-1))and 2009-2010 (2.7 t.ha(-1)). TVDI was obtained from the surface temperature (T-S) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images available from MODIS products, which were correlated to obtain a triangular scatter plot. Rainfall data from surface weather stations were also used. The results showed that the pattern of the TVDI is associated with rainfall variability. However, as the TVDI is based on normalization of the wet and dry edges of each image individually, the comparison of TVDI values across different images is challenging. This deficiency can be mitigated by analysis of the parameters used to derive the index. Therefore, both the TVDI and the "b" and T-Smin parameters used to derive it can elucidate the patterns of crop response to water availability.

TI  - Multi-Temporal X-Band Radar Interferometry Using Corner Reflectors: Application and Validation at the Corvara Landslide (Dolomites, Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - From the wide range of methods available to landslide researchers and practitioners for monitoring ground displacements, remote sensing techniques have increased in popularity. Radar interferometry methods with their ability to record movements in the order of millimeters have been more frequently applied in recent years. Multi-temporal interferometry can assist in monitoring landslides on the regional and slope scale and thereby assist in assessing related hazards and risks. Our study focuses on the Corvara landslides in the Italian Alps, a complex earthflow with spatially varying displacement patterns. We used radar imagery provided by the COSMO-SkyMed constellation and carried out a validation of the derived time-series data with differential GPS data. Movement rates were assessed using the Permanent Scatterers based Multi-Temporal Interferometry applied to 16 artificial Corner Reflectors installed on the source, track and accumulation zones of the landslide. The overall movement trends were well covered by Permanent Scatterers based Multi-Temporal Interferometry, however, fast acceleration phases and movements along the satellite track could not be assessed with adequate accuracy due to intrinsic limitations of the technique. Overall, despite the intrinsic limitations, Multi-Temporal Interferometry proved to be a promising method to monitor landslides characterized by a linear and relatively slow movement rates.

AB  - Shallow trade wind clouds pose one of the largest uncertainties in climate models. Due to the difficulties in assessing these clouds with routine observations the next-generation aircraft remote-sensing for validation campaign with the German High Altitude and LOng range research aircraft (HALO) took place in December 2013. Here we take advantage of the synergy of the HALO active and passive microwave package as well as spectrally resolved solar radiation (SR) measured by HALO-SR to characterize shallow clouds in the Caribbean. Based on a cloud mask developed from HALO-SR, about 12 000 cloudy profiles within similar to 4100 individual clouds could be detected with about 70% of them having a length of less than 2 km. Corresponding measurements with passive microwave measurements reveal that these small clouds also contain little water with 36% of the clouds showing a liquid water path (LWP) of less than 50 g . m(-2). We show that these small and thin clouds are difficult to characterize with satellite observations by the special sensor microwave imager/sounder due to its coarse resolution. Moderate imaging spectroradiometer measurements are able to identify the smaller clouds but suffer in terms of LWP when clouds start precipitating, which is the case for about 7% of the clouds as detected by the airborne 35 GHz radar.

TI  - Evidence for Submarine Groundwater Discharge into the Black Sea-Investigation of Two Dissimilar Geographical Settings
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainable management of coastal marine environments requires a comprehensive understanding of the processes related to material transport from land to coastal sea. Besides surface water discharge (e.g., rivers and storm drains), submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) plays a key role since it provides a major pathway for solute and particulate transport of contaminants and nutrients, both having considerable potential to cause deterioration of the overall ecological status of coastal environments. The aim of the presented study was the investigation of SGD in two exemplary and dissimilar areas at the Black Sea coast, one in the west (Romania) and one in the east (Georgia). The approach included the assessment of the geological/geographical setting regarding the potential of SGD occurrence, the use of environmental tracer data (Rn-222, delta O-18, delta H-2, salinity), and the evaluation of sea surface temperature patterns near the coastline using satellite data. Besides the individual site specific results, the study revealed that a combined evaluation of tracer data and satellite based information allows SGD localization with satisfying precision. A downscaling approach starting with large scale satellite data is generally recommended, continuing with medium scale tracer patterns and ending with local spot sampling.

TI  - Ethnic, socio-demographic and socio-economic differences in surgical treatment of breast cancer in New Zealand
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Indigenous Maori are known to experience inferior quality cancer care compared with non-Indigenous Europeans in New Zealand. However, limited data are available on ethnic/socio-economic differences in surgical treatment of breast cancer, or reasons for such variations within the local context. We investigated ethnic/socio-economic differences in rates of mastectomy, sentinel node biopsy (SNB), post-mastectomy breast reconstruction and definitive local therapy for breast cancer in New Zealand.Methods: A retrospective review of prospective data in the Waikato Breast Cancer Register for women diagnosed during 1999-2012 was performed. Differences in rates of mastectomy (for stage I/II, T1/T2 cancers), SNB (for stage I/II, T1/T2, cN0 cancers), post-mastectomy breast reconstruction (for non-metastatic cancers in women < 70 years) and definitive local therapy (for stage I/II cancers) were analysed in univariate and multivariate regression models, adjusting for covariates.Results: Significantly lower mastectomy and higher reconstruction rates were associated with younger age, private compared with public hospital care and screen compared with non-screen detection. Compared with NZ Europeans, Maori (41% versus 33%, P = 0.025) were significantly more likely to undergo mastectomy for cancers, which were potentially amenable for breast conserving surgery, but were significantly less likely to undergo post-mastectomy breast reconstruction (12% versus 35%, P < 0.001). No significant ethnic or socio-economic differences were observed in rates of SNB or definitive local therapy.Conclusions: This study has demonstrated lower rates of breast conserving surgery and reconstructions in Maori compared with NZ European women, and highlight the need for future research to focus on understanding the reasons behind these findings.

TI  - Total Discharge Estimation in the Korean Peninsula Using Multi-Satellite Products
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of total discharge is necessary to understand the hydrological cycle and to manage water resources efficiently. However, the task is problematic in an area where ground observations are limited. The North Korea region is one example. Here, the total discharge was estimated based on the water balance using multiple satellite products. They are the terrestrial water storage changes (TWSC) derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and evapotranspiration from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The satellite-based discharge was compared with land surface model products of the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and a positive relationship between the results was obtained (r = 0.70-0.86; bias = 9.08-16.99 mm/month; RMSE = 36.90-62.56 mm/month; NSE = 0.01-0.62). Among the four land surface models of GLDAS (CLM, Mosaic, Noah, and VIC), CLM corresponded best with the satellite-based discharge, satellite-based discharge has a tendency to slightly overestimate compared to model-based discharge (CLM, Mosaic, Noah, and VIC) in the dry season. Also, the total discharge data based on the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) and the in situ discharge for major five river basins in South Korea show comparable seasonality and high correlation with the satellite-based discharge. In spite of the relatively low spatial resolution of GRACE, and loss of information incurred during the process of integrating three different satellite products, the proposed methodology can be a practical tool to estimate the total discharge with reasonable accuracy, especially in a region with scarce hydrologic data.

TI  - Reconstructing Historical Land Cover Type and Complexity by Synergistic Use of Landsat Multispectral Scanner and CORONA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Survey data describing land cover information such as type and diversity over several decades are scarce. Therefore, our capacity to reconstruct historical land cover using field data and archived remotely sensed data over large areas and long periods of time is somewhat limited. This study explores the relationship between CORONA texture-a surrogate for actual land cover type and complexity-with spectral vegetation indices and texture variables derived from Landsat MSS under the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) such as to reconstruct historical continuous land cover type and complexity. Image texture of CORONA was calculated using a mean occurrence measure while image textures of Landsat MSS were calculated by occurrence and co-occurrence measures. The relationship between these variables was evaluated using correlation and regression techniques. The reconstruction procedure was undertaken through regression kriging. The results showed that, as expected, texture based on the visible bands and corresponding indices indicated larger correlation with CORONA texture, a surrogate of land cover (correlation > 0.65). In terms of prediction, the combination of the first-order mean of band green, second-order measure of tasseled cap brightness, second-order mean of Normalized Visible Index (NVI) and second-order entropy of NIR yielded the best model with respect to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), r-square, and variance inflation factors (VIF). The regression model was then used in regression kriging to map historical continuous land cover. The resultant maps indicated the type and degree of complexity in land cover. Moreover, the proposed methodology minimized the impacts of topographic shadow in the region. The performance of this approach was compared with two conventional classification methods: hard classifiers and continuous classifiers. In contrast to conventional techniques, the technique could clearly quantify land cover complexity and type. Future applications of CORONA datasets such as this one could include: improved quality of CORONA imagery, studies of the CORONA texture measures for extracting ecological parameters (e.g., species distributions), change detection and super resolution mapping using CORONA and Landsat MSS.

TI  - A Burned Area Mapping Algorithm for Chinese FengYun-3 MERSI Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning is a worldwide phenomenon, which emits large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and strongly influences the environment. Burned area is an important parameter in modeling the impacts of biomass burning on the climate and ecosystem. The Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) onboard FengYun-3C (FY-3C) has shown great potential for burned area mapping research, but there is still a lack of relevant studies and applications. This paper describes an automated burned area mapping algorithm that was developed using daily MERSI data. The algorithm employs time-series analysis and multi-temporal 1000-m resolution data to obtain seed pixels. To identify the burned pixels automatically, region growing and Support Vector Machine) methods have been used together with 250-m resolution data. The algorithm was tested by applying it in two experimental areas, and the accuracy of the results was evaluated by comparing them to reference burned area maps, which were interpreted manually using Landsat 8 OLI data and the MODIS MCD64A1 burned area product. The results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm was able to improve the burned area mapping accuracy at the two study sites.

TI  - An Empirical Algorithm for Wave Retrieval from Co-Polarization X-Band SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we proposed an empirical algorithm for significant wave height (SWH) retrieval from TerraSAR-X/TanDEM (TS-X/TD-X) X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) co-polarization (vertical-vertical (VV) and horizontal-horizontal (HH)) images. As the existing empirical algorithm at X-band, i.e., XWAVE, is applied for wave retrieval from HH-polarization TS-X/TD-X image, polarization ratio (PR) has to be used for inverting wind speed, which is treated as an input in XWAVE. Wind speed encounters saturation in tropical cyclone. In our work, wind speed is replaced by normalized radar cross section (NRCS) to avoiding using SAR-derived wind speed, which does not work in high winds, and the empirical algorithm can be conveniently implemented without converting NRCS in HH-polarization to NRCS in VV-polarization by using X-band PR. A total of 120 TS-X/TD-X images, 60 in VV-polarization and 60 in HH-polarization, with homogenous wave patterns, and the coincide significant wave height data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis field at a 0.125 degrees grid were collected as a dataset for tuning the algorithm. The range of SWH is from 0 to 7 m. We then applied the algorithm to 24 VV and 21 HH additional SAR images to extract SWH at locations of 30 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys. It is found that the algorithm performs well with a SWH stander deviation (STD) of about 0.5 m for both VV and HH polarization TS-X/TD-X images. For large wave validation (SWH 6-7 m), we applied the empirical algorithm to a tropical cyclone Sandy TD-X image acquired in 2012, and obtained good result with a SWH STD of 0.3 m. We concluded that the proposed empirical algorithm works for wave retrieval from TS-X/TD-X image in co-polarization without external sea surface wind information.

TI  - Expansion of Industrial Plantations Continues to Threaten Malayan Tiger Habitat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Southeast Asia has some of the highest deforestation rates globally, with Malaysia being identified as a deforestation hotspot. The Malayan tiger, a critically endangered subspecies of the tiger endemic to Peninsular Malaysia, is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. In this study, we estimate the natural forest loss and conversion to plantations in Peninsular Malaysia and specifically in its tiger habitat between 1988 and 2012 using the Landsat data archive. We estimate a total loss of 1.35 Mha of natural forest area within Peninsular Malaysia over the entire study period, with 0.83 Mha lost within the tiger habitat. Nearly half (48%) of the natural forest loss area represents conversion to tree plantations. The annual area of new plantation establishment from natural forest conversion increased from 20 thousand ha year 1 during 1988-2000 to 34 thousand ha year 1 during 2001-2012. Large-scale industrial plantations, primarily those of oil palm, as well as recently cleared land, constitute 80% of forest converted to plantations since 1988. We conclude that industrial plantation expansion has been a persistent threat to natural forests within the Malayan tiger habitat. Expanding oil palm plantations dominate forest conversions while those for rubber are an emerging threat.

TI  - Temporal comparison of global inventories of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from biomass burning during 2002-2011 derived from remotely sensed data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning is a large important source of greenhouse gases and atmospheric aerosols, and can contribute greatly to the temporal variations of CO2 emissions at regional and global scales. In this study, we compared four globally gridded CO2 emission inventories from biomass burning during the period of 2002-2011, highlighting the similarities and differences in seasonality and interannual variability of the CO2 emissions both at regional and global scales. The four datasets included Global Fire Emissions Database 4s with small fires (GFED4s), Global Fire Assimilation System 1.0 (GFAS1.0), Fire INventory from NCAR 1.0 (FINN1.0), and Global Inventory for Chemistry-Climate studies-GFED4s (G-G). The results showed that in general, the four inventories presented consistent temporal trend but with large differences as well. Globally, CO2 emissions of GFED4s, GFAS1.0, and G-G all peaked in August with the exception in FINN1.0, which recorded another peak in annual March. The interannual trend of all datasets displayed an overall decrease in CO2 emissions during 2002-2011, except for the inconsistent FINN1.0, which showed a tendency to increase during the considered period. Meanwhile, GFED4s and GFAS1.0 noted consistent agreement from 2002 to 2011 at both global (R (2) > 0.8) and continental levels (R (2) > 0.7). FINN1.0 was found to have the poorest temporal correlations with the other three inventories globally (R (2) < 0.6). The lower estimation in savanna CO2 emissions and higher calculation in cropland CO2 emissions by FINN1.0 from 2002 to 2011 was the primary reason for the temporal differences of the four inventories. Besides, the contributions of the three land covers (forest, savanna, and cropland) on CO2 emissions in each region varied greatly within the year (> 80%) but showed small variations through the years (< 40%).

TI  - The cooling effect of green infrastructure on surrounding built environments in a sub-tropical climate: a case study in Taipei metropolis
T2  - LANDSCAPE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Green infrastructure that provides cooling service is regarded as a critical urban planning strategy to mitigate urban heat. This study assesses important greenspace and matrix factors that contribute to greenspace cooling effect beyond greenspaces in Taipei metropolis using Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The results indicated that both greenspace and matrix features have jointly affected greenspace cooling intensity, but their cooling contributions to the mean temperature of greenspace and that of surrounding built environments were not necessarily identical or explicit. Larger greenspaces with compact/simple shape, containing more water elements and higher greenness tended to be cooler, whereas higher development intensity, lower tree proportion and fewer water elements in the matrix tended to produce warmer built environments. The influence of these features on temperature outside greenspaces varied by distance. With the distance increasing from greenspaces, the effect of greenspace features dropped and that of matrix features rose.

TI  - Spring migration of Brent Geese wintering in Japan extends into Russian high arctic
T2  - ORNITHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spring migration routes of the Brent Goose Branta bernicla nigricans wintering in Japan can extend beyond those of earlier-published trajectories from satellite data (Shimada et al. 2016). This conclusion is based on a ring recovered from a goose shot by a hunter, found south of the Lena Delta in the Russian high arctic. Building on the previously published satellite-tracking data from the same population, we suggest that the geese migrate northward in Russia following an interior route along the Lena and Yana rivers after arriving at the northern coast of the Sea of Okhotsk from Japan during spring migration.

TI  - Synergetic analysis of springtime air pollution episodes over Gwangju, Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of springtime aerosols, including their optical and microphysical properties, were analyzed for the months of March to May of 2009 in Gwangju (35.23 degrees N, 126.84 degrees E), Korea. A high Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)-derived aerosol depolarization ratio (6) of 0.25 +/- 0.04 was determined on dust particles during the observation period. The Angstrom exponent values of the 440-870 nm wavelength pair (angstrom(440-870)) and single-scattering albedo at 675 nm (0675) measured by a CIMEL sun/sky radiometer were 0.77 +/- 0.19 and 0.95 +/- 0.01, respectively. The elevated dust layers reached a maximum elevation of 4 km above sea level. Anthropogenic/smoke particles that originated from highly populated/industrialized regions could be distinguished by their relatively smaller particle size (angstrom(440-870) ranged between 1.33 and 1.36) and higher light -absorbing (Omega(675) of 0.92 +/- 0.01) characteristics. These aerosols are mostly distributed at altitudes <1.2 km. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between the aerosol optical depth (AOD, tau) derived from LIDAR (TuDAR) and from the tau(CIMEL) sun/sky radiometer (tau(CIMEL)) varied with respect to the surface PM10 concentration. The RMSD between tau(LIDAR) and tau(CIMEL) was as low as 13% under lower PM10 concentration levels (<100 Rg/m(3)). In contrast, the RMSD between tau(LIDAR) and tau(CIMEL) increased three times (similar to 31%) under high surface IDMio concentration levels (>100 g/m(3)). These results suggest that the accuracy of tau(LIDAR) is influenced by specific atmospheric conditions, regardless of its uncertainty.

TI  - Examining the strength of the newly-launched Sentinel 2 MSI sensor in detecting and discriminating subtle differences between C3 and C4 grass species
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - C3 and C4 grass species discrimination has increasingly become relevant in understanding their response to environmental changes and to monitor their integrity in providing goods and services. While remotely sensed data provide robust, cost-effective and repeatable monitoring tools for C3 and C4 grasses, this has been largely limited by the scarcity of sensors with better earth imaging characteristics. The recent launch of the advanced Sentinel 2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) presents a new prospect for discriminating C3 and C4 grasses. The present study tested the potential of Sentinel 2, characterized by refined spatial resolution and more unique spectral bands in discriminating between Festuca (C3) and Themeda (C4) grasses. To evaluate the performance of Sentinel 2 MSI; spectral bands, vegetation indices and spectral bands plus indices were used. Findings from Sentinel 2 were compared with those derived from the widely-used Worldview 2 commercial sensor and the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). Overall classification accuracies have shown that Sentinel 2 bands have potential (90.36%), than indices (85.54%) and combined variables (88.61%). The results were comparable to Worldview 2 sensor, which produced slightly higher accuracies using spectral bands (95.69%), indices (86.02%) and combined variables (87.09%), and better than Landsat 8 OLI spectral bands (75.26%), indices (82.79%) and combined variables (86.02%). Sentinel 2 bands produced lower errors of commission and omission (between 4.76 and 14.63%), comparable to Worldview 2 (between 1.96 and 7.14%), than Landsat 8 (between 18.18 and 30.61%), when classifying the two species. The classification accuracy from Sentinel 2 also did not differ significantly (z = 1.34) from Worldview 2, using standard bands; it was significantly (z > 1.96) different using indices and combined variables, whereas when compared to Landsat 8, Sentinel 2 accuracies were significantly different (z> 1.96) using all variables. These results demonstrated that key vegetation species discrimination could be improved by the use of the freely and improved Sentinel 2 MSI data.

TI  - Global Empirical Model of Critical Frequency of the Ionospheric <i>F</i>2-Layer for Quiet Geomagnetic Conditions
T2  - GEOMAGNETISM AND AERONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the foF2 database obtained from satellites and ground-based ionospheric stations, we have constructed a global empirical model of the critical frequency of the ionospheric F2-layer (SDMF2-Satellite and Digisonde Data Model of the F2 layer) for quiet geomagnetic conditions (Kp < 3). The input parameters of this model are the geographical coordinates, UT, day, month, year, and the integral index F10.7 (day, tau = 0.96) of solar activity for a given day. The SDMF2 model was based on the Legendre method for the spatial expansion of foF2 monthly medians to 12 in latitude and 8 in longitude of spherical harmonics. The resulting spatial coefficients have been expanded by the Fourier method in three spherical harmonics with respect to UT. The effect of the saturation of critical frequency of the ionospheric F2-layer at high solar activity was described in the SDMF2 model by foF2 as a logarithmic function of F10.7 (day, tau = 0.96). The difference between the SDMF2 and IRI models is a maximum at low solar activity as well as in the Southern Hemisphere and in the oceans. The testing on the basis of ground-based and satellite data has indicated that the SDMF2 model is more accurate than the IRI model.

TI  - Assessment and Improvement of MISR Angstrom Exponent and Single-Scattering Albedo Products Using AERONET Data in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the components, size, and absorbing/scattering properties of particle pollution is of great interest in the environmental and public health fields. Although the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) can detect a greater number of aerosol microphysical properties than most other spaceborne sensors, the Angstrom exponent (AE) and single-scattering albedo (SSA) products are not widely utilized or as robust as the aerosol optical depth (AOD) product. This study focused on validating MISR AE and SSA data using AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data for China from 2004 to 2014. The national mean value of the MISR data (1.08) was 0.095 lower than that of the AERONET data. However, the MISR SSA average (0.99) was significantly higher than that of AERONET (0.89). In this study, we developed a method to improve the AE and SSA by narrowing the selection of MISR mixtures via the introduction of the following group thresholds obtained from an 11-year AERONET dataset: minimum and maximum values (for the method of MISR_Imp_All) and the top 10% and bottom 10% of the averaged values (for MISR_Imp_10%). Overall, our improved AE values were closer to the AERONET AE values, and additional samples (MISR_Imp_All: 28.04% and 64.72%, MISR_Imp_10%: 34.11% and 73.13%) had absolute differences of less than 0.1 and 0.3 (defined by the expected error tests, e.g., EE_0.1) compared with the original MISR product (18.46% and 50.23%). For the SSA product, our method also improved the mean, EE_0.05, and EE_0.1 from 0.99, 16.13%, and 56.45% (MISR original product) to 0.96, 40.32%, and 70.97% (MISR_Imp_All), and 0.94, 54.84%, and 90.32% (MISR_Imp_10%), respectively.

TI  - Predicting Stem Total and Assortment Volumes in an Industrial <i>Pinus taeda</i> L. Forest Plantation Using Airborne Laser Scanning Data and Random Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Improvements in the management of pine plantations result in multiple industrial and environmental benefits. Remote sensing techniques can dramatically increase the efficiency of plantation management by reducing or replacing time-consuming field sampling. We tested the utility and accuracy of combining field and airborne lidar data with Random Forest, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to estimate stem total and assortment (commercial and pulpwood) volumes in an industrial Pinus taeda L. forest plantation in southern Brazil. Random Forest was populated using field and lidar-derived forest metrics from 50 sample plots with trees ranging from three to nine years old. We found that a model defined as a function of only two metrics (height of the top of the canopy and the skewness of the vertical distribution of lidar points) has a very strong and unbiased predictive power. We found that predictions of total, commercial, and pulp volume, respectively, showed an adjusted R2 equal to 0.98, 0.98 and 0.96, with unbiased predictions of 0.17%, 0.12% and 0.23%, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 7.83%, 7.71% and 8.63%. Our methodology makes use of commercially available airborne lidar and widely used mathematical tools to provide solutions for increasing the industry efficiency in monitoring and managing wood volume.

TI  - Remote sensing-based landscape indicators for the evaluation of threatened-bird habitats in a tropical forest
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Avian species persistence in a forest patch is strongly related to the degree of isolation and size of a forest patch and the vegetation structure within a patch and its matrix are important predictors of bird habitat suitability. A combination of space-borne optical (Landsat), ALOS-PALSAR (radar), and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data was used for assessing variation in forest structure across forest patches that had undergone different levels of forest degradation in a logged forest-agricultural landscape in Southern Laos. The efficacy of different remote sensing (RS) data sources in distinguishing forest patches that had different seizes, configurations, and vegetation structure was examined. These data were found to be sensitive to the varying levels of degradation of the different patch categories. Additionally, the role of local scale forest structure variables (characterized using the different RS data and patch area) and landscape variables (characterized by distance from different forest patches) in influencing habitat preferences of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red listed birds found in the study area was examined. A machine learning algorithm, MaxEnt, was used in conjunction with these data and field collected geographical locations of the avian species to identify the factors influencing habitat preference of the different bird species and their suitable habitats. Results show that distance from different forest patches played a more important role in influencing habitat suitability for the different avian species than local scale factors related to vegetation structure and health. In addition to distance from forest patches, LiDAR-derived forest structure and Landsat-derived spectral variables were important determinants of avian habitat preference. The models derived using MaxEnt were used to create an overall habitat suitability map (HSM) which mapped the most suitable habitat patches for sustaining all the avian species. This work also provides insight that retention of forest patches, including degraded and isolated forest patches in addition to large contiguous forest patches, can facilitate bird species retention within tropical agricultural landscapes. It also demonstrates the effective use of RS data in distinguishing between forests that have undergone varying levels of degradation and identifying the habitat preferences of different bird species. Practical conservation management planning endeavors can use such data for both landscape scale monitoring and habitat mapping.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the negative impact of urbanization over a time and its effect on increasing trend of temperature and degradation of urban ecology was assessed using the Landsat thermal data and field survey of Lucknow city, India. Land surface temperature (LST) estimation has been carried out using Mono-window algorithm, temporal land use change map, assessment of vegetation cover through Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and ecological evaluation of the city was carried out using the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI). Results indicated that the spatial distribution of the land surface temperature was affected by the land use-land cover change and anthropogenic causes. The mean land surface temperature difference between the years 2002 and 2014 was found is 0.75 degrees C. The observed results showed that the central portion of the city exhibited the highest surface temperature compared to the surrounding open area, the areas having dense built-up displayed higher temperatures and the areas covered by vegetation and water bodies exhibited lower temperatures. Strong correlation is observed between Land surface temperatures with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and UTFVI. The observed LST of the area also validated trough the Google Earth Images. Ecological evaluation of the area also showed that the city has worst ecological index in the highly urbanized area in the central portion of the city. The present study provides very scientific information on impact of urbanization and anthropogenic activities which cause major changes on eco-environment of the city. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Response of fuzzy clustering on different threshold determination algorithms in spectral change vector analysis over Western Himalaya, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection is a standard tool to extract and analyze the earth's surface features from remotely sensed data. Among the different change detection techniques, change vector analysis (CVA) have an exceptional advantage of discriminating change in terms of change magnitude and vector direction from multispectral bands. The estimation of precise threshold is one of the most crucial task in CVA to separate the change pixels from unchanged pixels because overall assessment of change detection method is highly dependent on selected threshold value. In recent years, integration of fuzzy clustering and remotely sensed data have become appropriate and realistic choice for change detection applications. The novelty of the proposed model lies within use of fuzzy maximum likelihood classification (FMLC) as fuzzy clustering in CVA. The FMLC based CVA is implemented using diverse threshold determination algorithms such as double-window flexible pace search (DFPS), interactive trial and error (T&E), and 3x3aEuro'pixel kernel window (PKW). Unlike existing CVA techniques, addition of fuzzy clustering in CVA permits each pixel to have multiple class categories and offers ease in threshold determination process. In present work, the comparative analysis has highlighted the performance of FMLC based CVA over improved SCVA both in terms of accuracy assessment and operational complexity. Among all the examined threshold searching algorithms, FMLC based CVA using DFPS algorithm is found to be the most efficient method.

TI  - Patterns of antimicrobial agent prescription in a sentinel population of canine and feline veterinary practices in the United Kingdom
T2  - VETERINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly important global health threat and the use of antimicrobial agents is a key risk factor in its development. This study describes antimicrobial agent prescription (AAP) patterns over a 2 year period using electronic health records (EHRs) from booked consultations in a network of 457 sentinel veterinary premises in the United Kingdom. A semi-automated classification methodology was used to map practitioner defined product codes in 918,333 EHRs from 413,870 dogs and 352,730 EHRs from 200,541 cats, including 289,789 AAPs. AAP as a proportion of total booked consultations was more frequent in dogs (18.8%, 95% confidence interval, CI, 18.2-19.4) than cats (17.5%, 95% CI 16.9-18.1). Prescription of topical antimicrobial agents was more frequent in dogs (7.4%, 95% CI 7.2-7.7) than cats (3.2%, 95% CI 3.1-3.3), whilst prescription of systemic antimicrobial agents was more frequent in cats (14.8%, 95% CI 14.2-15.4) than dogs (12.2%, 95% CI 11.7-12.7). A decreasing temporal pattern was identified for prescription of systemic antimicrobial agents in dogs and cats. Premises which prescribed antimicrobial agents frequently for dogs also prescribed frequently for cats. AAP was most frequent during pruritus consultations in dogs and trauma consultations in cats. Clavulanic acid potentiated amoxicillin was the most frequently prescribed antimicrobial agent in dogs (28.6% of prescriptions, 95% CI 27.4-29.8), whereas cefovecin, a third generation cephalosporin, was the most frequently prescribed antimicrobial agent in cats (36.2%, 95% CI 33.9-38.5). This study demonstrated patterns in AAP over time and for different conditions in a population of companion animals in the United Kingdom. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

CP  - 14th Specialist Meeting on Microwave Radiometry and Remote Sensing of the Environment (MicroRad)

AB  - This paper proposes an effective approach to improve the spatial resolution of FengYun-3 (FY-3) microwave radiation imager (MWRI) data via fusing with FY-3 medium-resolution imager (MERSI) data. Located onboard the same satellite FY-3, the complementary properties of MWRI and MERSI, such as cloud-penetrating ability and high spatial resolution, are explored to extend the applications of MWRI data to mesoscale or microscale. To this end, we make efforts to improve the spatial resolution of MWRI data by combining the spatial information and spectral information from MERSI and MWRI, respectively. The proposed fusion procedure includes two stages. In the first stage, the MERSI and MWRI images are jointly spectrally unmixed via learning a spectral dictionary pair, and then the spatial information from MERSI is transferred into MWRI by sparse coding, resulting in a spatial resolution enhanced MWRI image. In the second stage, the spectral information of the spatial resolution enhanced MWRI image is enhanced through guided filtering. To form a unified fusion framework for both the cloud-free and cloud-contaminated cases in MERSI images, we propose to leverage a learning-based single image super-resolution method in the cloud-contaminated case, which learns a spatial dictionary pair from the MWRI image pairs of low and high spatial resolutions obtained in the cloud-free case. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first fusion based one for spatial resolution enhancement of microwave radiometer images. Finally, to assess the performance of the proposed fusion framework, we choose three MERSI-MWRI image pairs to evaluate in both the cloud-free and cloud-contaminated cases. Both visual comparisons and quantitative evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion method in preserving the spatial information of MERSI and the spectral information of MWRI. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art method that does not resort to optical data, demonstrate the superiority of the pro-posed method with better overall measurements for experimental results.

TI  - An Adaptive Multilook Approach for Small Sets of Multitemporal SAR Data Based on Adaptive Joint Data Vector
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique is a potential tool for measuring digital elevation models and surface deformation. It has the advantage of high precision, competitive spatial resolution, and wide coverage. To improve the accuracy of the final results, some adaptive multilook strategies have been proposed in which the identification of statistically homogeneous pixels (SHPs) is the key task. However, these methods are not always reliable in the case of small data sets. To improve this reliability, SHPs are identified based on the adaptive joint data vector comprising of temporal sample and spatial information in this letter. Additionally, the formulation of adaptive joint data vector is combined with local spatial features of SAR images. The presented adaptive multilook approach can be used in many interferometric applications, such as InSAR data filtering and coherence estimation. Experiments on six TerraSAR-X stripmap images of Tianjin in China validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Increases in the Rate of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> Among Gay, Bisexual and Other Men Who Have Sex With Men-Findings From the Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Network 2010-2015
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Inequalities in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea) burden by sexual minority status in the United States are difficult to quantify. Sex of sex partner is not routinely collected for reported cases. Population estimates of men who have sex with men (MSM) necessary to calculate case rates have not been available until recently. For these reasons, trends in reported gonorrhea rates among MSM have not been described across multiple jurisdictions.Methods: We estimated of the number of MSM cases reported in 6 jurisdictions continuously participating in the STD Surveillance Network 2010-2015 based on interviews with a random sample of cases. Data were obtained for Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, San Francisco, California (excluding San Francisco), and Washington State. Estimates of the MSM, heterosexual male (MSW) and female populations were obtained from recently published estimates and census data. Case rates and rate-ratios were calculated comparing trends in reported cases among MSM, heterosexual males and women.Results: The proportion of male gonorrhea cases among MSM varied by jurisdiction (range: 20% to 98%). Estimated MSM rate increased from 1369 cases per 100,000 in 2010 to 3435 cases per 100,000 in 2015. Between 2010 and 2015, the MSM-to-Women gonorrhea rate ratio increased from 13: 1 to 24: 1, and the MSM-to-MSW gonorrhea rate ratio increased from 16: 1 to 31: 1.Conclusions: Estimated gonorrhea rate among MSM increased in a network of 6 geographically diverse US jurisdictions. Estimating the size of this population, determining MSM among reported cases and estimating rates are essential first steps for better understanding the changing epidemiology of gonorrhea.

TI  - ESTIMATION THE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION OF URBAN PARKS WITH FIELD BASED AND REMOTELY SENSED DATASETS
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate data and remote sensing images are used in this study to estimate the evapotranspiration of urban landscape vegetation. The study was conducted on a historic public park in Vrgac (Serbia), which is an important Serbian national heritage site. After comparing recordings from 14 weather stations in the region with recordings from the City Park, the weather station in Vrgac was chosen. The daily averaged values of climatic data for March, June, July and October of each year between 1949 and 2016, were used to compute the daily reference evapotranspiration ET] (mm/day), according to the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation. A landscape coefficient was estimated through field monitoring based on the Water Use Classification of Landscape Species (WUCOLS) principles. Also, thermal infrared images from Landsat 8 and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the QuickBird Satellite data are used as the remote sensing inputs to model daily evapotranspiration. This research explored the relationship between urban vegetation ET1 computed by the FAO-56 Penman Monteith method with the required meteorological data and by means of the remote sensing. The analysis revealed the significant correlation between the average daily evapotranspiration estimates from 0.98 to 0.99 by the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression and the weak Spearman's Rank correlation (p ranges from -0.006 to 0.384) leading to the conclusion that the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression is more suitable for evaluating urban landscape water requirements.

TI  - Economic benefit and ecological cost of enlarging tea cultivation in subtropical China: Characterizing the trade-off for policy implications
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cash crop expansion has become a global land use issue in recent decades. While the enlarging cash crop cultivation brings promising profitability, it can impair the delivery of various ecosystem services, with a risk of threat to sustainability and human well being. In order to make well-informed land use policy decisions, it requires elaborate efforts to characterize the trade-off between the benefit and cost of cash crop cultivation. This paper focuses on the enlarging tea cultivation in subtropical China, using a case of Anji County. We first monitor tea expansion from 1985 to 2016 based on time-series Landsat imageries, and then analyze the subsequent changes of water conservation service through an in-field survey of soil loss. Monetary approach is finally employed to evaluate the trade-off between economic benefit and ecological cost associated with the growing age of tea plantations. Results show that tea plantations expanded rapidly from 1985 to 2016 in Anji County. Delivery of water conservation service has been significantly impaired by the conversion from natural forests to tea plantations, but it can be gradually improved during the long rotational life cycles of tea plantations. For a given plot (1 ha at moderate slope), in theory, the economic benefit and ecological cost exhibit opposite trend associated the growing age of tea plantations, and an equilibrium point is approximately achieved at the 12-year growing age. In reality, ecological cost exceeds the economic benefit throughout the study period in Anji County. More specifically, the net difference increases from 11575 Yuan in 1985-1469167 Yuan in 2016. It denotes that economic benefit fails to compromise the ecological cost of the enlarging tea cultivation in Anji County. Conflicting land use policies (ecological conservation vs cash cropping promotion) and 'household contract responsibility' system should account for the unbalanced relationship between economic benefit and ecological conservation. We finally propose four major options towards the win-win possibilities between economic gain and ecological conservation associated with tea cultivation.

TI  - Investigating water use over the Choptank River Watershed using a multisatellite data fusion approach
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The health of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem has been declining for several decades due to high levels of nutrients and sediments largely tied to agricultural production systems. Therefore, monitoring of agricultural water use and hydrologic connections between crop lands and Bay tributaries has received increasing attention. Remote sensing retrievals of actual evapotranspiration (ET) can provide valuable information in support of these hydrologic modeling efforts, spatially and temporally describing consumptive water use by crops and natural vegetation and quantifying response to expansion of irrigated area occurring with Bay watershed. In this study, a multisensor satellite data fusion methodology, combined with a multiscale ET retrieval algorithm, was applied over the Choptank River watershed located within the Lower Chesapeake Bay region on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, USA to produce daily 30 m resolution ET maps. ET estimates directly retrieved on Landsat satellite overpass dates have high accuracy with relative error (RE) of 9%, as evaluated using flux tower measurements. The fused daily ET time series have reasonable errors of 18% at the daily time step - an improvement from 27% errors using standard Landsat-only interpolation techniques. Annual water consumption by different land cover types was assessed, showing reasonable distributions of water use with cover class. Seasonal patterns in modeled crop transpiration and soil evaporation for dominant crop types were analyzed, and agree well with crop phenology at field scale. Additionally, effects of irrigation occurring during a period of rainfall shortage were captured by the fusion program. These results suggest that the ET fusion system will have utility for water management at field and regional scales over the Eastern Shore. Further efforts are underway to integrate these detailed water use data sets into watershed-scale hydrologic models to improve assessments of water quality and inform best management practices to reduce nutrient and sediment loads to the Chesapeake Bay.

TI  - Determinants of HIV positivity among injecting drug users in Delhi and Punjab.
T2  - Indian journal of sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - CONTEXT: In India, the HIV positivity among injecting drug users (IDUs) stands at a staggering 7.71%. Among the states, HIV positivity among IDUs is highest in Punjab and Delhi, 21.2% and 18.3%, respectively. Interestingly, these two states are near to the "Golden Crescent."AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the similarities and differences between the IDUs in Punjab and Delhi, in the context of vulnerability to HIV.SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This study uses data from the HIV Sentinel Surveillance-2010-2011 (HSS). The HSS is a cross-sectional data collection process for HIV surveillance in India. HSS, apart from collecting the blood samples from the respondents, also collects basic sociodemographic as well as some information on the drug use patterns of the IDUs.DATA AND METHODS: The raw data from HSS 2010-2011 were used for this study. Bivariate and multivariate analyses performed to obtain the results.RESULTS: Descriptive analyses revealed that the IDUs of Punjab and Delhi are very different from each other. In Delhi, 62.4% of IDUs inject drugs for more than 5 years; whereas in Punjab, it was only 32.4%. Majority of the Delhi IDUs (86.5%) inject more than three times a week whereas the corresponding percentage in Punjab was only 29.5%. The profiles of the HIV positives also differ between these two states.CONCLUSIONS: It would be prudent to adopt state-specific strategies to prevent the spread of HIV among the IDUs.

TI  - Post-mastectomy radiation therapy in breast cancer with 1-3 involved lymph nodes: the Pros
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2014, the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) reported that post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) for breast cancer patients with 1-3 cancer-positive lymph nodes is associated with a survival benefit. However, it is not known whether this applies to Japanese patients in daily clinical practice, because this conclusion was based on the results of older, western trials. Therefore, we studied the differences between PMRT results in western breast cancer patients and current practice in Japanese patients. Although we identified three differences, they do not appear to strongly impact the results of EBCTCG. We conclude that Japanese breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes should receive PMRT in daily clinical practice.

TI  - Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection Using Attribute Profiles
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, anomaly detection has been an alluring topic in hyperspectral imagery. Despite most anomaly detection methods that focus on spectral information for detecting targets, this letter proposes a method in which both spectral and spatial information about the hyperspectral image (HSI) has been utilized for detecting anomalies. The differential attribute profile anomaly detection (DAPAD) method utilizes principal component analysis and DAP to extract spectral and spatial information from HSI, respectively. DAPs can model different kinds of structural information in a scene, which makes better extraction of spatial information. The proposed method is applied in experiments on Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment remote sensing data and the experimental results confirm the DAPAD method's superiority over five commonly used state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquakes are one of the most devastating types of natural disasters, and happen with little to no warning. This study combined Landsat-8 and interferometric ALOS-2 coherence data without training area techniques by classifying the remote sensing ratios of specific features for damage assessment. Waterbodies and highly vegetated areas were extracted by the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), respectively, from after-earthquake images in order to improve the accuracy of damage maps. Urban areas were classified from pre-event interferometric coherence data. The affected areas from the earthquake were detected with the normalized difference (ND) between the pre- and co-event interferometric coherence. The results presented three damage types; namely, damage to buildings caused by ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides. The overall accuracy (94%) of the confusion matrix was excellent. Results for urban areas were divided into three damage levels (e.g., none-slight, slight-heavy, heavy-destructive) at a high (90%) overall accuracy level. Moreover, data on buildings damaged by liquefaction and landslides were in good agreement with field survey information. Overall, this study illustrates an effective damage assessment mapping approach that can support post-earthquake management activities for future events, especially in areas where geographical data are sparse.

TI  - Is Sentinel Node Biopsy of the Internal Mammary Lymph Nodes Relevant in the Management of Breast Cancer?
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to review the outcomes of a series of breast cancer patients who underwent sentinel node biopsy inclusive of lymphoscintigraphy, and to assess the incidence of internal mammary node (IMN) metastatic positivity at exploration and whether these findings influenced treatment. Between April 2001 and December 2012, 581 breast cancer patients at Princess Alexandra Hospital underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy in the course of the performance of sentinel node biopsy. Analysis was performed of those patients who demonstrated radio-isotope uptake to the IMN chain, and who had sentinel node biopsy of the IMN's and were found to have metastatic involvement. Assessment was made to determine whether the finding of IMN metastases changed the adjuvant systemic management of these patients, and to review complication rates. 95 of 581 (16.4%) patients with preoperative breast lymphoscintigraphy had lymphatic mapping to the IMN chain. 51 (54%) of these patients had IMN chain surgically explored and IMN nodes were found in 35 of these patients (success rate of 69%). Of these, three patients (3/35 = 8.6%) had metastatic involvement of the IMN sentinel node group. All three IMN positive patients received adjuvant breast radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. In four patients (7.8%) IMN surgical exploration was complicated by pneumothorax. Only a small proportion of breast cancer patients were found to have metastasic involvement of the IMN chain and which did not significantly change their adjuvant therapy management. These findings suggest that the benefits of exploration of the IMN chain in breast cancer patients are limited and may be outweighed by the risk of complications.

TI  - Measuring morphological polycentricity - A comparative analysis of urban mass concentrations using remote sensing data
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Polycentricity belongs to the most versatile and fuzzy concepts in urban geography. It basically points to the existence of more than one center within a conurbation. Previous studies have mostly referred to the spatial distribution of employment density for (sub-) center identification. In contrast, our study draws on large area 3D building models derived from ubiquitous remote sensing data. We use stereoscopic Cartosat-1 digital surface models in combination with building footprints. These geoinformation reflect the spatial configuration of the built dimension and allow a physical approach to the concept of polycentricity. For (sub-) center identification we thoroughly analyze conceptually different kinds of threshold approaches (global, region-specific and distance-based) applied to concentrations of urban masses. After evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of the threshold approaches applied, we combine these methods to overcome their individual shortcomings. Last but not least, we establish a framework consisting of mapping techniques and site-and non-site specific statistics to evaluate polycentricity at fine-grained spatial intra-urban scale. In general we find that urban mass concentrations are a reasonable proxy for commonly used employment density data. We address the polycentricity issue across four German city regions Frankfurt, Cologne, Stuttgart and Munich and we find all of them to still be morphologically dominated by their core cities. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals striking differences of the urban spatial structure highlighting a rather monocentric pattern in the Munich region on the one hand, and a polycentric-dispersed distribution of urban mass concentrations in the Stuttgart region on the other hand.

TI  - Challenges Of Measuring Quality Of Community-Based Programs For Seriously Ill Individuals And Their Families
T2  - HEALTH AFFAIRS
M3  - Article
AB  - For many individuals and their families, acknowledging and confronting a serious illness such as cancer or advanced heart failure is a sentinel life event. From a health policy perspective, many individuals confronting such illnesses are high-need, high-cost patients who are increasingly cared for by community-based programs that may have competing goals: improving quality and reducing costs. Providing care to high-need, high-cost patients tests a health care system's ability to coordinate care and adapt to highly variable disease trajectories that could result in improved health for some, sudden and unexpected death for others, and a prolonged period of functional impairment for the majority. With the rapid growth in the number of community-based programs, efforts are needed to ensure transparency and accountability for this vulnerable population. In this article we outline the challenges in measuring quality of care for seriously ill patients, offer potential solutions, and call for new research to produce quality measures that ensure accountability for the care provided to seriously ill individuals and their families.

TI  - Analysis of Land Cover Classification Using Multi-Wavelength LiDAR System
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The airborne multi-wavelength light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system measures different wavelengths simultaneously and usually includes two or more active channels in infrared and green to acquire both topographic and hydrographic information. The reflected multi-wavelength energy can also be used to identify different land covers based on physical properties of materials. This study explored the benefits of multi-wavelength LiDAR in object-based land cover classification, focusing on three major issues: (1) the evaluation of single- and multi-wavelength LiDARs for land cover classification; (2) the performance of spectral and geometrical features extracted from multi-wavelength LiDAR; and (3) the comparison of the vegetation index derived from active multi-wavelength LiDAR and passive multispectral images. The three-wavelength test data were acquired by Optech Titan in green, near-infrared, and mid-infrared channels, and the reference data were acquired from Worldview-3 image. The experimental results show that the multi-wavelength LiDAR provided higher accuracy than single-wavelength LiDAR in land cover classification, with an overall accuracy improvement rate about 4-14 percentage points. The spectral features performed better compared to geometrical features for grass, road, and bare soil classes, and the overall accuracy improvement is about 29 percentage points. The results also demonstrated the vegetation indices from Worldview-3 and Optech Titan have similar characteristics, with correlations reaching 0.68 to 0.89. Overall, the multi-wavelength LiDAR system improves the accuracy of land cover classification because this system provides more spectral information than traditional single-wavelength LiDAR.

TI  - Application of remote sensing in analysis of impact assessment using biomass vigour changes of watersheds
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Vegetation status analysis is the best technique to assess the impact of watershed development activities. However, this approach often ignores biomass changes which are not due to the watershed management intervention in arid/semi-arid regions. The present study focused on the biomass vigour change detection to assess the impact of watershed management measures in arid Arjuni and semi-arid Morva-Hadaf watersheds from Gujarat state, India.Methodology: The study was carried out by multi-temporal remote sensing data for the year, 2002 & 2012 and 1997 & 2011 for the corresponding watersheds. The changes in biomass vigour were identified using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approach at watershed and sub-watershed levels for Arjuni watershed and watershed and mini-watershed levels for Morva-Hadaf watershed. The identified biomass changes were precisely tested with respect to already treated areas under watershed management programmes.Results: The NDVI values increased in both watersheds representing an overall increase in the biomass vigour. However, the sub-watershed level study of Arjuni watershed and mini-watershed level study of Morva-Hadaf watershed showed negative relationship between the percentage increase in NDVI, and percentage of treated area under different programmes.Interpretation: The results inferred that the increase in biomass vigour does not solely explain the implementation of watershed management measures. This clearly indicates that other than human induced factors (viz., micro-irrigation system adopted by farmers), seasonal factors (i.e., rainfall, temperature) have also influenced the NDVI values throughout the study area. Looking into the current micro-watershed clustering approach, the future work is required to distinguish between climate and human induced factors as a part of impact assessment studies.

TI  - Early warnings of hazardous thunderstorms over Lake Victoria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Weather extremes have harmful impacts on communities around Lake Victoria in East Africa. Every year, intense nighttime thunderstorms cause numerous boating accidents on the lake, resulting in thousands of deaths among fishermen. Operational storm warning systems are therefore crucial. Here we complement ongoing early warning efforts based on numerical weather prediction, by presenting a new satellite data-driven storm prediction system, the prototype Lake Victoria Intense storm Early Warning System (VIEWS). VIEWS derives predictability from the correlation between afternoon land storm activity and nighttime storm intensity on Lake Victoria, and relies on logistic regression techniques to forecast extreme thunderstorms from satellite observations. Evaluation of the statistical model reveals that predictive power is high and independent of the type of input dataset. We then optimise the configuration and show that false alarms also contain valuable information. Our results suggest that regression-based models that are motivated through process understanding have the potential to reduce the vulnerability of local fishing communities around Lake Victoria.

TI  - Innovations and Developments in Dermatologic Non-invasive Optical Imaging and Potential Clinical Applications
T2  - ACTA DERMATO-VENEREOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Most dermatologists are aware of the benefits of dermoscopy, and a few are familiar with laser-scanning confocal microscopy. Beyond confocal, there are fully 11 different categories of optical techniques that have been applied to clinical dermatology. This article first provides a comprehensive tabular overview of all these optical diagnostic technologies and then details 4 of the lesser known innovations that are already available or still in development (laser Doppler and speckle imaging, Raman spectroscopy, multiphoton microscopy, photoacoustic tomography), with some potential applications in clinical dermatology (blood flow monitoring, skin cancer diagnosis, composition measurements in atopic dermatitis, skin rejuvenation measurement, and noninvasive sentinel lymph node assessment in melanoma). These methods present many advantages, being non-invasive, portable, and rapid. The development of optics in biological and biomedical sciences (i.e. biophotonics) requires not only deep insight into the applications but also synergistic collaboration between engineers and clinicians.

TI  - Median Lingual Lymph Nodes: Prevalence on Imaging and Potential Implications for Oral Cavity Cancer Staging
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED TOMOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study sought to estimate the prevalence of median lingual lymph node (MLLN) metastases from oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) and determine the frequency with which MLLNs can be identified with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in control subjects.Methods: Pathology reports were used to identify patients with surgically treated OCSCC who underwent preoperative positron emission tomography-computed tomography to define the prevalence of MLLN metastases. As a control group, 500 consecutive face-neck MRIs from noncancer patients were reviewed for structures consistent with MLLNs.Results: In the study group, 1 (0.95%) of 105 OCSCC cases demonstrated a single MLLN metastasis from a lateral tongue tumor (T4aN2c). The MLLN exceeded 1 cm in all planes and was abnormal in morphology. The frequency of suspected MLLNs in controls was 1.0%, with a maximum measurement of 0.9 cm.Conclusions: Median lingual lymph nodes are infrequently identified with MRI in controls, concordant with the low prevalence of metastases from OCSCC to this inconstant nodal group.

TI  - Vicarious Calibration of sUAS Microbolometer Temperature Imagery for Estimation of Radiometric Land Surface Temperature
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the availability of lightweight microbolometer thermal cameras compatible with small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) has allowed their use in diverse scientific and management activities that require sub-meter pixel resolution. Nevertheless, as with sensors already used in temperature remote sensing (e.g., Landsat satellites), a radiance atmospheric correction is necessary to estimate land surface temperature. This is because atmospheric conditions at any sUAS flight elevation will have an adverse impact on the image accuracy, derived calculations, and study replicability using the microbolometer technology. This study presents a vicarious calibration methodology (sUAS-specific, time-specific, flight-specific, and sensor-specific) for sUAS temperature imagery traceable back to NIST-standards and current atmospheric correction methods. For this methodology, a three-year data collection campaign with a sUAS called AggieAir, developed at Utah State University, was performed for vineyards near Lodi, California, for flights conducted at different times (early morning, Landsat overpass, and mid-afternoon) and seasonal conditions. From the results of this study, it was found that, despite the spectral response of microbolometer cameras (7.0 to 14.0 m), it was possible to account for the effects of atmospheric and sUAS operational conditions, regardless of time and weather, to acquire accurate surface temperature data. In addition, it was found that the main atmospheric correction parameters (transmissivity and atmospheric radiance) significantly varied over the course of a day. These parameters fluctuated the most in early morning and partially stabilized in Landsat overpass and in mid-afternoon times. In terms of accuracy, estimated atmospheric correction parameters presented adequate statistics (confidence bounds under +/- 0.1 for transmissivity and +/- 1.2 W/m(2)/sr/um for atmospheric radiance, with a range of RMSE below 1.0 W/m(2)/sr/um) for all sUAS flights. Differences in estimated temperatures between original thermal image and the vicarious calibration procedure reported here were estimated from -5 degrees C to 10 degrees C for early morning, and from 0 to 20 degrees C for Landsat overpass and mid-afternoon times.

TI  - Patterns of calving and young stock movement in Ireland and their implications for BVD serosurveillance
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Republic of Ireland has a national eradication programme for bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDv) based on tissue-tag testing of calves to identify persistently infected animals (PIs). It has been proposed that serological testing of a sample of home-bred young stock would be a more cost effective surveillance mechanism than continued tissue-tag testing in herds which have previously been found to be BVD-free. These animals would have to be at least 6 months of age to avoid interference from maternal antibodies in test results. To examine the potential practicality of this system, we identified birth profiles and movements of calves born in Ireland during 2014 and 2015. We found that birth profiles for both beef and dairy animals were more evenly distributed throughout the year than often assumed, which should be borne in mind when evaluating the suitability of a single round of serological testing in the autumn for every herd. A large amount of movement was identified, with approximately 43% of calves experiencing a move before they reached 10 months of age, including moves to another Irish herd, to a knackery, to export, or to slaughter. Approximately 19% of calves had moved to other breeding herds in Ireland within this period. There were distinct patterns according to movement type, month of birth and herd type. The majority of herds moved either all or none of their calves in the first 10 months of life. These results indicate that young stock serological testing is unlikely to be an appropriate surveillance mechanism for all BVDv-free herds, as (i) many herds would not be able to supply a large enough sample of suitably aged home-bred young stock at a single point in time and (ii) Pls which would have been picked up by tissue-tag testing soon after birth would have moved from their home herd, to infect other herds, before serological testing could be conducted.

TI  - Osteogenic Melanoma With Desmin Expression
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Osteogenic differentiation is rarely seen in melanomas, when it occurs it is mainly in acral lesions.Methods: We report a case of an osteogenic melanoma in a 49-year-old woman who presented with a pigmented lesion in the subungueal region of her left hallux. The lesion was ulcerated and infiltrated until the deep dermis without bone involvement.Results: The tumor was composed of pleomorphic atypical epithelioid and fusiform cells disposed in nests or cords, with vesicular nuclei and prominent central nucleoli. Focal lentiginous proliferation of large atypical melanocytes was present along the dermoepidermal junction. Areas of osteoid matrix focally mineralized were disposed in trabeculae, and there were islands of neoplastic cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong expression of S-100 protein and, unexpectedly, of desmin. Focal expression of Melan-A, microphthalmia transcription factor, and HMB-45 is also revealed. Mutations in BRAF and NRAS genes were not present. The patient was submitted to an amputation of the left hallux with negative sentinel lymph node.Conclusion: The importance of recognizing osteogenic melanoma is based on difficulties for histologic recognition and its differentials diagnosis.

TI  - Spatial synchronicity in recruitment of Atlantic cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i>) stocks off Newfoundland and Labrador and the Flemish Cap
T2  - FISHERIES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial synchronicity in recruitment was examined for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the Newfoundland and southern Labrador (NL) and Flemish Cap regions. Recruitment was estimated using a cohort strength model for survey indices of abundance at pre-exploitation ages, and spatio-temporal covariation in recruitment was then examined. Patterns of recruitment synchrony were generally consistent with management boundaries. However, there were some exceptions that suggest structure at the sub stock level and mixing across adjacent stock boundaries. In particular, we observed weak correlations between the eastern and western 3Ps RV (Research Survey) recruitment indices. We also observed strong correlations between the eastern 3Ps RV and the fall and spring 3NO RV recruitment indices, as well as fairly strong correlations between the southern 3L, central 3KL, and 3Ps sentinel GN and LT recruitment indices. Correlations between the summer 3M RV recruitment indices and all other survey recruitment indices included in our analysis were generally very weak, as was expected. We demonstrate that survey recruitment indices can be used to identify either areas of potential sub-stock structure or mixing or areas where recruitment drivers may be operating across or differentially within stock management boundaries. Hence, our results should improve the design of future stock structure research, and provide useful new information for fisheries management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The passive surveillance of ticks using companion animal electronic health records
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ticks represent a large global reservoir of zoonotic disease. Current surveillance systems can be time and labour intensive. We propose that the passive surveillance of companion animal electronic health records (EHRs) could provide a novel methodology for describing temporal and spatial tick activity. A total of 16 58 857 EHRs were collected over a 2-year period (31 March 2014 and 29 May 2016) from companion animals attending a large sentinel network of 192 veterinary clinics across Great Britain (the Small Animal Veterinary Surveillance Network - SAVSNET). In total, 2180 EHRs were identified where a tick was recorded on an animal. The relative risk of dogs presenting with a tick compared with cats was 0.73 (95% confidence intervals 0.67-0.80). The highest number of tick records were in the south central regions of England. The presence of ticks showed marked seasonality with summer peaks, and a secondary smaller peak in autumn for cats; ticks were still being found throughout most of Great Britain during the winter. This suggests that passive surveillance of companion animal EHRs can describe tick activity temporally and spatially in a large cohort of veterinary clinics across Great Britain. These results and methodology could help inform veterinary and public health messages as well as increase awareness of ticks and tick-borne diseases in the general population.

TI  - A Satellite-Based Imaging Instrumentation Concept for Hyperspectral Thermal Remote Sensing
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the concept of the hyperspectral Earth-observing thermal infrared (TIR) satellite mission HiTeSEM (High-resolution Temperature and Spectral Emissivity Mapping). The scientific goal is to measure specific key variables from the biosphere, hydrosphere, pedosphere, and geosphere related to two global problems of significant societal relevance: food security and human health. The key variables comprise land and sea surface radiation temperature and emissivity, surface moisture, thermal inertia, evapotranspiration, soil minerals and grain size components, soil organic carbon, plant physiological variables, and heat fluxes. The retrieval of this information requires a TIR imaging system with adequate spatial and spectral resolutions and with day-night following observation capability. Another challenge is the monitoring of temporally high dynamic features like energy fluxes, which require adequate revisit time. The suggested solution is a sensor pointing concept to allow high revisit times for selected target regions (1-5 days at off-nadir). At the same time, global observations in the nadir direction are guaranteed with a lower temporal repeat cycle (>1 month). To account for the demand of a high spatial resolution for complex targets, it is suggested to combine in one optic (1) a hyperspectral TIR system with similar to 75 bands at 7.2-12.5 mu m (instrument NEDT 0.05 K-0.1 K) and a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 60 m, and (2) a panchromatic high-resolution TIR-imager with two channels (8.0-10.25 mu m and 10.25-12.5 mu m) and a GSD of 20 m. The identified science case requires a good correlation of the instrument orbit with Sentinel-2 (maximum delay of 1-3 days) to combine data from the visible and near infrared (VNIR), the shortwave infrared (SWIR) and TIR spectral regions and to refine parameter retrieval.

TI  - A method for examining temporal changes in cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom spatial extent using satellite remote sensing
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHAB) are thought to be increasing globally over the past few decades, but relatively little quantitative information is available about the spatial extent of blooms. Satellite remote sensing provides a potential technology for identifying cyanoHABs in multiple water bodies and across geo-political boundaries. An assessment method was developed using MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) imagery to quantify cyanoHAB surface area extent, transferable to different spatial areas, in Florida, Ohio, and California for the test period of 2008 to 2012. Temporal assessment was used to evaluate changes in satellite resolvable inland waterbodies for each state of interest. To further assess cyanoHAB risk within the states, the World Health Organization's (WHO) recreational guidance level thresholds were used to categorize surface area of cyanoHABs into three risk categories: low, moderate, and high-risk bloom area. Results showed that in Florida, the area of cyanoHABs increased largely due to observed increases in high-risk bloom area. California exhibited a slight decrease in cyanoHAB extent, primarily attributed to decreases in Northern California. In Ohio (excluding Lake Erie), little change in cyanoHAB surface area was observed. This study uses satellite remote sensing to quantify changes in inland cyanoHAB surface area across numerous water bodies within an entire state. The temporal assessment method developed here will be relevant into the future as it is transferable to the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on Sentinel-3A/3B missions. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Factors Influencing Disease Progression in Patients with Head and Neck Melanoma
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Histological parameters as well as the status of sentinel lymph node are known to be strong prognostic factors in patients with melanoma. Patients and Methods: In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 1,384 patients who were diagnosed with head and neck melanoma between 1976 and 2010 regarding prognostic factors [tumor thickness, level of invasion, sentinel lymph node (SLN) status, ulceration, histological subtype, localization, and gender], overall survival, and disease-free survival. Results: Patients who developed metastases had a significantly thicker tumor than patients without metastases. Additionally, a thicker tumor was often associated with a higher level of invasion (Clark level). There was no overall survival benefit in patients who underwent SLN dissection when compared to patients who did not (p=0.07). Compared to SLN-negative patients, patients with SLN involvement had a significantly shorter disease-free period (p<0.001) and shorter overall survival time (p<0.001). Conclusion: In summary, tumor thickness is the most important prognostic factor. SLN dissection does not affect the overall survival of patients with melanoma. However, a positive SLN is a marker for a worse outcome in these patients.

TI  - An integrated approach for tactical monitoring and data-driven spread forecasting of wildfires
T2  - FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 12th International Symposium on Fire Safety Science
CL  - Lund Univ, Lund, SWEDEN
AB  - In recent times there have been increasing efforts to integrate technology into wildfire management, especially in the fields of tactical monitoring and simulation. On the one hand, thermal infrared imaging (TIR) systems have been installed aboard surveillance aircraft including unmanned systems (UAS). On the other, there exists a variety of models and simulators able to forecast the fire spread. However, both fields currently present significant limitations. While relevant information is still extracted manually from aerial thermal imagery and is most times merely qualitative, simulators' accuracy on fire spread prediction has proved insufficient. To solve these issues, this article presents a twofold methodology to couple meaningful automated wildfire monitoring with accurate fire spread forecasting. The main goals are to, firstly, automatically process aerial TIR imagery so that valuable information can be produced in real time during the event and, secondly, use this information to adjust a Rothermel-based simulator in order to improve its accuracy on-line. The fire perimeter location is tracked automatically through an unsupervised edge detector. Afterwards, an assimilation module uses the remotely sensed data to optimise the simulator's fuel and wind parameters, which are assumed to remain constant for a certain period of time. Subsequently, the optimum parameters' values are used to issue a fire evolution forecast. All outputs are projected onto the corresponding Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) for visualization. The global system was validated using two large-scale experiments. If these algorithms can be applied to a sufficiently rich and varied set of experimental data and further developed to cope with more complex scenarios, they could eventually be incorporated into a fire management decision support system.

TI  - Flap Fixation Using Tissue Glue or Sutures Appears to Reduce Seroma Aspiration After Mastectomy for Breast Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Seroma formation and its sequelae cause complications and discomfort following mastectomy. In this retrospective study of 230 patients, patients underwent flap fixation after mastectomy using sutures or tissue glue. The results were compared to a group that had not been treated with flap fixation. The occurrence of seroma was significantly less in the group undergoing flap fixation with sutures. There were significantly fewer patients requiring seroma aspiration in both groups undergoing flap fixation.Background: Up to 90% of patients undergoing breast cancer surgery suffer from seroma formation, which can cause discomfort and various complications after mastectomy. This retrospective observational cohort study aimed to elucidate whether flap fixation with fibrin sealant (ARTISS) tissue glue reduces seroma formation and seroma aspiration after mastectomy when compared with flap fixation using Vicryl sutures and when compared with a conventional wound closure technique. Methods: All patients undergoing mastectomy due to invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ were eligible for inclusion. From May 2012 to March 2013, all patients undergoing mastectomy in 2 large breast cancer centers were treated using flap fixation with Vicryl sutures. From September 2013 to March 2014, all patients undergoing mastectomy were treated with flap fixation using ARTISS tissue glue. The data were retrospebtively analyzed and compared with a "drain-only" group that was not treated with flap fixation (May 2011-March 2012). Results: A total of 230 women who underwent mastectomy were retrospectively analyzed in this trial; 88 patients were included in the drain-only group (DO), 92 patients were included in the flap fixation group using Vicryl sutures (FF-1), and 50 patients were included in the flap fixation group using ARTISS tissue glue (FF-2). There was significantly less seroma formation in the group after flap fixation using sutures (P = .006). There were significantly fewer patients who required seroma aspiration in the FF-1 group (P = .001) and the FF-2 group (P = .001) after undergoing mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy or modified radical mastectomy. Conclusion: This study suggests that flap fixation after mastectomy using ARTISS tissue glue or sutures reduces postoperative seroma aspiration. As a result, flap fixation might lead to less patient discomfort. A randomized, prospective trial should be performed to verify these results.

TI  - Integral occurrence probability: combining cover and relative shoot frequencies based on bounded point-to-plant distances
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: To introduce a new distance-based field method for (herbaceous, terrestrial) plant species that relates cover to relative shoot frequency as a continuous process of occurrence probabilities and to explain how these data can be analysed.Methods: We propose to measure shortest distances from a sample of sampling points to the nearest above-ground part of plant species (up to a maximum search distance). We show how, after appropriate transformation of the point-to-plant distances to a 0-1 interval scale, cover as well as relative shoot frequency at any area up to the searched area can be read from the same curve. This leads to the notion of an integral occurrence probability, which we propose as a new species abundance measure. For estimation and regression modelling we make use of the zero-and-one inflated beta distribution. We supply all code required for these analyses.Results: Simulations of plant distribution patterns showed that the integral occurrence probability is able to differentiate between plant abundance patterns that differed in terms of relative cover, density and type of spatial distribution pattern. It is more sensitive to these differences than either cover or relative shoot frequency alone. The method allows summing occurrence probabilities over species to predict expected species richness as a function of the area searched. Aggregation across species, while accounting for overlap in species spatial distributions, is a simple matter of taking theminimum among the point-to-plant distances at each sampling point. The latter was demonstrated with data from a field trial in Nardetea grassland.Conclusions: The method could be a viable alternative for currently employed field methods, such as visual cover estimates, point-intercept sampling and recording the frequency of plant species in equal-area plots. Applications include, but are not limited to, conservation management monitoring and ground-truthing of remote sensing data.

TI  - Does time spent on visits to green space mediate the associations between the level of residential greenness and mental health?
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The objective of the current study was to explore whether time spent visiting green space near home acts as a mediator in the association between level of residential greenness and perceived mental health.Methods: Questionnaire data and satellite data of residential greenness were gathered in four European cities (total n = 3748): Barcelona (SP), Doetinchem (NL), Kaunas (LT) and Stoke-on-Trent (UK).Results: Mediation analyses showed that time spent visiting green space near home was a weak, but statistically significant, mediator in the pooled data and in the Dutch sample only.Conclusions: The findings provide little support for the hypothesis that purposeful visits are a mediator linking indirectly greenness with mental health. More research is needed to explore other mediators related to different exposure pathways, such as visual exposure, and alternative mechanisms, such as (perceived) safety.

TI  - Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging During Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Sentinel Node Biopsy: A First Step Towards a Fluorescence-based Anatomic Roadmap
T2  - EUROPEAN UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: During (robot-assisted) sentinel node (SN) biopsy procedures, intraoperative fluorescence imaging can be used to enhance radioguided SN excision. For this combined pre-and intraoperative SN identification was realized using the hybrid SN tracer, indocyanine green-Tc-99m-nanocolloid. Combining this dedicated SN tracer with a lymphangiographic tracer such as fluorescein may further enhance the accuracy of SN biopsy.Objective: Clinical evaluation of a multispectral fluorescence guided surgery approach using the dedicated SN tracer ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid, the lymphangiographic tracer fluorescein, and a commercially available fluorescence laparoscope.Design, setting, and participants: Pilot study in ten patients with prostate cancer. Following ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid administration and preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and single- photon emission computed tomograpy imaging, the number and location of SNs were determined. Fluorescein was injected intraprostatically immediately after the patient was anesthetized. A multispectral fluorescence laparoscope was used intraoperatively to identify both fluorescent signatures.Surgical procedure: Multispectral fluorescence imaging during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection and SN biopsy.Measurements: (1) Number and location of preoperatively identified SNs. (2) Number and location of SNs intraoperatively identified via ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid imaging. (3) Rate of intraoperative lymphatic duct identification via fluorescein imaging. (4) Tumor status of excised (sentinel) lymph node(s). (5) Postoperative complications and follow-up.Results and limitations: Near-infrared fluorescence imaging of ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid visualized 85.3% of the SNs. In 8/10 patients, fluorescein imaging allowed bright and accurate identification of lymphatic ducts, although higher background staining and tracer washout were observed. The main limitation is the small patient population.Conclusion: Our findings indicate that a lymphangiographic tracer can provide additional information during SN biopsy based on ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid. The study suggests that multispectral fluorescence image-guided surgery is clinically feasible. Patient summary: We evaluated the concept of surgical fluorescence guidance using differently colored dyes that visualize complementary features. In the future this concept may provide better guidance towards diseased tissue while sparing healthy tissue, and could thus improve functional and oncologic outcomes.

TI  - Clinically node negative breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving therapy, sentinel lymph node procedure versus follow-up: a Dutch randomized controlled multicentre trial (BOOG 2013-08)
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Studies showed that axillary lymph node dissection can be safely omitted in presence of positive sentinel lymph node(s) in breast cancer patients treated with breast conserving therapy. Since the outcome of the sentinel lymph node biopsy has no clinical consequence, the value of the procedure itself is being questioned. The aim of the BOOG 2013-08 trial is to investigate whether the sentinel lymph node biopsy can be safely omitted in clinically node negative breast cancer patients treated with breast conserving therapy.Methods: The BOOG 2013-08 is a Dutch prospective non-inferiority randomized multicentre trial. Women with pathologically confirmed clinically node negative T1-2 invasive breast cancer undergoing breast conserving therapy will be randomized for sentinel lymph node biopsy versus no sentinel lymph node biopsy. Endpoints include regional recurrence after 5 (primary endpoint) and 10 years of follow-up, distant-disease free and overall survival, quality of life, morbidity and cost-effectiveness. Previous data indicate a 5-year regional recurrence free survival rate of 99% for the control arm and 96% for the study arm. In combination with a non-inferiority limit of 5% and probability of 0.8, this result in a sample size of 1.644 patients including a lost to follow-up rate of 10%. Primary and secondary endpoints will be reported after 5 and 10 years of follow-up.Discussion: If the sentinel lymph node biopsy can be safely omitted in clinically node negative breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving therapy, this study will cost-effectively lead to a decreased axillary morbidity rate and thereby improved quality of life with non-inferior regional control, distant-disease free survival and overall survival.

TI  - Semi-Automated Monitoring of a Mega-Scale Beach Nourishment Using High-Resolution TerraSAR-X Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a semi-automated approach to detecting coastal shoreline change with high spatial-and temporal-resolution using X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The method was applied at the Sand Motor, a "mega-scale" beach nourishment project in the Netherlands. Natural processes, like waves, wind, and tides, gradually distribute the highly concentrated sand to adjacent beaches. Currently, various in-situ techniques are used to monitor the Sand Motor on a monthly basis. Meanwhile, the TerraSAR-X satellite collects two high-resolution (3 x 3 m), cloud-penetrating SAR images every 11 days. This study investigates whether shorelines detected in TerraSAR-X imagery are accurate enough to monitor the shoreline dynamics of a project like the Sand Motor. The study proposes and implements a semi-automated workflow to extract shorelines from all 182 available TerraSAR-X images acquired between 2011 and 2014. The shorelines are validated using bi-monthly RTK-GPS topographic surveys and nearby wave and tide measurements. A valid shoreline could be extracted from 54% of the images. The horizontal accuracy of these shorelines is approximately 50 m, which is sufficient to assess the larger scale shoreline dynamics of the Sand Motor. The accuracy is affected strongly by sea state and partly by acquisition geometry. We conclude that using frequent, high-resolution TerraSAR-X imagery is a valid option for assessing coastal dynamics on the order of tens of meters at approximately monthly intervals.

TI  - Evaluation of the US Geological Survey Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable across the Conterminous US Using Commercial High-Resolution Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey has produced the Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) product for the conterminous United States (CONUS), which provides wall-to-wall annual maps of burned area at 30 m resolution (1984-2015). Validation is a critical component in the generation of such remotely sensed products. Previous efforts to validate the BAECV relied on a reference dataset derived from Landsat, which was effective in evaluating the product across its timespan but did not allow for consideration of inaccuracies imposed by the Landsat sensor itself. In this effort, the BAECV was validated using 286 high-resolution images, collected from GeoEye-1, QuickBird-2, Worldview-2 and RapidEye satellites. A disproportionate sampling strategy was utilized to ensure enough burned area pixels were collected. Errors of omission and commission for burned area averaged 22 +/- 4% and 48 +/- 3%, respectively, across CONUS. Errors were lowest across the western U.S. The elevated error of commission relative to omission was largely driven by patterns in the Great Plains which saw low errors of omission (13 +/- 13%) but high errors of commission (70 +/- 5%) and potentially a region-growing function included in the BAECV algorithm. While the BAECV reliably detected agricultural fires in the Great Plains, it frequently mapped tilled areas or areas with low vegetation as burned. Landscape metrics were calculated for individual fire events to assess the influence of image resolution (2 m, 30 m and 500 m) on mapping fire heterogeneity. As the spatial detail of imagery increased, fire events were mapped in a patchier manner with greater patch and edge densities, and shape complexity, which can influence estimates of total greenhouse gas emissions and rates of vegetation recovery. The increasing number of satellites collecting high-resolution imagery and rapid improvements in the frequency with which imagery is being collected means greater opportunities to utilize these sources of imagery for Landsat product validation.

TI  - Experimental constraints on the rheology, eruption, and emplacement dynamics of analog lavas comparable to Mercury's northern volcanic plains
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present new viscosity measurements of a synthetic silicate system considered an analogue for the lava erupted on the surface of Mercury. In particular, we focus on the northern volcanic plains (NVP), which correspond to the largest lava flows on Mercury and possibly in the Solar System. High-temperature viscosity measurements were performed at both superliquidus (up to 1736K) and subliquidus conditions (1569-1502K) to constrain the viscosity variations as a function of crystallinity (from 0 to 28%) and shear rate (from 0.1 to 5s(-1)). Melt viscosity shows moderate variations (4-16Pas) in the temperature range of 1736-1600K. Experiments performed below the liquidus temperature show an increase in viscosity as shear rate decreases from 5 to 0.1s(-1), resulting in a shear thinning behavior, with a decrease in viscosity of similar to 1 log unit. The low viscosity of the studied composition may explain the ability of NVP lavas to cover long distances, on the order of hundreds of kilometers in a turbulent flow regime. Using our experimental data we estimate that lava flows with thickness of 1, 5, and 10m are likely to have velocities of 4.8, 6.5, and 7.2m/s, respectively, on a 5 degrees ground slope. Numerical modeling incorporating both the heat loss of the lavas and its possible crystallization during emplacement allows us to infer that high effusion rates (>10,000m(3)/s) are necessary to cover the large distances indicated by satellite data from the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging spacecraft.

TI  - Assessment of Approximations in Aerosol Optical Properties and Vertical Distribution into FLEX Atmospherically-Corrected Surface Reflectance and Retrieved Sun-Induced Fluorescence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Physically-based atmospheric correction of optical Earth Observation satellite data is used to accurately derive surface biogeophysical parameters free from the atmospheric influence. While water vapor or surface pressure can be univocally characterized, the compensation of aerosol radiometric effects relies on assumptions and parametric approximations of their properties. To determine the validity of these assumptions and approximations in the atmospheric correction of ESA's FLEX/Sentinel-3 tandem mission, a systematic error analysis of simulated FLEX data within the O-2 absorption bands was conducted. This paper presents the impact of key aerosol parameters in atmospherically-corrected FLEX surface reflectance and the subsequent Sun-Induced Fluorescence retrieval (SIF). We observed that: (1) a parametric characterization of aerosol scattering effects increases the accuracy of the atmospheric correction with respect to the commonly implemented discretization of aerosol optical properties by aerosol types and (2) the angstrom ngstrom exponent and the aerosol vertical distribution have a residual influence in the atmospherically-corrected surface reflectance. In conclusion, a multi-parametric aerosol characterization is sufficient for the atmospheric correction of FLEX data (and SIF retrieval) within the mission requirements in nearly 85% (70%) of the cases with average aerosol load conditions. The future development of the FLEX atmospheric correction algorithm would therefore gain from a multi-parametric aerosol characterization based on the synergy of FLEX and Sentinel-3 data.

TI  - Wavelength-Resolution SAR Incoherent Change Detection Based on Image Stack
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter presents a wavelength-resolution synthetic aperture radar incoherent change detection method based on image stack, i.e., there are more than one reference or/and surveillance image. Considering image stack in statistical hypothesis test for change detection is expected to result into a simple mathematical expression for implementation and provide better change detection results. As presented in this letter, a statistical hypothesis test is developed on bivariate Gaussian distribution for an image stack of two reference images and one surveillance image. The requirement for the image stack is three images associated with three measurements with no change between two of them. A detection method with simple processing scheme is proposed. The method is experimented with 24 CARABAS data sets. The results indicate that high average detection probability, e.g., 96%, with very low false alarm rate, e.g., only 0.19/km(2), is obtained with the proposal.

TI  - Evaluation of suitable sites for mud crab farming in Ratnagiri District of Maharashtra, India
T2  - Journal of the Marine Biological Association of India
M3  - Article
AB  - The State of Maharashtra has vast stretches of estuaries, creeks and mangrove swamps, which offers great potential for aquaculture, particularly for mud crab farming. In view of the natural resources and market potential for mud crab, the Department of Forests, Government of Maharashtra plans to promote mud crab farming through a novel approach, which aims at providing livelihood support to the local communities utilizing the mangrove wetlands; thereby the local communities also shoulder the responsibility of conservation of mangroves. In this backdrop, a study was conducted to identify the suitable sites for sustainable mud crab culture, in GIS environment, based on various physical and environmental criteria including topography, soil types, land-use systems, vegetation, water quality, water availability, salinity, risks of flooding, infrastructure, seed resources and availability, market and support services. The brackishwater stretches of Anjarle, Kelshi, Aade, Velas and Ansure in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra were studied, and all study stations had patchy to thick mangrove vegetation. The major mangrove species encountered were: Avicennia marina, Avicennia officinalis, Sonneratia caseolaris, Rhizophora mucronata and Acanthus ilicifolius. The pH of water was near-neutral to alkaline, whereas dissolved oxygen levels were found to be within the ideal range. The salinity of the tidal creeks ranged from 7.24 ppt (Velas) to 35.9 ppt (Ansure) which generally varies with the tide. The ammonia levels which ranged from 0 (Aade and Ansure) to 0.5 ppm (Kelshi), falls within the safe levels for aquaculture. The sediment pH ranged from 6.2 to 8.32. The organic carbon levels in sediment ranged from 0.27 to 2.94% indicating medium to high productive nature of sediment. Samples of mud crab collected from the study areas were processed for screening for WSSV infection. All samples gave Negative results in primary as well as nested PCRs, indicating the absence of WSSV in the wild mud crab population. Integrating the analysis result along with supporting spatial data with the aid of GIS and Remote Sensing techniques, a total of 10.063 ha have been evaluated as suitable areas for mud crab farming along the brackishwater stretches of Anjarle (1.91 ha), Aade (2.069 ha), Kelshi (1.77 ha), Velas (0.538 ha) and Ansure (3.776 ha).

TI  - Assessment of Forest Degradation in Vietnam Using Landsat Time Series Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat time series data were used to characterize forest degradation in Lam Dong Province, Vietnam. We conducted three types of image change analyses using Landsat time series data to characterize the land cover changes. Our analyses concentrated on the timeframe of 1973-2014, with much emphasis on the latter part of that range. We conducted a field trip through Lam Dong Province to develop a better understanding of the ground conditions of the region, during which we obtained many photographs of representative forest sites with Global Positioning System locations to assist us in our image interpretations. High-resolution Google Earth imagery and Landsat data of the region were used to validate results. In general, our analyses indicated that many land-use changes have occurred throughout Lam Dong Province, including gradual forest to non-forest transitions. Recent changes are most marked along the relatively narrow interfaces between agricultural and forest areas that occur towards the boundaries of the province. One important observation is that the most highly protected national reserves in the region have not changed much over the entire Landsat timeframe (1972-present). Spectral changes within these regions have not occurred at the same levels as those areas adjacent to the reserves.

TI  - Observations of the East Madagascar Current system: Dynamics and volume transports
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The South Equatorial Current (SEC) in the Indian Ocean bifurcates when it reaches Madagascar leading, respectively, to the North East Madagascar Current (NEMC), which contours the island flowing northwestward, and to the South East Madagascar Current (SEMC), which flows southwestward. Both branches eventually contribute to the greater Agulhas Current system and thus play a part in the global ocean circulation. In addition, these currents have important effects on the local conditions for marine life. In this study, the NEMC and the SEMC are investigated based on a comprehensive, multidisciplinary survey of the east coast of Madagascar in 2008. Results from conductivity-temperature-depth stations, underway measurements with thermosalinograph and fluorometer, and ship-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler are discussed along with concomitant remotely sensed data. Maximum core velocities of > 150 cm s(-1) were observed in both the NEMC and the SEMC. The SEMC appeared as a nearshore southward jet, which extended at its widest nearly 200 km offshore. Near the southern tip of Madagascar, the SEMC was flanked by reverse velocities: a northeastward current about 30 km wide along the coast and a northeastward offshore current greater than 140 km wide suggesting the presence of the South Indian Ocean Countercurrent. The NEMC had the structure of a narrow nearshore jet, with weak currents beyond 100 km offshore. Volume transport for the upper 1,100 m was estimated to be 22 Sverdrup (Sv) for the SEMC and 48 Sv for the NEMC. The high NEMC transport compared with earlier estimates might be because of anomalously high influx of the SEC during the measurement period. Off the south coast, an undercurrent below 900 m carried an equatorward transport of 3.1 Sv. No undercurrent was observed in the north, but a geostrophic velocity minimum and a similar vertical velocity shear between surface and subsurface currents were found at the level where such a countercurrent has been previously observed from direct measurements.

TI  - Electrically tunable fluidic lens imaging system for laparoscopic fluorescence-guided surgery
T2  - BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The addition of fluorescence guidance in laparoscopic procedures has gained significant interest in recent years, particularly through the use of near infrared (NIR) markers. In this work we present a novel laparoscope camera coupler based on an electrically tunable fluidic lens that permits programmable focus control and has desirable achromatic performance from the visible to the NIR. Its use extends the lower working distance limit and improves detection sensitivity, important for work with molecularly targeted fluorescence markers. We demonstrate its superior optical performance in laparoscopic fluorescenceguided surgery. In vivo results using a tumor specific molecular probe and a nonspecific NIR dye are presented.

TI  - Spatially detailed retrievals of spring phenology from single-season high-resolution image time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices derived from satellite image time series have been extensively used to estimate the timing of phenological events like season onset. Medium spatial resolution (>= 250 m) satellite sensors with daily revisit capability are typically employed for this purpose. In recent years, phenology is being retrieved at higher resolution (<= 30 m) in response to increasing availability of high-resolution satellite data. To overcome the reduced acquisition frequency of such data, previous attempts involved fusion between high- and medium-resolution data, or combinations of multi-year acquisitions in a single phenological reconstruction. The objectives of this study are to demonstrate that phenological parameters can now be retrieved from single-season high-resolution time series, and to compare these retrievals against those derived from multi-year high-resolution and single-season medium-resolution satellite data. The study focuses on the island of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands, which comprises a highly-dynamic saltmarsh, dune vegetation, and agricultural land. Combining NDVI series derived from atmospherically corrected images from RapidEye (5 m-resolution) and the SPOT5 Take5 experiment (10m-resolution) acquired between March and August 2015, phenological parameters were estimated using a function fitting approach. We then compared results with phenology retrieved from four years of 30 m Landsat 8 OLI data, and single-year 100 m Proba-V and 250 m MODIS temporal composites of the same period. Retrieved phenological parameters from combined RapidEye/SPOT5 displayed spatially consistent results and a large spatial variability, providing complementary information to existing vegetation community maps. Retrievals that combined four years of Landsat observations into a single synthetic year were affected by the inclusion of years with warmer spring temperatures, whereas adjustment of the average phenology to 2015 observations was only feasible for a few pixels due to cloud cover around phenological transition dates. The Proba-V and MODIS phenology retrievals scaled poorly relative to their high-resolution equivalents, indicating that medium-resolution phenology retrievals need to be interpreted with care, particularly in landscapes with fine-scale land cover variability.

TI  - Low-Cloud, Boundary Layer, and Sea Ice Interactions over the Southern Ocean during Winter
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - During austral winter, a sharp contrast in low-cloud fraction and boundary layer structure across the Antarctic sea ice edge is seen in ship-based measurements and in active satellite retrievals from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), which provide an unprecedented view of polar clouds during winter. Sea ice inhibits heat and moisture transport from the ocean to the atmosphere, and, as a result, the boundary layer is cold, stable, and clear over sea ice and warm, moist, well mixed, and cloudy over open water. The mean low-cloud fraction observed by CALIPSO is roughly 0.7 over open water and 0.4-0.5 over sea ice, and the low-cloud layer is deeper over open water. Low-level winds in excess of 10ms 21 are common over sea ice. Cold advection off of the sea ice pack causes enhanced low-cloud fraction over open water, and thus an enhanced longwave cloud radiative effect at the surface. Quantitative estimates of the surface longwave cloud radiative effect contributed by low clouds are presented. Finally, 10 state-of-the-art global climate models with satellite simulators are compared to observations. Near the sea ice edge, 7 out of 10 models simulate cloudier conditions over open water than over sea ice. Most models also underestimate low-cloud fraction both over sea ice and over open water.

TI  - Estimating crop residue cover using SPOT 5 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of percentage residue cover (PRC) is required to manage crop residue and to provide a key parameter for several biogeochemistry models. However, the growth of the next crop, crop residue decomposition, and precipitation or irrigation can affect the spectral features of crop residue and decrease the spectral difference between crop residue and soil. These factors limit the time window of image acquisition for estimating PRC, especially for double cropping systems (two crops harvested in one year). Remote sensing sensors with a short revisit interval allow imagery to be captured for a specific period (e.g., soon after harvest) when these effects are minimal. SPOT imagery has a short revisit interval of two to three days because of. its oblique viewing capacity, and provides balance between high resolution and wide-area coverage. The study aimed to investigate the potential of SPOT 5 imagery for predicting PRC in a typical area of China with a wheat (Triticum aestivum)-corn (Zea ways L.) double cropping system. A SPOT 5 image was acquired with three visible and near infrared bands and one shortwave infrared (SWIR) band, from which six normalized difference indices (NDI) were built. Wheat PRC values (n = 94) were measured immediately after wheat harvest using ground vertical photographs and divided into a calibration set (n = 62) and a validation set (n = 32). To estimate PRC linear spectral analysis and three regression methods were used. Simple linear regression (SLR) was used for its simplicity, and stepwise regression (SR) and principal component regression (PCR) were used because they could exploit the spectral information from all available image bands. Besides, the bootstrap was used to assess the prediction uncertainty of the regression methods. The results demonstrated that the NDI41 index (derived from SWIR and green bands) performed the best among the four bands and the six indices for estimating PRC when using the SLR method, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.588 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.114 for the validation set. This estimation accuracy was similar to that observed for the SR and PCR models and much better than that for the linear spectral analysis (R-2 and RMSE were 0.326 and 0.208, respectively). However, NDI41 accompanied by SLR was the optimal choice for estimating PRC because of its simplicity. These results indicate that SPOT 5 imagery could be used to estimate PRC. Therefore, this study should contribute to crop residue management.

TI  - Continued Reforestation and Urban Expansion in the New Century of a Tropical Island in the Caribbean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely monitoring of tropical land cover/use (LCLU) changes is urgent due to the rapid deforestation/reforestation and its impact on global land-atmosphere interaction. However, persistent cloud cover in the tropics imposes the greatest challenge and retards LCLU mapping in mountainous areas such as the tropic island of Puerto Rico, where forest transition changed from deforestation to reforestation due to the economy shift from agriculture to industry and service after the 1940s. To improve the LCLU mapping in the tropics and to evaluate the trend of forest transition of Puerto Rico in the new century, we integrated the optical Landsat images with the L-band SAR to map LC in 2010 by taking advantage of the cloud-penetrating ability of the SAR signals. The results showed that the incorporation of SAR data with the Landsat data significantly, although not substantially, enhanced the accuracy of LCLU mapping of Puerto Rico, and the Kappa statistic reached 90.5% from 88.4% without SAR data. The enhancement of mapping by SAR is important for urban and forest, as well as locations with limited optical data caused by cloud cover. We found both forests and urban lands continued expanding in the new century despite the declining population. However, the forest cover change slowed down in 2000-2010 compared to that in 1991-2000. The deforestation rate reduced by 42.1% in 2000-2010, and the reforestation was mostly located in the east and southeast of the island where Hurricane Georges landed and caused severe vegetation damage in 1998. We also found that reforestation increased, but deforestation decreased along the topography slope. Reforestation was much higher within the protected area compared to that in the surroundings in the wet and moist forest zones.

TI  - A snow-free vegetation index for improved monitoring of vegetation spring green-up date in deciduous ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetative spring green-up date (GUD), an indicator of plants' sensitivity to climate change, exerts an important influence on biogeochemical cycles. Conventionally, large-scale monitoring of spring phenology is primarily detected by satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs), e.g. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). However, these indices have long been criticized, as the derived GUD can be biased by snowmelt. To minimize the snowmelt effect in monitoring spring phenology, we developed a new index, Normalized Difference Phenology Index (NDPI), which is a 3-band VI, designed to best contrast vegetation from the background (i.e. soil and snow in this study) as well as to minimize the difference among the backgrounds. We examined the rigorousness of NDPI in three ways. First, we conducted mathematical simulations to show that NDPI is mathematically robust and performs superior to NDVI for differentiating vegetation from the background, theoretically justifying NDPI for spring phenology monitoring. Second, we applied NDPI using MODIS land surface reflectance products to real vegetative ecosystems of three in-situ PhenoCam sites. Our results show that, despite large snow cover in the winter and snowmelt process in the spring, the temporal trajectories of NDPI closely track the vegetation green-up events. Finally, we applied NDPI to 11 eddy-covariance tower sites, spanning large gradients in latitude and vegetation types in deciduous ecosystems, using the same MODIS products. Our results suggest that the GUD derived by using NDPI is consistent with daily gross primary production (GPP) derived GUD, with R (Spearman's correlation) = 0.93, Bias = 2.90 days, and RMSE (the root mean square error) = 7.75 days, which outcompetes the snow removed NDVI approach, with R = 0.90, Bias = 7.34 days, and RMSE = 10.91 days. We concluded that our newly-developed NDPI is robust to snowmelt effect and is a reliable approach for monitoring spring green-up in deciduous ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimating Top-of-Atmosphere Daily Reflected Shortwave Radiation Flux Over Land From MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-spatial resolution data of the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflected shortwave radiation flux are needed to understand the effects of local-scale anthropogenic and natural processes on earth's radiation budget. A previous study developed an algorithm to estimate the TOA instantaneous shortwave component from polar-orbiting Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. This paper presents a temporal scaling approach to predict daily values of TOA reflected shortwave radiation flux from temporally sparse MODIS observations. Radiative transfer simulation and statistical regression are used to establish the relationship between daily shortwave flux and MODIS spectral reflectance. A comparison between the Terra and Aqua combined MODIS computed data and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System SYN1deg product of 1 degrees regional daily shortwave fluxes have a bias of 3.8 W/m(2) with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 13.3 W/m(2) using data from 2009 over eight subsets across various latitudes. Comparing the regional monthly shortwave fluxes reduces the RMSE to 6.9 W/m(2). The longer the averaging period the lower the uncertainty is self-explanatory.

TI  - GF-3 SAR Ocean Wind Retrieval: The First View and Preliminary Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first Chinese civil C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) launched on 10 August 2016 by the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), which operates in 12 imaging modes with a fine spatial resolution up to 1 m. As one of the primary users, the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) operationally processes GF-3 SAR Level-1 products into ocean surface wind vector and plans to officially release the near real-time SAR wind products in the near future. In this paper, the methodology of wind retrieval at C-band SAR is introduced and the first results of GF-3 SAR-derived winds are presented. In particular, the case of the coastal katabatic wind off the west coast of the U.S. captured by GF-3 is discussed. The preliminary accuracy assessment of wind speed and direction retrievals from GF-3 SAR is carried out against in situ measurements from National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy measurements of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Only the buoys located inside the GF-3 SAR wind cell (1 km) were considered as co-located in space, while the time interval between observations of SAR and buoy was limited to less the 30 min. These criteria yielded 56 co-locations during the period from January to April 2017, showing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.46 m/s and 22.22 degrees for wind speed and direction, respectively. Different performances due to geophysical model function (GMF) and Polarization Ratio (PR) are discussed. The preliminary results indicate that GF-3 wind retrievals are encouraging for operational implementation.

TI  - Fusion of Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 is a wide-swath and fine spatial resolution satellite imaging mission designed for data continuity and enhancement of the Landsat and other missions. The Sentinel-2 data are freely available at the global scale, and have similar wavelengths and the same geographic coordinate system as the Landsat data, which provides an excellent opportunity to fuse these two types of satellite sensor data together. In this paper, a new approach is presented for the fusion of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager data to coordinate their spatial resolutions for continuous global monitoring. The 30 m spatial resolution Landsat 8 bands are downscaled to 10 m using available 10 m Sentinel-2 bands. To account for the land-cover/land-use (LCLU) changes that may have occurred between the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images, the Landsat 8 panchromatic (PAN) band was also incorporated in the fusion process. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach is effective for fusing Landsat 8 with Sentinel-2 data, and the use of the PAN band can decrease the errors introduced by LCLU changes. By fusion of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data, more frequent observations can be produced for continuous monitoring (this is particularly valuable for areas that can be covered easily by clouds, thereby, contaminating some Landsat or Sentinel-2 observations), and the observations are at a consistent fine spatial resolution of 10 m. The products have great potential for timely monitoring of rapid changes.

TI  - Effect of land use change on landscape ecological security in Erhai Basin
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - To study the landscape spatial change of small-scale natural watersheds integrated by plateau lakes and its impacts on landscape ecological risk, Landsat remote sensing image interpretation data in Erhai Lake Basin in 1995, 2005 and 2015 were used, and GIS spatial analysis technique and Fragstats 3.4 were used to calculate the landscape pattern index. Accordingly, the landscape ecological risk model was constructed, and the temporal and spatial characteristics of ecological risk and its evolution mechanism in Erhai Lake Basin were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) The area of landscape types changed obviously from 1995 to 2015 in Erhai Basin. Woodland, grassland and water landscape decreased gradually, the cultivated land and wetland decreased first and then increased, while the construction land increased significantly. (2) The quantitative analysis of landscape index in Erhai Basin showed that the landscape spatial heterogeneity decreased, and the landscape type distribution changed from centralized to scattered, and as a result, the control effect of woodland was weakened. (3) During the past 20 years, the ecological security of the watershed tended to deteriorate, the average ecological risk index changed from 0.4998 in 1995 to 0.5896 in 2015, the proportion of high ecological risk area changed from 34.0% in 1995 to 47.8% in 2015, and the distribution of high ecological risk region changed from the arc pattern along the periphery of the basin to the multi-core pattern centered on the Erhai Lake. The spatial and temporal changes of the ecological risk of the basin were closely related to the evolution of land use types and human activities. Large-scale tourism development and the differences in urban-rural development mechanism were important factors leading to the increase and transfer of high ecological risk area in this region.

TI  - Effect of Solar-Cloud-Satellite Geometry on Land Surface Shortwave Radiation Derived from Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds and their associated shadows are major obstacles to most land surface remote sensing applications. Meanwhile, solar-cloud-satellite geometry (SCSG) makes the effect of clouds and shadows on derived land surface biophysical parameters more complicated. However, in most existing studies, the SCSG effect has been frequently neglected although it is pointed out by many works that SCSG effect is a noticeable problem, especially in the field of land surface radiation budget. Taking shortwave downward radiation (SWDR) as a testing variable, this study quantified the SCSG effect on the derived SWDR, and proposed an operational scheme to correct the big effect. The results demonstrate that the proposed correcting scheme is very effective and works very well. It is revealed that a significant under- or overestimation is detected in retrieved SWDR if the SCSG effect is ignored. Typically, the induced error in SWDR can reach up to 80%. The scheme and findings of this study are expected to be inspirational for the land surface remote sensing community, wherein solar-cloud-satellite geometry is an unavoidable issue.

TI  - Monitoring land surface albedo and vegetation dynamics using high spatial and temporal resolution synthetic time series from Landsat and the MODIS BRDF/NBAR/albedo product
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal vegetation phenology can significantly alter surface albedo which in turn affects the global energy balance and the albedo warming/cooling feedbacks that impact climate change. To monitor and quantify the surface dynamics of heterogeneous landscapes, high temporal and spatial resolution synthetic time series of albedo and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were generated from the 500 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) operational Collection V006 daily BRDF/NBAR/albedo products and 30 m Landsat 5 albedo and near-nadir reflectance data through the use of the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM). The traditional Landsat Albedo (Shuai et al., 2011) makes use of the MODIS BRDF/Albedo products (MCD43) by assigning appropriate BRDFs from coincident MODIS products to each Landsat image to generate a 30 m Landsat albedo product for that acquisition date. The available cloud free Landsat 5 albedos (due to clouds, generated every 16 days at best) were used in conjunction with the daily MODIS albedos to determine the appropriate 30 m albedos for the intervening daily time steps in this study. These enhanced daily 30 m spatial resolution synthetic time series were then used to track albedo and vegetation phenology dynamics over three Ameriflux tower sites (Harvard Forest in 2007, Santa Rita in 2011 and Walker Branch in 2005). These Ameriflux sites were chosen as they are all quite nearby new towers coming on line for the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), and thus represent locations which will be served by spatially paired albedo measures in the near future. The availability of data from the NEON towers will greatly expand the sources of tower albedometer data available for evaluation of satellite products. At these three Ameriflux tower sites the synthetic time series of broadband shortwave albedos were evaluated using the tower albedo measurements with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) less than 0.013 and a bias within the range of +/- 0.006. These synthetic time series provide much greater spatial detail than the 500 m gridded MODIS data, especially over more heterogeneous surfaces, which improves the efforts to characterize and monitor the spatial variation across species and communities. The mean of the difference between maximum and minimum synthetic time series of albedo within the MODIS pixels over a subset of satellite data of Harvard Forest (16 km by 14 km) was as high as 0.2 during the snow-covered period and reduced to around 0.1 during the snow-free period. Similarly, we have used STARFM to also couple MODIS Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectances (NBAR) values with Landsat 5 reflectances to generate daily synthetic times series of NBAR and thus Enhanced Vegetation Index (NBAR-EVI) at a 30 m resolution. While normally STARFM is used with directional reflectances, the use of the view angle corrected daily MODIS NBAR values will provide more consistent time series. These synthetic times series of EVI are shown to capture seasonal vegetation dynamics with finer spatial and temporal details, especially over heterogeneous land surfaces. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Using multi-date satellite imagery to monitor invasive grass species distribution in post-wildfire landscapes: An iterative, adaptable approach that employs open-source data and software
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the most pressing concerns of land managers in post-wildfire landscapes are the establishment and spread of invasive species. Land managers need accurate maps of invasive species cover for targeted management post-disturbance that are easily transferable across space and time. In this study, we sought to develop an iterative, replicable methodology based on limited invasive species occurrence data, freely available remotely sensed data, and open source software to predict the distribution of Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) in a post-wildfire landscape. We developed four species distribution models using eight spectral indices derived from five months of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data in 2014. These months corresponded to both cheatgrass growing period and time of field data collection in the study area. The four models were improved using an iterative approach in which a threshold for cover was established, and all models had high sensitivity values when tested on an independent dataset. We also quantified the area at highest risk for invasion in future seasons given 2014 distribution, topographic covariates, and seed dispersal limitations. These models demonstrate the effectiveness of using derived multi-date spectral indices as proxies for species occurrence on the landscape, the importance of selecting thresholds for invasive species cover to evaluate ecological risk in species distribution models, and the applicability of Landsat 8 OLI and the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling for targeted invasive species management.

TI  - Multiple Regression Analysis for Unmixing of Surface Temperature Data in an Urban Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change and increasing urbanization worldwide intensify the need for a better understanding of human heat stress dynamics in urban systems. During heat waves, which are expected to increase in number and intensity, the development of urban cool islands could be a lifesaver for many elderly and vulnerable people. The use of remote sensing data offers the unique possibility to study these dynamics with spatially distributed large datasets during all seasons of the year and including day and night-time analysis. For the city of Basel 32 high-quality Landsat 8 (L8) scenes are available since 2013, enabling comprehensive statistical analysis. Therefore, land surface temperature (LST) is calculated using L8 thermal infrared (TIR) imagery (stray light corrected) applying improved emissivity and atmospheric corrections. The data are combined with a land use/land cover (LULC) map and evaluated using administrative residential units. The observed dependence of LST on LULC is analyzed using a thermal unmixing approach based on a multiple linear regression (MLR) model, which allows for quantifying the gradual influence of different LULC types on the LST precisely. Seasonal variations due to different solar irradiance and vegetation cover indicate a higher dependence of LST on the LULC during the warmer summer months and an increasing influence of the topography and albedo during the colder seasons. Furthermore, the MLR analysis allows creating predicted LST images, which can be used to fill data gaps like in SLC-off Landsat 7 ETM+ data.

TI  - A Fully Automated Supraglacial lake area and volume Tracking("FAST") algorithm: Development and application using MODIS imagery of West Greenland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) influence ice dynamics if they drain rapidly by hydrofracture. MODIS data are often used to investigate SGLs, including calculating SGL area changes through time, but no existing work presents a method that tracks changes to individual (and total) SGL volume in MODIS imagery over a melt season. Here, we develop such a method by first testing three automated approaches to derive SGL areas from MODIS images from the MOD09 level-2 surface-reflectance product, by comparing calculated areas for the Paakitsoq and Store Glacier regions in West Greenland with areas derived from Landsat-8 (LS8) images. Second, we apply a physically-based depth-calculation algorithm to the pixels within the SGL boundaries from the best performing area-derivation method, and compare the resultant depths with those calculated using the same method applied to LS8 imagery. Our results indicate that SGL areas are most accurately generated using dynamic thresholding of MODIS band 1 (red) MOD09 data with a 0.640 threshold value; calculated values from MODIS are closely comparable to those derived from LS8. Third, we incorporate the best performing area- and depth-detection methods into a Fully Automated SGL Tracking ("FAST") algorithm that tracks individual SGLs between successive MODIS images. Finally, we apply the FAST algorithm to the two study regions, where it identifies 43 (Paakitsoq) and 19 (Store Glacier) rapidly draining SGLs during 2014, representing 21% and 15% of the respective total SGL populations, including some clusters of rapidly draining SGLs. The FAST algorithm improves upon existing automatic SGL tracking methods through its calculation of both SGL areas and volumes over large regions of the GrIS on a fully automatic basis. It therefore has the potential to be used for investigating statistical relationships between SGL areas, volumes and drainage events over the whole of the GrIS, and over multiple seasons, which might provide further insights into the factors that trigger rapid SGL drainage.

TI  - Multi-decadal time series of remotely sensed vegetation improves prediction of soil carbon in a subtropical grassland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil carbon sequestration in agroecosystems could play a key role in climate change mitigation but will require accurate predictions of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks over spatial scales relevant to land management. Spatial variation in underlying drivers of SOC, such as plant productivity and soil mineralogy, complicates these predictions. Recent advances in the availability of remotely sensed data make it practical to generate multidecadal time series of vegetation indices with high spatial resolution and coverage. However, the utility of such data largely is unknown, only having been tested with shorter (e.g., 1-2 yr) data summaries. Across a 2,000 ha subtropical grassland, we found that a long time series (28 yr) of a vegetation index (Enhanced Vegetation Index; EVI) derived from the Landsat 5 satellite significantly enhanced prediction of spatially varying SOC pools, while a short summary (2 yr) was an ineffective predictor. EVI was the best predictor for surface SOC (0-5 cm depth) and total measured SOC stocks (0-15 cm). The optimum models for SOC in the upper soil layer combined EVI records with elevation and calcium concentration, while deeper SOC was more strongly associated with calcium availability. We demonstrate how data from the open access Landsat archive can predict SOC stocks, a key ecosystem metric, and illustrate the rich variety of analytical approaches that can be applied to long time series of remotely sensed greenness. Overall, our results showed that SOC pools were closely coupled to EVI in this ecosystem, demonstrating that maintenance of higher average green leaf area is correlated with higher SOC. The strong associations of vegetation greenness and calcium concentration with SOC suggest that the ability to sequester additional SOC likely will rely on strategic management of pasture vegetation and soil fertility.

TI  - Location-and Time-Specific Hydrological Simulations with Multi-Resolution Remote Sensing Data in Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A major challenge in hydrologic modeling remains the mapping of vegetation dynamics in an urban landscape. The impact of vegetation on interception storage varies over time and needs to be quantified in order to enable proper management of water resources in urban areas. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of the urban landscape makes it challenging to monitor urban vegetation. A more detailed spatial and temporal scale is needed. To characterize surface cover at a high spatial resolution, a hyperspectral APEX image (2 m) is used, while a time series of Proba-V images (daily, 100 m) allows a detailed characterization of the seasonal variation of urban greenness. For this study, we use and validate the leaf area index (LAI) maps derived from APEX and Proba-V data for a selected pixel in the Watermaelbeek catchment in Brussels (Belgium). The ground-truthing of the Proba-V pixels includes a detailed mapping of land cover characteristics and more specifically vegetation cover throughout the seasons. LAI values calculated based on the APEX image agree with the LAI values measured from the ground (n = 106, R-2 = 0.68). Further, the aggregated APEX pixels correlate with the Proba-V pixels (R-2 = 0.79), and the Proba-V data can be used to monitor vegetation dynamics. As the seasonal LAI measurements correspond with the Proba-V dynamics, we conclude that Proba-V images allow the characterization of vegetation dynamics at a high spatial resolution in heterogeneous areas. We create a time series of LAI maps at a high resolution (2 m), which allows a location-and time-specific simulation of interception storage and thus contributes to managing water resources in urban areas.

TI  - An abiding antagonism: realism, idealism and the mirage of western-Russian partnership after the Cold War
T2  - INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Europe's security environment is critically dependent on nature of the relationship between Russia and the broader west. What are the obstacles in the way of a stable partnership? Against the conventional wisdom that foregrounds domestic politics, we establish the importance of an abiding clash of definitions of national interest on both sides. The US and Russian strategic perspectives draw on the modern historical experience of both sides, are consistent with well-established international relations theories and are independent of particular personalities such as Putin's. We demonstrate that though personalities, ideas and contingency played their roles, these basic clashing perspectives existed even during the euphoric days of the Cold War's end. Success in negotiating an improvement in USA-Russian relations will require a pragmatic compromise between deeply divergent interests. Stable economic and political relations may be possible, but the first step in attaining it is recognizing the scale of the challenge.

AB  - Although the use of postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) is widely accepted in certain clinical situations, areas of controversy persist for some clinical scenarios. In addition, with significant shifts in the management of breast cancer, including omission of axillary nodal dissection in select sentinel node-positive patients and increased use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, new clinical challenges have arisen regarding the role of PMRT. This article reviews the data to support current recommendations for postmastectomy radiation and explores areas of controversy and the studies that guide clinicians in these scenarios.

TI  - Assessment of Terra MODIS On-Orbit Polarization Sensitivity Using Pseudoinvariant Desert Sites
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is currently flying on NASA's Earth Observing System Terra and Aqua satellites, launched in 1999 and 2002, respectively. MODIS reflective solar bands in the visible wavelength range are known to be sensitive to polarized light based on prelaunch polarization sensitivity tests. After about five years of on-orbit operations, it was discovered that the polarization sensitivity at short wavelengths had shown a noticeable increase. In this paper, we examine the impact of polarization on measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectances based on MODIS Collection-6 L1B over pseudoinvariant desert sites. The standard polarization correction equation is used in combination with simulated at-sensor radiances using the second simulation of a satellite signal in the Solar Spectrum, Vector Radiative Transfer Code (6SV). We ignore the polarization contribution from the surface and a ratio approach is used for both 6SV-derived input parameters and observed TOA reflectances. Results indicate that significant gain corrections up to 25% are required near the end of scan for the 412 and 443 nm bands. The polarization correction reduces the seasonal fluctuations in reflectance trends and mirror side ratios from 30% and 12% to 10% and 5%, respectively, for the two bands. Comparison of the effectiveness of the polarization correction with the results from the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group shows a good agreement in the corrected reflectance trending results and their seasonal fluctuations.

TI  - Detecting Wind Farm Impacts on Local Vegetation Growth in Texas and Illinois Using MODIS Vegetation Greenness Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the possible impacts of real-world wind farms (WFs) on vegetation growth using two vegetation indices (VIs), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), at a similar to 250 m resolution from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradimeter (MODIS) for the period 2003-2014. We focus on two well-studied large WF regions, one in western Texas and the other in northern Illinois. These two regions differ distinctively in terms of land cover, topography, and background climate, allowing us to examine whether the WF impacts on vegetation, if any, vary due to the differences in atmospheric and boundary conditions. We use three methods (spatial coupling analysis, time series analysis, and seasonal cycle analysis) and consider two groups of pixels, wind farm pixels (WFPs) and non-wind-farm pixels (NWFPs), to quantify and attribute such impacts during the pre- and post-turbine periods. Our results indicate that the WFs have insignificant or no detectible impacts on local vegetation growth. At the pixel level, the VI changes demonstrate a random nature and have no spatial coupling with the WF layout. At the regional level, there is no systematic shift in vegetation greenness between the pre- and post-turbine periods. At interannual and seasonal time scales, there are no confident vegetation changes over WFPs relative to NWFPs. These results remain robust when the pre- and post-turbine periods and NWFPs are defined differently. Most importantly, the majority of the VI changes are within the MODIS data uncertainty, suggesting that the WF impacts on vegetation, if any, cannot be separated confidently from the data uncertainty and noise. Overall, there are some small decreases in vegetation greenness over WF regions, but no convincing observational evidence is found for the impacts of operating WFs on vegetation growth.

TI  - Snowmelt Pattern Over High-Mountain Asia Detected From Active and Passive Microwave Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The snow in high-mountain Asia (HMA) is of great importance, as it is very sensitive to the climate change. Air temperature and precipitation shifts/increases will be reflected in the timing of snowmelt onset. In this letter, a new algorithm is proposed to determine the snowmelt onset date from active and passive microwave remote sensing data, and the spatial and temporal pattern of snowmelt onset in HMA is studied using active and passive microwave remote sensing for the first time. Over 35 years of passive microwave data and ten years of active microwave data are used to derive the melt onset date in HMA. The active microwave data has 4.5-km resolution so that more detailed spatial pattern of snowmelt onset date can be derived compared to the 25-km resolution passive microwave data. Under climate change background, time series analyses of the snowmelt onset date in HMA are conducted to study the snowmelt onset time changes in recent 35 years. This letter provides an objective evidence of climate change impact on the cryospheric system. Time series analysis shows that the snowmelt onset date is becoming earlier in HMA region during 1988-2015, except the Karakorum Mountains and part of the western Kunlun Mountains. Mean air temperature is compared with the time series snowmelt onset date and the results show that there is strong correlation between mean air temperature and average snowmelt onset date. A 4.5 days/degree rate of snowmelt onset date advancing is found.

TI  - The detection algorithm of irregular dynamic objects
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remote sensing data for marine monitoring, marine rescue, marine pollution monitoring which has a broad monitoring area and fast response time, so in the last 10 years, satellite borne or airborne optical and SAR sensor data have been increasingly used in the field of ocean monitoring. However, based on the dynamic video to carry out the study of the detection of irregular debris blocks from the wrecked ship, aircraft is less. To a great extent, it affects the efficiency of maritime rescue. This paper, based on the dynamic objects detection, Color Space Quantization and property of Human Vision System, takes the irregular wreckage patches as research. And a detection algorithm for dynamic objects is developed with the foundation of Lab channels. To verify that, the calculation of the Euclidean distance between the characteristic parameters of irregular wreckage patches and regular floating ones, and the average Euclidean distance is 0.8245 between the irregular1 and the regular while that between irregular2 and the regular is 4.3645. At the same time, the Hausdorff distance was calculated and verified, and the average distance between the irregular block 1 and the regular block was 2.5975. The average distance between the block 2 and the rule block was 13.8962. Experimental results show that the method is consistent with the results of the second methods, which proves that the first method is scientific and operational. Therefore, it can be found that some parameters including divergence, elongation and eccentricity fluctuate dramatically from those in irregular ones to the regular one, which could be extracted to recognize or distinguish the patches. That is why this paper is of importance in marine rescue and detection of objects on the sea surface.

TI  - Classification of Local Climate Zones Using ASTER and Landsat Data for High-Density Cities
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The local climate zone (LCZ) scheme provides a standard method to conduct urban heat island studies, in which urban landscapes are classified into different LCZs according to urban structures, land cover, and construction materials. Based on the LCZ classification scheme, the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) is a new initiative to generate LCZ maps of cities worldwide with the use of freely available Landsat data. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of the original WUDAPT method in LCZ mapping for high-density cities. To further improve LCZ mapping accuracy for high-density cities, we investigate the usage of both freely available Landsat and advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) satellite data to generate better LCZ mapping results. Experiments on two high-density Chinese cities, Guangzhou and Wuhan, showed that combining Landsat and ASTER data can improve the overall performance of LCZ mapping results, especially for urban areas. This finding indicates that further applications of the WUDAPT method for high-density cities can include both ASTER and Landsat data.

TI  - Learning-Based Sub-Pixel Change Detection Using Coarse Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are effective and efficient for monitoring urban dynamics such as urban cover change and thermal anomalies, but the spatial resolution provided by MODIS data is 500 m (for most of its shorter spectral bands), which results in difficulty in detecting subtle spatial variations within a coarse pixel-especially for a fast-growing city. Given that the historical land use/cover products and satellite data at finer resolution are valuable to reflect the urban dynamics with more spatial details, finer spatial resolution images, as well as land cover products at previous times, are exploited in this study to improve the change detection capability of coarse resolution satellite data. The proposed approach involves two main steps. First, pairs of coarse and finer resolution satellite data at previous times are learned and then applied to generate synthetic satellite data with finer spatial resolution from coarse resolution satellite data. Second, a land cover map was produced at a finer spatial resolution and adjusted with the obtained synthetic satellite data and prior land cover maps. The approach was tested for generating finer resolution synthetic Landsat images using MODIS data from the Guangzhou study area. The finer resolution Landsat-like data were then applied to detect land cover changes with more spatial details. Test results show that the change detection accuracy using the proposed approach with the synthetic Landsat data is much better than the results using the original MODIS data or conventional spatial and temporal fusion-based approaches. The proposed approach is beneficial for detecting subtle urban land cover changes with more spatial details when multitemporal coarse satellite data are available.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th Specialist Meeting on Microwave Radiometry and Remote Sensing of the Environment (MicroRad)
CL  - Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Radio Sci & Engn, Espoo, FINLAND
AB  - This study addresses two significant sources of uncertainty prevalent in snow water equivalent (SWE) retrievals derived from advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR-E) passive microwave (PMW) brightness temperature (Tb) observations at 18.7 and 36.5 GHz. Namely, atmospheric and overlying forest effects are decoupled from the original AMSR-E PMW Tb observations using relatively simple, physically based radiative transfer models. Comparisons against independent Tb measurements collected during airborne PMWTb surveys highlight the effectiveness of the proposed AMSR-E atmospheric decoupling procedure. The atmospheric contribution to Tb ranges from 1 to 3 K depending on the frequency and polarization measured as well as meteorologic conditions at the time of AMSR-E overpass. It is further shown that forest decoupling should be conducted as a function of both land cover type and snow cover class. The exponential decay relationship between the forest structure parameter, namely, MODIS-derived leaf area index (LAI) and forest transmissivity, is fitted across snow-covered terrain in North America. The fitted exponential function can be utilized during forest decoupling activities for evergreen needle-leaved forest and woody savanna regions, but remains uncertain in other forest types due to a sparsity of snow-covered areas. By removing forest-related Tb contributions from the original AMSR-E observations, the results suggest that Tb spectral difference between 18.7 and 36.5 GHz, in general, increases across thinly vegetated to heavily vegetated regions, which can be beneficial when applied to traditional SWE retrieval algorithms.

TI  - Diurnal Scale Controls on C-Band Microwave Backscatter From Snow-Covered First-Year Sea Ice During the Transition From Late Winter to Early Melt
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Diurnal observations of coincident in situ physical-, electrical-, and surface-based C-band microwave scattering properties of a 16-cm saline snow cover on smooth, moderately saline, first-year sea ice are presented for the transition period between late winter and early melt. Statistical regression analysis and backscatter modeling are employed to explore the scattering mechanisms within the snowpack and to assess associations between backscatter and snow properties for both periods. Our results demonstrate substantial variation in both measured snow properties and C-band microwave backscatter over the diurnal cycle during the late winter period when the difference between maximum and minimum air and snow surface temperature was approximately 5 degrees C. No such variation in snow properties and backscatter occurred for the early melt period when our case study exhibited a small diurnal variation (similar to 1 degrees C) in air and snow surface temperature. Statistical and modeled results show significant association between the microwave backscatter and snow properties for the top 8 cm of the snowpack. Basal snow properties do not contribute toward total backscatter in either case. As a result, we are certain that the sea ice surface was a negligible scattering interface during both cases. Correlations between backscatter and snow properties are incidence angle dependent, demonstrating the highest association at 50 degrees. Diurnal backscatter from RADARSAT-2 synthetic aperture radar acquisitions support the influence of varying diurnal snow properties on C-band backscatter, showing a difference of similar to 4 dB for sigma(0)(hh) and sigma(0)(vv) during the late winter period. This difference is reduced to <1 dB for the early melt period.

M3  - Article
AB  - The coregistration of synthetic aperture radar images is of fundamental importance for the generation of interferograms. The high azimuth coregistration requirements imposed by the TOPS acquisition mode imply that an advanced approach for the coregistration of stacked time series images is needed due to temporal decorrelation effects. In some scenarios, the conventional approach of estimating the shifts pairwise with respect to the same master might result insufficient. Therefore, a joint estimation is proposed here, which exploits jointly all interferograms in order to retrieve more accurate results. Simulated data and Sentinel-1A images acquired in IW mode are used to validate this procedure, demonstrating the better performance of the joint approach when compared to the standard single-master approach.

TI  - EFFECTS OF TWO DIFFERENT VOLUME-EQUATED WEEKLY DISTRIBUTED SHORT-TERM PLYOMETRIC TRAINING PROGRAMS ON FUTSAL PLAYERS' PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim was to analyze the effect of 2 different plyometric training programs (i.e., 1 vs. 2 sessions per week, same total weekly volume) on physical performance in futsal players. Forty-four futsal players were divided into 3 training groups differing in weekly plyometric training load: the 2 days per week plyometric training group (PT2D, n = 15), the 1 day per week plyometric training group (PT1D, n = 12), and the control group (CG, n = 12) which did not perform plyometric training. The results of this study showed that in-season futsal training per se was capable of improving repeat sprint ability (RSA) (effect size [ES] = -0.59 to -1.53). However, while change of direction ability (CODA) was maintained during the training period (ES = 0.00), 15-m sprint (ES = 0.73), and vertical jump (VJ) performance (ES = -0.30 to -1.37) were significantly impaired. By contrast, PT2D and PT1D plyometric training were effective in improving futsal players' 15-m sprint (ES = -0.64 to -1.00), CODA (ES = -1.83 to -5.50), and horizontal jump (ES = 0.33-0.64) performance. Nonetheless, all groups (i.e., PT2D, PT1D, and CG) presented a reduction in VJ performance (ES = -0.04 to -1.37). Regarding RSA performance, PT1D showed a similar improvement compared with CG (ES = -0.65 to -1.53) after the training intervention, whereas PT2D did not show significant change (ES = -0.04 to -0.38). These results may have considerable practical relevance for the optimal design of plyometric training programs for futsal players, given that a 1-day-per-week plyometric training program is more efficient than a 2-day-per-week plyometric training program to improve the futsal players' physical performance.

TI  - Chlorophyll fluorescence tracks seasonal variations of photosynthesis from leaf to canopy in a temperate forest
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) remains a challenge despite its importance in the global carbon cycle. Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) has been recently adopted to understand photosynthesis and its response to the environment, particularly with remote sensing data. However, it remains unclear how ChlF and photosynthesis are linked at different spatial scales across the growing season. We examined seasonal relationships between ChlF and photosynthesis at the leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales and explored how leaf-level ChlF was linked with canopy-scale solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in a temperate deciduous forest at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. Our results show that ChlF captured the seasonal variations of photosynthesis with significant linear relationships between ChlF and photosynthesis across the growing season over different spatial scales (R-2 = 0.73, 0.77, and 0.86 at leaf, canopy, and satellite scales, respectively; P < 0.0001). We developed a model to estimate GPP from the tower-based measurement of SIF and leaf-level ChlF parameters. The estimation of GPP from this model agreed well with flux tower observations of GPP (R-2 = 0.68; P < 0.0001), demonstrating the potential of SIF for modeling GPP. At the leaf scale, we found that leaf F-q'/F-m', the fraction of absorbed photons that are used for photochemistry for a light-adapted measurement from a pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer, was the best leaf fluorescence parameter to correlate with canopy SIF yield (SIF/APAR, R-2 = 0.79; P < 0.0001). We also found that canopy SIF and SIF-derived GPP (GPP(SIF)) were strongly correlated to leaf-level biochemistry and canopy structure, including chlorophyll content (R-2 = 0.65 for canopy GPP(SIF) and chlorophyll content; P < 0.0001), leaf area index (LAI) (R-2 = 0.35 for canopy GPP(SIF) and LAI; P < 0.0001), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (R-2 = 0.36 for canopy GPP(SIF) and NDVI; P < 0.0001). Our results suggest that ChlF can be a powerful tool to track photosynthetic rates at leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales.

TI  - Forest Stock Volume Estimation Model Using Textural and Topographic Factors of Landsat8 OLI
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest stock volume (FSV) is an important factor in the investigation of the forest stand and the main indicator to evaluate forest. The traditional methods of forest stock volume measurement are time-consuming and low efficiency. In remote sensing multiple linear regression method the accuracy is low and it is difficult to achieve accurate forestry requirements. As a self-improvement and automatic method which using lots of training data, machine learning can approach any nonlinear system model to improve prediction accuracy. Take into account spectral factor, texture factor, topographical factors in study area JI-UFENG forest. BP-FSV, LSSVM-FSV and RF-FSV multi-spectral forest volume estimation models were established using BP neural network (BP), least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), random forest (RF) method in machine learning. Ground-angle gauge plots measured data, forest resource in subcompartment inventory data for management, forest sub-compartment map, model in conjunction Landsat8 OLI multispectral remote sensing data of sub-forest types were used for forest volume inversion. Programming in Matlab 2014a realization, BP-FSV Model of BP neural network and LSSVM least squares support vector mechanism LSSVM-FSV model were compared and analyzed based on R-2 and RMSE. The results showed that: the p value tested between the predicted values from BP-FSV, LSSVM-FSV and RF-FSV model and observed values is less than 0. 05. It indicates that there is no significant differences between the predicted and observed values of forest stock volume, It shows that the predicted results with the models are ideal, and it is feasible to predict forest stock volume by the models. The model established can improve the forecasting precision of forest stock volume through inversion combining with image spectral, textural, and terrain factor. RF-FSV model in coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest and mixed forest have shown a strong predictive ability, higher than BP -FSV model, which is above or close to LSSVM-FSV model, the RF-FSV model training and predicting accuracy are the highest among the three models, RF-FSV model in the training phase R-2 and RMSE is 0. 839 and 13. 953 3 in coniferous forest, in broad-leaved forest is 0. 924 and 7. 634 1, for mixed forest 0. 902 and 12. 153 9. In the prediction stage R-2 and RMSE in coniferous forests is 0. 816 and 15. 630 1, in broad-leaved forest 0. 913 and 4. 890 2, in mixed forest 0. 865 and 9. 344 1, it can provide a new method for forest stock volume prediction with better prospects.

TI  - Soil moisture retrieval in the Tibetan plateau using optical and passive microwave remote sensing data
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision soil moisture estimation in Tibetan Plateau plays an essential role in the terrestrial water cycle and its impact on the global weather and climate. The Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) is widely used to estimate soil moisture on a large scale, but the accuracy of the TVDI can be influenced by some factors (eg. the surface temperature and NDVI). The AMSR-E data accurately records the soil moisture information, but the spatial resolution is low. This study aims to develop appropriate methods to estimate the soil moisture with high accuracy over the Tibetan Plateau. Firstly, the NDVI was replaced by MSAVI to correct the saturation characteristic of NDVI, and the terrain-induced variations in the land surface temperature (Ts) were removed using the ASTER GDEM data. Then, a soil moisture estimating model was built from a neural network combining the improved TVDI data, AMSR-E data and TRMM data and applied to obtain the soil moisture of three networks (CAMP/Tibet, Maqu, and Nagqu) in Tibetan Plateau. Finally, the method was validated using in situ soil moisture measurements. The results show that the soil moisture retrieved by the present algorithm has a higher accuracy (RMSE=0. 031 similar to 0. 041 m(3) . m(-3)). This study also has applied the algorithms for the Tibetan Plateau continuous soil moisture spatial distribution retrievals, and the trend of the soil moisture was compared with the trend of measured precipitation. The result showed the trends of the two variables had a strong correlation.

TI  - Mathematical Modeling and Accuracy Testing of WorldView-2 Level-1B Stereo Pairs without Ground Control Points
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With very high resolution satellite (VHRS) imagery of 0.5 m, WorldView-2 (WV02) satellite images have been widely used in the field of surveying and mapping. However, for the specific WV02 satellite image geometric orientation model, there is a lack of detailed research and explanation. This paper elaborates the construction process of the WV02 satellite rigorous sensor model (RSM), which considers the velocity aberration, the optical path delay and the atmospheric refraction. We create a new physical inverse model based on a double-iterative method. Through this inverse method, we establish the virtual control grid in the object space to calculate the rational function model (RFM) coefficients. In the RFM coefficient calculation process, we apply the correcting characteristic value method (CCVM) and least squares (LS) method to compare the two experiments' accuracies. We apply two stereo pairs of WV02 Level 1B products in Qinghai, China to verify the algorithm and test image positioning accuracy. Under the no-control conditions, the monolithic horizontal mean square error (RMSE) of the rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) is 3.8 m. This result is 13.7% higher than the original RPC positioning accuracy provided by commercial vendors. The stereo pair horizontal positioning accuracy of both the physical and RPC models is 5.0 m circular error 90% (CE90). This result is in accordance with the WV02 satellite images nominal positioning accuracy. This paper provides a new method to improve the positioning accuracy of the WV02 satellite image RPC model without GCPs.

TI  - Contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging <i>in vivo</i> with laser-activated nanodroplets
T2  - MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This study introduces a real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging method with recently developed laser-activated nanodroplets (LANDs), a new class of phase-change nanometer-scale contrast agents that provides perceptible, sustained high-contrast with ultrasound.Methods: In response to pulsed laser irradiation, the LANDs-, which contain liquid perfluorohexane and optical fuses-blink (vaporize and recondense). That is, they change their state from liquid nanodroplets to gas microbubbles, and then back to liquid nanodroplets. In their gaseous microbubble state, the LANDs provide high-contrast ultrasound, but the microbubbles formed in situ typically recondense in tens of milliseconds. As a result, LAND visualization by standard, real-time ultrasound is limited. However, the periodic optical triggering of LANDs allows us to observe corresponding transient, periodic changes in ultrasound contrast. This study formulates a probability function that measures how ultrasound temporal signals vary in periodicity. Then, the estimated probability is mapped onto a B-scan image to construct a LAND-localized, contrast-enhanced image. We verified our method through phantom and in vivo experiments using an ultrasound system (Vevo 2100, FUJIFILM VisualSonics, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada) operating with a 40-MHz linear array and interfaced with a 10 Hz Nd:YAG laser (Phocus, Opotek Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) operating at the fundamental 1064 nm wavelength.Results: From the phantom study, the results showed improvements in the contrast-to-noise ratio of our approach over conventional ultrasound ranging from 129% to 267%, with corresponding execution times of 0.10 to 0.29 s, meaning that the developed method is computationally efficient while yielding high-contrast ultrasound. Furthermore, in vivo sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging results demonstrated that our technique could accurately identify the SLN.Conclusions: The results indicate that our approach enables efficient and robust LAND localization in real time with substantially improved contrast, which is essential for the successful translation of this contrast agent platform to clinical settings.

TI  - An Assessment of Mean Areal Precipitation Methods on Simulated Stream Flow: A SWAT Model Performance Assessment
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mean areal precipitation (MAP) estimates are essential input forcings for hydrologic models. However, the selection of the most accurate method to estimate MAP can be daunting because there are numerous methods to choose from (e.g., proximate gauge, direct weighted average, surface-fitting, and remotely sensed methods). Multiple methods (n = 19) were used to estimate MAP with precipitation data from 11 distributed monitoring sites, and 4 remotely sensed data sets. Each method was validated against the hydrologic model simulated stream flow using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT was validated using a split-site method and the observed stream flow data from five nested-scale gauging sites in a mixed-land-use watershed of the central USA. Cross-validation results showed the error associated with surface-fitting and remotely sensed methods ranging from -4.5% to -5.1%, and -9.8% to -14.7%, respectively. Split-site validation results showed the percent bias (PBIAS) values that ranged from -4.5% to -160%. Second order polynomial functions especially overestimated precipitation and subsequent stream flow simulations (PBIAS = -160) in the headwaters. The results indicated that using an inverse-distance weighted, linear polynomial interpolation or multiquadric function method to estimate MAP may improve SWAT model simulations. Collectively, the results highlight the importance of spatially distributed observed hydroclimate data for precipitation and subsequent steam flow estimations. The MAP methods demonstrated in the current work can be used to reduce hydrologic model uncertainty caused by watershed physiographic differences.

TI  - Exploring the role of trees in the evolution of meander bends: The Tagliamento River, Italy
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To date, the role of riparian trees in the formation of scroll bars, ridges, and swales during the evolution of meandering channels has been inferred largely from field observations with support from air photographs. In situ field observations are usually limited to relatively short periods of time, whereas the evolution of these morphological features may take decades. By combining field observations of inner bank morphology and overlying riparian woodland structure with a detailed historical analysis of airborne LiDAR data, panchromatic, and color images, we reconstruct the spatial and temporal evolution of the morphology and vegetation across four meander bends of the Tagliamento River, Italy. Specifically we reveal (i) the appearance of deposited trees and elongated vegetated patches on the inner bank of meander bends following flood events; (ii) temporal progression from deposited trees, through small to larger elongated vegetated patches (pioneer islands), to their coalescence into long, linear vegetated features that eventually become absorbed into the continuous vegetation cover of the riparian forest; and (iii) a spatial correspondence between the resulting scrolls and ridge and swale topography, and tree cover development and persistence. We provide a conceptual model of the mechanisms by which vegetation can contribute to the formation of sequence of ridges and swales on the convex bank of meander bends. We discuss how these insights into the biomorphological processes that control meander bends advance can inform modeling activities that aim to describe the lateral and vertical accretion of the floodplain during the evolution of vegetated river meanders.

TI  - Automated Water Classification in the Tibetan Plateau Using Chinese GF-1 WFV Data
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The unique climate and topography of the Tibetan Plateau produce an abundant distribution of lakes. These lakes are important indicators of climate change, and changes in lake area have critical implications for water resources and ecological conditions. Lake area change can be monitored using the huge sets of high-resolution remote sensing data available, but this demands an automatic water classification system. This study develops an algorithm for automatic water classification using Chinese GF-1 (or Gaofen-1) wide-field-of-view (WFV) satellite data. The original GF-1 WFV data were automatically preprocessed with radiometric correction and orthorectification. The single-band threshold and two global-local segmentation methods were employed to distinguish water from non-water features. Three methods of determining the optimal thresholds for normalized difference water index (NDWI) images were compared: Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA); global-local segmentation with thresholds specified by stepwise iteration; and the Otsu method. The water classification from two steps of globallocal segmentations showed better performance than the single-band threshold and ISODATA methods. The GF-1 WFVbased lake mapping across the entire Tibetan Plateau in 2015 using the global-local segmentations with thresholds from the Otsu method showed high quality and efficiency in automatic water classification. This method can be extended to other satellite datasets, and makes the high-resolution global monitoring and mapping of lakes possible.

TI  - Urban Area Extraction by Regional and Line Segment Feature Fusion and Urban Morphology Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas are a complex combination of various land-cover types, and show a variety of land-use structures and spatial layouts. Furthermore, the spectral similarity between built-up areas and bare land is a great challenge when using high spatial resolution remote sensing images to map urban areas, especially for images obtained in dry and cold seasons or high-latitude regions. In this study, a new procedure for urban area extraction is presented based on the high-level, regional, and line segment features of high spatial resolution satellite data. The urban morphology is also analyzed. Firstly, the primitive features-the morphological building index (MBI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and line segments-are extracted from the original images. Chessboard segmentation is then used to segment the image into the same-size objects. In each object, advanced features are then extracted based on the MBI, the NDVI, and the line segments. Subsequently, object-oriented classification is implemented using the above features to distinguish urban areas from non-urban areas. In general, the boundaries of urban and non-urban areas are not very clear, and each urban area has its own spatial structure characteristic. Hence, in this study, an analysis of the urban morphology is carried out to obtain a clear regional structure, showing the main city, the surrounding new development zones, etc. The experimental results obtained with six WorldView-2 and Gaofen-2 images obtained from different regions and seasons demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Atypical Chemokine Receptor 1 Polymorphism can not Affect Susceptibility to Hepatitis C Virus
T2  - BALKAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Hepatitis C virus has infected 130 to 150 million individuals globally. Atypical chemokine receptor 1 has become a focus of research because of its diverse roles in different diseases. However, little is known regarding the association of atypical chemokine receptor 1 polymorphism with susceptibility to hepatitis C virus.Aims: To determine the association of an atypical chemokine receptor 1 polymorphism (rs12075) with hepatitis C virus susceptibility.Study Design: Case-control study.Methods: We collected blood samples from 231 patients infected with hepatitis C virus and 239 blood donors as control subjects. Genotyping of atypical chemokine receptor 1 was performed using a 5'-nuclease assay with TaqMan-minor groove binding probes. Comparisons between hepatitis C virus-infected patients and control subjects were assessed using Fisher's exact test.Results: The genotype frequencies of FY*A/FY*A, FY*A/FY*B and FY*B/FY*B were 86.1%, 13.9% and 0% in the patient group, and 86.2%, 13.4% and 0.4% in the control group, respectively. The difference in atypical chemokine receptor 1 genotype frequencies between hepatitis C virus-infected patients and control group was not significant (p=1.00, OR=1.004, 95% CI=0.5941.695). FY*A and FY*B allele frequencies were 93.1% and 6.9% in the patient group, and 92.9% and 7.1% in the control group, respectively. The difference in atypical chemokine receptor 1 allele frequencies between hepatitis C virus- infected patients and the control group was not significant (p=1.00, OR=0.972, 95% CI=0.5891.603).Conclusion: Our result indicates that atypical chemokine receptor 1 polymorphism (rs12075) does not affect susceptibility to hepatitis C virus.

Four forest succession stages were adopted: stand initiation, young multistory, understory reinitiation, and old growth. Remote sensing metrics describing the spatial patterns of forest structures were derived and a Random Forest learning algorithm was used to classify forest succession stages. These metrics included texture variables from Gray Level Co-occurrence Measures (GLCM), range and sill from the semi-variogram, and the fraction of shadow and its spatial distribution. Among all the derived variables, shadow fractions and the GLCM variables of contrast, mean, and dissimilarity were the most important for characterizing the forest succession stages (classification accuracy of 89%). In addition, a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) derived forest structural index (predicted Lorey's height) was employed to validate the classification result. The classification using imagery spatial variables was shown to be consistent with the LiDAR derived variable (R-2 = 0.68 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 2.39). This study demonstrates that high spatial resolution imagery was able to characterize forest succession stages with promising accuracy and may be considered an alternative to LiDAR data for this kind of application. Also, the results of stand development stages build a framework for future wildlife habitat mapping.

TI  - An urban heat island study in Nanchang City, China based on land surface temperature and social-ecological variables
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the spatial and temporal patterns of land surface temperature (LST) in Nanchang City, China in the context of the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. It also investigates the relationship of LST with six social-ecological variables, namely land use/land cover (LULC), vegetation index, impervious surface index, water index, population density, and fossil-fuel CO2 emission. Landsat data captured in 2000 and 2013 and geographic information systems techniques were used to facilitate the analysis. The results show that the overall mean LST in the study area increased by 1.64 degrees C between 2000 and 2013. This temporal variation in LST might have been influenced by the given environmental conditions at the time when the source satellite images were captured. That said, there have been indications that the detected increase in the overall mean LST has been influenced by the rapid urbanization of the area, resulting in the rapid expansion of impervious surfaces and loss of green spaces. In both time points, the urban LULC class (impervious surfaces) had a consistent high LST and all the other social-ecological variables examined had statistically significant relationships with LST. We recommend that these variables be taken into consideration in the landscape and urban planning process for the future development of the city. This study also emphasizes on the importance of urban green spaces because of their ability to mitigate UHI effects and the valuable ecosystem services they generate for and provide to people. Urban green spaces can help improve the overall livability and environmental sustainability of cities.

TI  - Merging MODIS and Ground-Based Fine Mode Fraction of Aerosols Based on the Geostatistical Data Fusion Method
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of the economy and society, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has not only caused severe environmental problems, but also posed a threat to public health. In order to improve the estimated accuracy of PM2.5, the input data fine mode fraction (FMF), a key parameter to the PM2.5 remote sensing method (PMRS), should be improved due to its significant errors. In this study, we merge the observations of the fine mode fraction (FMF) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and the Sun-sky radiometer Observation Network (SONET) using the universal kriging (UK) method to obtain accurate FMF distribution over eastern China. PM2.5 mass concentration is estimated by the fusion and MODIS FMF distributions using the PMRS model. The results show that the parameters in the variogram are relatively stable except for significant differences in correlation lengths in summer. The FMF in the Winter of 2015 shows that the mean error decreases from 0.38 to 0.13 compared with that from MODIS using leave-one-out cross-validation, with the maximum error decreasing from 0.75 to 0.34, indicating that the UK method can provide better estimates of FMF. We also find that PM2.5 estimated from FMF fusion results is closer to the in situ PM2.5 from the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) (87.2 vs. 88.9 mu g/m(3)).

TI  - MMCR-based characteristic properties of non-precipitating cloud liquid droplets at Naqu site over Tibetan Plateau in July 2014
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Microphysical properties of low level liquid clouds at the Naqu site over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are characterized using empirical regression algorithms based on ground-based millimeter cloud radar (MMCR) boundary mode observations in July 6-31, 2014. Monthly averaged temperature profiles measured over the Naqu site by radiosondes at Beijing local time 8:00 and 20:00 and diurnal variation of microwave radiometer (MWR) temperature profiles indicate a 0 degrees C layer above 1.2 km. Only clouds below 1.2 km are examined in this study and they are assumed as pure liquid in phase. The parameters used in the regression equations have been scaled based on MWR liquid water path when there are only low non-precipitating liquid clouds and MWR measurements are available. Statistically, the characteristic properties of liquid clouds show a single mode distribution for cloud droplet effective radius (r(e)) with most frequent values around 5-7 mu m, and for cloud liquid water content (LWC) with most frequent values below 0.2 g/m(3). The diurnal distribution shows weak variation with slightly low values in the morning and evening time; and the vertical distribution shows increasing cloud droplet re and LWC with height. Especially, cloud droplet r(e) increases from approximately 4-6 mu m to 8-12 mu m with height. The monthly mean cloud droplet r(e) and LWC are approximately 5.7 mu m and 0.07 g/m(3) in July 2014. The liquid cloud properties characterized here have been shown comparable to those obtained from MODIS satellite observations, which has an average value of 5.1 mu m for the same observation period.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon Storage Changes in Coastal Wetlands of the Liaohe Delta, China, Based on Landscape Patterns
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing wetland loss along a coastal area in China was examined through shoreline recession and land use changes. Carbon storage or sequestration in coastal wetland soils was based on vertical marsh accretion and aerial change data. Marshes sequester significant amounts of carbon through vertical accretion; however, large amounts of carbon previously sequestered in the soil profile are lost through rapid land use changes and shoreline recessions. The Liaohe Delta (LHD) was divided into nine landscape types based on Landsat TM digital images from 1991 to 2011. The distributed areas and transfer matrices of each landscape type were calculated. Combined with the organic carbon content and bulk density of 202 soil surface samples from field investigations in 2012, the soil organic carbon pools and stocks were estimated. Results showed that the soil organic carbon pools varied from 0.58 to 9.75 kg m(-2), and organic carbon storage in the upper 20 cm of soil was 1935.92 x 10(4) and 1863.87 x 10(4) t in 1991 and 2011, respectively. We attributed these large losses of carbon to rapid land use changes. The construction of levees along the shoreline has triggered large instantaneous losses of previously sequestered carbon through the destruction of 278.06 km(2) of tidal flats. Our results reveal that the LHD wetlands might not serve as a desired sink of carbon if maladministration practices are applied. These results can provide scientific guidance for decision makers in determining an effective way to maintain the soil carbon pool in the wetlands of the LHD.

TI  - The Mons Rumker volcanic complex of the Moon: A candidate landing site for the Chang'E-5 mission
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mons Rumker is a large volcanic complex in Oceanus Procellarum on the Moon and is a candidate landing site for China's Chang'E-5 sample return mission. We conducted a comprehensive study of the topography, geomorphology, composition, and stratigraphy of the Mons Rumker region with multisource remote sensing data in order to better understand the geology of the region and provide further support for the Chang'E-5 mission. The results show that the Rumker plateau stands 200-1300m above the surrounding mare surface and 75% of the plateau has a slope of less than 3 degrees at a baseline length of 30m. Domes are the most prominent volcanic landforms in Mons Rumker and a total of 22 domes were identified and divided into two types that may represent different stages of volcanic activity. Spectral analyses indicated that Mons Rumker is covered by low-Ti basalt and the dominant mafic mineral is high-calcium pyroxene, though signs of mixing of highland materials and basalt have been found. Mons Rumker has three main basalt units, and their absolute model ages are 3.71Ga, 3.58Ga, and 3.51Ga, respectively. Steep-sided domes could be the youngest volcanic features on the plateau with indications that they were active until the Eratosthenian. A new geologic map of the study region was produced and used to interpret and discuss the geologic evolution of the region. Finally, we propose two candidate landing sites for the Chang'E-5 mission.

TI  - GDP Spatialization and Economic Differences in South China Based on NPP-VIIRS Nighttime Light Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate data on gross domestic product (GDP) at pixel level are needed to understand the dynamics of regional economies. GDP spatialization is the basis of quantitative analysis on economic diversities of different administrative divisions and areas with different natural or humanistic attributes. Data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), carried by the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite, are capable of estimating GDP, but few studies have been conducted for mapping GDP at pixel level and further pattern analysis of economic differences in different regions using the VIIRS data. This paper produced a pixel-level (500 m x 500 m) GDP map for South China in 2014 and quantitatively analyzed economic differences among diverse geomorphological types. Based on a regression analysis, the total nighttime light (TNL) of corrected VIIRS data were found to exhibit R-2 values of 0.8935 and 0.9243 for prefecture GDP and county GDP, respectively. This demonstrated that TNL showed a more significant capability in reflecting economic status (R-2 > 0.88) than other nighttime light indices (R-2 < 0.52), and showed quadratic polynomial relationships with GDP rather than simple linear correlations at both prefecture and county levels. The corrected NPP-VIIRS data showed a better fit than the original data, and the estimation at the county level was better than at the prefecture level. The pixel-level GDP map indicated that: (a) economic development in coastal areas was higher than that in inland areas; (b) low altitude plains were the most developed areas, followed by low altitude platforms and low altitude hills; and (c) economic development in middle altitude areas, and low altitude hills and mountains remained to be strengthened.

TI  - Enhanced orbit determination for BeiDou satellites with FengYun-3C onboard GNSS data
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A key limitation for precise orbit determination of BeiDou satellites, particularly for satellites in geostationary orbit (GEO), is the relative weak geometry of ground stations. Fortunately, data from a low earth orbiting satellite with an onboard GNSS receiver can improve the geometry of GNSS orbit determination compared to using only ground data. The Chinese FengYun-3C (FY3C) satellite carries the GNSS Occultation Sounder equipment with both dual-frequency GPS (L1 and L2) and BeiDou (B1 and B2) tracking capacity. The satellite-induced variations in pseudoranges have been estimated from multipath observables using an elevation-dependent piece-wise linear model, in which the constant biases, i.e., ambiguities and hardware delays, have been removed. For IGSO and MEO satellites, these variations can be seen in onboard B1 and B2 code measurements with elevation above 40A degrees. For GEO satellites, a different behavior has been observed for these signals. The GEO B2 pseudoranges variations are similar to those of IGSO satellites, but no elevation-dependent variations have been identified for GEO B1. A possible cause is contamination of the larger noise in GEO B1 signals. Two sets of precise orbits were determined for FY3C in March 2015 using onboard GPS-only data and onboard BeiDou-only data, respectively. The 3D RMS (Root Mean Square) of overlapping orbit differences (OODs) is 2.3 cm for GPS-only solution. The 3D RMS of orbit differences between BeiDou-only and GPS-only solutions is 15.8 cm. Also, precise orbits and clocks for BeiDou satellites were determined based on 97 global (termed GN) or 15 regional (termed RN) ground stations. Furthermore, also using FY3C onboard BeiDou data, two additional sets of BeiDou orbit and clock products are determined with the data from global (termed GW) or regional (termed RW) stations. In general, the OODs decrease for BeiDou satellites, particularly for GEO satellites, when the FY3C onboard BeiDou data are added. The 3D OODs reductions are 10.0 and 291.2 cm for GW and RW GEO solution with respect to GN and RN solution, respectively. Since the OODs in the along-track direction dominate the OODs reduction, no improvement has been observed by satellite laser ranging, which mainly validates the accuracy of the radial orbital component. With the GW BeiDou orbit and clock products, the FY3C orbits determined with onboard BeiDou-only data also show improvement in comparison with those determined with BeiDou GN products.

TI  - Object-based cloud detection of multitemporal high-resolution stationary satellite images
T2  - OPTICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing that utilizes highly accurate cloud detection is important for monitoring natural disasters. The GaoFen-4, China's first high-resolution stationary satellite, was recently launched and acquires imagery at a spatial resolution of 50 m and a high temporal resolution (up to 10 min). An object-based cloud detection method was conducted for a time series of GaoFen-4 images. The cloudy objects were obtained from the individual images, and the outlier detection of multiple temporal objects was further processed for refinement. In the initial cloud detection, the objects were segmented by the mean-shift algorithm, and their morphological features were extracted by extended attribute profiles. The threshold-detected cloudy objects were trained according to spectral and morphological features, and the initial objects were classified as cloudy or clear by a regularized least-squares classifier. Furthermore, the medians and standard deviations of the classified cloudy and clear objects were calculated and subsequently refined by the outlier detection of multiple temporal images. The clear object features deviated more than a multiple of standard deviations from the medians of the clear objects that were classified as cloudy objects. Additionally, the refined clear objects were obtained by a similar outlier detection method. Flood event monitoring using GaoFen-4 images showed that the average overall accuracy of the initial cloud detection was 83.4% and increased to 93.3% after refinement. This object-based cloud detection method was insensitive to variations in land objects and can effectively improve cloud detection within small or thin areas, which can be helpful for the monitoring of natural disasters.

TI  - Quantitative and detailed spatiotemporal patterns of drought in China during 2001-2013
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigation of spatiotemporal patterns of drought is essential to understand the mechanism and influencing factors of drought occurrence and development. Due to the differences in designation of various drought indices, it remains a great challenge to obtain an accurate result in spatiotemporal patterns investigation of drought. In this study, a quantitative drought monitoring index (i.e., Integrated Surface Drought Index, ISDI) was used to identify spatiotemporal patterns of drought and the drought variation trend at the pixel level during 20012013 over China. Eco-geographical regionalization was used as an evaluation unit to distinguish the ecological and climatic background of drought over the whole country. The results showed that the spatial distribution of drought intensity has a strong correlation with eco-geographical regionalization in China. The severe drought areas were mainly concentrated in sub-humid regions and semi-arid regions of medium temperate zones, and humid regions of middle subtropical zones. The regions with higher drought probabilities were most distributed in the south and north of China, while the regions in central and western China exhibited lower drought probabilities. The most obvious decreasing trend of WI from 2001 to 2013 was located in the northeast of China and south of the Yangtze River. This decrease in ISDI over time indicates a trend for progressive aggravation of drought severity in these areas. This study shows great promise in informing the future drought prevention measures and management policies under the background of more frequent extreme climate events. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ecolinguistics: Towards a new harmony
T2  - LANGUAGE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, I argue that only dialogue that links science, aesthetics, and axiology can solve the ecological crisis' moral concerns. Serious consideration can thus be given to raising bio-ecological awareness (Section 1). The paper traces three global waves in the emerging field of ecolinguistics (Section 2). Their divergences and disharmony have hindered awareness of the bio-ecology and the benign development of the discipline (Section 3). To bring clarity to the field, it is therefore proposed that the roots of disharmony tap into the moral and ethical harmony of Chinese worldview (Section 4). By adopting a harmonious view of language, mind and the world, a future harmonious ecolinguistics can be realized to become a life science (Section 5). In short, a synthesis of science, axiology and aesthetics can bring new harmony to European and Chinese ecolinguistics. Such an outcome would be a significant step in improving human bio-ecological awareness and resolving the ecological crisis (Section 6). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Landscape pattern changes of <i>Carex </i>and its response to water level in Lake Poyang Wet-land
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation and evolution of vegetation landscape are controlled by the hydrological processes in freshwater wetlands. Based on the Landsat TM/ETM+ remote sensing images, the landscape information on Lake Poyang Wetland in 1992, 1999, 2006 and 2012 was extracted by using decision tree classification. The spatial variation of Carex landscape was analyzed by means of landscape pattern index, transfer matrix and centriod shifting methods. Meanwhile, the relationship between Carex landscape and hydrological processes was also preliminarily discussed. Results showed that the distribution and area of Carex landscape in autumn were influenced by the water level and recession process of Lake Poyang Wetland during the study period, the slow recession of intermediate-elevation (14-16 m) areas and fast emersion of low-elevation (12-14 m) areas play a more important role in the formation and expansion of Carex landscape than the water level. The spatial pattern Carex landscape in Lake Poyang Wetland was closely related to the annual mean water level. In the year of low annual mean water level, the distribution elevation of Carex landscape is relatively low, some exposed mudflats were occupied by Carex landscape, and the original distribution areas of Carex landscape were partly replaced by Phragmites and Triarrhena landscape, the fragmentation degree of Carex landscape was relatively heavy. While in the year with high annual mean water level, many low bottomlands were submerged, the elevation of Carex distributed was relatively high. Many regions of Phragmites and Triarrhena landscape were occupied by Carex, while the original distribution areas of Carex landscape became partly mudflat or water landscape types. Affected by the rising water level, Carex landscape mainly shifted and centered on the high zones of estuary of input rivers and lakeshore, thus the fragmentation degree of Carex landscape was relatively light. In addition, water level inter-annual fluctuation will affect the centroid position of Carex landscape, with centriod shifting to the lakeshore during the rising water level; vice verse to the lake center during the falling water level falling.

TI  - Hydrological impacts of land use-land cover change and detention basins on urban flood hazard: a case study of Poisar River basin, Mumbai, India
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding in urban area is a major natural hazard causing loss of life and damage to property and infrastructure. The major causes of urban floods include increase in precipitation due to climate change effect, drastic change in land use-land cover (LULC) and related hydrological impacts. In this study, the change in LULC between the years 1966 and 2009 is estimated from the toposheets and satellite images for the catchment of Poisar River in Mumbai, India. The delineated catchment area of the Poisar River is 20.19 km(2). For the study area, there is an increase in built-up area from 16.64 to 44.08% and reduction in open space from 43.09 to 7.38% with reference to total catchment area between the years 1966 and 2009. For the flood assessment, an integrated approach of Hydrological Engineering Centre-Hydrological Modeling System (HEC-HMS), HEC-GeoHMS and HEC-River analysis system (HEC-RAS) with HEC-GeoRAS has been used. These models are integrated with geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing data to develop a regional model for the estimation of flood plain extent and flood hazard analysis. The impact of LULC change and effects of detention ponds on surface runoff as well as flood plain extent for different return periods have been analyzed, and flood plain maps are developed. From the analysis, it is observed that there is an increase in peak discharge from 2.6 to 20.9% for LULC change between the years 1966 and 2009 for the return periods of 200, 100, 50, 25, 10 and 2 years. For the LULC of year 2009, there is a decrease in peak discharge from 10.7% for 2-year return period to 34.5% for 200-year return period due to provision of detention ponds. There is also an increase in flood plain extent from 14.22 to 42.5% for return periods of 10, 25, 50 and 100 years for LULC change between the year 1966 and year 2009. There is decrease in flood extent from 4.5% for 25-year return period to 7.7% for 100-year return period and decrease in total flood hazard area by 14.9% due to provisions of detention pond for LULC of year 2009. The results indicate that for low return period rainfall events, the hydrological impacts are higher due to geographic characteristics of the region. The provision of detention ponds reduces the peak discharge as well as the extent of the flooded area, flood depth and flood hazard considerably. The flood plain maps and flood hazard maps generated in this study can be used by the Municipal Corporation for flood disaster and mitigation planning. The integration of available software models with GIS and remote sensing proves to be very effective for flood disaster and mitigation management planning and measures.

TI  - A human-driven decline in global burned area
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is an essential Earth system process that alters ecosystem and atmospheric composition. Here we assessed long- term fire trends using multiple satellite data sets. We found that global burned area declined by 24.3 +/- 8.8% over the past 18 years. The estimated decrease in burned area remained robust after adjusting for precipitation variability and was largest in savannas. Agricultural expansion and intensification were primary drivers of declining fire activity. Fewer and smaller fires reduced aerosol concentrations, modified vegetation structure, and increased the magnitude of the terrestrial carbon sink. Fire models were unable to reproduce the pattern and magnitude of observed declines, suggesting that they may overestimate fire emissions in future projections. Using economic and demographic variables, we developed a conceptual model for predicting fire in human-dominated landscapes.

TI  - Establishing an ICD-10 code based SARI-surveillance in Germany - description of the system and first results from five recent influenza seasons
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Syndromic surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) is important to assess seriousness of disease as recommended by WHO for influenza. In 2015 the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) started to collaborate with a private hospital network to develop a SARI surveillance system using case-based data on ICD-10 codes. This first-time description of the system shows its application to the analysis of five influenza seasons.Methods: Since week 40/2015, weekly updated anonymized data on discharged patients overall and on patients with respiratory illness including ICD-10 codes of primary and secondary diagnoses are transferred from the network data center to RKI. Retrospective datasets were also provided. Our descriptive analysis is based on data of 47 sentinel hospitals collected between weeks 1/2012 to 20/2016. We applied three different SARI case definitions (CD) based on ICD-10 codes for discharge diagnoses of respiratory tract infections (J09 - J22): basic CD (BCD), using only primary diagnoses; sensitive CD (SCD), using primary and secondary diagnoses; timely CD (TCD), using only primary diagnoses of patients hospitalized up to one week. We compared the CD with regard to severity, age distribution and timeliness and with results from the national primary care sentinel system.Results: The 47 sentinel hospitals covered 3.6% of patients discharged from all German hospitals in 2013. The SCD comprised 2.2 times patients as the BCD, and 3.6 times as many as the TCD. Time course of SARI cases corresponded well to results from primary care surveillance and influenza virus circulation. The patients fulfilling the TCD had been completely reported after 3 weeks, which was fastest among the CD. The proportion of SARI cases among patients was highest in the youngest age group of below 5-year-olds. However, the age group 60 years and above contributed most SARI cases. This was irrespective of the CD used.Conclusions: In general, available data and the implemented reporting system are appropriate to provide timely and reliable information on SARI in inpatients in Germany. Our ICD-10-based approach proved to be useful for fulfilling requirements for SARI surveillance. The exploratory approach gave valuable insights in data structure and emphasized the advantages of different CD.

TI  - Dust radiative effects on atmospheric thermodynamics and tropical cyclogenesis over the Atlantic Ocean using WRF-Chem coupled with an AOD data assimilation system
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the dust radiative effects on atmospheric thermodynamics and tropical cyclogenesis over the Atlantic Ocean using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) coupled with an aerosol data assimilation (DA) system. MODIS AOD (aerosol optical depth) data were assimilated with the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) DA scheme to depict the Saharan dust outbreak events in the 2006 summer. Comparisons with Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET), and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) observations showed that the system was capable of reproducing the dust distribution. Two sets of 180 h forecasts were conducted with the dust radiative effects activated (RE_ON) and inactivated (RE_OFF) respectively. Differences between the RE_ON and RE_OFF forecasts showed that low-altitude (high-altitude) dust inhibits (favors) convection owing to changes in convective inhibition (CIN). Heating in dust layers immediately above the boundary layer increases inhibition, whereas sufficiently elevated heating allows cooling above the boundary layer that reduces convective inhibition. Semi-direct effects in which clouds are altered by thermodynamic changes are also noted, which then alter cloudradiative temperature (T) changes. The analysis of a tropical cyclone (TC) suppression case on 5 September shows evidence of enhanced convective inhibition by direct heating in dust, but it also suggests that the low-predictability dynamics of moist convection reduces the determinism of the effects of dust on timescales of TC development (days).

TI  - Extension of physical scaling method and its application towards downscaling climate model based near surface air temperature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Physical scaling (SP) method is a statistical downscaling approach where model-based climate data are downscaled taking into consideration large-scale climate, elevation and land-cover at the location of interest. In this study, the downscaling skills of an ensemble of SP method and its variants and Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM) towards downscaling North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) temperature data are compared. Two downscaling approaches: direct and indirect, two versions: SP and surrounding pixel information and three functional forms: linear regression, quantile regression and generalized additive models are considered to prepare the method ensemble. To evaluate method performance, a leave-one-out cross-validation approach is adopted. Results indicate that SP method and its variants have comparable skill to SDSM. Further method skill is found to be only marginally influenced by the choice of method version and functional form, and considerably influenced by the choice of approach. The ensemble of models is thereafter used to downscale future air temperature projections made by a global climate model: FGOALS-s2. It is found that downscaled future projections are most significantly influenced by the choice of version, followed by the choice of approach and the choice of functional form in the decreasing order of importance.

TI  - Molecular characterization of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> isolates from stool specimens of outpatients in sentinel hospitals Beijing, China, 2010-2015
T2  - GUT PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is an opportunistic pathogen associated with community-acquired infections and nosocomial infections. From 2010 to 2015, K. pneumoniae testing was included into the exiting diarrhea-syndrome surveillance with objective to estimate the prevalence of K. pneumoniae in diarrhea-syndrome patients, test antibiotics susceptibility and investigate molecular characteristics.Methods: Stool specimens from diarrhea-syndrome outpatients were cultured and identified the pathogens by the Vitek2 Compact instrument. The isolated K. pneumoniae strains were tested for antibiotics susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) method, and subtyped by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST).Results: 22 K. pneumoniae strains were identified from 4340 stool specimens of outpatients who visited sentinel hospitals in Beijing during 2010-2015. All strains were sensitive to gentamicin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefepime, imipenem. The highest resistance rate of K. pneumoniae strains was 100% to amoxicillin-clavu-lanate, followed by 72.7% to ampicillin. These 22 K. pneumoniae strains were characterized into 21 different PFGE types and 20 MLST types with less similarity.Conclusions: The detection rate of K. pneumoniae in stool specimens from outpatients with diarrhea syndromes was about 0.5% in Beijing. Less similarity of the isolated strains indicated the unlikely long-term circulating of K. pneumoniae in the community. ST23 was the most common genotype. Drug resistance of the community-acquired K. pneumoniae was not a serious problem in comparing with hospital-acquired infections. High vigilance in the community-acquired K. pneumoniae strains and investigation of pathogens' microbiological characteristics are valuable for signals detection for drug resistance in population and strains variation.

TI  - Evapotranspiration seasonality across the Amazon Basin
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) of Amazon forests is a main driver of regional climate patterns and an important indicator of ecosystem functioning. Despite its importance, the seasonal variability of ET over Amazon forests, and its relationship with environmental drivers, is still poorly understood. In this study, we carry out a water balance approach to analyse seasonal patterns in ET and their relationships with water and energy drivers over five sub-basins across the Amazon Basin. We used in situ measurements of river discharge, and remotely sensed estimates of terrestrial water storage, rainfall, and solar radiation. We show that the characteristics of ET seasonality in all sub-basins differ in timing and magnitude. The highest mean annual ET was found in the northern Rio Negro basin (similar to 1497 mm year(-1)) and the lowest values in the Solimoes River basin (similar to 986 mm year(-1)). For the first time in a basin-scale study, using observational data, we show that factors limiting ET vary across climatic gradients in the Amazon, confirming local-scale eddy covariance studies. Both annual mean and seasonality in ET are driven by a combination of energy and water availability, as neither rainfall nor radiation alone could explain patterns in ET. In southern basins, despite seasonal rainfall deficits, deep root water uptake allows increasing rates of ET during the dry season, when radiation is usually higher than in the wet season. We demonstrate contrasting ET seasonality with satellite greenness across Amazon forests, with strong asynchronous relationships in ever-wet watersheds, and positive correlations observed in seasonally dry watersheds. Finally, we compared our results with estimates obtained by two ET models, and we conclude that neither of the two tested models could provide a consistent representation of ET seasonal patterns across the Amazon.

TI  - Synthetic aperture radar analysis of floating ice at Terra Nova Bay-an application to ice eddy parameter extraction
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the framework of a study of ice formation in Antarctica, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image acquisitions were planned over Terra Nova Bay (TNB). Thanks to the European Space Agency (ESA) Third Party Mission program, Cosmo-SkyMed and Radarsat-2 images over TNB were obtained for the period of February 20 to March 20, 2015; in addition, available Sentinel-1 images for the same period were retrieved from the ESA scientific data hub. The first inspection of the images revealed the presence of a prominent eddy, i.e., an ice vortex presumably caused by the wind blowing from the continent. The important parameters of an eddy are its area and lifetime. While the eddy lifetime was easily obtained from the image sequence, the area was measured using a specific processing scheme that consists of nonlinear filtering and Markov random field segmentation. The main goal of our study was to develop a segmentation scheme to detect and measure "objects" in SAR images. In addition, the connection between eddy area and wind field was investigated using parametric and nonparametric correlation functions; statistically significant correlation values were obtained in the analyzed period. After March 15, a powerful katabatic wind completely disrupted the surface eddy. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

TI  - Use of Native Yeast Strains for In-Bottle Fermentation to Face the Uniformity in Sparkling Wine Production
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The in-bottle fermentation of sparkling wines is currently triggered by few commercialized Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. This lack of diversity in tirage yeast cultures leads to a prevalent uniformity in sensory profiles of the end products. The aim of this study has been to exploit the natural multiplicity of yeast populations in order to introduce variability in sparkling wines throughout the re-fermentation step. A collection of 133 S. cerevisiae strains were screened on the basis of technological criteria (fermenting power and vigor, SO2 tolerance, alcohol tolerance, flocculence) and qualitative features (acetic acid, glycerol and H2S productions). These activities allowed the selection of yeasts capable of dominating the in-bottle fermentation in actual cellar conditions: in particular, the performances of FX and FY strains (isolated in Franciacorta area), and OX and OY strains (isolated in Oltrepo Pavese area), were compared to those of habitually used starter cultures (IOC18-2007, EC1118, Lalvin DV10), by involving nine wineries belonging to the two Consortia of Appellation of Origin. The microbiological analyses of samples have revealed that the indigenous strains showed an increased latency period and a higher cultivability along the aging time than the commercial starter cultures do. Results of chemical analyses and sensory evaluation of the samples after 18 months sur lies have shown that significant differences (p < 0.05) were present among the strains for alcoholic strength, carbon dioxide overpressure and pleasantness, whereas they were not observed for residual sugars content, titratable acidity or volatile acidity. Indigenous S. cerevisiae exhibited comparable values respect to the commercial starter cultures. The ANOVA has also proven that the base wine formulation is a key factor, by significantly affecting (p < 0.01) some oenological parameters of wine, like alcoholic strength, volatile acidity, carbon dioxide overpressure, titratable acidity and dry extract. The use of native yeast strains for the re-fermentation step can be considered a convenient way for introducing differentiation to the final product without modifying the traditional technology. In a perspective of "precision enology," here the wine is designed on specific vine cultivars and microorganisms, this work underlines that exploring yeast biodiversity is a strategic activity to improve the production.

TI  - Automatic detection of snow avalanche debris in central Svalbard using C-band SAR data
T2  - POLAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow avalanches pose a threat to people and infrastructure in and around Svalbard's main settlement Longyearbyen. Since January 2016, publically available regional avalanche warnings are issued daily for Nordenskiold Land, the area around Longyearbyen. Avalanche warning services rely on information of when and where avalanches occur. Systematic field observations of avalanche activity are not feasible across all of the vast area (ca. 7200 km(2)) of Nordenskiold Land. Svalbard also experiences over four months of polar night per year. However, using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), a weather-and light-independent technique, large areas can be monitored at once. We have developed a SAR-based automatic avalanche debris detection algorithm and tested it on satellite image pairs from Sentinel-1A at medium resolution and from Radarsat-2 at very high resolution. The detection algorithm uses a threshold value that distinguishes avalanche debris with increased backscatter from undisturbed snow with lower backscatter. Depending on the spatial resolution of the SAR image, different post-processing filters are applied. There is a promising level of agreement between automatic detection results and manual identification of avalanche debris, but the algorithm's drawback is marked overdetection. We envision that further improvements in the form of avalanche debris shape recognition could ultimately lead to the development of operational avalanche activity maps. These frequently updated maps could then assist in regional avalanche forecasting, notably in and around Longyearbyen, Svalbard. The detection algorithm we have developed could eventually have applications in other avalanche-prone regions in the world.

TI  - Modeling the water budget of the Upper Blue Nile basin using the JGrass-NewAge model system and satellite data
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Blue Nile basin is one of the most data-scarce regions in developing countries, and hence the hydrological information required for informed decision making in water resource management is limited. The hydrological complexity of the basin, tied with the lack of hydrometeorological data, means that most hydrological studies in the region are either restricted to small subbasins where there are relatively better hydrometeorological data available, or on the whole-basin scale but at very coarse timescales and spatial resolutions. In this study we develop a methodology that can improve the state of the art by using available, but sparse, hydrometeorological data and satellite products to obtain the estimates of all the components of the hydrological cycle (precipitation, evapotranspiration, discharge, and storage). To obtain the water-budget closure, we use the JGrass-NewAge system and various remote sensing products. The satellite product SM2R-CCI is used for obtaining the rainfall inputs, SAF EUMETSAT for cloud cover fraction for proper net radiation estimation, GLEAM for comparison with NewAge-estimated evapotranspiration, and GRACE gravimetry data for comparison of the total water storage amounts available in the whole basin. Results are obtained at daily time steps for the period 1994-2009 (16 years), and they can be used as a reference for any water resource development activities in the region. The overall water-budget analysis shows that precipitation of the basin is 1360 +/- 230mm per year. Evapotranspiration accounts for 56% of the annual water budget, runoff is 33 %, storage varies from -10 to + 17% of the water budget.

TI  - Whole-body imaging of lymphovascular niches identifies pre-metastatic roles of midkine
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous melanoma is a type of cancer with an inherent potential for lymph node colonization, which is generally preceded by neolymphangiogenesis(1-3). However, sentinel lymph node removal does not necessarily extend the overall survival of patients with melanoma(4,5). Moreover, lymphatic vessels collapse and become dysfunctional as melanomas progress(6,7). Therefore, it is unclear whether (and how) lymphangiogenesis contributes to visceral metastasis. Soluble and vesicle-associated proteins secreted by tumours and/or their stroma have been proposed to condition pre-metastatic sites in patients with melanoma(8-14). Still, the identities and prognostic value of lymphangiogenic mediators remain unclear(2,14). Moreover, our understanding of lymphangiogenesis (in melanomas and other tumour types) is limited by the paucity of mouse models for live imaging of distal pre-metastatic niches(15). Injectable lymphatic tracers have been developed(7), but their limited diffusion precludes whole-body imaging at visceral sites(16). Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) is an attractive 'lymphoreporter' 17 because its expression is strongly downregulated in normal adult lymphatic endothelial cells, but is activated in pathological situations such as inflammation and cancer(17,18). Here, we exploit this inducibility of VEGFR3 to engineer mouse melanoma models for whole-body imaging of metastasis generated by human cells, clinical biopsies or endogenously deregulated oncogenic pathways. This strategy revealed early induction of distal pre-metastatic niches uncoupled from lymphangiogenesis at primary lesions. Analyses of the melanoma secretome and validation in clinical specimens showed that the heparin-binding factor midkine is a systemic inducer of neo-lymphangiogenesis that defines patient prognosis. This role of midkine was linked to a paracrine activation of the mTOR pathway in lymphatic endothelial cells. These data support the use of VEGFR3 reporter mice as a 'MetAlert' discovery platform for drivers and inhibitors of metastasis.

AB  - Climatic time series for Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau locations are rare. Although glacier shrinkage is well described, the relationship between mass balance and climatic variation is less clear. We studied the effect of climate changes on mass balance by analyzing the complex principal components of mass changes during 2003-2015 using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite data. Mass change in the eastern Himalayas, Karakoram, Pamirs, and northwestern India was most sensitive to variation in the first principal component, which explained 54% of the change. Correlation analysis showed that the first principal component is related to the Indian monsoon and the correlation coefficient is 0.83. Mass change on the eastern Qinghai plateau, eastern Himalayas-Qiangtang Plateau-Pamirs area and northwestern India was most sensitive to variation of the second major factor, which explained 16% of the variation. The second major component is associated with El Nio; the correlation coefficient was 0.30 and this exceeded the 95% confidence interval of 0.17. Mass change on the western and northwestern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau was most sensitive to the variation of its third major component, responsible for 6% of mass balance change. The third component may be associated with climate change from the westerlies and La Nia. The third component and El Nio have similar signals of 6.5 year periods and opposite phases. We conclude that El Nio now has the second largest effect on mass balance change of this region, which differs from the traditional view that the westerlies are the second largest factor.

TI  - Estimating canine cancer incidence: findings from a population-based tumour registry in northwestern Italy
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Canine cancer registry data can be put to good use in epidemiological studies. Quantitative comparison of tumour types may reveal unusual cancer frequencies, providing directions for research and generation of hypotheses of cancer causation in a specific area, and suggest leads for identifying risk factors. Here we report canine cancer incidence rates calculated from a population-based registry in an area without any known specific environmental hazard.Results: In its 90 months of operation from 2001 to 2008 (the observation period in this study), the population-based Piedmont Canine Cancer Registry collected data on 1175 tumours confirmed by histopathological diagnosis. The incidence rate was 804 per 100,000 dog-years for malignant tumours and 897 per 100,000 dog-years for benign tumours. Higher rates for all cancers were observed in purebred dogs, particularly in Yorkshire terrier and Boxer. The most prevalent malignant neoplasms were cutaneous mastocytoma and hemangiopericytoma, and mammary gland complex carcinoma and simplex carcinoma.Conclusions: The Piedmont canine cancer registry is one of few of its kind whose operations have been consistently supported by long-term public funding. The registry-based cancer incidence rates were estimated with particular attention to the validity of data collection, thus minimizing the potential for bias. The findings on cancer incidence rates may provide a reliable reference for comparison studies. Researches conducted on dogs, used as sentinels for community exposure to environmental carcinogens, can be useful to detect excess risks in the incidence of malignant tumours in the human population.

TI  - Joint Sentinel-1 and SMAP data assimilation to improve soil moisture estimates
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - SMAP (Soil Moisture Active and Passive) radiometer observations at similar to 40 km resolution are routinely assimilated into the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model to generate the 9 km SMAP Level-4 Soil Moisture product. This study demonstrates that adding high-resolution radar observations from Sentinel-1 to the SMAP assimilation can increase the spatiotemporal accuracy of soil moisture estimates. Radar observations were assimilated either separately from or simultaneously with radiometer observations. Assimilation impact was assessed by comparing 3-hourly, 9 km surface and root-zone soil moisture simulations with in situ measurements from 9 km SMAP core validation sites and sparse networks, from May 2015 to December 2016. The Sentinel-1 assimilation consistently improved surface soil moisture, whereas root-zone impacts were mostly neutral. Relatively larger improvements were obtained from SMAP assimilation. The joint assimilation of SMAP and Sentinel-1 observations performed best, demonstrating the complementary value of radar and radiometer observations.

TI  - Bright birds are cautious: seasonally conspicuous plumage prompts risk avoidance by male superb fairy-wrens
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased predation risk is considered a cost of having conspicuous colours, affecting the anti-predator behaviour of colourful animals. However, this is difficult to test, as individual factors often covary with colour and behaviour. We used alarm call playback and behavioural observations to assess whether individual birds adjust their response to risk according to their plumage colour. Male superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus) change from a dull brown to conspicuous blue plumage each year, allowing the behaviour of different coloured birds to be compared while controlling for withinin-dividual effects. Because the timing of colour change varies among males, blue and brown birds can also be compared at the same time of year, controlling for seasonal effects on behaviour. While blue, fairy-wrens fled more often in response to alarm calls, and took longer to emerge from cover. Blue fairy-wrens also spent more time foraging in cover and being vigilant. Group members appeared to benefit from the presence of blue males, as they reduced their response to alarms, and allocated less time to sentinel behaviour when a blue male was close by. We suggest that fairy-wrens perceive themselves to be at a higher risk of predation while in conspicuous plumage and adjust their behaviour accordingly.

TI  - How robust are in situ observations for validating satellite-derived albedo over the dark zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet?
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Calibration and validation of satellite-derived ice sheet albedo data require high-quality, in situ measurements commonly acquired by up and down facing pyranometers mounted on automated weather stations (AWS). However, direct comparison between ground and satellite-derived albedo can only be justified when the measured surface is homogeneous at the length-scale of both satellite pixel and in situ footprint. Here we use digital imagery acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle to evaluate point-to-pixel albedo comparisons across the western, ablating margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Our results reveal that in situ measurements overestimate albedo by up to 0.10 at the end of the melt season because the ground footprints of AWS-mounted pyranometers are insufficient to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the ice surface as it progressively ablates and darkens. Statistical analysis of 21 AWS across the entire Greenland Ice Sheet reveals that almost half suffer from this bias, including some AWS located within the wet snow zone.Plain Language Summary Ground measurements of reflectivity, such as those made by automated weather stations, are often used to determine the accuracy of satellite measurements. But the footprints of the instruments mounted on automated weather stations are usually much smaller than the pixel of the satellite image, meaning that comparison between the two is only justified when the surface is relatively uniform. We use high resolution imagery collected by a UAV to demonstrate that the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet is often not uniform at the scale of both the weather station and satellite pixel due to the presence of impurities, surface water and crevasses. This means that a point measurement of reflectivity might not capture the full variability of the surface, resulting in discrepancies when compared to satellite image pixels. Furthermore, weather stations are usually located on safe areas of flat, bare ice or snow, so they usually overestimate reflectivity in comparison to the satellite pixel. We argue that if unrepresentative ground measurements are removed from satellite comparison exercises then the uncertainty in satellite products could be reduced. Hence, the long-term decline in Greenland Ice Sheet reflectivity between 2000 and 2012 might be more significant than previously thought.

TI  - Transient modeling of the ground thermal conditions using satellite data in the Lena River delta, Siberia
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost is a sensitive element of the cryosphere, but operational monitoring of the ground thermal conditions on large spatial scales is still lacking. Here, we demonstrate a remote-sensing-based scheme that is capable of estimating the transient evolution of ground temperatures and active layer thickness by means of the ground thermal model CryoGrid 2. The scheme is applied to an area of approximately 16 000 km(2) in the Lena River delta (LRD) in NE Siberia for a period of 14 years. The forcing data sets at 1 km spatial and weekly temporal resolution are synthesized from satellite products and fields of meteorological variables from the ERA-Interim reanalysis. To assign spatially distributed ground thermal properties, a stratigraphic classification based on geomorphological observations and mapping is constructed, which accounts for the large-scale patterns of sediment types, ground ice and surface properties in the Lena River delta.A comparison of the model forcing to in situ measurements on Samoylov Island in the southern part of the study area yields an acceptable agreement for the purpose of ground thermal modeling, for surface temperature, snow depth, and timing of the onset and termination of the winter snow cover. The model results are compared to observations of ground temperatures and thaw depths at nine sites in the Lena River delta, suggesting that thaw depths are in most cases reproduced to within 0.1m or less and multi-year averages of ground temperatures within 1-2 degrees C. Comparison of monthly average temperatures at depths of 2-3m in five boreholes yielded an RMSE of 1.1 degrees C and a bias of -0.9 degrees C for the model results. The highest ground temperatures are calculated for grid cells close to the main river channels in the south as well as areas with sandy sediments and low organic and ice contents in the central delta, where also the largest thaw depths occur. On the other hand, the lowest temperatures are modeled for the eastern part, which is an area with low surface temperatures and snow depths. The lowest thaw depths are modeled for Yedoma permafrost featuring very high ground ice and soil organic contents in the southern parts of the delta.The comparison to in situ observations indicates that transient ground temperature modeling forced by remote-sensing data is generally capable of estimating the thermal state of permafrost (TSP) and its time evolution in the Lena River delta. The approach could hence be a first step towards remote detection of ground thermal conditions and active layer thickness in permafrost areas.

TI  - Deforestation effects on Amazon forest resilience
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Through vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks, rainfall reductions as a result of Amazon deforestation could reduce the resilience on the remaining forest to perturbations and potentially lead to large-scale Amazon forest loss. We track observation-based water fluxes from sources (evapotranspiration) to sinks (rainfall) to assess the effect of deforestation on continental rainfall. By studying 21st century deforestation scenarios, we show that deforestation can reduce dry season rainfall by up to 20% far from the deforested area, namely, over the western Amazon basin and the La Plata basin. As a consequence, forest resilience is systematically eroded in the southwestern region covering a quarter of the current Amazon forest. Our findings suggest that the climatological effects of deforestation can lead to permanent forest loss in this region. We identify hot spot regions where forest loss should be avoided to maintain the ecological integrity of the Amazon forest.Plain Language Summary The Amazon forest is a giant water pump. It releases huge amount of water to the atmosphere by transpiration. This water is then recycled back as precipitation over the forest, sometimes in remote locations following large-scale transport in the atmosphere. We use an empirical approach based on satellite images to quantify changes in the water flux following 21st century deforestation scenarios. We find rainfall reductions by up to 20% downwind of the deforested area (western Amazon and subtropical South America). This in turn increases the ecological vulnerability of the remaining forest to perturbations (logging, fire, and extreme drought), in particular, in southwestern Amazonia. Our results suggest that increasing deforestation might lead to permanent forest loss in this region. We show that the regions where deforestation would most increase the ecological vulnerability of the whole forest coincide with regions likely to be deforested or degraded in the near future. Therefore, forest protection strategies should be defined to maintain the water pump, in order to avoid changes in rainfall over South America and to sustain the ecological integrity of the Amazon forest.

TI  - Fire-induced albedo change and surface radiative forcing in sub-Saharan Africa savanna ecosystems: Implications for the energy balance
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is a critical parameter that controls surface energy balance. In dryland ecosystems, fires play a significant role in decreasing surface albedo, resulting in positive radiative forcing. Here we investigate the long-term effect of fire on surface albedo. We devised a method to calculate short-, medium-, and long-term effect of fire-induced radiative forcing and their relative effects on energy balance. We used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in our analysis, covering different vegetation classes in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Our analysis indicated that mean short- term fire-induced albedo change in SSA was -0.022, -0.035, and -0.041 for savannas, shrubland, and grasslands, respectively. At regional scale, mean fire-induced albedo change in savannas was -0.018 and -0.024 for northern sub-Saharan of Africa and the southern hemisphere Africa, respectively. The short- term mean fire-induced radiative forcing in burned areas in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) was 5.41W m(-2), which contributed continental and global radiative forcings of 0.25 and 0.058 W m(-2), respectively. The impact of fire in surface albedo has long-lasting effects that varies with vegetation type. The long-term energetic effects of fire-induced albedo change and associated radiative forcing were, on average, more than 19 times greater across SSA than the short- term effects, suggesting that fires exerted far more radiative forcing than previously thought. Taking into account the actual duration of fire's effect on surface albedo, we conclude that the contribution of SSA fires, globally and throughout the year, is similar to 0.12 W m(-2). These findings provide crucial information on possible impact of fire on regional climate variability.

TI  - Development of a remote sensing algorithm to retrieve atmospheric aerosol properties using multiwavelength and multipixel information
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a satellite remote sensing algorithm to retrieve the aerosol optical properties using satellite-received radiances for multiple wavelengths and pixels. Our algorithm utilizes spatial inhomogeneity of surface reflectance to retrieve aerosol properties, and the main target is urban aerosols. This algorithm can simultaneously retrieve aerosol optical thicknesses (AOT) for fine- and coarse-mode aerosols, soot volume fraction in fine-mode aerosols (SF), and surface reflectance over heterogeneous surfaces such as urban areas that are difficult to obtain by conventional pixel-by-pixel methods. We applied this algorithm to radiances measured by the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite/Thermal and Near Infrared Sensor for Carbon Observations-Cloud and Aerosol Image (GOSAT/TANSO-CAI) at four wavelengths and were able to retrieve the aerosol parameters in several urban regions and other surface types. A comparison of the retrieved AOTs with those from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) indicated retrieval accuracy within +/- 0.077 on average. It was also found that the column-averaged SF and the aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) underwent seasonal changes as consistent with the ground surface measurements of SSA and black carbon at Beijing, China.

TI  - Amphibian and reptile road-kills on tertiary roads in relation to landscape structure: using a citizen science approach with open-access land cover data
T2  - BMC ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Amphibians and reptiles are among the most endangered vertebrate species worldwide. However, little is known how they are affected by road-kills on tertiary roads and whether the surrounding landscape structure can explain road-kill patterns. The aim of our study was to examine the applicability of open-access remote sensing data for a large-scale citizen science approach to describe spatial patterns of road-killed amphibians and reptiles on tertiary roads. Using a citizen science app we monitored road-kills of amphibians and reptiles along 97.5 km of tertiary roads covering agricultural, municipal and interurban roads as well as cycling paths in eastern Austria over two seasons. Surrounding landscape was assessed using open access land cover classes for the region (Coordination of Information on the Environment, CORINE). Hotspot analysis was performed using kernel density estimation (KDE+). Relations between land cover classes and amphibian and reptile road-kills were analysed with conditional probabilities and general linear models (GLM). We also estimated the potential cost-efficiency of a large scale citizen science monitoring project.Results: We recorded 180 amphibian and 72 reptile road-kills comprising eight species mainly occurring on agricultural roads. KDE+ analyses revealed a significant clustering of road-killed amphibians and reptiles, which is an important information for authorities aiming to mitigate road-kills. Overall, hotspots of amphibian and reptile roadkills were next to the land cover classes arable land, suburban areas and vineyards. Conditional probabilities and GLMs identified road-kills especially next to preferred habitats of green toad, common toad and grass snake, the most often found road-killed species. A citizen science approach appeared to be more cost-efficient than monitoring by professional researchers only when more than 400 km of road are monitored.Conclusions: Our findings showed that freely available remote sensing data in combination with a citizen science approach would be a cost-efficient method aiming to identify and monitor road-kill hotspots of amphibians and reptiles on a larger scale.

TI  - Discovery of a single male <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (L.) in Merseyside, England
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.) is found in tropical and sub-tropical regions where it is the major vector of dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya and more recently Zika virus. Given its importance as a vector of arboviruses and its propensity to be transported to new regions, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has placed Ae. aegypti on a list of potentially invasive mosquito species. It was previously reported in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1865 and 1919 but did not establish on either occasion. It is now beginning to reappear in European countries and has been recorded in the Netherlands (not established) and Madeira (Portugal), as well as southern Russia, Georgia and Turkey.Results: During summer 2014, a single male Ae. aegypti was captured during mosquito collections in north-western England using a sweep net. Morphological identification complimented by sequencing of the ITS2 rDNA, and cox1 mtDNA regions, confirmed the species. Following confirmation, a programme of targeted surveillance was implemented around the collection site by first identifying potential larval habitats in greenhouses, a cemetery, a farm and industrial units. Despite intensive surveillance around the location, no other Ae. aegypti specimens were collected using a combination of sweep netting, larval dipping, mosquito magnets, BG sentinel traps and ovitraps. All species collected were native to the UK.Conclusion: The finding of the single male Ae. aegypti, while significant, presents no apparent disease risk to public health, and the follow-up survey suggests that there was no established population. However, this report does highlight the need for vigilance and robust surveillance, and the requirement for procedures to be in place to investigate such findings.

TI  - Integrating remote sensing, GIS and dynamic models for landscape-level simulation of forest insect disturbance
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cellular automata (CA) is a powerful tool for modeling the evolution of macroscopic scale phenomena as it couples time, space, and variables together while remaining in a simplified form. However, such application has remained challenging in forest insect epidemics due to the highly dynamic nature of insect behavior. Recent advances in temporal trajectory-based image analysis offer an alternative way to obtain high-frequency model calibration data. In this study, we propose an insect-CA modeling framework that integrates cellular automata, remote sensing, and Geographic Information System to understand the insect ecological processes, and tested it with measured data of mountain pine beetle (MPB) in the Rocky Mountains. The overall accuracy of the predicted MPB mortality pattern in the test years ranged from 88% to 94%, which illuminates its effectiveness in modeling forest insect dynamics. We further conducted sensitivity analysis to examine responses of model performance to various parameter settings. In our case, the ensemble random forest algorithm outperforms the traditional linear regression in constructing the suitability surface. Small neighborhood size is more effective in simulating the MPB movement behavior, indicating that short-distance is the dominating dispersal mode of MPB. The introduction of a stochastic perturbation component did not improve the model performance after testing a broad range of randomness degree, reflecting a relative compact dispersal pattern rather than isolated outbreaks. We conclude that CA with remote sensing observation is useful for landscape insect movement analyses; however, consideration of several key parameters is critical in the modeling process and should be more thoroughly investigated in future work.

TI  - Comparison of forest aboveground biomass estimates from passive and active remote sensing sensors over Kayar Khola watershed, Chitwan district, Nepal
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We use passive optical high-resolution GeoEye-1 imagery and active synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS-1) phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) L-band horizontal-horizontal-polarization imagery to estimate forest aboveground biomass (AGB) of the tropical mountainous forest test site in Kayar Khola watershed, Chitwan district, Nepal. Object-based tools were used to delineate tree crowns from the orthorectified pan-sharpened GeoEye-1 optical imagery. AGB modeling with crown projection area extracted from the optical imagery shows a good linear relationship with R-2 = 0.76. The terrain-corrected, radiometrically calibrated, and speckle-filtered ALOS-1 PALSAR back-scatter image was utilized for AGB modeling; the nonlinear modeling of AGB with the SAR backscatter (dB) shows R-2 = 0.52. The validation R-2 values for AGB estimates from GeoEye-1 and ALOS-1 PALSAR are 0.83 and 0.44, respectively. The direct comparison of AGB estimates from both sensors is made possible by the utilization of the same set of ground survey points for both training and validation of the statistical models for both datasets. The final AGB output maps from both sensors show that the spatial patterns of AGB are in reasonable agreement at lower elevation, while SAR seems to underestimate AGB values as compared with optical-based estimates in the higher elevation zones.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of grassland aboveground biomass on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau based on validated MODIS NDVI
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of aboveground biomass (AGB) is a fundamental problem for grassland environmental management on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data can feasibly be used to estimate AGB at large scales, and their precise validation is necessary to utilize them effectively. In our study, the clip-harvest method was used at 64 plots in QTP grasslands to obtain actual AGB values, and a handheld hyperspectral spectrometer was used to calculate field-measured NDVI to validate MODIS NDVI. Based on the models between NDVI and AGB, AGB dynamics trends during 2000-2012 were analyzed. The results showed that the AGB in QTP grasslands increased during the study period, with 70% of the grasslands undergoing increases mainly in the Qinghai Province. Also, the meadow showed a larger increasing trend than steppe. Future AGB dynamic trends were also investigated using a combined analysis of the slope values and the Hurst exponent. The results showed high sustainability of AGB dynamics trends after the study period. Predictions indicate 60% of the steppe and meadow grasslands would continue to increase in AGB, while 25% of the grasslands would remain in degradation, with most of them distributing in Tibet.

TI  - MyD88-dependent pro-interleukin-1β induction in dendritic cells exposed to food-grade synthetic amorphous silica
T2  - PARTICLE AND FIBRE TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Denditic cells (DCs) are specialized first-line sensors of foreign materials invading the organism. These sentinel cells rely on pattern recognition receptors such as Nod-like or Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to launch immune reactions against pathogens, but also to mediate tolerance to self-antigens and, in the intestinal milieu, to nutrients and commensals. Since inappropriate DC activation contributes to inflammatory diseases and immunopathologies, a key question in the evaluation of orally ingested nanomaterials is whether their contact with DCs in the intestinal mucosa disrupts this delicate homeostatic balance between pathogen defense and tolerance. Here, we generated steady-state DCs by incubating hematopoietic progenitors with feline McDonough sarcoma-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FIt3L) and used the resulting immature DCs to test potential biological responses against food-grade synthetic amorphous silica (SAS) representing a common nanomaterial generally thought to be safe. Results: Interaction of immature and unprimed DCs with food-grade SAS particles and their internalization by endocytic uptake fails to elicit cytotoxicity and the release of interleukin (IL)-la or tumor necrosis factor-a, which were identified as master regulators of acute inflammation in lung-related studies. However, the display of maturation markers on the cell surface shows that SAS particles activate completely immature DCs. Also, the endocytic uptake of SAS particles into these steady-state DCs leads to induction of the pro IL 1 beta precursor, subsequently cleaved by the inflammasome to secrete mature IL-113. In contrast, neither pro-IL-1 beta induction nor mature IL-1 secretion occurs upon internalization of TiO2 or FePO4 nanoparticles. The pro-IL-1 beta induction is suppressed by pharmacologic inhibitors of endosomal TLR activation or by genetic ablation of MyD88, a downstream adapter of TLR pathways, indicating that endosomal pattern recognition is responsible for the observed cytokine response to food-grade SAS particles. Conclusions: Our results unexpectedly show that food-grade SAS particles are able to directly initiate the endosomal MyD88-dependent pathogen pattern recognition and signaling pathway in steady-state DCs. The ensuing activation of immature DCs with de novo induction of pro-IL-1 beta implies that the currently massive use of SAS particles as food additive should be reconsidered.

TI  - Targeting the duality of cancer
T2  - NPJ PRECISION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, and is an increasing cause of death in the developing world. While there is great heterogeneity in the anatomic site and mutations involved in human cancer, there are common features, including immortal growth, angiogenesis, apoptosis evasion, and other features, that are common to most if not all cancers. However, new features of human cancers have been found as a result of clinical use of novel "targeted therapies," angiogenesis inhibitors, and immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors. These findings indicate that cancer is a moving target, which can change signaling and metabolic features based upon the therapies offered. It is well-known that there is significant heterogeneity within a tumor and it is possible that treatment might reduce the heterogeneity as a tumor adapts to therapy and, thus, a tumor might be synchronized, even if there is no major clinical response. Understanding this concept is important, as concurrent and sequential therapies might lead to improved tumor responses and cures. We posit that the repertoire of tumor responses is both predictable and limited, thus giving hope that eventually we can be more effective against solid tumors. Currently, among solid tumors, we observe a response of 1/3 of tumors to immunotherapy, perhaps less to angiogenesis inhibition, a varied response to targeted therapies, with relapse and resistance being the rule, and a large fraction being insensitive to all of these therapies, thus requiring the older therapies of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. Tumor phenotypes can be seen as a continuum between binary extremes, which will be discussed further. The biology of cancer is undoubtedly more complex than duality, but thinking of cancer as a duality may help scientists and oncologists discover optimal treatments that can be given either simultaneously or sequentially.

TI  - Status update: is smoke on your mind? Using social media to assess smoke exposure
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to wildland fire smoke is associated with negative effects on human health. However, these effects are poorly quantified. Accurately attributing health end-points to wildland fire smoke requires determining the locations, concentrations, and durations of smoke events. Most current methods for assessing these smoke events (ground-based measurements, satellite observations, and chemical transport modeling) are limited temporally, spatially, and/or by their level of accuracy. In this work, we explore using daily social media posts from Facebook regarding smoke, haze, and air quality to assess population-level exposure for the summer of 2015 in the western US. We compare this de-identified, aggregated Facebook dataset to several other datasets that are commonly used for estimating exposure, such as satellite observations (MODIS aerosol optical depth and Hazard Mapping System smoke plumes), daily (24 h) average surface particulate matter measurements, and model-simulated (WRF-Chem) surface concentrations. After adding population-weighted spatial smoothing to the Facebook data, this dataset is well correlated (R-2 generally above 0.5) with the other methods in smoke-impacted regions. The Facebook dataset is better correlated with surface measurements of PM2.5 at a majority of monitoring sites (163 of 293 sites) than the satellite observations and our model simulation. We also present an example case for Washington state in 2015, for which we combine this Facebook dataset with MODIS observations and WRF-Chem-simulated PM2.5 in a regression model. We show that the addition of the Facebook data improves the regression model's ability to predict surface concentrations. This high correlation of the Facebook data with surface monitors and our Washington state example suggests that this social-media-based proxy can be used to estimate smoke exposure in locations without direct ground-based particulate matter measurements.

TI  - New insight into transmission dynamics of the crustacean pathogen <i>Hematodinium perezi</i> (Dinoflagellata) using a novel sentinel methodology
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hematodinium perezi causes disease and mortality in several decapod crustaceans along the eastern seaboard and Gulf coast of the USA. The route of transmission of the parasite is unknown, but infections exhibit a sharp seasonal cycle in its primary host, the blue crab Call-inectes sapidus, that indicates the possibility of a short transmission period in its life cycle. We developed a sentinel methodology based on the use of naive, uninfected, early benthic juvenile crabs (instars C1 to C10) to investigate the transmission of H. perezi. Crabs were collected from a non-endemic site, held for a short period for evaluation, and then deployed in a highly endemic site for 14 d. Transmission of the pathogen was successful; 12.7 to 25.7% of the crabs deployed at the endemic site became infected over this period. Infections developed rapidly, with 25% of new infections developing into heavy infections during the deployment. The large number of infections that developed using the sentinel methodology allowed for the first estimates of incidence (the proportion of new infections in a population over time) in this system. Incidence varied from 0.9 to 1.8% of the resident crab population per day and accounts for the high prevalence levels observed in the endemic coastal bays of the Delmarva Peninsula. The development of this sentinel methodology has broad application for studying disease ecology in this system and in other pathogens that infect decapods.

TI  - Implementation of aerosol-cloud interactions in the regional atmosphere-aerosol model COSMO-MUSCAT(5.0) and evaluation using satellite data
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The regional atmospheric model Consortium for Small-scale Modeling (COSMO) coupled to the Multi-Scale Chemistry Aerosol Transport model (MUSCAT) is extended in this work to represent aerosol-cloud interactions. Previously, only one-way interactions (scavenging of aerosol and in-cloud chemistry) and aerosol-radiation interactions were included in this model. The new version allows for a microphysical aerosol effect on clouds. For this, we use the optional two-moment cloud microphysical scheme in COSMO and the online-computed aerosol information for cloud condensation nuclei concentrations (C-ccn), replacing the constant Cccn profile. In the radiation scheme, we have implemented a droplet-size-dependent cloud optical depth, allowing now for aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions. To evaluate the models with satellite data, the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project Observation Simulator Package (COSP) has been implemented. A case study has been carried out to understand the effects of the modifications, where the modified modeling system is applied over the European domain with a horizontal resolution of 0.25 degrees X 0.25 degrees. To reduce the complexity in aerosol-cloud interactions, only warm-phase clouds are considered. We found that the online-coupled aerosol introduces significant changes for some cloud microphysical properties. The cloud effective radius shows an increase of 9.5 %, and the cloud droplet number concentration is reduced by 21.5 %.

TI  - Beyond "Monologicality"? Exploring Conspiracist Worldviews
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conspiracy theories (CTs) are widespread ways by which people make sense of unsettling or disturbing cultural events. Belief in CTs is often connected to problematic consequences, such as decreased engagement with conventional political action or even political extremism, so understanding the psychological and social qualities of CT belief is important. CTs have often been understood to be "monological," displaying the tendency for belief in one conspiracy theory to be correlated with belief in (many) others. Explanations of monologicality invoke a nomothetical or "closed" mindset whereby mutually supporting beliefs based on mistrust of official explanations are used to interpret public events as conspiracies, independent of the facts about those events (which they may ignore or deny). But research on monologicality offers little discussion of the content of monological beliefs and reasoning from the standpoint of the CT believers. This is due in part to the "access problem": CT believers are averse to being researched because they often distrust researchers and what they appear to represent. Using several strategies to address the access problem we were able to engage CT believers in semi-structured interviews, combining their results with analysis of media documents and field observations to reconstruct a conspiracy worldview a set of symbolic resources drawn on by CT believers about important dimensions of ontology, epistemology, and human agency. The worldview is structured around six main dimensions: the nature of reality, the self, the outgroup, the ingroup, relevant social and political action, and possible future change. We also describe an ascending typology of five types of CT believers, which vary according to their positions on each of these dimensions. Our findings converge with prior explorations of CT beliefs but also revealed novel aspects: A sense of community among CT believers, a highly differentiated representation of the outgroup, a personal journey of conversion, variegated kinds of political action, and optimistic belief in future change. These findings are at odds with the typical image of monological CT believers as paranoid, cynical, anomic and irrational. For many, the CT worldview may rather constitute the ideological underpinning of a nascent pre-figurative social movement.

TI  - Physical activity and associated factors from a cross-sectional survey among adults in northern Tanzania
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Insufficient physical activity (PA) is a major contributing factor in the growing problem of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in urban and rural Sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed to determine PA and associated factors among adults in Northern Tanzania.Methods: We analyzed secondary data from a cross-sectional serological survey nested within the Magu health and demographic sentinel surveillance population in Magu District Northwestern Tanzania. All resident adults aged 15 years and older were invited to participate in the study, and physical activity data were analyzed for 5663 participants. Data were analyzed using Stata version 13.0. We used logistic regression to obtain odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risk factors associated with differences in PA.Results: In this mainly rural population, 96% reported sufficient PA, with a higher proportion in males (97.3%) compared to females (94.8%). In males the odds of sufficient PA were lower in rural areas compared to urban areas (OR = 0.19; P < 0.001; 95%CI = 0.08-0.42), while in females the odds of sufficient PA were higher in rural areas compared to urban areas (OR = 2.27; P < 0.001; 95%CI = 1.59-3.24). Leisure-related activity was low compared to work-related and transport-related activity. Farmers had a higher odds of sufficient PA than those in professional jobs in both males (OR = 9.75; P < 0.001; 95%CI = 3.68-5.82) and females (OR = 2.83; P = 0.021; 95%CI = 1.17-6.86).Conclusion: The prevalence of PA in this population was high. However, there is need for PA programs to maintain the high level of compliance during and following the transition to a more urban-based culture.

TI  - Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations for Studying Solar Flare Trigger Mechanism
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to understand the flare trigger mechanism, we conduct three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations using a coronal magnetic field model derived from data observed by the Hinode satellite. Several types of magnetic bipoles are imposed into the photospheric boundary of the Nonlinear Force-free Field model of Active Region (AR) NOAA 10930 on 2006 December 13, to investigate what kind of magnetic disturbance may trigger the flare. As a result, we confirm that certain small bipole fields, which emerge into the highly sheared global magnetic field of an AR, can effectively trigger a flare. These bipole fields can be classified into two groups based on their orientation relative to the polarity inversion line: the so-called opposite polarity, and reversed shear structures, as suggested by Kusano et al. We also investigate the structure of the footpoints of reconnected field lines. By comparing the distribution of reconstructed field lines and observed flare ribbons, the trigger structure of the flare can be inferred. Our simulation suggests that the data-constrained simulation, taking into account both the large-scale magnetic structure and small-scale magnetic disturbance (such as emerging fluxes), is a good way to discover a flare-producing AR, which can be applied to space weather prediction.

TI  - Multifunctional Biomedical Imaging in Physiological and Pathological Conditions Using a NIR-II Probe
T2  - ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared with imaging in the visible (400-650 nm) and near-infrared window I (NIR-I, 650-900 nm) regions, imaging in near-infrared window II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) is a highly promising in vivo imaging modality with improved resolution and deeper tissue penetration. Here, a small molecule NIR-II dye, 5,5'-(1H,5H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c']bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole)-4,8-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-(3-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)propyl)phenyl)thiophen-2-amine), is successfully encapsulated into phospholipid vesicles to prepare a probe CQS1000. The novel NIR-II probe is studied for in vivo multifunctional biological imaging. The results of this study indicate that the NIR-II vesicle CQS1000 can noninvasively and dynamically visualize and monitor many physiological and pathological conditions of circulatory systems, including lymphatic drainage and routing, angiogenesis of tumor, and vascular deformity such as arterial thrombus formation and ischemia with high spatial and temporal resolution. More importantly, by virtue of the favorable half-life of blood circulation of CQS1000, NIR-II imaging is capable of aiding precise resection of tumor such as osteosarcoma and accelerating the process of lymph node dissection to complete sentinel lymph node biopsy for better decision making during the tumor surgery. Overall, CQS1000 is a highly promising NIR-II probe for multifunctional biomedical imaging in physiological and pathological conditions, surpassing traditional NIR-I imaging modality and pathologic assessments for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Ground uplift related to permeability enhancement following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in the Kanto Plain, Japan
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the post-seismic surface displacement of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake around the Kanto Plain (including the capital area of Japan), which is located approximately 400 km from the epicenter, using a global positioning system network during 2005-2015 and persistent scatterer interferometry of TerraSAR-X data from March 2011 to November 2012. Uniform uplift owing to viscoelastic relaxation and afterslip on the plain has been reported previously. In addition to the general trend, we identified areas where the surface displacement velocity was faster than the surrounding areas, as much as similar to 7 mm/year for 3 years after the earthquake and with a velocity decay over time. Local uplift areas were similar to 30 x 50 km(2) and showed a complex spatial distribution with an irregular shape. Based on an observed groundwater level increase, we deduce that the local ground uplift was induced by a permeability enhancement and a pore pressure increase in the aquifer system, which is attributable to mainshock vibration.

TI  - Utility of the sentinel node concept for detection of lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis in lower rectal cancer
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There are two lymphatic flows in lower rectal cancer; one along the inferior mesenteric artery and another towards the internal iliac artery. The benefit of dissection of lateral pelvic (LP) lymph nodes (LPLN) remains controversial. This study aimed to clarify the possibility of detecting the sentinel node (SN) of the LP region (LPSN) and examine metastasis, including micrometastasis, using a radio isotope (RI) method.Methods: In total, 62 patients with clinical (c) T1-T4 rectal cancer were enrolled in this study (11, 16 and 35 patients had tumor located in the upper, middle and lower rectal third, respectively). LPSNs were detected using a radio-isotope method in which 99 m technetium-tin colloid was endoscopically injected into the submucosa in patients with cT1, and into the muscularis propria in patients with cT2, cT3 and cT4. All patients underwent curative resection with lymphadenectomy. LPSN metastases were diagnosed by HE staining, immunohistochemical staining using AE1/AE3 as a primary antibody and by RT-PCR using CEA as a marker.Results: Of the lower rectal (c) T2-4 tumors, 38.4% had lateral pelvic lymphatic flow that was significantly greater than that of cT1 tumors in the upper and middle thirds of the rectum (p = 0.0074). HE and immunohistochemical staining did not detect LPSN metastases but RT-PCR detected micrometastasis of three SNs. The remaining half of LPSNs were immunohistochemically re-examined; in all three cases, isolated tumor cells were detected.Conclusion: The SN concept may be useful for detecting lateral pelvic lymphatic flow and LPSN metastases, including micrometastasis in lower rectal cancer.

TI  - Vegetation spatial and temporal dynamic characteristics based on NDVI time series trajectories in grassland opencast coal mining
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal dynamic patterns of vegetation in mining area are still unclear. This study utilized time series trajectory segmentation algorithm to fit Landsat NDVI time series which generated from fusion images at the most prosperous period of growth based on ESTARFM algorithm. Combining with the shape features of the fitted trajectory, this paper extracted five vegetation dynamic patterns including pre-disturbance type, continuous disturbance type, stabilization after disturbance type, stabilization between disturbance and recovery type, and recovery after disturbance type. The result indicated that recovery after disturbance type was the dominant vegetation change pattern among the five types of vegetation dynamic pattern, which accounted for 55.2% of the total number of pixels. The follows were stabilization after disturbance type and continuous disturbance type, accounting for 25.6% and 11.0%, respectively. The pre-disturbance type and stabilization between disturbance and recovery type accounted for 3.5% and 4.7%, respectively. Vegetation disturbance mainly occurred from 2004 to 2009 in Shengli mining area. The onset time of stable state was 2008 and the spatial locations mainly distributed in open-pit stope and waste dump. The recovery state mainly started since the year of 2008 and 2010, while the areas were small and mainly distributed at the periphery of open-pit stope and waste dump. Duration of disturbance was mainly year. The duration of stable period usually sustained 7 years. The duration of recovery state of the type of stabilization between disturbances continued 2 to 5 years, while the type of recovery after disturbance often sustained 8 years.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use vertical and humidity correcting method to calibrate aerosol optical depth (AOD), and to explore the feasibility of calibrated-AOD as exposure index to measure the level of air pollutants from the ground and to establish the exposure-response relationship between calibrated-AOD and people's health outcomes.METHODS: First of all, we interpolated AOD, PM2.5, relative humidity and planetary boundary layer height using Kriging method to obtain data at different locations and matched different data with respiratory death in Beijing by geographical coordinates. Then, the planetary boundary layer height and aerosol hygroscopic growth factor calculated based on relative humidity was used to calbrate the AOD. To compare the effects of calibrated-AOD and PM2.5, we used standardization method to get non dimensionless calibrated-AOD and PM2.5. At last, we used the generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) to estimate the acute effects of calibrated-AOD and PM2.5 on respiratory death and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) death, after controlling the time trend, temperature and humidity effects, days of the week effect and holiday effects.RESULTS: The correlation coefficient between calibrated-AOD and PM2.5 was 0.72. The effects of calibrated-AOD on respiratory death and COPD death was the strongest at lag 0-3, one unit of calibrated-AOD increases was associated with 3.64% (95%CI: 0.58%-6.78%) increase of respiratory death and 4.92% (95%CI: 1.81%-8.14%) increase of COPD death. As for PM2.5, the strongest effects appeared at lag 0-1, one unit of PM2.5 (about 155 mug/m3) increases was associated with excess risks of 3.96% (95%CI: 0.82%-7.19%) and 6.12% (95%CI: 1.44%-11.02%) for respiratory death and COPD death respectively. Compared with PM2.5, the effects of calibrated-AOD on respiratory death and COPD death had narrower confidence intervals. The calibrated-AOD was sensitive to capture the lag effects, and the cumulative lag effects of calibrated-AOD were all significant on multiple lag days which indicated that the calibrated-AOD was sensitive to capture cumulative lag effects of air pollutants on respiratory death and COPD death as well.CONCLUSION: We believe that calibrated-AOD can be used as an index to reflect the effects of air pollutants on respiratory death in Beijing. In the absence of ground monitoring, calibrated-AOD can be used to mea-sure the relationship between air pollutants and some health outcomes.

TI  - Revisiting the iris effect of tropical cirrus clouds with TRMM and A-Train satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Just as the iris of human eye controls the light influx (iris effect), tropical anvil cirrus clouds may regulate the Earth's surface warming by controlling outgoing longwave radiation. This study examines this possible effect with monthly satellite observations such as Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer cirrus fraction, and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System top-of-the-atmosphere radiative fluxes averaged over different tropical domains from March 2000 to October 2014. To confirm that high-level cirrus is relevant to this study, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization high cloud observations were also analyzed from June 2006 to December 2015. Our analysis revealed that the increase in sea surface temperature in the tropical western Pacific tends to concentrate convective cloud systems. This concentration effect very likely induces the significant reduction of both stratiform rain rate and cirrus fraction, without appreciable change in the convective rain rate. This reduction of stratiform rain rate and cirrus fraction cannot be found over its subregion or the tropical eastern Pacific, where the concentration effect of anvil cirrus is weak. Consistently, over the tropical western Pacific, the higher ratio of convective rain rate to total rain rate (i.e., precipitation efficiency) significantly correlates with warmer sea surface temperature and lower cirrus fraction. The reduced cirrus eventually increased outgoing longwave radiation to a greater degree than absorbed solar radiation. Finally, the negative relationship between precipitation efficiency and cirrus fraction tends to correspond to a low global equilibrium climate sensitivity in the models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. This suggests that tropical anvil cirrus clouds exert a negative climate feedback in strong association with precipitation efficiency.Plain Language Summary The Earth may have a cooling mechanism, so called the iris effect, under green house gas forcing, as if human eyes control the light influx. This feedback process of the tropical cloud to increased sea surface temperature is confirmed using various satellite observation. It is found that the precipitation efficiency increases as the temperature increases and the cirrus decreases as the precipitation efficiency increases in the tropical Western Pacific. This negative relationship suggests the presence of the cooling mechanism (negative feedback). Our climate models also tend to show lower warming rate if the observed negative relationship is properly mimicked, vice versa.

TI  - Angular normalization of GOME-2 Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence observation as a better proxy of vegetation productivity
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been regarded as a promising proxy for gross primary productivity (GPP) over land. Considerable uncertainties in GPP estimation using remotely sensed SIF exist due to variations in the Sun-satellite view observation geometry that could induce unwanted variations in SIF observation. In this study, we normalize the far-red Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 SIF observations on sunny days to hot spot direction (SIFh) to represent sunlit leaves and compute a weighted sum of SIF (SIFt) from sunlit and shaded leaves to represent the canopy. We found that SIFh is better correlated with sunlit GPP simulated by a process-based ecosystem model and SIFt is better correlated with the simulated total GPP than the original SIF observations. The coefficient of determination (R-2) are increased by 0.040.03, and 0.070.04 on a global average using SIFh and SIFt, respectively. The most significant increases of the R-2 (0.090.04 for SIFt and 0.050.03 for SIFh) appear in deciduous broadleaf forests.

TI  - Using MEG to Understand the Progression of Light Sleep and the Emergence and Functional Roles of Spindles and K-Complexes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We used tomographic analysis of MEG signals to characterize regional spectral changes in the brain at sleep onset and during light sleep. We identified two key processes that may causally link to loss of consciousness during the quiet or "core" periods of NREM1. First, active inhibition in the frontal lobe leads to delta and theta spectral power increases. Second, activation suppression leads to sharp drop of spectral power in alpha and higher frequencies in posterior parietal cortex. During NREM2 core periods, the changes identified in NREM1 become more widespread, but focal increases also emerge in alpha and low sigma band power in frontal midline cortical structures, suggesting reemergence of some monitoring of internal and external environment. Just before spindles and K-complexes (KCs), the hallmarks of NREM2, we identified focal spectral power changes in pre-frontal cortex, mid cingulate, and areas involved in environmental and internal monitoring, i.e., the rostral and sub-genual anterior cingulate. During both spindles and KCs, alpha and low sigma bands increases. Spindles emerge after further active inhibition (increase in delta power) of the frontal areas responsible for environmental monitoring, while in posterior parietal cortex, power increases in low and high sigma bands. KCs are correlated with increase in alpha power in the monitoring areas. These specific regional changes suggest strong and varied vigilance changes for KCs, but vigilance suppression and sharpening of cognitive processing for spindles. This is consistent with processes designed to ensure accurate and uncorrupted memory consolidation. The changes during KCs suggest a sentinel role: evaluation of the salience of provoking events to decide whether to increase processing and possibly wake up, or to actively inhibit further processing of intruding influences. The regional spectral patterns of NREM1, NREM2, and their dynamic changes just before spindles and KCs reveal an edge effect facilitating the emergence of spindles and KCs and defining the precise loci where they might emerge. In the time domain, the spindles are seen in widespread areas of the cortex just as reported from analysis of intracranial data, consistent with the emerging consensus of a differential topography that depends on the kind of memory stored.

TI  - A cloud-resolving model study of aerosol-cloud correlation in a pristine maritime environment
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In convective clouds, satellite-observed deepening or increased amount of clouds with increasing aerosol concentration has been reported and is sometimes interpreted as aerosol-induced invigoration of the clouds. However, such correlations can be affected by meteorological factors that affect both aerosol and clouds, as well as observational issues. In this study, we examine the behavior in a 660x660km(2) region of the South Pacific during June 2007, previously found by Koren et al. (2014) to show strong correlation between cloud fraction, cloud top pressure, and aerosols, using a cloud-resolving model with meteorological boundary conditions specified from a reanalysis. The model assumes constant aerosol loading, yet reproduces vigorous clouds at times of high real-world aerosol concentrations. Days with high- and low-aerosol loading exhibit deep-convective and shallow clouds, respectively, in both observations and the simulation. Synoptic analysis shows that vigorous clouds occur at times of strong surface troughs, which are associated with high winds and advection of boundary layer air from the Southern Ocean where sea-salt aerosol is abundant, thus accounting for the high correlation. Our model results show that aerosol-cloud relationships can be explained by coexisting but independent wind-aerosol and wind-cloud relationships and that no cloud condensation nuclei effect is required.

TI  - Seasonally transported aerosol layers over southeast Atlantic are closer to underlying clouds than previously reported
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - From June to October, low-level clouds in the southeast (SE) Atlantic often underlie seasonal aerosol layers transported from African continent. Previously, the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) 532nm lidar observations have been used to estimate the relative vertical location of the above-cloud aerosols (ACA) to the underlying clouds. Here we show new observations from NASA's Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS) lidar. Two seasons of CATS 1064nm observations reveal that the bottom of the ACA layer is much lower than previously estimated based on CALIPSO 532nm observations. For about 60% of CATS nighttime ACA scenes, the aerosol layer base is within 360m distance to the top of the underlying cloud. Our results are important for future studies of the microphysical indirect and semidirect effects of ACA in the SE Atlantic region.

TI  - Analyzing cloud base at local and regional scales to understand tropical montane cloud forest vulnerability to climate change
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The degree to which cloud immersion provides water in addition to rainfall, suppresses transpiration, and sustains tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) during rainless periods is not well understood. Climate and land use changes represent a threat to these forests if cloud base altitude rises as a result of regional warming or deforestation. To establish a baseline for quantifying future changes in cloud base, we installed a ceilometer at 100m altitude in the forest upwind of the TMCF that occupies an altitude range from similar to 600m to the peaks at 1100m in the Luquillo Mountains of eastern Puerto Rico. Airport Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) ceilometer data, radiosonde data, and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite data were obtained to investigate seasonal cloud base dynamics, altitude of the trade-wind inversion (TWI), and typical cloud thickness for the surrounding Caribbean region. Cloud base is rarely quantified near mountains, so these results represent a first look at seasonal and diurnal cloud base dynamics for the TMCF. From May 2013 to August 2016, cloud base was lowest during the midsummer dry season, and cloud bases were lower than the mountain-tops as often in the winter dry season as in the wet seasons. The lowest cloud bases most frequently occurred at higher elevation than 600 m, from 740 to 964 m. The Luquillo forest low cloud base altitudes were higher than six other sites in the Caribbean by similar to 200-600 m, highlighting the importance of site selection to measure topographic influence on cloud height. Proximity to the oceanic cloud system where shallow cumulus clouds are seasonally invariant in altitude and cover, along with local trade-wind orographic lifting and cloud formation, may explain the dry season low clouds. The results indicate that climate change threats to low-elevation TMCFs are not limited to the dry season; changes in synoptic-scale weather patterns that increase frequency of drought periods during the wet seasons (periods of higher cloud base) may also impact ecosystem health.

TI  - A high-accuracy map of global terrain elevations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne digital elevation models (DEMs) are a fundamental input for many geoscience studies, but they still include nonnegligible height errors. Here we introduce a high-accuracy global DEM at 3 resolution (similar to 90 m at the equator) by eliminating major error components from existing DEMs. We separated absolute bias, stripe noise, speckle noise, and tree height bias using multiple satellite data sets and filtering techniques. After the error removal, land areas mapped with 2m or better vertical accuracy were increased from 39% to 58%. Significant improvements were found in flat regions where height errors larger than topography variability, and landscapes such as river networks and hill-valley structures, became clearly represented. We found the topography slope of previous DEMs was largely distorted in most of world major floodplains (e.g., Ganges, Nile, Niger, and Mekong) and swamp forests (e.g., Amazon, Congo, and Vasyugan). The newly developed DEM will enhance many geoscience applications which are terrain dependent.

TI  - Development and evaluation of the MTVDI for soil moisture monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Several parameterization schemes have been developed to retrieve the soil moisture information involved in the remotely sensed surface temperature-vegetation index (T-s - VI) space. However, most of them are performed with the constraint of the dry edge of the T-s - VI space to define the maximum water stressed conditions. In view of the subjectivity and uncertainty involved in the determination of the dry edge, a new index termed as the Modified Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (MTVDI) was developed in this paper to reduce the reliance of the parameterization scheme on the dry edge. In the parameterization scheme of MTVDI, isopleth lines of soil moisture involved in the feature space were retrieved by the temperature-vegetation index method, and only the maximum surface temperature of bare soil (T-smax) was indispensable in the definition of maximum water stressed conditions. For evaluation purpose, the MTVDI was demonstrated in the Southern Great Plains region of the U.S. and was compared with two other traditional soil moisture indexes developed under the constraint of dry edge. The comparison confirmed the effectivity of the MTVDI in monitoring the spatial pattern and seasonal variation of soil moisture. Our analyses also suggest that T-smax, the only parameter needed in the definition of maximum water stressed conditions, can be retrieved directly from the parameterization scheme itself. Therefore, the retrieval of MTVDI can be performed independent of the dry edge, which is a significant improvement to the traditional parameterization schemes of soil moisture from the T-s - VI feature space.

TI  - Assessing the impact of emerging forest disease on wildfire using Landsat and KOMPSAT-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental disturbance regimes are more frequently being altered by historically novel events and disturbance interactions, which may trigger reorganizations of new ecosystem states and processes. Here we examine synergies between emerging forest disease and wildfire to determine whether disease outbreak changes environmental drivers of burn severity using sudden oak death and the basin complex fire in California as a case study of novel disturbance interaction. We mapped the spatial distribution of sudden oak death tree mortality using a new object-based filter with 1.0 m resolution KOMPSAT-2 images. We integrated these data with a physical simulation model of burn severity informed by post-fire Landsat data. Model performance varied across stages of disease establishment (early, middle and late) with stronger relationships occurring during later stages of disease progression. Multiscale statistical analysis of environmental drivers of burn severity in diseased compared to healthy forests showed that sudden oak death tree mortality altered relationships between burn severity and the biophysical environment. Specifically, compared to the healthy forests, those affected by disease exhibited higher landscape heterogeneity at smaller spatial scales (e.g., 25 and 50 m), which has been associated with decreased burn severity in the literature. Our results showed the opposite pattern. That is, a disease-affected landscape comprising less connected patches and higher patch shape complexity was more likely to experience greater burn severity. This suggests that disease-caused increases in surface fuels may have reduced the landscape's resistance to fire and in turn increased burn severity in forest patches neighboring disease-impacted forests.

TI  - Investigations of improvements to an operational GOES-satellite-data-based insolation system using pyranometer data from the US Climate Reference Network (USCRN)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Incident solar radiation at the earth's surface (insolation) is the driving force for the earth's atmospheric and surface systems, including biochemical processes such as photosynthesis and the hydrologic cycle for land. This study details insolation estimates over four continuous seasons from a simple radiative transfer model, employing imager visible data from the geostationary GOES series of satellites, a model developed in the 1980s that has undergone continual upgrades and tests since that time. After an introduction explaining the physics and physical assumptions of this model, recent improvements in spatial and temporal resolution and other model modifications are detailed. Initially a set of current satellite insolation results from years 2014-2015 are compared to those produced for a set of 11 pyranometer measurement locations of the United States Climate Research Network (USCRN) for the years 2003-2004 (Otkin et al., 2005). It is found that the model improvements and modifications on average increase the accuracy of the satellite insolation estimates. Subsequently, insolation estimates from this satellite system are compared to USCRN pyranometer measurements from years 2014 and 2015 at an additional 34 USCRN measurement locations across the conterminous U.S. When satellite data are available for a USCRN location using data from both GOES-East and GOES-West, error statistics from the two satellite sources are compared. Distinctions are made between USCRN locations with differing topography and other relevant physical characteristics. Finally, plans for additional improvements and enhancements of the model are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A framework for the retrieval of all-weather land surface temperature at a high spatial resolution from polar-orbiting thermal infrared and passive microwave data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter associated with the land-atmosphere interface. Satellite remote sensing is the most effective method of measuring LST at regional and global scales. Satellite thermal infrared (TIR) measurements are widely used to retrieve LST with high accuracy and high spatial resolution but are limited to cloud-free conditions due to their inability to penetrate clouds. By contrast, satellite passive microwave (PMW) measurements are capable of penetrating clouds and providing data regardless of the cloud conditions. However, PMW measurements have limitations, such as a low spatial resolution and low temperature retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, temperature retrieval from PMW measurements yields the subsurface temperature, which differs from the LST retrieved from TIR measurements (skin temperature). This study proposes a framework for the retrieval of all-weather LST at a high spatial resolution by combining the advantages of TIR and PMW measurements. Compared to the MODIS LST product, the all-weather LST reflects the spatial variations in LST accurately. In situ LST measurements at four sites in an arid area of northwest China were used to evaluate the accuracy of the all-weather LST. The root mean square error of the LST under cloud-free conditions was approximately 2 K, whereas that of the LST under cloudy conditions varied from 3.5 K to 4.4 K. The results indicate that the all-weather LST retrieval algorithm can provide an IST dataset with reasonable accuracy and a high spatial resolution under clear and cloudy conditions.

TI  - Impact of the choice of the satellite aerosol optical depth product in a sub-regional dust emission inversion
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral dust is the major continental contributor to the global atmospheric aerosol burden with important effects on the climate system. Regionally, a large fraction of the emitted dust is produced in northern Africa; however, the total emission flux from there is still highly uncertain. In order to reduce these uncertainties, emission estimates through top-down approaches (i.e. usually models constrained by observations) have been successfully developed and implemented. Such studies usually rely on a single observational dataset and propagate the possible observational errors of this dataset onto the emission estimates. In this study, aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from five different satellites are assimilated one by one in a source inversion system to estimate dust emission fluxes over northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. We estimate mineral dust emissions for the year 2006 and discuss the impact of the assimilated dataset on the analysis. We find a relatively large dispersion in flux estimates among the five experiments, which can likely be attributed to differences in the assimilated observation datasets and their associated error statistics.

TI  - A comparison of Dynamic Habitat Indices derived from different MODIS products as predictors of avian species richness
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding past and current patterns of species richness is essential for predicting how these patterns may be affected by future global change. The species energy hypothesis predicts that higher abundance and richness of animal species occur where available energy is higher and more consistently available. There is a wide range of remote sensing proxies for available energy, such as vegetation productivity, but it is not clear which best predict species richness. Our goal here was to evaluate different proxies for annual plant productivity from Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as input for the Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs), and to determine how well they predict the richness of breeding bird species in six functional guilds across the conterminous United States. The DHIs are measures of vegetation productivity over the course of a year and consist of three components: (1) cumulative productivity (DHI Cum), (2) minimum productivity (DHI Min), and (3) intra-annual variation of productivity (DHI Var). We hypothesized that increases in cumulative and minimum productivity and reductions in intra-annual variation will be associated with higher species richness. We calculated the DHIs from a range of MODIS 1000-m vegetation productivity data sets for 20032014, i.e., the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). We summarized bird species richness of different guilds within ecoregions (n = 85) based on abundance maps derived from the >3000 routes of the North American Breeding Bird Survey for 2006 to 2012. Generally, we found all the DHI5 had high explanatory power for predicting breeding bird species richness. However, the strength of the associations between the DHI5 and bird species richness depended on habitat, nest placement, and migratory behavior. We found highest correlations for habitat-based guilds, such as grassland breeding species (R-adj(2) 0.66-0.73 for the multiple DHI regression model; R-adj(2) 0.41-0.61 for minimum DHI) and woodland breeding species (R-adj(2), 0.34-0.60 for the multiple DHI regression model; R-adj(2), 0.26-0.51 for cumulative DHI). The strong relationship between the DHI5 and bird species richness reinforces the importance of vegetation productivity as a determinant of species diversity patterns, and the usefulness of satellite data for applying the species energy hypothesis to predictions in service to conservation.

TI  - A land cover change detection and classification protocol for updating Alaska NLCD 2001 to 2011
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and mapping land cover changes are important ways to support evaluation of the status and transition of ecosystems. The Alaska National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 was the first 30-m resolution baseline land cover product of the entire state derived from circa 2001 Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary data. We developed a comprehensive approach named AKUP11 to update Alaska NLCD from 2001 to 2011 and provide a 10-year cyclical update of the state's land cover and land cover changes. Our method is designed to characterize the main land cover changes associated with different drivers, including the conversion of forests to shrub and grassland primarily as a result of wildland fire and forest harvest, the vegetation successional processes after disturbance, and changes of surface water extent and glacier ice/snow associated with weather and climate changes. For natural vegetated areas, a component named AKUP11-VEG was developed for updating the land cover that involves four major steps: 1) identify the disturbed and successional areas using Landsat images and ancillary datasets; 2) update the land cover status for these areas using a SKILL model (System of Knowledge-based Integrated -trajectory Land cover Labeling); 3) perform decision tree classification; and 4) develop a final land cover and land cover change product through the postprocessing modeling. For water and ice/snow areas, another component named AKUP11-WIS was developed for initial land cover change detection, removal of the terrain shadow effects, and exclusion of ephemeral snow changes using a 3-year MODIS snow extent dataset from 2010 to 2012. The overall approach was tested in three pilot study areas in Alaska, with each area consisting of four Landsat image footprints. The results from the pilot study show that the overall accuracy in detecting change and no-change is 90% and the overall accuracy of the updated land cover label for 2011 is 86%. The method provided a robust, consistent, and efficient means for capturing major disturbance events and updating land cover for Alaska. The method has subsequently been applied to generate the land cover" and land cover change products for the entire state of Alaska. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A multi-resolution approach to national-scale cultivated area estimation of soybean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing data can provide timely, accurate, and objective information on cultivated area by crop type and, in turn, facilitate accurate estimates of crop production. Here, we present a generic multi-resolution approach to sample-based crop type area estimation at the national level using soybean as an example crop type. Historical MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data were used to stratify growing regions into subsets of low, medium and high soybean cover. A stratified random sample of 20 km x 20 km sample blocks was selected and Landsat data for these sample blocics classified into soybean cover. The Landsat-derived soybean area was used to produce national estimates of soybean area. Current year MODIS-indicated soybean cover served as an auxiliary variable in a stratified regression estimator procedure. To evaluate the approach, we prototyped the method in the USA, where the 2013 USDA Cropland Data Layer (CDL) was used as a reference training data set for mapping soybean cover within each sample block. Three individual Landsat images were sufficient to accurately map soybean cover for all blocics, revealing that a rather sparse sample of phenological variation is needed to separate soybean from other cover types. In addition to stacks of images, we also evaluated standard radiometrically normalized Landsat inputs for mapping blocks individually (local-scale) and all at once (national-scale). All tested inputs resulted in area estimates comparable to the official USDA estimate of 30.86 Mha, with lower accuracy and higher standard error for national-scale mapping implementations. The stratified regression estimator incorporating current year MODIS-indicated soy reduced the standard error of the estimated soybean area by over 25% relative to the standard error of the stratified estimator. Finally, the method was ported to Argentina. A stratified random sample of blocks was characterized for soybean cultivated area using stacks of individual Landsat images for the 2013-2014 southern hemisphere growing season. A sub sample of these blocks was visited on the ground to assess the accuracy of the Landsat-derived soy classification. The stratified regression estimator procedure performed similarly to the US application as it resulted in a reduction in standard error of about 25% relative to the stratified estimator not incorporating current year MODIS-indicated soybean. Our final estimated soybean area was 28% lower than that reported by the USDA, corresponding to a 20% field-based omission error related to underdeveloped fields. Lessons learned from this study can be ported to other regions of comparable field size and management intensity to assess soybean cultivated area.

TI  - Comparison of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 in the estimation of boreal forest canopy cover and leaf area index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the first comparison of Sentinel-2A (S2) MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument) and Landsat 8 (L8) OLI (Operational Land Imager) data in the retrieval of forest canopy cover (CC), effective canopy cover (ECC), and leaf area index (LAI). We used S2 and L8 images obtained from Suonenjoki, Finland on 17 and 22 August 2015, respectively. A combination of airborne lidar data and field plots was used to calculate CC, ECC and LAI for a set of 746 systematically placed lidar plots. Generalized additive models were used to link these variables with various types of spectral indices. Our results indicated that instead of using the native image resolution, the model accuracies were better for 60 m lidar plots comprising of nine (S2) or four (L8) image pixels. The best case absolute root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEPs) (relative RMSEPs shown in parentheses) obtained from ten-fold cross validation of multivariate models for S2 CC, ECC and LAI were 0.126 (24.0%), 0.100 (20.8%), and 0.596 (19.6%), respectively. For L8, the corresponding RMSEPs were 0.128 (24.5%), 0.108 (22.4%), and 0.614 (20.2%). The marginally better performance of S2 models may be related to the 705 nm red edge band, which frequently occurred among the selected predictors. When testing indices that used bands available for both sensors, there were no systematic differences between S2 and L8. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - On October 1st, 2005, Santa Ana volcano (El Salvador) underwent a VEI 3 phreatomagmatic eruption after approximately one century of rest. Casualties and damages to some of the local infrastructures and surrounding plantations were followed by the evacuation of the nearby communities. The analysis of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) infrared data reveals that the main explosion was preceded by a one-yearlong thermal unrest, associated to the development of a fumaroles field, located at the western rim of the summit crater lake. By combining space-based thermal flux and ground-based measurements (seismicity, sulfur emissions and lake temperatures), we suggest that the activity observed at Santa Ana between 2004 and 2005 was driven by the gradual intrusion of an undegassed magma body at a very shallow depth. Magma injection induced thermal anomalies associated with sustained degassing from the fumaroles field and promoted the interaction between the magmatic-hydrothermal system and the overlying water table. This process culminated into the VEI 3 phreatomagmatic eruption of October 2005 that strongly modified the shallow structure of the crater area. The subsequent three-years-long activity resulted from self-sealing of the fracture system and by the opening of a new fracture network directly connecting the deeper hydrothermal system with the crater lake. Our results show that satellite-based thermal data allow us to detect the expansion of the high-temperature fumarolic field. This may precede an explosive eruption and/or a lava dome extrusion. In particular, we show that thermal records can be analyzed with other geochemical (i.e. SO2 emissions) and geophysical (seismicity) data to track a shallow magmatic intrusion interacting with the surrounding hydrothermal system. This provides a remarkable support for volcano monitoring and eruption forecasting, particularly in remote areas where permanent ground data acquisition is hazardous, expensive and difficult.

TI  - Improving BRDF normalisation for Landsat data using statistical relationships between MODIS BRDF shape and vegetation structure in the Australian continent
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The intra-and inter-annual variability of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) products in Australia have been analysed using 10 years (2002 2011) of MODIS BRDF Collection 6 data. Root Mean Square (RMS) and Anisotropic Flat Index (AFX) parameters were used as BRDF shape indices to represent the overall BRDF shape. Australian vegetation structure and agro-climate regions were used to separate and analyse different BRDF shape patterns. The results confirmed earlier findings that the intra-annual variation of MODIS BRDF shape is stronger than the inter-annual. High variance in the shape parameters of the base BRDF model as well as poor quality data regions suggest that for spectral data correction, the data are better used as a spatial average of BRDF shape (e.g. over a vegetation structure/climate class patch). This can reduce the spatial variance of shape to similar levels observed in the local variance of spectral data. The within-and between-class variations as well as correlations between some BRDF shape indices and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) show that inter-annual relationships between BRDF parameters can be separated using strata based on vegetation structure (basically height, cover and dominant growth form). However, due to the different climate drivers involved, such as rainfall, light and temperature, the intra-annual variation is better analysed if the patches of vegetation structure classes are identified by climate zone for climatic homogeneity. It is found that if long term averages are used to represent stable focal points in the time series, significant relationships exist between BRDF indices and spectral indices such as NDVI. However, there is no satisfactory way to directly relate short term fluctuations of (e.g.) NDVI with short term BRDF changes. All of the indices are significantly related to rainfall, structural characteristics and biomass with lagged relationships providing a more suitable pathway to analysing short variations. It is concluded that for the situation where a high quality BRDF product is available, the best strategy would involve use of a set of vegetation structure class patches to increase the resolution of local differences in BRDF shape for inhomogeneous scenes as well as control the high variance in MODIS BRDF model shape parameters. The partial relationships found between some BRDF indices (in particular RMS) and average rainfall or stable (longer term) NDVI also provide a potential for empirically updating BRDF shape for climate variation in periods before MODIS data were available.

TI  - Dendritic Cell Vaccination Enhances Immune Responses and Induces Regression of HER2<SUP>pos</SUP> DCIS Independent of Route: Results of Randomized Selection Design Trial
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Vaccination with HER2 peptide-pulsed DC1s stimulates a HER2-specific T-cell response. This randomized trial aimed to establish safety and evaluate immune and clinical responses to vaccination via intralesional (IL), intranodal (IN), or both intralesional and intranodal (ILN) injection.Experimental Design: Fifty-four HER2(pos) patients [42 pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 12 early invasive breast cancer (IBC)] were enrolled in a neoadjuvant HER2 peptide-pulsed DC1 vaccine trial. Patients were randomized to IL (n = 19), IN (n = 19), or ILN (n = 16) injection. Immune responses were measured in peripheral blood and sentinel lymph nodes by ELISPOT or in vitro sensitization assay. Pathologic response was assessed in resected surgical specimens.Results: Vaccination by all injection routes was well tolerated. There was no significant difference in immune response rates by vaccination route (IL 84.2% vs. IN 89.5% vs. ILN 66.7%; P = 0.30). The pathologic complete response (pCR) rate was higher in DCIS patients compared with IBC patients (28.6% vs. 8.3%). DCIS patients who achieved pCR (n = 12) and who did not achieve pCR (n = 30) had similar peripheral blood anti-HER2 immune responses. All patients who achieved pCR had an anti-HER2 CD4 immune response in the sentinel lymph node, and the quantified response was higher by response repertoire (P = 0.03) and cumulative response (P = 0.04).Conclusions: Anti-HER2 DC1 vaccination is a safe and immunogenic treatment to induce tumor-specific T-cell responses in HER2(pos) patients; immune and clinical responses were similar independent of vaccination route. The immune response in the sentinel lymph nodes, rather than in the peripheral blood, may serve as an endpoint more reflective of antitumor activity. (C) 2016 AACR.

TI  - Improved infrared precipitation estimation approaches based on k-means clustering: Application to north Algeria using MSG-SEVIRI satellite data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, two new infrared precipitation estimation approaches based on the concept of k-means clustering are first proposed, named the NAW-Kmeans and the GPI-Kmeans methods. Then, they are adapted to the southern Mediterranean basin, where the subtropical climate prevails. The infrared data (10.8 mu m channel) acquired by MSG-SEVIRI sensor in winter and spring 2012 are used. Tests are carried out in eight areas distributed over northern Algeria: Sebra, El Bordj, Chlef, Blida, Bordj Menael, Sidi Aich, Beni Ourthilane, and Beni Aziz. The validation is performed by a comparison of the estimated rainfalls to rain gauges observations collected by the National Office of Meteorology in Dar El Beida (Algeria). Despite the complexity of the subtropical climate, the obtained results indicate that the NAW-Kmeans and the GPI-Kmeans approaches gave satisfactory results for the considered rain rates. Also, the proposed schemes lead to improvement in precipitation estimation performance when compared to the original algorithms NAW (Nagri, Adler, and Wetzel) and GPI (GOES Precipitation Index).

TI  - Extracting the intertidal extent and topography of the Australian coastline from a 28 year time series of Landsat observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The physical environment of the intertidal zone presents a number of challenges which make traditional surveying methods difficult to implement; whilst the acquisition cost of airborne elevation data can be prohibitive beyond localised applications. Remote sensing data from earth observation satellites has been well established as a method for mapping the extent and elevation profile of the intertidal zone; however the majority of these applications are local in nature, and based on analysis of a limited number of individual image observations.In this paper we outline an automated methodology to model the intertidal extent and topography of the Australian coastline, that leverages a full time series of Landsat observations from 1987 to 2015 managed in the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC). Our approach reframes the analysis from time of acquisition into the tidal domain through the use of a continental scale tidal model, combined with a median pixel compositing of Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) stacks, to robustly estimate the tidal extent and elevation profile across the observed tidal range. We demonstrate the ability of a median-based compositing approach to deal effectively with data quality, modelling outliers and other issues that commonly affect single scene methodologies. Our new framework enables us to produce a continental-scale intertidal model, detailing intertidal zone topography at a 25 m spatial scale.We then demonstrate the potential of the modelling framework to derive digital elevation data based on tidal model attribution, validating our models against in-situ GPS observations, before discussing issues that must be addressed to move this capability to a continental scale. The ability of the model to examine coastal stability is introduced, in the context of the conceptual reframing of the data into the tidal domain, with a view to furthering this application in future versions of the model.

TI  - UAV lidar and hyperspectral fusion for forest monitoring in the southwestern USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest vegetation classification and structure measurements are fundamental steps for planning, monitoring, and evaluating large-scale forest changes including restoration treatments. High spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing data are critically needed to classify vegetation and measure their 3-dimensional (3D) canopy structure at the level of individual species. Here we test high-resolution lidar, hyperspectral, and multispectral data collected from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and demonstrate a lidar-hyperspectral image fusion method in treated and control forests with varying tree density and canopy cover as well as in an ecotone environment to represent a gradient of vegetation and topography in northern Arizona, U.S.A. The fusion performs better (88% overall accuracy) than either data type alone, particularly for species with similar spectral signatures, but different canopy sizes. The lidar data provides estimates of individual tree height (R-2 = 0.90; RMSE = 2.3 m) and crown diameter (R-2 = 0.72; RMSE = 0.71 m) as well as total tree canopy cover (R-2 = 0.87; RMSE = 9.5%) and tree density (R-2 = 0.77; RMSE = 0.69 trees/cell) in 10 m cells across thin only, burn only, thin-and-burn, and control treatments, where tree cover and density ranged between 22 and 50% and 1-3.5 trees/cell, respectively. The lidar data also produces highly accurate digital elevation model (DEM) (R-2 = 0.92; RMSE = 0.75 m). In comparison, 3D data derived from the multispectral data via structure-from-motion produced lower correlations with field-measured variables, especially in dense and structurally complex forests. The lidar, hyperspectral, and multispectral sensors, and the methods demonstrated here can be widely applied across a gradient of vegetation and topography for monitoring landscapes undergoing large-scale changes such as the forests in the southwestern U.S.A.

TI  - Assessment of spatio-temporal changes of smallholder cultivation patterns in the Angolan Miombo belt using segmentation of Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forests provide globally important ecosystem services and host exceptionally high biodiversity. These biomes are currently under immense pressure, particularly for conversion to agriculture, and already experience high global deforestation rates. Miombo forests in Southern Angola are affected by deforestation, fragmentation and degradation, caused mainly by an increasing rural population who follows a traditional farming system of shifting cultivation with slash-and-burn agriculture. After the termination of the civil war in 2002, population growth and resettlements have accelerated the use of woody resources, selective logging and clearing for cultivation purposes and led to an exceedance of sustainability thresholds. Large scale projects are expected to put further pressure on the forests and increase the potential of conflicts regarding land resources and competition with local subsistence farming.We use an existing time series segmentation tool (LandTrendr) with a time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) data in combination with adapted temporal metrics to provide information about the dynamics of different cultivation patterns, to gain insight into historical developments and to assess temporal cultivation characteristics. We define cleared areas and cultivation time on a pixel-by-pixel basis providing temporal and spatial information on current and past changes from 1989 to 2013 using data from Landsat 5-8. Overall accuracy for the disturbance detection is 72%. We can follow the effect of armed conflicts on agricultural expansion with a drop in deforestation rate of more than 70% from 12,000 to 4000 ha per year (1994-1998) and subsequently tripling to 12,000 ha per year again after 2002. Deforestation patterns are in accordance with previous multi-temporal studies, although time series segmentation reveals more detailefi information on deforestation and cultivation dynamics.We successfully separate areas of different historic backgrounds and agricultural dynamics, e.g. areas that were severely affected during the civil war, which transition from shifting to semi-permanent and permanent systems. We provide recommendations for the assessment of agricultural dynamics in similar areas where ground data and basic information is missing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Testing a Landsat-based approach for mapping disturbance causality in US forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In light of Earth's changing climate and growing human population, there is an urgent need to improve monitoring of natural and anthropogenic disturbances which effect forests' ability to sequester carbon and provide other ecosystem services. In this study, a two-step modeling approach was used to map the type and timing of forest disturbances occurring between 1984 and 2010 in ten Landsat scenes located in diverse forest systems of the conterminous U.S. In step one, Random Forest (RF) models were developed to predict the presence of five forest disturbance agents (conversion, fire, harvest, stress and wind) and stable (i.e. undisturbed) forest. Models were developed using a suite of predictors including spectral change metrics derived from a nonparametric shape-restricted spline fitting algorithm, as well as several topographic and biophysical variables which potentially influence the initiation and/or spread of forest disturbance agents. Step two involved applying a rule-based model to the spectrally-based shape parameters (e.g. shape type, year and duration) to assign a year to the disturbance types and locations predicted in step one. Out of bag (OOB) predictions from RF showed that across the ten scenes, overall agreement was highest when only causal agent was considered (avg = 80%, min = 69%, max = 86%), and was lowest when both agent and year (within 1 of the reference date) were required to be correct (avg = 71%, min = 56%, max = 80%). Across scene omission and commission errors for fire and stable forest classes were mostly around 10% to 20%, respectively. Harvests were also modeled well, as five of nine test scenes had error rates <26%. Accuracy of the wind and stress classes were much more variable with model errors ranging from 24% to 88%. The years assigned by the rule-based model were reasonably accurate, as 88% of all disturbances were assigned a year that fell within 2 years of the reference date. Fire disturbances were assigned the correct year 78% of the time, followed by harvest (69%) and conversion (54%). Although 17% and 63% of wind and stress disturbances were under-estimated by S or more years, the impact on overall accuracy was nominal given these two classes only accounted for roughly 5% of all disturbances. Our results also revealed that causal agent models summarized to broader disturbed/not disturbed classes were as accurate as models specifically constructed to predict binary disturbance, thus there appears to be no advantage to modeling disturbance prior to assigning causality. A relative evaluation of mean decrease in accuracy from RF showed that although a wide range of predictor variables contributed to the successful modeling of causal agents and stable forest (e.g. patch metrics, forest occurrence, and topography), disturbance variables (e.g. MTBS) and spectral change metrics (e.g. absolute and relative magnitude) were by far the most important. Modeled causality maps and annual disturbance rates were examined and found to be in good agreement with existing literature and other published data sets. Lastly, results are used to make recommendations for mapping forest disturbance agents nationally across the U.S. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Hybrid stochastic ground motion modeling of the <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake of 2015 based on InSAR inversion
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We derive the coseismic slip distribution on a fault for the 2015, M-w 7.8 Gorkha earthquake based on ALOS-2 wide scan data and the inversion code, SDM (Steepest Descend Method). The results show that the maximum slip is 4.7 m, and the total released seismic moment is 6.02 x 1020 N m, equivalent to an earthquake of M-w similar to 7.82. Static stress and slip heterogeneity analyses show that both the average stress drop and corner wavenumber are at a low level. Additionally, we model the observed impulsive behavior at the near-source KATNP station using a hybrid stochastic approach, which combines an analytical approach at low frequencies with a stochastic approach at high frequencies. The good agreement between the hybrid modeling and observed records reveals that the input parameters, such as stress drop or slip distribution, are suitable for the Gorkha earthquake. The success of the modeling indicates that, in addition to the smooth onset of STF (slip-rate time function), the low stress drop and low degree of slip heterogeneity are also responsible for the low level of high -frequency ground motion during the Gorkha earthquake.

TI  - Synergy of MODIS and AATSR for better retrieval of aerosol optical depth and land surface directional reflectance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new algorithm to simultaneously retrieve Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and land surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) from Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) by adopting gradient optimization method. Different from traditional method the approach presented here can perform simultaneous retrieval from each individual AATSR swath rather than multiple days. A theoretical sensitivity study proves the proposed method is insensitive to the distortion of initial BRDF. The presented algorithm is tested on AATSR data around four different Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites representing various types of land surface. Compared with the four selected AERONET sites' AOD and BRDF-derived albedo from AERONET-based Surface Reflectance Validation Network (ASRVN) data in corresponding four AERONET sites, the presented algorithm proves considerable accuracy for various type of land surface with correlation of AOD ranging from 0.647 to 0.911 and correlation of BRDF-derived albedo ranging from 0.483 to 0.944. The intersensor comparison with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 3 km AOD dark target product reveals high coverage rate of the presented method especially in bright surface or nonvegetation area and the correlation between the two sensors reaches up to 0.967. The improved estimation of BRDF from AATSR retrieval in AERONET Beijing site is compared with MODIS MCD43B1 product. The relative differences in hemispherical albedo calculated from average BRDF shape function parameters between AATSR and MODIS product are 133%, 1.52%, 2.60% and 4.28% at 550 nm, 670 nm, 870 nm and 1600 nm respectively.

TI  - Early season large-area winter crop mapping using MODIS NDVI data, growing degree days information and a Gaussian mixture model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge on geographical location and distribution of crops at global, national and regional scales is an extremely valuable source of information for many applications. Traditional approaches to crop mapping using remote sensing data rely heavily on reference or ground truth data in order to train/calibrate classification models. As a rule, such models are only applicable to a single vegetation season and should be recalibrated to be applicable for other seasons. This paper addresses the problem of early season large-area winter crop mapping using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series and growing degree days (GDD) information derived from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) product. The model is based on the assumption that winter crops have developed biomass during early spring while other crops (spring and summer) have no biomass. As winter crop development is temporally and spatially non-uniform due to the presence of different agro-climatic zones, we use GDD to account for such discrepancies. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to discriminate winter crops from other crops (spring and summer). The proposed method has the following advantages: low input data requirements, robustness, applicability to global scale application and can provide winter crop maps 1.5-2 months before harvest. The model is applied to two study regions, the State of Kansas in the US and Ukraine, and for multiple seasons (2001-2014). Validation using the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Data Layer (CDL) for Kansas and ground measurements for Ukraine shows that accuracies of >90% can be achieved in mapping winter crops 1.5-2 months before harvest. Results also show good correspondence to official statistics with average coefficients of determination R-2 > 0.85. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improving temperature interpolation using MODIS LST and local topography: a comparison of methods in south east Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Available climate data for south east Australia is reliant upon elevational lapse rates, which do not account for mesoscale processes that can affect temperatures, such as cold air drainage. Additional predictor variables are available for generating new climate datasets such as topographic indices and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land surface temperature (MODIS LST); however, these have not been thoroughly tested to date. In this study, the relative benefits of including a localized topographic index and standardized MODIS LST values for temperature interpolation were assessed using partial bivariate splines, full and partial trivariate splines, and regression kriging. Trivariate splines provided the best interpolation performance in most cases; however, the partial bivariate spline with a fixed dependence upon elevation performed marginally better than the full trivariate spline for minimum temperature. The local topographic index improved the RMSE of minimum temperature climate normals by 17% in comparison to the best performing elevation only model. A further improvement for minimum temperature performance was achieved by including standardized night time MODIS LST values as covariates (34-39% reduction in RMSE). Standardized day time MODIS LST values improved maximum temperature interpolation performance; however, the improvement was onlymarginal in comparison to the full trivariate spline (6% reduction in RMSE). Cross validation of daily maximum and minimum temperature anomalies reflected performance trends shown in the climate normal analysis. Results suggest that the use of alternative approaches to interpolating temperature data may have significant implications for the calculation of bioclimatic variables and provide new opportunities to study extremes at high spatial and temporal resolutions using existing weather station networks. Furthermore, improving minimum temperature surfaces by accounting for temperature inversions driven by cold air drainage regimes may improve our ability to incorporate mesoscale temperature variability into a variety of applications, such as deriving temperature dependent climatic variables, species distribution modelling and assessments of fire risk.

AB  - Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare type of invasive breast carcinoma, and chondroid differentiation is even rarer. Here we report a case of MBC with extensive chondroid differentiation in a 38-year-old woman who presented with a lump in her left breast. Ultrasound findings were most compatible with those of giant fibroadenoma. A histopathological examination revealed a malignant lesion comprising neoplastic epithelial cells arranged in solid nests, with large areas of chondroid differentiation. Neoplastic chondroid cells exhibited a positive reaction for S-100, patchy positive reaction for pan-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and negative reaction for epithelial membrane antigen. Both carcinomatous and chondroid cells exhibited p53 overexpression. Sentinel lymph node biopsy revealed no tumorous involvement.

TI  - Discharge estimation and forecasting by MODIS and altimetry data in Niger-Benue River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the most devastating natural hazards in the world and its forecast is essential in flood risk reduction and disaster response decision. The lack of adequate monitoring networks, especially in developing countries prevents near real-time flood prediction that could help to reduce the loss of lives and economic damages. In the last few years, increasing availability of multi-satellite sensors induced to develop new techniques for retrieving river discharge and especially in supporting discharge nowcasting and forecasting activities. Recently, the potential of radar altimetry to estimate water levels and discharge in ungauged river sites with good accuracy has been demonstrated. However, the considerable benefit derived from this technique is attenuated by the low revisit time of the satellite (10 or 35 days, depending on the satellite mission) causing delays on the predicting operations. For this reason, sensors with a higher temporal resolution such as the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), working in visible/Infra-Red bands, can support flood forecasting.In this study, we performed the forecast of river discharge by using MODIS and we compared it with the radar altimetry and in-situ data along the Niger-Benue River in Nigeria to develop an operational flood forecasting scheme that could help in rapid emergency response and decision making processes. In the first step, four MODIS products (daily and, 8-day from the TERRA and AQUA satellites) at two gauged sites were used for discharge estimation. Secondly, the capability of remote sensing sensors to forecast discharge a few days (similar to 4 days) in advance at a downstream section using MODIS is analyzed and also compared with the one obtained by the use of radar altimetry by ENVISAT and Jason-2.The results confirmed the capability of the MODIS data to estimate river discharge with performance indices >0.97 and 0.95 in terms of coefficient of correlation and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency. In particular, RMSE does not exceed 1300 m(3)/s and the fractional RMSE ranges between 0.15 and 0.23. For the forecasting exercise, both altimetry and MODIS provide satisfactory results with positive coefficient of persistence considering 4 days of lead time (>0.34). Although altimetry was found to be more accurate in the forecasting of river discharge (RMSE similar to 350 m(3)/s), the much higher temporal resolution of MODIS guarantees a continuity that is more suitable to address operational activities.

TI  - New Safety Margins for Melanoma Surgery: Nice Possibility for Drinking of "Just That Cup of Coffee"?
T2  - Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC's) skin melanoma surgical treatment recommendations from 2011 are characterised by a prima facie "freedom of choice" regarding how extensive should be the excisions for melanomas with tumour thickness up to 2 mm and melanoma in situ. It is unclear why the recommended surgical security margins vary between 0.5 and 1 cm for melanoma in situ, whereas for melanomas with a tumour thickness of up to 1.99 mm, the range of variation is also between 1 and 2 cm, without specifying when the surgical field should be broader and, narrower, accordingly. This "uncertainty or lack of intent" of the guilders often leads to the same surgical approach to melanomas at different stages, or to a different approach in cases of melanomas at the same stage, in contrast. Therefore, this should be defined as wrong, logically.CASE PRESENTATION: We present 3 patients with cutaneous melanomas, treated with similar fields of surgical security. Current issues, generated within the framework of melanoma's surgery guided by the recommendations of the AJCC are also discussed. A new surgical approach in patients with melanoma is recommended, discussed for the first time in world literature. We hypothesize that the introduction of a certain recommendations for a 2 cm surgical field in all directions during the initial excision, combined with the parallel performance of a sentinel lymph node biopsy, will lead in fact to several important advantages: 1) avoiding of the secondary excision in at least 70% - 90% of the patients (depending on the tumor thickness), 2) minimizing the risk of lymphatic effusion change and misinterpretation of the sentinel lymph node biopsy's results in patients with secondary excision; 3) optimization of the surgical team's work; 4) minimizing the possibility of unprepared/uninformed personnel to take part in decisions for treating a specific disease such as skin melanoma, 4) facilitating the appropriate patients' group selection at the appropriate stage when involving them in different studies, leading to equal leveling of the initial positions.CONCLUSION: Whether the proposed approach will be subjected to a detailed discussion of AJCC's expert's remains currently unclear.

TI  - Hyperspectral characterization of freezing injury and its biochemical impacts in oilseed rape leaves
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic detection and monitoring of freezing injury in crops is of vital importance for assessing plant physiological status and yield losses. This study investigates the potential of hyperspectral techniques for detecting leaves at the stages of freezing and post-thawing injury, and for quantifying the impacts of freezing injury on leaf water and pigment contents. Four experiments were carried out to acquire hyperspectral reflectance and biochemical parameters for oilseed rape plants subjected to freezing treatment. Principal component analysis and support vector machines were applied to raw reflectance, first and second derivatives (SDR), and inverse logarithmic reflectance to differentiate freezing and the different stages of post-thawing from the normal leaf state. The impacts on biochemical retrieval using particular spectral domains were also assessed using a multivariate analysis. Results showed that SDR generated the highest classification accuracy (>95.6%) in the detection of post-thawed leaves. The optimal ratio vegetation index (RVI) generated the highest predictive accuracy for changes in leaf water content, with a cross validated coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.85 and a cross validated root mean square error (RMSECV) of 2.4161 mg/cm(2). Derivative spectral indices outperformed multivariate statistical methods for the estimation of changes in pigment contents. The highest accuracy was found between the optimal RVI and the change in carotenoids content (R-cv(2) = 0.70 and RMSECV = 0.0015 mg/cm(2)). The spectral domain 400-900 nm outperformed the full spectrum in the estimation of individual pigment contents, and hence this domain can be used to reduce redundancy and increase computational efficiency in future operational scenarios. Our findings indicate that hyperspectral remote sensing has considerable potential for characterizing freezing injury in oilseed rape, and this could form a basis for developing satellite remote sensing products for crop monitoring.

TI  - Fine crop mapping by combining high spectral and high spatial resolution remote sensing data in complex heterogeneous areas
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In complex heterogeneous areas, it is difficult to map crops with high accuracy using only high spatial resolution or only high spectral resolution remote sensing data. Because the spectral resolution of high spatial resolution data is too low, the spectral differentiations of different vegetation types are very small in high spatial resolution data. It is hard to distinguish between different vegetation types using high spatial resolution data. For high spectral resolution remote sensing data, it is hard to exclude linear objects like roads, bridges and drains from crops due to the low spatial resolution of these data. To address this problem, a novel object-based fine crop mapping method by combining high spatial and high spectral resolution remote sensing data for heterogeneous areas was proposed and validated in Suzhou city, Jiangsu province, China. First, pure crop polygons were derived from a 0.5 m aerial data. Due to the high spatial resolution, non-cultivated land could be easily isolated from arable land. Then, a Hyperion data was used to classify crops for each of the pure crop polygons. The results show that this method can map crops in complex heterogeneous areas with an overall accuracy higher than 95%, which is much higher than the accuracy of maps classified using only high spatial resolution data or only high spectral resolution data, which have an overall accuracy of 58.78% and 77.54%, respectively.

TI  - An improved scheme for rice phenology estimation based on time-series multispectral HJ-1A/B and polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice phenology information is critical for farm management and productivity evaluation. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data are very useful for monitoring rice growth. Therefore, this paper focuses on building a robust, accurate and operational scheme for phenology estimation based on SAR and multi spectral remote sensing data. The proposed scheme has three main improvements. First, two main types of rice field - transplanted indica rice field (TRF) and direct-sown japonica rice field (DRF) - were considered individually. Second, 149 SAR signatures and optical Vegetation Indices (Vls) were extracted from time-series of optical and full/compact-pol SAR data and a novel feature selection method based on Monte Carlo experiments and the correlation limitation (MCCL) was proposed. Third, six different phenological labeling cases were considered, with the multiclass relevant vector machine (mRVM) being used to identify different stages. Based on the improvements above, we generated the optimal feature matrix based on the MCCL; this matrix consisted of the optimal feature subset (OFS) used for the identification of each stage. The overall phenological estimation accuracy (OPEA) based on the optical Vls and SAR signatures together (86.59%), was shown to be better than that based on either the optical Vls or the SAR signatures only. In addition, it was significant to consider the differences between the DRF and TRF for rice phenology estimation. The OPEA was higher than 85% when the DRF and TRF were considered separately, much higher than the accuracy obtained (68.89%) when the differences between the DRF and TRF were ignored. Lastly, the availability of the proposed feature selection method MCCL was discussed. It was found that the best OPEA was generated using the OFS selected by the proposed MCCL when the dimensions of the OFS were kept small. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRecent studies suggest that the protective effect of the current influenza vaccine could be influenced by vaccination in previous seasons. We estimated the combined effect of the previous and current influenza vaccines from the 2010-2011 season to the 2015-2016 season in Spain.MethodsWe performed a test-negative case-control study in patients >= 9 years old. We estimated the influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against influenza A(H1N1) pdm09, A(H3N2), and B virus.ResultsWe included 1206 influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 cases, 1358 A(H3N2) cases and 1079 B cases. IVE against A(H1N1) pdm09 virus in the pooled-season analysis was 53% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 21% to 72%) for those vaccinated only in the current season and 50% (95% CI: 23% to 68%) for those vaccinated in the both current and previous seasons. Against the influenza A(H3N2) virus, IVE was 17% (95% CI: -43% to 52%) for those vaccinated only in the current season and 3% (95% CI: -33% to 28%) for those vaccinated in both seasons. Regarding influenza B, we obtained similar IVEs for those vaccinated only in the current and those vaccinated in both seasons: 57% (95% CI: 12% to 79%) and 56% (95% CI: 36% to 70%), respectively.ConclusionOur results suggested no interference between the previous and current influenza vaccines against A(H1N1) pdm09 and B viruses, but a possible negative interference against A (H3N2) virus.

TI  - Impacts of freshwater changes on Antarctic sea ice in an eddy-permitting sea-ice-ocean model
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In a warming climate, satellite data indicate that the sea ice extent around Antarctica has increased over the last decades. One of the suggested explanations is the stabilizing effect of increased mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheet. Here, we investigate the sea ice response to changes in both the amount and the spatial distribution of freshwater input to the ocean by comparing a set of numerical sensitivity simulations with additional supply of water at the Antarctic ocean surface. We analyze the short-term response of the sea ice cover and the on-shelf water column to variations in the amount and distribution of the prescribed surface freshwater flux.Our results confirm that enhancing the freshwater input can increase the sea ice extent. Our experiments show a negative development of the sea ice extent only for "extreme" freshwater additions. We find that the spatial distribution of freshwater is of great influence on sea ice concentration and thickness as it affects sea ice dynamics and thermodynamics. For strong regional contrasts in the freshwater addition the dynamic response dominates the local change in sea ice, which generally opposes the thermodynamic response. Furthermore, we find that additional coastal runoff generally leads to fresher and warmer dense shelf waters.

TI  - On the impact of granularity of space-based urban CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in urban atmospheric inversions: A case study for Indianapolis, IN
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cities is a key challenge towards effective emissions management. An inversion analysis from the INdianapolis FLUX experiment (INFLUX) project, as the first of its kind, has achieved a top-down emission estimate for a single city using CO2 data collected by the dense tower network deployed across the city. However, city-level emission data, used as a priori emissions, are also a key component in the atmospheric inversion framework. Currently, fine-grained emission inventories (EIs) able to resolve GHG city emissions at high spatial resolution, are only available for few major cities across the globe. Following the INFLUX inversion case with a global 1 x 1 km ODIAC fossil fuel CO2 emission dataset, we further improved the ODIAC emission field and examined its utility as a prior for the city scale inversion. We disaggregated the 1 x 1 km ODIAC non-point source emissions using geospatial datasets such as the global road network data and satellite-data driven surface imperviousness data to a 30 x 30 m resolution. We assessed the impact of the improved emission field on the inversion result, relative to priors in previous studies (Hestia and ODIAC). The posterior total emission estimate (5.1 MtC/yr) remains statistically similar to the previous estimate with ODIAC (5.3 MtC/yr). However, the distribution of the flux corrections was very close to those of Hestia inversion and the model-observation mismatches were significantly reduced both in forward and inverse runs, even without hourly temporal changes in emissions. EIs reported by cities often do not have estimates of spatial extents. Thus, emission disaggregation is a required step when verifying those reported emissions using atmospheric models. Our approach offers gridded emission estimates for global cities that could serves as a prior for inversion, even without locally reported EIs in a systematic way to support city-level Measuring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) practice implementation.

TI  - Risk of major congenital malformations in relation to maternal overweight and obesity severity: cohort study of 1.2 million singletons
T2  - BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVETo estimate the risks of major congenital malformations in the offspring of mothers who are underweight (body mass index (BMI) <18.5), overweight (BMI 25 to <30), or in obesity classes I (BMI 30 to <35), II (35 to <40), or III (>= 40) compared with offspring of normal weight mothers (BMI 18.5 to <25) in early pregnancy.DESIGNPopulation based cohort study.SETTINGNationwide Swedish registries.PARTICIPANTS1 243 957 liveborn singleton infants from 2001 to 2014 in Sweden. Data on maternal and pregnancy characteristics were obtained by individual record linkages.EXPOSUREMaternal BMI at the first prenatal visit.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESOffspring with any major congenital malformation, and subgroups of organ specific malformations diagnosed during the first year of life. Risk ratios were estimated using generalised linear models adjusted for maternal factors, sex of offspring, and birth year.RESULTSA total of 43 550 (3.5%) offspring had any major congenital malformation, and the most common subgroup was for congenital heart defects (n=20 074; 1.6%). Compared with offspring of normal weight mothers (risk of malformations 3.4%), the proportions and adjusted risk ratios of any major congenital malformation among the offspring of mothers with higher BMI were: overweight, 3.5% and 1.05 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.07); obesity class I, 3.8% and 1.12 (1.08 to 1.15), obesity class II, 4.2% and 1.23 (1.17 to 1.30), and obesity class III, 4.7% and 1.37 (1.26 to 1.49). The risks of congenital heart defects, malformations of the nervous system, and limb defects also progressively increased with BMI from overweight to obesity class III. The largest organ specific relative risks related to maternal overweight and increasing obesity were observed for malformations of the nervous system. Malformations of the genital and digestive systems were also increased in offspring of obese mothers.CONCLUSIONSRisks of any major congenital malformation and several subgroups of organ specific malformations progressively increased with maternal overweight and increasing severity of obesity. For women who are planning pregnancy, efforts should be encouraged to reduce adiposity in those with a BMI above the normal range.

TI  - Diversification and domain evolution of molluskan metallothioneins: a mini review
T2  - Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Metallothionein (MT) is a multifunctional protein playing important roles in homeostatic regulation and detoxification of metals. Mollusk species have been considered as useful sentinel platforms for MT-based biomarker approaches, and they have been reported to display an extraordinary structural diversity of MT proteins. However, potential diversity of molluskan MTs has not been fully explored and recent updates have suggested the need of revision of evolutionary hypothesis for molluskan MTs.Results: Based on bioinformatic analysis and phylogenetic evidences, novel divergence mechanisms and paths were hypothesized in both gastropod and bivalve MT groups. Our analyses are suggestive of the taxon-or lineage-specific domain multiplication/duplication from the ancestral or prototypic MT. Diversification and selection of molluskan MTs might be driven by the needs for acquiring metal selectiveness, specialized novel function, and improved capacity of metal detoxification under environmentally stressed conditions.Conclusion: The structural diversity and variations of molluskan MTs are significantly larger than previously understood. Undoubtedly, molluskan MTs have undergone dynamic divergent processes in their evolutionary histories, giving rise to the great diversity of domain structures in extant MT isoforms. Novel evolutionary paths for molluskan MTs newly proposed in this review could shed additional light onto the revision of the hypothesis for evolutionary differentiation of MTs in the molluskan lineage.

TI  - Integrated change detection and temporal trajectory analysis of coastal wetlands using high spatial resolution Korean Multi-Purpose Satellite series imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of multispectral high-resolution Korean Multi-Purpose Satellite (KOMPSAT) images was used to detect the geographical changes in four different tidal flats between the Yellow Sea and the west coast of South Korea. The method of unsupervised classification was used to generate a series of land use/land cover (LULC) maps from satellite images, which were then used as input for temporal trajectory analysis to detect the temporal change of coastal wetlands and its association with natural and anthropogenic activities. The accurately classified LULC maps of KOMPSAT images, with overall accuracy ranging from 83.34% to 95.43%, indicate that these multispectral high-resolution satellite data are highly applicable to the generation of high-quality thematic maps for extracting wetlands. The result of the trajectory analysis showed that, while the variation of the tidal flats in the Gyeonggi and Jeollabuk provinces was well correlated with the regular tidal regimes, the reductive trajectory of the wetland areas belonging to the Saemangeum province was caused by a high degree of human-induced activities including large reclamation and urbanization. The conservation of the Jeungdo Wetland Protected Area in the Jeollanam province revealed that effective social and environmental policies could help in protecting coastal wetlands from degradation.

TI  - New method to estimate surface upwelling long-wave radiation from MODS cloud-free data
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important component in the surface radiation budget, surface upwelling longwave radiation (SUER) is an outcome of the land surface energy exchange and mainly represents the capability of thermal radiation from the surface of the Earth. Existing satellite derived SUER products are too coarse to support high-resolution numerical models, and their accuracy needs to be improved. In this study, an equivalent temperature is introduced through which a "split-window" atmospheric correction algorithm is developed for MODIS data to estimate the instantaneous clear-sky SUER. It is a simple and feasible method that is particularly applicable to MOMS data to acquire relatively high precision SUER under clear skies from which qualified water vapor contents (WVC) and thermal channel brightness temperatures are available. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) are less than 13 W/m(2) for all WVC sub-ranges with the viewing zenith angle (VZA) less than 30, or for all sub-ranges with the VZA less than 60 and the WVC less than 3.5 g/cm(2). Also, applications and comparisons with the LST-emissivity method are made by using ground measurements which are collected from the network of surface radiation budget network data (SURFRAD) at the moment of MODIS overpass. Results show that the proposed model has high computational efficiency to estimate SUER from MODIS cloud-free data, (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

AB  - Despite efforts and progress have been made in wetland mapping using multi-source remotely sensed data, a fine spatial and spectral resolution dynamic modeling of wetland coverage is limited. This research proposed a fusion model to generate fine-spatial-spectral-resolution images by blending multispectral images with fine spatial resolution and hyperspectral images with coarse spatial resolution. Applying the China Environment 1A series satellite (HJ-1A) CCD/HSI data, we showed that the proposed model produced reliable dataset that was not only able to capture spectral fidelity, but also could preserve spatial details. By integrating both fine spatial details and hyperspectral signatures, we further conducted a guided filtering based spectral-spatial mapping on the Poyang Lake wetland. Compared with the classification result of the CCD image, a significant higher classification accuracy of the synthetic fused image was achieved. Results also showed that the final guided-filtering based mapping result could remove potential misclassification biases and achieve higher accuracy than previous pixelwise classification methods Our study.indicated a straightforward approach to blend multi-source remotely sensed data to generate reliable, high-quality dynamic dataset for wetland mapping and ecological modelling. The synthetic combination of spatial and hyperspectral details could improve our understanding of the significance of wetland ecosystem. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Inter-annual climate variability dominates the evolution of eco-hydrological processes over the water limited basins. Haihe Basin in semi -humid northern China is under significant climate change and serious human disturbance during the recent decades, Integrated with NASA Terra-Modis remote sensing LAI data products, the VIP eco-hydrological model is used to predict the spatiotemporal variations of evapotranspiration (ET) and vegetation gross primary production (GPP) over two catchments of Haihe River branches from 2000 to 2013. Along with precipitation increasing, average annual ET and GPP are significantly increasing, The trends are more distinct over the mountainous upstream areas. The inter annual variations of ET and GPP are highly correlated with the 12-month SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index), while the monthly GPP is related clearly with 3-month SPI. Sensitivity analysis shows that there are remarkable differences in the elasticity coefficients of both ET and GPP to the climatic factors. It is found that precipitation, solar radiation and leaf area index are the most sensitive factors to ET and GPP in the study basin. The results are helpful to understand the catchment eco-hydrological mechanisms and their responses to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evolution of wetlands in lower reaches of Bagmari-Bansloi-Pagla rivers: a study using multidated images and maps
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous seasonally flooded wetlands in the lower Gangetic floodplain offer unique natural habitat for many migratory bird species due to their geographical location and hydro-ecological functioning. The various developmental projects change the riverine flow regime and cause hydro-ecological modification in the Gangetic floodplain wetland system. This study presents a comprehensive spatio-temporal monitoring of wetland dynamics in the lower segment of the Bagmari-Bansloi-Pagla sub-basin of the Ganga-Bhagirathi rivers using image classification technique and some fragmentation indices. Our results reveal that the land-use conversion and fragmentation processes that affect the wetland landscape are generally represented as the evolution, and consecutive drying and squeezing of wetland patches over the study area. The water-spreading area of the wetlands was highest during 1975 after the construction of the Bhagirathi feeder canal. The situation has worsened since 1980 due to cumulative effects of agriculture after the Green revolution, and the whole landscape has become a fragmented, isolated and agronomically managed wetland.

TI  - Using the wavelet transform to detect temporal variations in hydrological processes in the Pearl River, China
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we updated the hydrological data from the 1950s to 2012 and analysed the temporal variations in the hydrological series of the Pearl River using the wavelet transform method. Furthermore, we quantified the climatic and anthropogenic effects on the changes in the hydrological processes in the Pearl River. The results of the combined methods of the wavelet transform method and the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test (i.e., wavelet trend test) reveal that the water discharge series exhibited a statistically insignificant changing trend since the 1950s; however, the sediment load series displayed a statistically significant decreasing trend. Comparisons of the results of the MK trend test and the wavelet trend test indicate that annual and inter-annual periodic oscillations affect the trend changes in the hydrological series. Statistical analysis and the double mass curve indicate that climatic change dominates changes in water discharge, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and human activities were mainly responsible for the phase changes in the sediment load. From 1973 to 1986, deforestation in the basin dominated the sediment variability and caused 83.2% of the increase in the sediment load compared to the reference period of 1957-1972. Even though water and soil conservation projects have Ueen carried out since the early 1990s, the vegetation cover in the catchment area decreased by 6.5 x 10(4) km(2) from the late 1980s to the late 2000s, as detected by Landsat TM images, and water and soil conservation projects had little effect on the sediment reduction. Since the 1990s, dam construction has dominated sediment variability. Compared to the reference period, the sediment load due to dam construction decreased by 83.4 kg/s and 993.3 kg/s in the periods of 1987-1998 and 1998-2006, respectively, and the reduction in the sediment load increased to 1329.5 kg/s in the period of 2007-2012, indicating the intensifying impact of dam construction on the sediment reduction. The sediment sources in the Pearl River basin have changed, and scouring of the river channel has become a new sediment source in response to dam construction. The alteration of hydrological processes in the Pearl River will continue to occur in the future in the context of global climatic change, which is becoming increasingly important for river management in the Pearl River basin.

TI  - Comparative analysis of spectral characteristics of EO-1 ALI and Landsat 8 OLI imagery
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat 8 (L8) is the only normally operating Landsat satellite at present, and the Earth Observing One (EO-1) Advanced Land Imager (ALI) was the prototype for operational land imager (OLI) on-board the L8 satellite. To comprehend well the differences in spectral characteristics between the two sensors, six nearly simultaneous image pairs were selected, which included five land-cover categories: water, bare soil, vegetation, manmade and rock. Moreover, comparisons of spectral characteristics were made through orbital parameters, imaging parameters, spectral response characteristics and spectral characteristics. Finally, the mutual quantitative relations were built up among these image pairs. The results demonstrate that Landsat 8 OLI and EO-1 ALI have similar orbital parameters. With regard to the imaging and spectral response characteristics, the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of EO-1 ALI are slightly different from those of L8 OLI, but there is a high correlation between EO-1 ALI and L8 OLI of TOA reflectance and NDVI, with the coefficients of determination ranging from 0.962 to 0.994. Therefore, the TOA reflectance and NDVI images from the two sensors are complementary.

M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDSentinel-lymph-node biopsy is associated with increased melanoma-specific survival (i.e., survival until death from melanoma) among patients with node-positive intermediate-thickness melanomas (1.2 to 3.5 mm). The value of completion lymph-node dissection for patients with sentinel-node metastases is not clear.METHODSIn an international trial, we randomly assigned patients with sentinel-node metastases detected by means of standard pathological assessment or a multimarker molecular assay to immediate completion lymph-node dissection (dissection group) or nodal observation with ultrasonography (observation group). The primary end point was melanoma-specific survival. Secondary end points included disease-free survival and the cumulative rate of nonsentinel-node metastasis.RESULTSImmediate completion lymph-node dissection was not associated with increased melanoma-specific survival among 1934 patients with data that could be evaluated in an intention-to-treat analysis or among 1755 patients in the per-protocol analysis. In the per-protocol analysis, the mean (+/-SE) 3-year rate of melanoma-specific survival was similar in the dissection group and the observation group (86+/-1.3% and 86+/-1.2%, respectively; P = 0.42 by the log-rank test) at a median follow-up of 43 months. The rate of disease-free survival was slightly higher in the dissection group than in the observation group (68+/-1.7% and 63+/-1.7%, respectively; P = 0.05 by the log-rank test) at 3 years, based on an increased rate of disease control in the regional nodes at 3 years (92+/-1.0% vs. 77+/-1.5%; P<0.001 by the log-rank test); these results must be interpreted with caution. Nonsentinel-node metastases, identified in 11.5% of the patients in the dissection group, were a strong, independent prognostic factor for recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.78; P = 0.005). Lymphedema was observed in 24.1% of the patients in the dissection group and in 6.3% of those in the observation group.CONCLUSIONSImmediate completion lymph-node dissection increased the rate of regional disease control and provided prognostic information but did not increase melanoma-specific survival among patients with melanoma and sentinel-node metastases.

TI  - Volcanic deformation of Atosanupuri volcanic complex in the Kussharo caldera, Japan, from 1993 to 2016 revealed by JERS-1, ALOS, and ALOS-2 radar interferometry
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of uplifts and subsidences of a volcanic complex in the Kussharo caldera in eastern Hokkaido (Japan) has been revealed by interferometric analysis using archived satellite synthetic aperture radar data. A time series of inter-ferograms from 1993 to 1998 showed the temporal evolution of a ground deformation process. The horizontal dimension of the deformation field was about 10 km in diameter, and the maximum amplitude of the deformation was >20 cm. Uplift started in 1994, and concurrent earthquake swarm activity was observed around the uplift area; however, no other phenomena were observed during this period. A subsidence process then followed, with the shape of the deformation forming a mirror image of the uplift. Model simulations suggest deformation was caused by a source at the depth of about 6 km and that the position of the source remained static throughout the episode. Subsidence of the volcanic complex was also observed by another satellite from 2007 to 2010, and likely continued for more than 10 years. In addition to the main uplift-subsidence sequence, small deformation patterns with short spatial wavelengths were observed at the center of the deforming area. Data from three satellites recorded small-scale subsidence of the Atosanupuri and Rishiri lava domes at a constant rate of approx. 1 cm/year from 1993 to 2016.

TI  - Remote sensing of PM2.5 during cloudy and nighttime periods using ceilometer backscatter
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter d <= 2.5 mu m) mass concentration has become of more importance recently because of the negative impacts of fine particles on human health. However, monitoring PM2.5 during cloudy and nighttime periods is difficult since nearly all the passive instruments used for aerosol remote sensing are not able to measure aerosol optical depth (AOD) under either cloudy or nighttime conditions. In this study, an empirical model based on the regression between PM2.5 and the near-surface backscatter measured by ceilometers was developed and tested using 6 years of data (2006 to 2011) from the Howard University Beltsville Campus (HUBC) site. The empirical model can explain similar to 56, similar to 34 and similar to 42% of the variability in the hourly average PM2.5 during daytime clear, daytime cloudy and nighttime periods, respectively. Meteorological conditions and seasons were found to influence the relationship between PM2.5 mass concentration and the surface backscatter. Overall the model can explain similar to 48% of the variability in the hourly average PM2.5 at the HUBC site when considering the seasonal variation. The model also was tested using 4 years of data (2012 to 2015) from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site, which was geographically and climatologically different from the HUBC site. The results show that the empirical model can explain similar to 66 and similar to 82% of the variability in the daily average PM2.5 at the ARM SGP site and HUBC site, respectively. The findings of this study illustrate the strong need for ceilometer data in air quality monitoring under cloudy and nighttime conditions. Since ceilometers are used broadly over the world, they may provide an important supplemental source of information of aerosols to determine surface PM2.5 concentrations.

TI  - Differences in liquid cloud droplet effective radius and number concentration estimates between MODIS collections 5.1 and 6 over global oceans
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Differences in cloud droplet effective radius and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) estimates inferred from the Aqua-MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) collections 5.1 (C5.1) and 6 (C6) cloud products (MYD06) are examined for warm clouds over global oceans for the year 2008. Individual pixel level retrievals for both collections are aggregated to 1 degrees x 1 degrees and compared globally and regionally for the three main spectral channel pairs used for MODIS cloud optical property retrievals. Comparisons between both collections are performed for cases in which all three effective radii retrievals are classified by the MODIS cloud product as valid. The contribution to the observed differences of several key MYD06 Collection 6 algorithm updates are also explored, with a focus on changes to the surface reflectance model, assumed solar irradiance, above-cloud emission, cloud-top pressure (CTP), and pixel registration. Global results show a neutral to positive (> 50 cm(-3)) change for C6-derived CDNC relative to C5.1 for the 1.6 and 2.1 mu m channel retrievals, corresponding to a neutral to 2 mu m difference in droplet effective radius (r(e)). For 3.7 mu m retrievals, CDNC results show a negative change in the tropics, with differences transitioning toward positive values with increasing latitude spanning 25 to +50 cm(-3) related to a + 2.5 to -1 mu m transition in effective radius. Cloud optical thickness (tau) differences were small relative to effective radius and found to not significantly impact CDNC estimates. Regionally, the magnitude and behavior of the annual CDNC cycle are compared for each effective radius retrieval. Results from this study indicate significant inter-collection differences in aggregated values of effective radius due to changes to the precomputed retrieval lookup tables (LUTs) for ocean scenes, changes to retrieved cloud-top pressure, solar irradiance, or above-cloud thermal emission, depending upon spectral channel. The observed differences between collections may have implications for existing MODIS-derived climatologies and validation studies of effective radius and CDNC.

TI  - Distribution and drivers of global mangrove forest change, 1996-2010
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - For the period 1996-2010, we provide the first indication of the drivers behind mangrove land cover and land use change across the (pan-) tropics using time-series Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array-type L-band SAR (PALSAR) data. Multi-temporal radar mosaics were manually interpreted for evidence of loss and gain in forest extent and its associated driver. Mangrove loss as a consequence of human activities was observed across their entire range. Between 1996-2010 12% of the 1168 1 degrees x1 degrees radar mosaic tiles examined contained evidence of mangrove loss, as a consequence of anthropogenic degradation, with this increasing to 38% when combined with evidence of anthropogenic activity prior to 1996. The greatest proportion of loss was observed in Southeast Asia, whereby approximately 50% of the tiles in the region contained evidence of mangrove loss, corresponding to 18.4% of the global mangrove forest tiles. Southeast Asia contained the greatest proportion (33.8%) of global mangrove forest. The primary driver of anthropogenic mangrove loss was found to be the conversion of mangrove to aquaculture/agriculture, although substantial advance of mangroves was also evident in many regions.

TI  - Historical grassland desertification changes in the Horqin Sandy Land, Northern China (1985-2013)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since rural reforms in the 1980s, both the state and local governments of China have devoted great efforts to combating desertification through a number of eco-environmental restoration campaigns, resulting in burgeoning contention at all levels of government and sparking public concern. Monitoring and accurately assessing the statuses and trends of grassland desertification are important for developing effective restoration strategies. The Horqin Sandy Land (HSL), a very typical desertified grassland (DG) with better hydrothermal conditions among sandy lands in north China, was recently selected (1985-2013) to assess the spatiotemporal dynamic performances of grassland desertification before and after implementing restoration projects. Landsat images (TM/ETM+/OLI), field investigations and expert review were integrated to form a classification scheme for the HSL. Then, spectral mixture analysis and the decision-tree method were used to extract bare-sand ratios and vegetation cover fraction dynamics. A favourable phenomenon of DG was seen to be reversed in an accelerated pace during 2001-2013, despite challenge from both climatic and anthropogenic factors. However, overexploitation of grassland (especially for farming) and ground water for irrigation has led to remarkable decreases in the ground water level in recent decades, which should be highly concerning regarding the formulation of restoration campaigns in the sandy land.

TI  - Recent tree cover increases in eastern China linked to low, declining human pressure, steep topography, and climatic conditions favoring tree growth
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, the extent of forest continues to decline, however, some countries have increased their forest extent in recent years. China is one of these countries and has managed to increase their tree cover through huge reforestation and afforestation programs during recent decades as well as land abandonment dynamics. This study investigates tree cover change in the eastern half of China between 2000 and 2010 on three different scales, using random forest modeling of remote sensing data for tree cover in relation to environmental and anthropogenic predictor variables. Our results show that between the years 2000 and 2010 2,667,875 km 2 experienced an increase in tree cover while 1,854,900 km(2) experienced a decline in tree cover. The area experiencing >= 10% increase in tree cover is almost twice as large as the area with >= 10% drop in tree cover. There is a clear relation between topography and tree cover change with steeper and mid-elevation areas having a larger response on tree cover increase than other areas. Furthermore, human influence, change in population density, and actual evapotranspiration are also important factors in explaining where tree cover has changed. This study adds to the understanding of tree cover change in China, as it has focus on the entire eastern half of China on three different scales and how tree cover change is linked to topography and anthropogenic pressure. Though, our results show an increase in tree cover in China, this study emphasizes the importance of incorporating anthropogenic factors together with biodiversity protection into the reforestation and afforestation programs in the future.

TI  - Changing patterns of fire occurrence in proximity to forest edges, roads and rivers between NW Amazonian countries
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests in NW Amazonia are highly threatened by the expansion of the agricultural frontier and subsequent deforestation. Fire is used, both directly and indirectly, in Brazilian Amazonia to propagate deforestation and increase forest accessibility. Forest fragmentation, a measure of forest degradation, is also attributed to fire occurrence in the tropics. However, outside the Brazilian Legal Amazonia the role of fire in increasing accessibility and forest fragmentation is less explored. In this study, we compared fire regimes in five countries that share this tropical biome in the most north-westerly part of the Amazon Basin (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil). We analysed spatial differences in the timing of peak fire activity and in relation to proximity to roads and rivers using 12 years of MODIS active fire detections. We also distinguished patterns of fire in relation to forest fragmentation by analysing fire distance to the forest edge as a measure of fragmentation for each country. We found significant hemispheric differences in peak fire occurrence with the highest number of fires in the south in 2005 vs. 2007 in the north. Despite this, both hemispheres are equally affected by fire. We also found difference in peak fire occurrence by country. Fire peaked in February in Colombia and Venezuela, whereas it peaked in September in Brazil and Peru, and finally Ecuador presented two fire peaks in January and October. We confirmed the relationship between fires and forest fragmentation for all countries and also found significant differences in the distance between the fire and the forest edge for each country. Fires were associated with roads and rivers in most countries. These results can inform land use planning at the regional, national and subnational scales to minimize the contribution of road expansion and subsequent access to the Amazonian natural resources to fire occurrence and the associated deforestation and carbon emissions.

TI  - Increased risk of brain metastases in women with breast cancer and p16 expression in metastatic lymph-nodes
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Metastatic breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality in women, partly on account of brain metastases. However, the mechanisms by which cancer cells cross the blood-brain barrier remain undeciphered. Most molecular studies predicting metastatic risk have been performed on primary breast cancer samples. Here we studied metastatic lymph-nodes from patients with breast cancers to identify markers associated with the occurrence of brain metastases.Results: Transcriptomic analyses identified CDKN2A/p16 as a gene potentially associated with brain metastases.Materials and Methods: Fifty-two patients with HER2-overexpressing or triple-negative breast carcinoma with lymph nodes and distant metastases were included in this study. Transcriptomic analyses were performed on laser-microdissected tumor cells from 28 metastatic lymph-nodes. Supervised analyses compared the transcriptomic profiles of women who developed brain metastases and those who did not. As a validation series, we studied metastatic lymph-nodes from 24 other patients.Immunohistochemistry investigations showed that p16 mean scores were significantly higher in patients with brain metastases than in patients without (7.4 vs. 1.7 respectively, p < 0.01). This result was confirmed on the validation series. Multivariate analyses showed that the p16 score was the only variable positively associated with the risk of brain metastases (p = 0.01).With the same threshold of 5 for p16 scores using a Cox model, overall survival was shorter in women with a p16 score over 5 in both series.Conclusions: The risk of brain metastases in women with HER2-overexpressing or triple-negative breast cancer could be better assessed by studying p16 protein expression on surgically removed axillary lymph-nodes.

TI  - Satellite-based high-resolution mapping of rainfall over southern Africa
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - A spatially explicit mapping of rainfall is necessary for southern Africa for eco-climatological studies or nowcasting but accurate estimates are still a challenging task. This study presents a method to estimate hourly rainfall based on data from the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SE-VIRI). Rainfall measurements from about 350 weather stations from 2010-2014 served as ground truth for calibration and validation. SEVIRI and weather station data were used to train neural networks that allowed the estimation of rainfall area and rainfall quantities over all times of the day. The results revealed that 60% of recorded rainfall events were correctly classified by the model (probability of detection, POD). However, the false alarm ratio (FAR) was high (0.80), leading to a Heidke skill score (HSS) of 0.18. Estimated hourly rainfall quantities were estimated with an average hourly correlation of rho = 0.33 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.72. The correlation increased with temporal aggregation to 0.52 (daily), 0.67 (weekly) and 0.71 (monthly). The main weakness was the overestimation of rainfall events. The model results were compared to the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. Despite being a comparably simple approach, the presented MSGbased rainfall retrieval outperformed GPM IMERG in terms of rainfall area detection: GPM IMERG had a considerably lower POD. The HSS was not significantly different compared to the MSG-based retrieval due to a lower FAR of GPM IMERG. There were no further significant differences between the MSG-based retrieval and GPM IMERG in terms of correlation with the observed rainfall quantities. The MSG-based retrieval, however, provides rainfall in a higher spatial resolution. Though estimating rainfall from satellite data remains challenging, especially at high temporal resolutions, this study showed promising results towards improved spatio-temporal estimates of rainfall over southern Africa.

TI  - Satellite data based estimation of methane emissions from rice paddies in the Sanjiang Plain in northeast China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sanjiang Plain (SJP), one of the major rice producing regions in China, is an important source of methane (CH4) emissions. However, there have been large uncertainties in the estimates of CH4 emissions from this area during the past few years. In this study, we estimated CH4 emissions using a process-based model derived by rice area, CH4 flux, land surface temperature (LST), and the ratio of precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (ET) in rice paddies in the SJP during the rice growing seasons in 2000, 2006, and 2010, respectively. The results showed that the total area of rice fields was 1.64 million ha in 2010, which was approximately 35 and 13% higher than in 2000 and 2006, respectively. The average LST was 22.1 degrees C in 2000 which was higher than in 2006 (21.6 degrees C) and 2010 (21.5 degrees C). Monthly ET and P displayed similar seasonal and annual variability. The monthly ET was 61.7, 66.5, and 63.0 mm month(-1) and P was 85.1, 80.6 and 85.9 mm month(-1) during the rice growing seasons in 2000, 2006, and 2010, respectively. The averaged CH4 flux rates were 24.83, 24.63, and 24.59 ton km(-2), and the estimated mean annual CH4 emissions from rice paddies were 0.30, 0.36, and 0. 40 Tg yr(-1) in 2000, 2006, and 2010, respectively. The CH4 emissions displayed obvious spatial variations that decreased from east to west in the SJP, and were mainly affected by temperature. The results will improve our understanding of the interannual and spatial variations of CH4 emissions and provide a more accurate regional budget of CH4 emissions from rice paddies in the Sanjiang Plain.

TI  - The evaluation of land consolidation policy in improving agricultural productivity in China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - China is presently undergoing rapid economic development and unprecedented urbanization. Concerns over food security have prompted the Chinese government to implement large-scale land consolidation projects. However, no formal evaluation has been conducted on such projects. Thus, effectiveness of land consolidation policy remains uncertain. We obtained detailed geo-spatial information for 5328 land consolidation projects implemented between 2006 and 2010, and used time-series MODIS NDVI (2006-2016) data to assess effectiveness of China's land consolidation policy in improving agricultural productivity. Our results show that the overall effectiveness of land consolidation in improving agricultural productivity is low, which lies in contrast to optimistic estimates based on regional statistical analysis and theoretical approaches. For projects (n = 560) implemented in 2006, about 29.5% showed significant (p < 0.05) increasing trends of MODIS NDVI after implementation of land consolidation. For 2007-2010, lower percentages (e.g., 25.9% in 2007 and 13.5% in 2010) of projects showed significant increasing trends. Furthermore, we found effectiveness of land consolidation projects displayed clear regional differences and driving factors are inconsistent with policy design. We anticipate our research to be a starting point for a more comprehensive evaluation involving longer time-series and higher spatial resolution data.

TI  - Monitoring of ground movement in open pit iron mines of Carajas Province (Amazon region) based on A-DInSAR techniques using TerraSAR-X data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) analysis of a large area is always a challenging task regarding the removal of the atmospheric phase component. This work presents an investigation of ground movement measurements based on a combination of differential SAR interferometry time-series (DTS) and PSI techniques, applied on a large area of extent with open pit iron mines located in Carajas (Brazilian Amazon Region), aiming at detecting linear and nonlinear ground movement. These mines have presented a history of instability, and surface monitoring measurements over sectors of the mines (pit walls) have been carried out based on ground-based radar and total station (prisms). Using a priori information regarding the topographic phase error and a phase displacement model derived from DTS, temporal phase unwrapping in the PSI processing and the removal of the atmospheric phases can be performed more efficiently. A set of 33 TerraSAR-X (TSX-1) images, acquired during the period from March 2012 to April 2013, was used to perform this investigation. The DTS analysis was carried out on a stack of multilook unwrapped interferograms using an extension of SVD to obtain the least-square solution. The height errors and deformation rates provided by the DTS approach were subtracted from the stack of interferograms to perform the PSI analysis. This procedure improved the capability of the PSI analysis for detecting high rates of deformation, as well as increased the numbers of point density of the final results. The proposed methodology showed good results for monitoring surface displacement in a large mining area, which is located in a rain forest environment, providing very useful information about the ground movement for planning and risk control.

TI  - Novel rapid-immunohistochemistry using an alternating current electric field for intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node status and pathological diagnosis of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) is a prognostic factor that influences management of postoperative therapy. Recent reports indicate that one-step nucleic acid amplification and hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained frozen sections are effective for intraoperative diagnosis of SLNs. In the present study, we report a rapid-immunohistochemical staining (R-IHC) method that enables intraoperative detection of SLN metastases within 16 min using an anti-cytokeratin antibody. This is the first report on SLN diagnosis using R-IHC in patients with breast cancer. We prospectively examined 160 dissected SLNs from 108 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery at our institute. The dissected SLNs were sectioned and conventionally stained with HE or immunohistochemically labeled with anti-cytokeratin antibody using R-IHC procedures. Intraoperative R-IHC analyses were completed within 16 min, after which diagnoses were made by two pathologists. The total time required for intraoperative diagnosis was about 20 min. In this study series, R-IHC detected four metastatic SLNs that were undetected using conventional HE staining (4/20, 20.0%). Compared with subsequent permanent diagnosis, R-IHC offered 95.2% sensitivity and 100% specificity. These findings indicate R-IHC is a clinically applicable technique that enables precise and quick intraoperative detection of micro-and macrometastasis in breast cancer.

TI  - Temperature and electron density in femtosecond filament-induced Cu plasma
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), which is also known as laser-induced plasma spectroscopy (LIPS), is a very promising spectral analysis technique for detecting elemental composition. The possibility of remote operation of LIBS is one of the properties, which expands the application scope of this technique. The remote LIBS technique is based on a long-range lens. With the increase of focusing distance, it is difficult to tightly focus laser pulse due to the diffraction limits. The size of focusing spot increases with focusing distance increasing. This will require extremely high laser energy. Femtosecond laser filamentation due to optical Kerr effect can be applied to the remote LIBS. During the filament propagation, the waist of laser beam is close to a constant value. The laser intensity inside the filament is about 10(13) W/cm(2) (intensity clamping). The intensity is sufficient to ablate sample and produce the plasma. It can overcome the influence of the diffraction limit in nanosecond LIBS. Although many researchers have studied the femtosecond geometrical focusing and femtosecond filamentation LIBSs, the spectral characteristics have not been completely understood. In this paper, we study the femtosecond laser filament-induced Cu plasma spectroscopy. Femtosecond laser system is an ultrafast Ti:sapphire amplifier (Coherent Libra). The full-width at the half maximum is 50 fs at a wavelength of 800 nm with a repetition rate of 1 kHz and its output energy is 3.5 mJ. A quartz lens with a focal length of 1 m is used to focus the laser to generate a filament channel. The spectral intensity of produced Cu plasma along the filament channel is measured by using the optical emission spectroscopy, and the distribution of Cu(I) intensity versus the distance between sample and focused lens is obtained. The results indicate that in a longer distance range along the filament, plasma spectroscopy has stronger emission due to the intensity clamping effect in femtosecond laser filamentation. In addition, we also calculate the plasma temperature and electron density by using the Boltzmann plot and the Stark broadening. The plasma temperature and electron density along the filament channel can be divided into three main regions:region 1) from 950 mm to 970 mm, in which the plasma temperature and electron density increase with the increase of distance; region 2) from 970 mm to 1030 mm, in which the change of plasma excitation temperature is opposite to the change of electron density; region 3) from 1030 mm to 1050 mm, in which the plasma temperature and electron density decrease with the increase of distance.

TI  - A Potential Role of Esophageal Cancer Related Gene-4 for Atrial Fibrillation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Epidemiological studies have shown a strong correlation between tumor and AF. However, the molecular link between tumor and AF remains unknown. ECRG4, a tumor suppressor gene that is expressed in the A-V node and in sporadic ventricular myocytes, inhibits tumorigenesis and monitors tissue homeostasis by functioning as a 'sentinel' molecule gauging inflammatory and cell proliferative responses. To explore the potential physiological function of Ecrg4 in heart, we evaluated its distribution in heart, analyzed its expression in patients with persistent AF and in a canine AF model, and dissected the molecular events downstream of Ecrg4. The results showed that the level of Ecrg4 expression is homogenously high in atria and the conduction systems and in sporadic ventricular myocytes. Importantly, the expression of Ecrg4 was significantly decreased in atrial appendages of AF patients than patients with SR. Moreover, in rapid pacing canine AF models, the expression of ECRG4 in atria was significantly decreased compared to that of the controls. Mechanistically, knockdown ECRG4 in atrial myocytes significantly shortened the APDs, inhibited the expression of Gja1, and activated pro-inflammatory cascades and genes involved in cardiac remodeling. These results suggest that Ecrg4 may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of AF.

TI  - Intraoperative electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopic localization of small, deep, or subsolid pulmonary nodules
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Localizing small or deep pulmonary nodules or subsolid groundglass opacities often is difficult during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS). This can result in larger resections or conversion to thoracotomy. The goal of this study is to evaluate the role of electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopic localization (ENBL) as a safe and accurate intraoperative method to localize small, deep, or subsolid nodules.Methods: This is a single-institution, single-surgeon retrospective study of all patients (51) who underwent combined ENBL and resection of 54 nodules between May 2013 and August 2015. Localization was performed by intraoperative ENBL-guided transbronchial injection of a liquid marker. The liquid marker used was methylene blue, either alone or in addition to indocyanine green and Isovue. A fiduciary also was added in 2 cases. Immediately after localization, the patients underwent VATS for evaluation before proceeding with RATS for anatomical sublobar resection.Results: The mean preoperative largest nodule diameter on computed tomography scan was 13.3 mm (range, 4-44 mm). The mean distance from the surface of the lung to the middle of the nodule was 22 mm (range, 4-38 mm). Thirty-one nodules were solid (57.4%), whereas 23 were ground-glass opacities (42.6%). ENBL successfully localized the nodules for initial sublobar resection in 53 of 54 nodules (98.1%). Minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery was performed successfully in 49 of 51 patients (96.1%), by RATS in 47 (92.2%), and VATS in 2 (3.9%). Two patients required conversion to thoracotomy secondary to extensive adhesions. Of the 54 nodules, final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma in 32 (59.2%), metastatic disease in 7 (13%), squamous cell carcinoma in 2 (3.7%), neuroendocrine tumor in 2 (3.7%), and benign in 11 (20.3%). There were no operative mortalities. Morbidities included acute renal insufficiency in 2 patients and prolonged air leak requiring a Heimlich valve in 3 patients. Mean length of stay was 3.9 days.Conclusions: ENBL is a safe and accurate intraoperative modality for targeted sublobar resection of pulmonary nodules that are deemed difficult to localize.

TI  - Estimating the water budget components and their variability in a pre-alpine basin with JGrass-NewAGE
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of water resources at basin scale requires modelling of all components of the hydrological system. Because of the great uncertainties associated with the estimation of each water cycle component and the large error in budget closure that results, water budget is rarely carried out explicitly. This paper fills the gap in providing a methodology for obtaining it routinely at daily and subdaily time scales. In this study, we use various strategies to improve water budget closure in a small basin of Italian Prealps. The specific objectives are: assessing the predictive performances of different Kriging methods to determine the most accurate precipitation estimates; using MODIS imagery data to assist in the separation of snowfall and rainfall; combining the Priestley-Taylor evapotranspiration model with the Budyko hypothesis to estimate at high resolution (in time and space) actual evapotranspiration (ET); using an appropriate calibration-validation strategy to forecast discharge spatially. For this, 18 years of spatial time series of precipitation, snow water equivalent, rainfall-runoffand ET at hourly time steps are simulated for the Posina River basin (Northeast Italy) using the JGrass-NewAGE system. Among the interpolation methods considered, local detrended kriging is seen to give the best performances in forecasting precipitation distribution. However, detrended Kriging gives better results in simulating discharges. The parameters optimized at the basin outlet over a five-year period show acceptable performances during the validation period at the outlet and at interior points of the basin. The use of the Budyko hypothesis to guide the ET estimation shows encouraging results, with less uncertainty than the values reported in literature. Aggregating at a long temporal scale, the mean annual water budget for the Posina River basin is about 1269 +/- 372 mm (76.4%) runoff, 503.5 +/- 35.5 mm (30%) evapotranspiration, and -50 +/- 129 mm (-4.2%) basin storage from basin precipitation of 1730 +/- 344 mm. The highest interannual variability is shown for precipitation, followed by discharge. Evapotranspiration shows less interannual variability and is less dependent on precipitation.

TI  - Envisat RA-2 Individual Echoes: A Unique Dataset for a Better Understanding of Inland Water Altimetry Potentialities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploitation of synthetic aperture properties in nadir-looking radars is opening new scenarios in the framework of satellite radar altimetry. Both recent and upcoming missions including Cryosat-2, Sentinel-3, Sentinel-6 and SWOT take benefit from the coherent processing of radar data, aimed at improving range measurements in particular contexts, such as ice, open ocean, coastal zone, and even inland waters. This work investigates the possibilities offered by current and future satellite radar altimetry missions for the study of inland water bodies, probing into the peculiarities of the expected radar returns and their potential usage. In this regard, signals collected by the RA-2 instrument (Radar Altimeter 2) onboard the Envisat mission offer an unprecedented possibility, even with a relatively low pulse repetition frequency, to analyze the peculiarities of actual signals for detecting and ranging small water surfaces. In particular, the RA-2 instrument offers a global archive of Individual Echoes (IEs), collected at the native sampling rate of 1795 Hz, in addition to the 18 Hz data obtained by incoherent averaging, which are typically delivered to the users as standard products. RA-2 shares with future radar platforms such as Sentinel-6 a continuous and interleaved working modality, as was recommended by the scientific community in designing next missions' requirements. This is a further reason to consider the usage of RA-2 IEs as particularly attractive. Whilst only available for a small percentage of the earth's surface, sufficient IE data exist to study the height retrieval capability of these echoes, in particular for what concerns small water bodies, where we show that enough coherence is exhibited for focusing relatively narrow surfaces and range them correctly. A peculiar aspect of this work lies in the assumption that most of the returned echoes (in RA-2 IEs) are specular. A theoretical framework is developed according to this assumption, which is validated by investigating real RA-2 data and observing their related specular features. In particular, we discuss how specular echoes are expected to be very common in inland altimetry, and are most often associated with small to medium size lakes and rivers. This paper illustrates the expected electromagnetic behavior of specular water targets by exploiting the classical radar cross-section (RCS) theory for specular surfaces. Results from the model are compared with real IE data in three selected case studies, regarding two rivers of variable width and one flood plain, in order to check different hydrological regimes. The model very closely matches the data in all cases, making the results of this validation activity very promising. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility of using satellite radar altimetry in rivers much smaller than what was considered possible until now.

TI  - Evaluation of watershed scale changes in groundwater and soil moisture storage with the application of GRACE satellite imagery data
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - As a hidden resource, our understanding and knowledge on the distribution of groundwater and its quantity is limited. In areas where such data is scarce, geo-observatory products such as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) can provide an accurate estimate of changes in total terrestrial water storage at a coarser, regional resolution. However, in the Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia, groundwater is stored in localized aquifers, and its flow is controlled by physical variables (local geology, soil cover, slope, elevation difference, topographic index and drainage density) and climate (rainfall). The objective of this study is to utilize GRACE (CSR RL05) for the evaluation of spatial and temporal changes of soil moisture and groundwater storage at watershed scale. A geographic information system (GIS) based multi-layer analysis of the physical variables is implemented to delineate aquifer potential zones. The aquifer potential zone of the basin is combined with the GRACE (CSR RL05) based change in total terrestrial water storage data. Accordingly, the very high and high potential aquifer zone classes demarcate hot spots of high groundwater storage fluctuations recorded by the satellite data. The change in storage fluctuation of the 11-year monthly data, from 2003 to 2013, reveals that the total terrestrial water storage of the basin has declined by 1837 cm. This is equivalent to the loss of 2.21 BCM of water within 11 years. Groundwater and soil moisture gains are a response of recharge, hence it is highly recommended to promote groundwater recharge, soil moisture harvesting, and sustainable use. On the other hand, the study highlights the possibility of application of the regional GRACE (CSR RL05) product for watershed-scale evaluations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Temporal change of glaciers area and geomorphometric parameters in Parbati valley, Himachal Pradesh, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal change in the glacier coverage is analyzed for the period between 1962 and 2003 in Parbati valley, Himachal Pradesh. It is observed that the total glacier cover has been decreased by 17% ranging between 8 and 100% for individual glacier. The pattern of de-glaciation shows a high degree of shrinkage in outer zone of Parbati valley, while least shrinkage is observed in the inner valley. The present study is conducted to establish relationship between glacio-geomorphic parameters and glaciers shrinkage pattern to predict the future glacier cover in warming scenario. Asystematic change is observed for glacio-geomorphic parameters associated with temporal change in glacier cover. It is observed that mean and minimum elevation, slope, relief and duration of insolation have changed substantially. Maximum elevation, plan/profile curvatures and aspect have shown less change from 1962 to 2003. A correlation matrix between glacio-geomorphic parameters for glaciers between 1962 and 2003 shows that the recent glaciers are much more controlled by terrain characteristics than that in the recent past.

TI  - Validation of Sentinel-1A SAR Coastal Wind Speeds Against Scanning LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-accuracy wind data for coastal regions is needed today, e.g., for the assessment of wind resources. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the only satellite borne sensor that has enough resolution to resolve wind speeds closer than 10 km to shore but the Geophysical Model Functions (GMF) used for SAR wind retrieval are not fully validated here. Ground based scanning light detection and ranging (LiDAR) offer high horizontal resolution wind velocity measurements with high accuracy, also in the coastal zone. This study, for the first time, examines accuracies of SAR wind retrievals at 10 m height with respect to the distance to shore by validation against scanning LiDARs. Comparison of 15 Sentinel-1A wind retrievals using the GMF called C-band model 5.N (CMOD5.N) versus LiDARs show good agreement. It is found, when nondimenionalising with a reference point, that wind speed reductions are between 4% and 8% from 3 km to 1 km from shore. Findings indicate that SAR wind retrievals give reliable wind speed measurements as close as 1 km to the shore. Comparisons of SAR winds versus two different LiDAR configurations yield root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.31 ms(-1) and 1.42 ms(-1) for spatially averaged wind speeds.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The BG-Sentinelt (R) (BGS) trap has recently been redesigned for increased durability and ergonomic functionality, marketed as the BG-Sentinel 2 (R) (BGS2). We evaluated the trapping performance of these 2 traps in addition to the BG-Sentinel prototype (BGSP), a model similar to the BGS2 that was beta tested in several US states in 2014, and the BG-SNAP (SNAP), which is a prototype revision of the BG-Mosquititoe (TM). We also evaluated 2 new Biogents AG lures: the BG-Lure cartridge and BG-Sweetscente (TM), as they are granular formulations replacing the original mesh BG-Luret (R). Evaluations were conducted between July and September 2015 under field conditions within a suburban area in southeastern Virginia. The 4 traps were compared with their respective lure systems (BGS, BGSP, and BGS2 with BG-Lure cartridge; SNAP with BG-Sweetscent). No significant differences were seen in total female mosquito collections among the 3 BG-Sentinel models. All 3 Sentinels collected significantly more female mosquitoes than the SNAP (P <= 0.009); BGS and BGS2 both collected significantly more Aedes albopictus females than the SNAP (P <= 0.02). The 2 lures were compared in both BGS2 and SNAP traps. Although both lures performed significantly better in the BGS2 trap (P <= 0.0003), there were no significant differences in number of mosquitoes or species composition collected with BG-Sweetscent and BG-Lure cartridge within the same trap type.

TI  - Comparing Passive Microwave with Visible-To-Near-Infrared Phenometrics in Croplands of Northern Eurasia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Planting and harvesting times drive cropland phenology. There are few datasets that derive explicit phenological metrics, and these datasets use the visible to near infrared (VNIR) spectrum. Many different methods have been used to derive phenometrics such as Start of Season (SOS) and End of Season (EOS), leading to differing results. This discrepancy is partly due to spatial and temporal compositing of the VNIR satellite data to minimize data gaps resulting from cloud cover, atmospheric aerosols, and solar illumination constraints. Phenometrics derived from the downward Convex Quadratic model (CxQ) include Peak Height (PH) and Thermal Time to Peak (TTP), which are more consistent than SOS and EOS because they are minimally affected by snow and frost and other non-vegetation related issues. Here, we have determined PH using the vegetation optical depth (VOD) in three microwave frequencies (6.925, 10.65 and 18.7 GHz) and accumulated growing degree-days derived from AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS) data at a spatial resolution of 25 km. We focus on 50 AMSR-E cropland pixels in the major grain production areas of Northern Eurasia (Ukraine, southwestern Russia, and northern Kazakhstan) for 2003-2010. We compared the land surface phenologies of AMSR-E VOD and MODIS NDVI data. VOD time series tracked cropland seasonal dynamics similar to that recorded by the NDVI. The coefficients of determination for the CxQ model fit of the NDVI data were high for all sites (0.78 < R-2 < 0.99). The 10.65 GHz VOD (VOD1065GHz) achieved the best linear regression fit (R-2 = 0.84) with lowest standard error (SEE = 0.128); it is therefore recommended for microwave VOD studies of cropland land surface phenology. Based on an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) analysis, the slopes from the linear regression fit were not significantly different by microwave frequency, whereas the intercepts were significantly different, given the different magnitudes of the VODs. PHs for NDVI and VOD were highly correlated. Despite their strong correspondence, there was generally a lag of AMSR-E PH VOD10.65GHz by about two weeks compared to MODIS peak greenness. To evaluate the utility of the PH determination based on maximum value, we correlated the CxQ derived and maximum value determined PHs of NDVI and found that they were highly correlated with R-2 of 0.87, but with a one-week bias. Considering the one-week bias between the two methods, we find that PH of VOD10.65GHz lags PH of NDVI by three weeks. We conclude, therefore, that maximum-value based PH of VOD can be a complementary phenometric for the CxQ model derived PH NDVI, especially in cloud and aerosol obscured regions of the world.

TI  - Soil Moisture Content Estimation Based on Sentinel-1 and Auxiliary Earth Observation Products. A Hydrological Approach
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A methodology for elaborating multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 satellite images for estimating topsoil Soil Moisture Content (SMC) to support hydrological simulation studies is proposed. After pre-processing the remote sensing data, backscattering coefficient, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), thermal infrared temperature and incidence angle parameters are assessed for their potential to infer ground measurements of SMC, collected at the top 5 cm. A non-linear approach using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is tested. The methodology is applied in Western Crete, Greece, where a SMC gauge network was deployed during 2015. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using leave-one-out cross validation and sensitivity analysis. ANNs prove to be the most efficient in SMC estimation yielding R-2 values between 0.7 and 0.9. The proposed methodology is used to support a hydrological simulation with the HEC-HMS model, applied at the Keramianos basin which is ungauged for SMC. Results and model sensitivity highlight the contribution of combining Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat 8 images for improving SMC estimates and supporting hydrological studies.

TI  - Improved retrieval of Secchi depth for optically-complex waters using remote sensing data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water transparency is one of the ecological indicators for describing water quality and the underwater light field which determines its productivity. In the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) as well as in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) water transparency is used for ecological status classification of inland, coastal and open sea waters and it is regarded as an indicator for eutrophication in Baltic Sea management (HELCOM, 2007). We developed and compared different empirical and semi-analytical algorithms for lakes and coastal Nordic waters to retrieve Secchi depth (Z(SD)) from remote sensing data (MERIS, 300 m resolution).The algorithms were developed in water bodies with high coloured dissolved organic matter absorption (a(CNOM)(442) ranging 1.7-4.0 m(-1)), Chl a concentration (0.5-73 mg m(-3)) and total suspended matter (0.7-37.5 g m(-3)) and validated against an independent data set over inland and coastal waters (0.6 m < Z(SD) < 14.8 m). The results indicate that for empirical algorithms, using longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum as a reference band decreases the RMSE and increases the coefficient of determination (R-2). The accuracy increased (R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.33 m, n = 134) when Z(SD) was retrieved via an empirical relationship between Z(SD) and K-d (490). The best agreement with in situ data was attained when Z(SD) was calculated via both the diffuse and the beam attenuation coefficient (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.77 m, n = 89). The results demonstrate that transparency can be retrieved with high accuracy over various optical water types by the means of ocean color remote sensing, improving both the spatial and temporal coverage. The satellite derived Z(SD) product could be therefore used as an additional source of information for WFD and MSFD reporting purposes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Patterns of canopy and surface layer consumption in a boreal forest fire from repeat airborne lidar
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire in the boreal region is the dominant agent of forest disturbance with direct impacts on ecosystem structure, carbon cycling, and global climate. Global and biome-scale impacts are mediated by burn severity, measured as loss of forest canopy and consumption of the soil organic layer. To date, knowledge of the spatial variability in burn severity has been limited by sparse field sampling and moderate resolution satellite data. Here, we used pre- and post-fire airborne lidar data to directly estimate changes in canopy vertical structure and surface elevation for a 2005 boreal forest fire on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula. We found that both canopy and surface losses were strongly linked to pre-fire species composition and exhibited important fine-scale spatial variability at sub-30m resolution. The fractional reduction in canopy volume ranged from 0.61 in lowland black spruce stands to 0.27 in mixed white spruce and broadleaf forest. Residual structure largely reflects standing dead trees, highlighting the influence of pre-fire forest structure on delayed carbon losses from aboveground biomass, post-fire albedo, and variability in understory light environments. Median loss of surface elevation was highest in lowland black spruce stands (0.18 m) but much lower in mixed stands (0.02 m), consistent with differences in pre-fire organic layer accumulation. Spatially continuous depth-of-burn estimates from repeat lidar measurements provide novel information to constrain carbon emissions from the surface organic layer and may inform related research on post-fire successional trajectories. Spectral measures of burn severity from Landsat were correlated with canopy (r = 0.76) and surface (r = -0.71) removal in black spruce stands but captured less of the spatial variability in fire effects for mixed stands (canopy r = 0.56, surface r = -0.26), underscoring the difficulty in capturing fire effects in heterogeneous boreal forest landscapes using proxy measures of burn severity from Landsat.

TI  - Moderate Salafism and the Challenge of De-Radicalization The Case of Pakistan
T2  - ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is generally taken for granted that Salafism is inherently a violent ideology and social-political trajectory. Seen as a globally homogenous phenomenon, the possibility of a moderate trend within Salafism is generally ruled out. Consequently, adherents of the Salafi ideology are not seen as part of the solution to tackling extremism and radicalism. The current research paper brings this widely held belief into question from several grounds. It does so by identifying the prevalence of diversity rather than homogeneity in the Salafist social trajectory in Pakistan and beyond. Further, the research more specifically highlights the body of moderate Salafi activists and their social networks promoting an alternative worldview to those of violent extremists. Moreover, the research suggests ways and means of broader social engagement of moderate Salafists as partners in peace building, violence prevention and the further strengthening of the current de-radicalization programs in Pakistan. The prevalence of multiple strands of Salafism (rather than singular/homogenous) offers an opportunity, and may therefore be (re) conceptualized as part of the solution of the most daunting challenge Pakistan is confronted with. The argument made here further strengthens the stream of studies conducted on inclusion-moderation hypothesis (tested for various Islamist movements across the globe). Through their inclusion in the de-radicalization process, the Salafists will not only further moderate their radical positions but will also contribute to the intellectual and social resources needed for the de-radicalization project. The research therefore suggests that policy makers and implementers may look beyond the Salafi textual surface and militant-Salafist variety, and concentrate on competing social-political practices.

TI  - A Conjugate of Pentamethine Cyanine and <SUP>18</SUP>F as a Positron Emission Tomography/Near-Infrared Fluorescence Probe for Multimodality Tumor Imaging
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel synthesis of a dual-modality, pentamethine cyanine (Cy5) fluorescent, F-18 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probe is reported. The probe shows a large extinction coefficient and large quantum yield in the biologically transparent, near-infrared window (650-900 nm) for in vivo fluorescent imaging. This fluorophore bears the isotope, F-18, giving a F-18-PET/near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF), bi-modal imaging probe, that combines the long-term stability of NIRF and the unlimited penetration depth of PET imaging. The bi-modal probe is labeled with F-18 in a quick, one-step reaction, which is important in working with the rapid decay of F-18. The bi-modal probe bears a free carboxyl group, highlighting a PET/NIRF synthon that can be conjugated onto many advanced biomolecules for biomarker-specific in vivo dual-modal PET/NIR tumor imaging, confocal histology, and utility in multi-fluorophore, fluorescence-guided surgery. Its potential in vivo biocompatibility is explored in a quick proof-of-principal in vivo study. The dye is delivered to A549 xenograft flank-tumors to generate PET and NIRF signals at the tumor site. The tumor distribution is confirmed in ex vivo gamma counting and imaging. Pentamethine cyanine (Cy5) has the ability to preferentially accumulate in tumor xenografts. We substitute the PET/NIRF probe for Cy5, and explore this phenomenon.

TI  - Ocean surface partitioning strategies using ocean colour remote Sensing: A review
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - The ocean surface is organized into regions with distinct properties reflecting the complexity of interactions between environmental forcing and biological responses. The delineation of these functional units, each with unique, homogeneous properties and underlying ecosystem structure and dynamics, can be defined as ocean surface partitioning. The main purposes and applications of ocean partitioning include the evaluation of particular marine environments; generation of more accurate satellite ocean colour products; assimilation of data into biogeochemical and climate models; and establishment of ecosystem-based management practices. This paper reviews the diverse approaches implemented for ocean surface partition into functional units, using ocean colour remote sensing (OCRS) data, including their purposes, criteria, methods and scales. OCRS offers a synoptic, high spatial-temporal resolution, multi-decadal coverage of bio-optical properties, relevant to the applications and value of ocean surface partitioning. In combination with other biotic and/or abiotic data, OCRS-derived data (e.g., chlorophyll-a, optical properties) provide a broad and varied source of information that can be analysed using different delineation methods derived from subjective, expert-based to unsupervised learning approaches (e.g., cluster, fuzzy and empirical orthogonal function analyses). Partition schemes are applied at global to mesoscale spatial coverage, with static (time-invariant) or dynamic (time-varying) representations. A case study, the highly heterogeneous area off SW Iberian Peninsula (NE Atlantic), illustrates how the selection of spatial coverage and temporal representation affects the discrimination of distinct environmental drivers of phytoplankton variability. Advances in operational oceanography and in the subject area of satellite ocean colour, including development of new sensors, algorithms and products, are among the potential benefits from extended use, scope and applications of ocean surface partitioning using OCRS.

TI  - The Paranoid Style Revisited: Pseudo-Conservatism in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century
T2  - JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fifty years ago, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Richard Hofstadter published the seminal essay, The Paranoid Style in American Politics. In this and related works he examined the rhetoric animating the extreme right-wing of the country's electorate. In this article I revisit Hofstadter's claims regarding the marginalization of the paranoid style and its connection to status-based politics. A review of the most popular pseudo-conservative commentators, survey data, the rise of the Tea Party, and the intransigence of the present day Republican Party suggests that a worldview that was once extreme has now become mainstreme within the political culture.

TI  - Integrating remotely sensed fires for predicting deforestation for REDD
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is an important tool in tropical forest management, as it alters forest composition, structure, and the carbon budget. The United Nations program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) aims to sustainably manage forests, as well as to conserve and enhance their carbon stocks. Despite the crucial role of fire management, decision-making on REDD+ interventions fails to systematically include fires. Here, we address this critical knowledge gap in two ways. First, we review REDD+ projects and programs to assess the inclusion of fires in monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems. Second, we model the relationship between fire and forest for a pilot site in Colombia using near-real-time (NRT) fire monitoring data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The literature review revealed fire remains to be incorporated as a key component of MRV systems. Spatially explicit modeling of land use change showed the probability of deforestation declined sharply with increasing distance to the nearest fire the preceding year (multi-year model area under the curve [AUC] 0.82). Deforestation predictions based on the model performed better than the official REDD earlY-warning system. The model AUC for 2013 and 2014 was 0.81, compared to 0.52 for the early-warning system in 2013 and 0.68 in 2014. This demonstrates NRT fire monitoring is a powerful tool to predict sites of forest deforestation. Applying new, publicly available, and open-access NRT fire data should be an essential element of early-warning systems to detect and prevent deforestation. Our results provide tools for improving both the current MRV systems, and the deforestation early-warning system in Colombia.

TI  - Coral reef atoll assessment in the South China Sea using Planet Dove satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs of the Spratly archipelago in the South China Sea are undergoing rapid transformation through military base and outpost development, destructive fishing practices and other factors. Despite increasing pressure on the ecologically unique reefs throughout this region, limited direct access to them has made it difficult to monitor reef cover. A new constellation of satellite imaging sensors, called Planet Dove, provides 3-5 m resolution monitoring of Earth on a daily time step, potentially offering a way to monitor changes in reef extent on a rapid repeat basis. We tested the accuracy of Planet Dove data for coral reef and seagrass mapping at an intensively studied atoll in the Spratly archipelago, and then applied the resulting approach to the atolls currently undergoing rapid change in the region. Compared to underwater photographic surveys, we found that unsupervised classification of Planet Dove imagery provided a 92% average accuracy in detecting the extent of shallow coral reef, observable portions of deep coral reef and sand. Dove data were deemed not sufficiently useful for separating different types of shallow reef or seagrass beds. Applying the 3-class mapping approach to 19 atolls throughout the region, we found that two-thirds of currently occupied atolls have proportionally less shallow reef cover than unoccupied atolls. Frequent satellite-based updates of atolls and islands in the Spratly archipelago could advance international discussion on conservation in the South China Sea.

T2  - LITHOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gebel El-Delihimmi granite intrusion, located in the Central Eastern Desert of Egypt, cuts the core of a major anticlinal structure of calc-alkaline metavolcanics and ophiolitic melange rocks. The intrusion is microscopically differentiated into granodiorite, monzogranite, syenogranite and alkali-feldspar granite. Decorrelation stretch and band-ratio techniques were applied to Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer data. Processing of ASTER-SWIR bands enabled discrimination of El-Delihimmi granite phases and generation of a detailed lithologic map of the study area. The structural and microfabric data suggest that the El-Delihimmi granite underwent at least two phases of deformations. The first was related to the Najd fault system during which the older granodiorite phase of the intrusion was affected by sinistral ductile shearing. During the second phase, monzogranite and syenogranite in the intrusion were affected by brittle E-W compressional deformation. Geochemical data reported here reveal that the granodiorite phase has K2O/Na2O ratio <1 and represents an evolved calc-alkaline granite. The monzogranite, syenogranite and alkali-feldspar granite phases have K2O/Na2O ratio >1. The granite phases are generally I-type, metaluminous to slightly peraluminous and are interpreted as formed above subducted slabs of oceanic lithosphere rather than in continental collision zones.

TI  - A cross-case analysis of three Native Science Field Centers
T2  - CULTURAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Native Science Field Centers (NSFCs) were created to engage youth and adults in environmental science activities through the integration of traditional Native ways of knowing (understanding about the natural world based on centuries of observation including philosophy, worldview, cosmology, and belief systems of Indigenous peoples), Native languages, and Western science concepts. This paper focuses on the Blackfeet Native Science Field Center, the Lakota Native Science Field Center, and the Wind River Native Science Field Center. One of the long-term, overarching goals of these NSFCs was to stimulate the interest of Native American students in ways that encouraged them to pursue academic and career paths in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. A great deal can be learned from the experiences of the NSFCs in terms of effective educational strategies, as well as advantages and challenges in blending Native ways of knowing and Western scientific knowledge in an informal science education setting. Hopa Mountain-a Bozeman, Montana-based nonprofit-partnered with the Blackfeet Community College on the Blackfeet Reservation, Fremont County School District #21 on the Wind River Reservation, and Oglala Lakota College on the Pine Ridge Reservation to cooperatively establish the Native Science Field Centers. This paper presents a profile of each NSFC and highlights their program components and accomplishments.

TI  - Regression in primary cutaneous melanoma: etiopathogenesis and clinical significance
T2  - LABORATORY INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Though not required currently for staging, regression is a histopathologic parameter typically reported upon diagnosis of an invasive primary cutaneous melanoma. The studies examining the prognostic significance of regression in patient outcome have yielded controversial findings; likely because the definition and assessment of regression have not been consistent, in addition to subjectivity of pathologists' interpretation. Regression is histologically characterized by variable decrease in the number of melanoma cells accompanied by the presence of a host response consisting of dermal fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrate, melanophages, ectatic blood vessels, epidermal attenuation, and/or apoptosis of keratinocytes or melanocytes; the relative extent of these features depends on the stage of the regression. However, the magnitudes to which these individual changes must be present to meet the threshold of histologic regression have not been well defined or agreed upon, and thus, the definition and classification of histologic regression in melanoma varies considerably among institutions and even among individual pathologists. In order to determine the clinical significance of histologic analysis of regression, there is a compelling need for a universal scheme to objectively define and assess histologic regression in primary cutaneous melanoma, so that the biologic and prognostic significance of this process may be completely understood.

TI  - Zika virus: Global health challenge, threat and current situation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ZIKV has emerged as grave global health issue in the past few years. ZIKV was firstly isolated in 1947 from a rhesus sentinel monkey in the Zika forest in Uganda. It is usually transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes and infects skin fibroblasts, skin keratinocytes, etc. ZIKV until now was under reported because of its clinical similarity with the dengue and chikungunya. It is usually spread through the course of the sylvatic cycle. In this cycle, the virus or pathogen lifespan is spent between the wild animal and vectors. The intrinsic incubation period is not yet fully known but it is observed that the very first symptoms of ZIKV infection can appear or develop within 3-12 days of time period and usually subside within 7 days of time. There is a strong relationship between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly; other serious brain anomalies to the infant or newborn are Guillain-Barre syndrome. To date no vaccines are available for ZIKV prevention hence only symptomatic treatment is recommended in infected patients. Usually ZIKV is detected by serologic (IgM ELISA), plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) along with in-house molecular techniques (RT-PCR). ZIKV infection being imminent global health issue warrants strong protective measures to prevent it from becoming an epidemic. Early detection and prevention is the key to tackle this grave potential health hazard. J. Med. Virol. 89:943-951, 2017. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Role of axillary ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy in the preoperative triage of breast cancer patients
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Roughly two-thirds of early breast cancer cases are associated with negative axillary nodes and do not benefit from axillary surgery at all. Accordingly, there is an ongoing search for non-surgical staging procedures to avoid lymph-node dissection or sentinel node biopsy (SNB). Non-invasive imaging techniques with very high sensitivity (Se) and negative predictive value (NPV) could eventually replace SNB. We aimed to establish the role of axillary US and MRI, alone or in combination, associated with ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (US-FNAB) in the prediction of axillary node involvement.Methods/patients Between January 2003 and September 2015, we included 1505 of the 1538 breast cancer patients attending our centres. All patients had been referred from a single geographical area. Axillary US, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (US-FNAB) were performed if required.Results 1533 axillary US examinations and 1351 axillary MRI studies were analyzed. For axillary US, Se, Specificity (Sp), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and NPV were 47.5, 93.6, 82.5, and 73.8%, respectively. For axillary MRI, corresponding values were 29.8, 96.6, 84.9, and 68.4%. When both tests were combined, Sp and PPV slightly improved over individual tests alone. US-FNAB showed a 100% Sp and PPV, with a Se of 80%.Conclusion We may confidently state that axillary US and US-FNAB have to be included in the preoperative work-up of breast cancer patients.

TI  - Energy Development in Colorado's Pawnee National Grasslands: Mapping and Measuring the Disturbance Footprint of Renewables and Non-Renewables
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the pattern and extent of energy development in steppe landscapes of northeast Colorado, United States. We compare the landscape disturbance created by oil and gas production to that of wind energy inside the Pawnee National Grasslands eastern side. This high-steppe landscape consists of a mosaic of federal, state, and private lands where dominant economic activities include ranching, agriculture, tourism, oil and gas extraction, and wind energy generation. Utilizing field surveys, remote sensing data and geographic information systems techniques, we quantify and map the footprint of energy development at the landscape level. Findings suggest that while oil and gas and wind energy development have resulted in a relatively small amount of habitat loss within the study area, the footprint stretches across the entire zone, fragmenting this mostly grassland habitat. Futhermore, a third feature of this landscape, the non-energy transportation network, was also found to have a significant impact. Combined, these three features fragment the entire Pawnee National Grasslands eastern side, leaving very few large intact core, or roadless areas. The primary objective of this ongoing work is to create a series of quantifiable and replicable surface disturbance indicators linked to energy production in semi-arid grassland environments. Based on these, and future results, we aim to work with industry and regulators to shape energy policy as it relates to environmental performance, with the aim of reducing the footprint and thus increasing the sustainability of these extractive activities.

TI  - Comparison of Satellite Reflectance Algorithms for Estimating Phycocyanin Values and Cyanobacterial Total Biovolume in a Temperate Reservoir Using Coincident Hyperspectral Aircraft Imagery and Dense Coincident Surface Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed 27 established and new simple and therefore perhaps portable satellite phycocyanin pigment reflectance algorithms for estimating cyanobacterial values in a temperate 8.9 km(2) reservoir in southwest Ohio using coincident hyperspectral aircraft imagery and dense coincident water surface observations collected from 44 sites within 1 h of image acquisition. The algorithms were adapted to real Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI), synthetic WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, MODIS and Sentinel-3/MERIS/OLCI imagery resulting in 184 variants and corresponding image products. Image products were compared to the cyanobacterial coincident surface observation measurements to identify groups of promising algorithms for operational algal bloom monitoring. Several of the algorithms were found useful for estimating phycocyanin values with each sensor type except MODIS in this small lake. In situ phycocyanin measurements correlated strongly (r(2) = 0.757) with cyanobacterial sum of total biovolume (CSTB) allowing us to estimate both phycocyanin values and CSTB for all of the satellites considered except MODIS in this situation.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Approach for Regional-Scale Mapping of Agricultural Land-Use Systems Based on NDVI Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to the need for generic remote sensing tools to support large-scale agricultural monitoring, we present a new approach for regional-scale mapping of agricultural land-use systems (ALUS) based on object-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series analysis. The approach consists of two main steps. First, to obtain relatively homogeneous land units in terms of phenological patterns, a principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to an annual MODIS NDVI time series, and an automatic segmentation is performed on the resulting high-order principal component images. Second, the resulting land units are classified into the crop agriculture domain or the livestock domain based on their land-cover characteristics. The crop agriculture domain land units are further classified into different cropping systems based on the correspondence of their NDVI temporal profiles with the phenological patterns associated with the cropping systems of the study area. A map of the main ALUS of the Brazilian state of Tocantins was produced for the 2013-2014 growing season with the new approach, and a significant coherence was observed between the spatial distribution of the cropping systems in the final ALUS map and in a reference map extracted from the official agricultural statistics of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). This study shows the potential of remote sensing techniques to provide valuable baseline spatial information for supporting agricultural monitoring and for large-scale land-use systems analysis.

TI  - Evaluation of Hemispheric Asymmetries in Marine Cloud Radiative Properties
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The hemispheric symmetry of albedo and its contributing factors in satellite observations and global climate models is evaluated. The analysis is performed on the annual mean time scale, on which a bimodality in the joint distribution of albedo and cloud fraction is evident, resulting from tropical and subtropical clouds and midlatitude clouds, respectively. Hemispheric albedo symmetry is not found in individual ocean-only latitude bands; comparing the Northern and Southern Hemisphere (NH and SH), regional mean albedo is higher in the NH tropics and lower in the NH subtropics and midlatitudes than in the SH counterparts. This follows the hemispheric asymmetry of cloud fraction. In midlatitudes and tropics the hemispheric asymmetry in cloud albedo also contributes to the asymmetry in total albedo, whereas in the subtropics the cloud albedo is more hemispherically symmetric. According to the observations, cloud contributions to compensation for higher clear-sky albedo in the NH come primarily from cloud albedo in midlatitudes and cloud amount in the subtropics. Current-generation climate models diverge in their representation of these relationships, but common features of the model-data comparison include weaker-than-observed asymmetry in cloud fraction and cloud albedo in the tropics, weaker or reversed cloud fraction asymmetry in the subtropics, and agreement with observed cloud albedo asymmetry in the midlatitudes. Models on average reproduce the NH-SH asymmetry in total albedo over the 60 degrees S-60 degrees N ocean but show higher occurrence of brighter clouds in the SH compared to observations. The albedo bias in both hemispheres is reinforced by overestimated clear-sky albedo in the models.

TI  - Mangrove Carbon Stocks and Ecosystem Cover Dynamics in Southwest Madagascar and the Implications for Local Management
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Of the numerous ecosystem services mangroves provide, carbon storage is gaining particular attention for its potential role in climate change mitigation strategies. Madagascar contains 2% of the world's mangroves, over 20% of which is estimated to have been deforested through charcoal production, timber extraction and agricultural development. This study presents a carbon stock assessment of the mangroves in Helodrano Fagnemotse in southwest Madagascar alongside an analysis of mangrove land-cover change from 2002 to 2014. Similar to other mangrove ecosystems in East Africa, higher stature, closed-canopy mangroves in southwest Madagascar were estimated to contain 454.92 (+/- 26.58) Mg.C.ha(-1). Although the mangrove extent in this area is relatively small (1500 ha), these mangroves are of critical importance to local communities and anthropogenic pressures on coastal resources in the area are increasing. This was evident in both field observations and remote sensing analysis, which indicated an overall net loss of 3.18% between 2002 and 2014. Further dynamics analysis highlighted widespread transitions of dense, higher stature mangroves to more sparse mangrove areas indicating extensive degradation. Harnessing the value that the carbon stored within these mangroves holds on the voluntary carbon market could generate revenue to support and incentivise locally-led sustainable mangrove management, improve livelihoods and alleviate anthropogenic pressures.

TI  - Detection of Land Subsidence in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, Using DInSAR Technique
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) is a remote sensing technique that is capable of detecting land surface deformation with centimeter accuracy. In this research, this technique was applied to two pairs of Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band SAR (PALSAR) data to detect land subsidence in the Kathmandu valley from 2007 to 2010. The result revealed several subsidence areas towards the center of the valley ranging from a maximum of 9.9 km(2) to a minimum of 1 km(2) coverage with a maximum velocity of 4.8 cm/year, and a minimum velocity of 1.1 cm/year, respectively. The majority of the subsidence was observed in old settlement areas with mixed use development. The subsidence depth was found to gradually increase from the periphery towards the center in almost all detected subsidence areas. The subsidence depth was found to be in a range of 1 cm to 17 cm. It was found that the concentration of deep water extraction wells was higher in areas with higher subsidence rates. It was also found that the detected subsidence area was situated over geological formations mainly consisting of unconsolidated fine-grained sediments (silica, sand, silt, clay and silty sandy gravel), which is the major factor affecting the occurrence of land subsidence due to groundwater extraction.

TI  - Costs of hospitalization with respiratory syncytial virus illness among children aged &lt;5 years and the financial impact on households in Bangladesh, 2010
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute respiratory illness in young children and results in significant economic burden. There is no vaccine to prevent RSV illness but a number of vaccines are in development. We conducted this study to estimate the costs of severe RSV illness requiring hospitalization among children <5 years and associated financial impact on households in Bangladesh. Data of this study could be useful for RSV vaccine development and also the value of various preventive strategies, including use of an RSV vaccine in children if one becomes available.Methods From May through October 2010, children aged <5 years with laboratory-confirmed RSV were identified from a sentinel influenza program database at four tertiary hospitals. Research assistants visited case-patients' homes after hospital discharge and administered a structured questionnaire to record direct medical costs (physician consultation fee, costs for hospital bed, medicines and diagnostic tests); non-medical costs (costs for food, lodging and transportation); indirect costs (caregivers' productivity loss), and coping strategies used by families to pay for treatment. We used WHO-Choice estimates for routine health care service costs. We added direct, indirect and health care service costs to calculate cost-per-episode of severe RSV illness. We used Monte Carlo simulation to estimate annual economic burden for severe RSV illness.Findings We interviewed caregivers of 39 persons hospitalized for RSV illness. The median direct cost for hospitalization was US$ 62 (inter-quartile range [IQR] =43-101), indirect cost was US$ 19 (IQR = 11-29) and total cost was US$ 94 (IQR = 67-127). The median out-of-pocket cost was 24% of monthly household income of affected families (US$ 143), and >50% families borrowed money to meet treatment cost. We estimated that the median direct cost of RSV-associated hospitalization in children aged <5 years in Bangladesh was US$ 10 million (IQR: US$ 7-16 million), the median indirect cost was US$ 3.0 million (IQR: 2-5 million) in 2010.Conclusion: RSV-associated hospitalization among children aged <5 years represents a substantial economic burden in Bangladesh. Affected families frequently incurred considerable out of pocket and indirect costs for treatment that resulted in financial hardship.

TI  - Exploring Relationships among Tree-Ring Growth, Climate Variability, and Seasonal Leaf Activity on Varying Timescales and Spatial Resolutions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the first section of this study, we explored the relationship between ring width index (RWI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series on varying timescales and spatial resolutions, hypothesizing positive associations between RWI and current and previous- year NDVI at 69 forest sites scattered in the Northern Hemisphere. We noted that the relationship between RWI and NDVI varies over space and between tree types (deciduous versus coniferous), bioclimatic zones, cumulative NDVI periods, and spatial resolutions. The high-spatial-resolution NDVI (MODIS) reflected stronger growth patterns than those with coarse-spatial-resolution NDVI (GIMMS3g). In the second section, we explore the link between RWI, climate and NDVI phenological metrics (in place of NDVI) for the same forest sites using random forest models to assess the complicated and nonlinear relationships among them. The results are as following (a) The model using high-spatial-resolution NDVI time series explained a higher proportion of the variance in RWI than that of the model using coarse-spatial-resolution NDVI time series. (b) Amongst all NDVI phenological metrics, summer NDVI sum could best explain RWI followed by the previous year's summer NDVI sum and the previous year's spring NDVI sum. (c) We demonstrated the potential of NDVI metrics derived from phenology to improve the existing RWI-climate relationships. However, further research is required to investigate the robustness of the relationship between NDVI and RWI, particularly when more tree-ring data and longer records of the high-spatial-resolution NDVI become available.

TI  - Underwater Topography Detection in Coastal Areas Using Fully Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide detailed information on scattering mechanisms that could enable the target or structure to be identified. This paper presents a method to detect underwater topography in coastal areas using high resolution fully polarimetric SAR data, while less prior information is required. The method is based on the shoaling and refraction of long surface gravity waves as they propagate shoreward. First, the surface scattering component is obtained by polarization decomposition. Then, wave fields are retrieved from the two-dimensional (2D) spectra by the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). Finally, shallow water depths are estimated from the dispersion relation. Applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology are tested by using C-band fine quad-polarization mode RADARSAT-2 SAR data over the near-shore area of the Hainan province, China. By comparing with the values from an official electronic navigational chart (ENC), the estimated water depths are in good agreement with them. The average relative error of the detected results from the scattering mechanisms based method and single polarization SAR data are 9.73% and 11.53% respectively. The validation results indicate that the scattering mechanisms based methodology is more effective than only using the single polarization SAR data for underwater topography detection, and will inspire further research on underwater topography detection with fully polarimetric SAR data.

TI  - Surface Water Monitoring within Cambodia and the Vietnamese Mekong Delta over a Year, with Sentinel-1 SAR Observations
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a methodology to detect and monitor surface water with Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data within Cambodia and the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. It is based on a neural network classification trained on Landsat-8 optical data. Sensitivity tests are carried out to optimize the performance of the classification and assess the retrieval accuracy. Predicted SAR surface water maps are compared to reference Landsat-8 surface water maps, showing a true positive water detection of approximate to 90% at 30 m spatial resolution. Predicted SAR surface water maps are also compared to floodability maps derived from high spatial resolution topography data. Results show high consistency between the two independent maps with 98% of SAR-derived surface water located in areas with a high probability of inundation. Finally, all available Sentinel-1 SAR observations over the Mekong Delta in 2015 are processed and the derived surface water maps are compared to corresponding MODIS/Terra-derived surface water maps at 500 m spatial resolution. Temporal correlation between these two products is very high (99%) with very close water surface extents during the dry season when cloud contamination is low. This study highlights the applicability of the Sentinel-1 SAR data for surface water monitoring, especially in a tropical region where cloud cover can be very high during the rainy seasons.

TI  - Boundary Spanning Activities of Corporate HQ Executives Insights from a Longitudinal Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - What are the boundary spanning activities undertaken by the Corporate Headquarters (HQ) executives of a Multinational Corporation? We address this question through a five-year longitudinal case study of one company as it shifted from a traditional HQ in one location, to a dual HQ in two locations, to a virtual HQ split across multiple locations. By observing how HQ executives prioritized their time over the course of this transition, we identified four generic boundary spanning activities: two (spearheading and facilitating) focused on making connections across boundaries, two (reconciling and lubricating) focused on overcoming differences in worldview across boundaries. By considering these activities together, and how they vary in importance over time, we show how each boundary spanning activity adds value to the MNC and improves the effectiveness of the internal and external network. An important feature of our study is that we operationalize boundary spanning at the activity level, i.e., in terms of the specific actions taken by corporate HQ executives, to provide a more granular understanding of how boundary spanning works in practice.

TI  - Surface-water dynamics and land use influence landscape connectivity across a major dryland region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape connectivity is important for the long-term persistence of species inhabiting dryland freshwater ecosystems, with spatiotemporal surface-water dynamics (e.g., flooding) maintaining connectivity by both creating temporary habitats and providing transient opportunities for dispersal. Improving our understanding of how landscape connectivity varies with respect to surface-water dynamics and land use is an important step to maintaining biodiversity in dynamic dryland environments. Using a newly available validated Landsat TM and ETM+ surface-water time series, we modelled landscape connectivity between dynamic surface-water habitats within Australia's 1 million km(2) semiarid Murray Darling Basin across a 25-yr period (1987-2011). We identified key habitats that serve as well-connected "hubs," or "stepping-stones" that allow long-distance movements through surface-water habitat networks. We compared distributions of these habitats for short- and long-distance dispersal species during dry, average, and wet seasons, and across land-use types. The distribution of stepping-stones and hubs varied both spatially and temporally, with temporal changes driven by drought and flooding dynamics. Conservation areas and natural environments contained higher than expected proportions of both stepping-stones and hubs throughout the time series; however, highly modified agricultural landscapes increased in importance during wet seasons. Irrigated landscapes contained particularly high proportions of well-connected hubs for long-distance dispersers, but remained relatively disconnected for less vagile organisms. The habitats identified by our study may serve as ideal high-priority targets for land-use specific management aimed at maintaining or improving dispersal between surface-water habitats, potentially providing benefits to biodiversity beyond the immediate site scale. Our results also highlight the importance of accounting for the influence of spatial and temporal surface-water dynamics when studying landscape connectivity within highly variable dryland environments.

TI  - Predictors and Patterns of Local, Regional, and Distant Failure in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Vulva
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY-CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective:To identify factors predicting for recurrence in vulvar cancer patients undergoing surgical treatment.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated data of consecutive patients with squamous cell vulvar cancer treated between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2013. Basic descriptive statistics and multivariable analysis were used to design predicting models influencing outcomes. Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using the Cox model.Results:The study included 101 patients affected by vulvar cancer: 64 (63%) stage I, 12 (12%) stage II, 20 (20%) stage III, and 5 (5%) stage IV. After a mean (SD) follow-up of 37.6 (22.1) months, 21 (21%) recurrences occurred. Local, regional, and distant failures were recorded in 14 (14%), 6 (6%), and 3 (3%) patients, respectively. Five-year DFS and OS were 77% and 82%, respectively. At multivariate analysis only stromal invasion >2 mm (hazard ratio: 4.9 [95% confidence interval, 1.17-21.1]; P=0.04) and extracapsular lymph node involvement (hazard ratio: 9.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.17-69.5); P=0.03) correlated with worse DFS, although no factor independently correlated with OS. Looking at factors influencing local and regional failure, we observed that stromal invasion >2 mm was the only factor predicting for local recurrence, whereas lymph node extracapsular involvement predicted for regional recurrence.Conclusions:Stromal invasion >2 mm and lymph node extracapsular spread are the most important factors predicting for local and regional failure, respectively. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of adjuvant treatment in high-risk patients are warranted.

TI  - Assessing variability in post-fire forest structure along gradients of productivity in the Canadian boreal using multi-source remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimForest regeneration following fire is an important component of the global carbon cycle, but it is difficult to monitor over large and remote forested regions, such as Canada's north. In this study, we aim to (1) characterize how forest regeneration following fire varies across the Canadian boreal and (2) determine if this variability is captured by satellite-derived estimates of productivity.LocationCanadian boreal.MethodsWe relate structural measurements from light detection and ranging (lidar) data to gross primary productivity (GPP) estimates from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) along a 25-year chronosequence of forest regeneration following fire. Over 400 patches that burned from 1985-2009 were analysed, with fire information obtained from a national Landsat-derived record of forest change.ResultsIn the first 15 years since fire (YSF), estimates of percent canopy cover (>2m) were typically low regardless of GPP (mean=11.0-16.0%, SD=7.8-8.9%) and correlations to GPP were relatively weak (r=0.18-0.48). Canopy cover was more variable between stands by 16-25 YSF (mean=16.2-21.7%, SD=16.0-17.1%), and correlations to GPP were stronger (r=0.63-0.71, P<0.01). Conversely, variability in stand height (75th height percentile) remained low at 16-25 YSF (mean=4.9-5.0m, SD=0.9-1.1m) and weakly related to GPP (r=0.16-0.21).Main conclusionsSatellite-derived estimates of productivity capture differences in canopy structure across the boreal, but only after 15 YSF. While canopy cover varied strongly along gradients of productivity from 16-25 YSF, differences in vertical growth were less pronounced due to slow boreal growth rates. Our results provide important insights into how satellite-derived estimates of productivity are realized structurally, as understanding regional variation in forest regeneration is critical to quantifying carbon dynamics in forests. Combining lidar-derived estimates of structure with Landsat-derived disturbance history is a valuable approach for characterizing variability in post-fire structure over large forested areas.

TI  - PhenoRice: A method for automatic extraction of spatio-temporal information on rice crops using satellite data time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural monitoring systems require spatio-temporal information on widely cultivated staple crops like rice. More emphasis has been made on area estimation and crop detection than on the temporal aspects of crop cultivation, but seasonal and temporal information such as i) crop duration, ii) date of crop establishment and iii) cropping intensity are as important as area for understanding crop production. Rice cropping systems are diverse because genetic, environmental and management factors (G x E x M combinations) influence the spatio-temporal patterns of cultivation.We present a rule based algorithm called PhenoRice for automatic extraction of temporal information on the rice crop using moderate resolution hypertemporal optical imagery from MODIS. Performance of PhenoRice against spatially and temporally explicit reference information was tested in three diverse sites: rice-fallow (Italy), rice-other crop (India) and rice-rice (Philippines) systems.Regional product accuracy assessments showed that PhenoRice made a conservative, spatially representative and robust detection of rice cultivation in all sites (r(2) between 0.75 and 0.92) and crop establishment dates were in close agreement with the reference data (r(2) = 0.98, Mean Error = 4.07 days, Mean Absolute Error = 9.95 days, p < 0.01). Variability in algorithm performance in different conditions in each site (irrigated vs rainfed, direct seeding vs transplanting, fragmented vs clustered rice landscapes and the impact of cloud contamination) was analysed and discussed. Analysis of the maps revealed that cropping intensity and season length per site matched well with local information on agro-practices and cultivated varieties. The results show that PhenoRice is robust for deriving essential temporal descriptions of rice systems in both temperate and tropical regions at a level of spatial and temporal detail that is suitable for regional crop monitoring on a seasonal basis.

TI  - Temporal trends in sea surface temperature gradients in the South Atlantic Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) gradients in the South Atlantic Ocean (SAO) using satellite data. 12 years (2003-2014) of high resolution synoptic SST images acquired from NASA's MODIS instrument onboard Terra and Aqua platforms were processed to mitigate quality issues related to stripe noise and cloud misclassification and then compiled into monthly, yearly, and decadal maps of SST gradient magnitudes. We used these composite maps and corresponding time series to identify regions with strong frontal activity and characterize the seasonal and long term evolution of thermal gradients. While a clear seasonal cycle was observed in most subregions of the SAO, the satellite data do not suggest significant interannual variability or long term changes in the magnitude of thermal fronts in the SAO except in the upwelling region of Cape Frio Brazil, where SST gradients have increased at an approximate rate of 1% per year since 2003.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose > To compare epidemiological, histological, therapeutic characteristics and prognosis of patients with breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy with those diagnosed in postpartum period at a national expert center, Cancer Associe a La Grossesse network.Methods > Retrospective study of 108 patients with a pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) between 2002 and 2016 comparing 51 patients with PABC during pregnancy and 57 patients with PABC of postpartum.Results > Median gestational age at diagnosis was 16 weeks of gestation (WG). Median size (P = 0.92), initial axillary pathology (P = 0.29), histological type (P = 0.33) and hormone receptor positive (P = 0.93), were similar between groups. PABC during pregnancy overexpressed less frequently HER2 (12 % vs 36 %, P = 0.003) and were less proliferant (Ki67 >= 15 %; 64 % vs 75 %, P = 0.018) with less radical surgery (45 % vs 70 %, P = 0.008). Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 8 patients during pregnancy. Less patients of PABC during pregnancy received trastuzumab 12 % vs 37 %, P = 0.003. Median delivery term was 37 WG. Median follow-up 3.2 vs 5.6 years (P = 0.002) and recurrence rote for PABC during pregnancy and of postpartum were 3.2 vs 5.6 years (P = 0.002) and 12 % vs 32 % (P = 0.01), respectively. Our results emphasize histological, surgical and adjuvant treatment differences imposing differentiating PABC during pregnancy from those diagnosed in the postpartum period.

TI  - Pilot study of mobile phone technology in allergic rhinitis in European countries: the MASK-rhinitis study
T2  - ALLERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The use of Apps running on smartphones and tablets profoundly affects medicine. The MASK-rhinitis (MACVIA-ARIA Sentinel NetworK for allergic rhinitis) App (Allergy Diary) assesses allergic rhinitis symptoms, disease control and impact on patients' lives. It is freely available in 20 countries (iOS and Android platforms).Aims: To assess in a pilot study whether (i) Allergy Diary users were able to properly provide baseline characteristics (ii) simple phenotypic characteristics based upon data captured by the Allergy Diary could be identified and (iii) information gathered by this study could suggest novel research questions.Methods: The Allergy Diary users were classified into six groups according to the baseline data that they entered into the App: (i) asymptomatic; (ii) nasal symptoms excluding rhinorrhea; (iii) rhinorrhea; (iv) rhinorrhea plus 1-2 nasal/ocular symptoms; (v) rhinorrhea plus >= 3 nasal/ocular symptoms; and (vi) rhinorrhea plus all nasal/ocular symptoms.Results: By 1 June 2016, 3260 users had registered with the Allergy Diary and 2710 had completed the baseline questionnaire. Troublesome symptoms were found mainly in the users with the most symptoms. Around 50% of users with troublesome rhinitis and/or ocular symptoms suffered work impairment. Sleep was impaired by troublesome symptoms and nasal obstruction.Conclusions: This is the first App (iOS and Android) to have tested for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis. A simple questionnaire administered by cell phones enables the identification of phenotypic differences between a priori defined rhinitis groups. The results suggest novel concepts and research questions in allergic rhinitis that may not be identified using classical methods.

TI  - Phenology of the beech forests in the Western Carpathians from MODIS for 2000-2015
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper introduces a satellite-based approach to the detection of phenology events in beech forests across Slovakia (the Western Carpathians) using the MOD/MYD09 products. Normalized vegetation index (NDVI) was used for determining the onset of the phenophases in spring and autumn. Double logistic sigmoid function was applied in order to fit the NDVI profile during the year. The satellite-derived phenological metrics was based on calculating the extreme values of the sigmoid function and its derivatives. Between 2000 and 2015, a time-series analysis using the linear regressions models revealed that the onset of leaf unfolding shifted at a rate of 0.8 day per decade, the onset of leaf fall was delayed at a rate of 1.9 day per decade, and the growing season (GS) extended at a rate of 1.1 day per decade. However, at a regional level, the trends were not found to be statistically significant in either case. Leaf unfolding/fall was significantly non-linearly delayed/advanced with the increase of altitude (p<0.01). GS duration varied extensively within the region. Theil-Sen estimation of GS trend revealed the median shift of 1.8 days, the range of shift being from -7.0 to + 12.1 days at the 5-95 % quantile for 2000-2015. A significant inverse correlation between GS shift and GS length (p< 0.01) was observed. The GS shift was positive in the sites with shorter GS and negative in the sites with longer GS.

TI  - A Fast Support Detector for Superresolution Localization of Multiple Scatterers in SAR Tomography
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is focused on the problem of the detection of multiple scatterers in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography. The method presented exploits the a priori information that at most K-max different scatterers are present in the same range-azimuth resolution cell. In particular, a simplified version of a generalized-likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector, based on support estimation (Sup-GLRT), is proposed. The Sup-GLRT is a constant false alarm rate sequential test that detects the presence of scatterers, one after another, and estimates their positions, detecting the support of the unknown signal. The proposed simplified test denoted as Fast-Sup-GLRT detector, despite still being a multistep statistical hypothesis test, exploits, at each step i, an approximated maximum-likelihood estimate of the signal support of cardinality i-1, based on the sequential estimation of i-1 supports of cardinality one. The introduced approximation allows a considerable reduction of the computational complexity, which from the combinatorial trend of Sup-GLRT passes to the linear one of Fast-Sup-GLRT, without significantly impairing the detection probability. The performance of the proposed approach is analyzed using TerraSAR-X system parameters, with particular reference to the elevation superresolution achievable for an assigned probability of false alarm and with a given number of acquisitions. Numerical results on simulated and real data are presented and discussed.

TI  - Nocturnal hunting by Eleonora's Falcons <i>Falco eleonorae</i> on their breeding and non-breeding grounds
T2  - ACTA ORNITHOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on nocturnal hunting by Eleonora's Falcons in their breeding range. in the Mediterranean region and in their non-breeding range in Madagascar. Hunting activity of Eleonora's Falcons near floodlights during the breeding season in western Morocco peaked 30-60 min after sunset, but continued into the early morning. Hunting activity and prey capture rates near floodlights were highest during nights with little moonlight or overcast conditions. Fifty-one percent of 73 group capture attempts were successful. Of the migratory prey species identified at the Moroccan study site (26 species), 73% belonged to species mainly migrating at night, whereas 57%,of all migratory bird prey species of Eleonora's Falcon reported to date (122 species) migrate predominantly at night; suggesting that hunting near artificial light may increase the proportion of nocturnal migrant species in the diet of falcons. Sylvia and Acrocephalus were the most commonly recorded genera among prey caught after dark. Our direct observations and analysis of satellite transmitter data indicated that Eleonora's Falcons also hunted away from artificial light in Morocco, Italy, and frequently so in Madagascar. Flight activity was detected in 18% of 342 night-time locations of seven satellite tagged Eleonora's Falcons in Madagascar, at an average moon illumination of 60%. We conclude that nocturnal hunting by Eleonora's Falcons is more common than previously assumed and occurs preferably, but not exclusively, at above-average moon illumination on wintering grounds or near artificial lights during the breeding period.

TI  - Phantom Study Investigating the Accuracy of Manual and Automatic Image Fusion with the GE Logiq E9: Implications for use in Percutaneous Liver Interventions
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR AND INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine the accuracy of automatic and manual co-registration methods for image fusion of three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) with real-time ultrasonography (US) for image-guided liver interventions.CT images of a skills phantom with liver lesions were acquired and co-registered to US using GE Logiq E9 navigation software. Manual co-registration was compared to automatic and semiautomatic co-registration using an active tracker. Also, manual point registration was compared to plane registration with and without an additional translation point. Finally, comparison was made between manual and automatic selection of reference points. In each experiment, accuracy of the co-registration method was determined by measurement of the residual displacement in phantom lesions by two independent observers.Mean displacements for a superficial and deep liver lesion were comparable after manual and semiautomatic co-registration: 2.4 and 2.0 mm versus 2.0 and 2.5 mm, respectively. Both methods were significantly better than automatic co-registration: 5.9 and 5.2 mm residual displacement (p < 0.001; p < 0.01). The accuracy of manual point registration was higher than that of plane registration, the latter being heavily dependent on accurate matching of axial CT and US images by the operator. Automatic reference point selection resulted in significantly lower registration accuracy compared to manual point selection despite lower root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values.The accuracy of manual and semiautomatic co-registration is better than that of automatic co-registration. For manual co-registration using a plane, choosing the correct plane orientation is an essential first step in the registration process. Automatic reference point selection based on RMSD values is error-prone.

TI  - Indocyanine green applications in plastic surgery: A review of the literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Use of indocyanine green (ICG) near-infrared fluorescence as a dye to assess tissue vascularization is now well standardized. The aimof this literature review was to review and resume the most recent recommendations for ICG use in its plastic surgery applications.Methods: A systematic literature review was performed using Medline, EMBASE, and PubMed databases to obtain the latest recommendations for ICG in plastic surgery. Inclusion criteriawere all articles written in English language that evaluated pre-, intra-, or postoperative ICG applications in surgical procedures usually performed by plastic surgeons. Case reports, reviews, meta-analyses, and experimental studies on animals or cadavers were excluded after title and abstract screening.Results: Of the 1389 article titles retrieved, 41 full-text articles met the inclusion criteria. ICG applications in plastic surgery were ICG lymphangiography used in sentinel lymph node mapping for breast cancer and melanoma and in microsurgery for the staging and treatment of secondary chronic lymphedema. The latest updates of ICG angiography in assessing free flaps, pedicled flaps, or large skin paddles were also retrieved.Conclusions: Large prospective studies suggest that ICG lymphography could be used as a single tracer to reliably perform sentinel lymph node biopsy. In the case of cutaneous melanoma, ICG lymphography increases node detection sensitivity and accuracy in conjunction with lymphoscintigraphy. In chronic lymphedema, it is useful for pre-and postoperative staging and intraoperative anatomical location of lymphatic pathways when lymphovenous bypass is indicated. ICG angiography is used intraoperatively to assess free flap anastomosis and design skin paddles and postoperatively to monitor buried flaps. In pedicled perforator flaps or for large skin paddles, intraoperative ICG angiography is strongly correlated with postoperative outcomes.

AB  - The following data was used: the archives of measurements of available water capacity carried out at Roshydromet network of stations and satellite measurements of relative humidity of the upper soil layer from ASCAT data (from the MetOp satellites). The statistical structure of the field of available water capacity in the upper 10- and 20-cm soil layers is assessed. The correlations between the Earth remote sensing data and data from agrometeorological stations are revealed. The procedure of automatic data checking from ground-based observations is developed. The algorithm is suggested for statistically optimal conversion of the Earth remote sensing data to the estimate of moisture content in the upper soil layer.

TI  - Drivers of bird diversity in an understudied African centre of endemism: The Angolan Central Escarpment Forest
T2  - BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural habitats are being rapidly lost due to human activities. It is therefore vital to understand how these activities influence biodiversity so that suitable guidelines can be established for conservation. This is particularly important in understudied, high biodiversity, areas such as the Angolan Escarpment. Here we examine which habitat characteristics drive bird diversity and endemic species presence at Kumbira Forest, a key site in the Central Escarpment Forest. Bird diversity was sampled by 10 min bird point counts, whereas habitat characteristics were measured by a combination of ground-based vegetation surveys and remotely sensed data modelling of Landsat images. GLM, multi-model inference and model averaging were used to determine the most important variables driving species richness and the presence of endemics. The remote sensing variables performed poorly in predicting presence of Red-crested Turaco Tauraco erythrolophus and Gabela Bushshrike Laniarius amboimensis but they contributed significantly to explain species richness and Gabela Akalat Sheppardia gabela presence, both of which were associated with greater canopy cover. Liana density and elevation were also important explanatory variables in certain cases. Conservation actions at Kumbira should focus on increasing canopy cover and maintaining forest integrity (as measured by liana density), as these actions are likely to have the most positive outcomes for the avifauna.

TI  - Remote sensing monitoring the spatio-temporal changes of aridification in the Mongolian Plateau based on the general Ts-NDVI space, 1981-2012
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper has developed a general Ts-NDVI triangle space with vegetation index time-series data from AVHRR and MODIS to monitor soil moisture in the Mongolian Plateau during 1981-2012, and studied the spatio-temporal variations of drought based on the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI). The results indicated that (1) the developed general Ts-NDVI space extracted from the AVHRR and MODIS remote sensing data would be an effective method to monitor regional drought, moreover, it would be more meaningful if the single time Ts-NDVI space showed an unstable condition; (2) the inverted TVDI was expected to reflect the water deficit in the study area. It was found to be in close negative agreement with precipitation and 10 cm soil moisture; (3) in the Mongolian Plateau, TVDI presented a zonal distribution with changes in land use/land cover types, vegetation cover and latitude. The soil moisture is low in bare land, construction land and grassland. During 1981-2012, drought was widely spread throughout the plateau, and aridification was obvious in the study period. Vegetation degradation, overgrazing, and climate warming could be considered as the main reasons.

TI  - Analysis of respired amphibole fibers (asbestos and non-asbestos classified): discrimination between natural and anthropogenic sources using sentinel animals
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the degree of exposure and to distinguish the contributions of respirable amphibole fibers (both asbestos and non-asbestos) from natural and anthropogenic sources, we investigated their burden in the lungs of sentinel animals. Lung samples of sentinel animals are more easily and continuously available in comparison to humans and are not affected by human variables such as occupational exposure and smoking habit. Fiber identification and quantification have been performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Results for detected amphibole fibers (both asbestos and non-asbestos) were obtained from six studied areas in Northwest Italy (Piedmont) and correlated to lithological and urbanization data. Detected amphibole fiber species have been classified as asbestos minerals occur naturally (NOA) or to anthropogenically sourced asbestos (ASA). This pilot study is a potentially useful tool for the evaluation of the distribution and sources of respirable inorganic fibers. The model should be applicable in any areas where lithological and anthropogenic characteristics are known.

TI  - The hydrologic landscape of the Ajo coastal plain, Argentina: An assessment of human-induced changes
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands rank among the most endangered ecosystems since they are affected by the sea level rise and by anthropogenic activities. The continued loss and degradation of these valuable environments requires greater understanding of groundwater-surface water exchange, as the ecological function of coastal wetlands greatly depends on it. Hydrological research carried out in the lower part of the Samborombon Bay coastland (Rio de la Plata estuary, Argentina) by remote sensing revealed the presence of a meandering channel system, which does not appear in modern maps. Analysis of SPOT satellite images and interpretation of historical maps and in situ surveys confirmed that this structure is part of an ancient river system - the palaeo-Rincon de Ajo River - at present almost completely silted up. In addition, multispectral satellite data provided information to develop a conceptual hydrological model, as well as evidence that a significant hydrologic landscape shift occurred due to human-made interventions. The palaeo-Rincon de Ajo River disappeared because water flow in its upper course was intercepted by human-made canals. In its lower course, embankments built for the construction of roads and flood prevention of the wetlands from the Rio de la Plata estuary excluded the surface flow from the estuary to the mainland and vice versa. The silting up in the lower course and in the vicinity of the mouth cancelled the original structure of the ancient river. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping major land cover types and retrieving the age of secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon by combining single-date optical and radar remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests play an important role in restoring carbon and biodiversity lost previously through deforestation and degradation and yet there is little information available on the extent of different successional stages. Such knowledge is particularly needed in tropical regions where past and current disturbance rates have been high but regeneration is rapid. Focusing on three areas in the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus, Santarem, Machadinho d'Oeste), this study aimed to evaluate the use of single-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data in the 2007-2010 period for i) discriminating mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest, and ii) retrieving the age of secondary forests (ASF), with 100 to x 100 m training areas obtained by the analysis of an extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data over the three sites. A machine learning algorithm (random forests) was used in combination with ALOS PALSAR backscatter intensity at HH and HV polarizations and Landsat 5 TM surface reflectance in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions. Overall accuracy when discriminating mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest is high (95-96%), with the highest errors in the secondary forest class (omission and commission errors in the range 4-6% and 12-20% respectively) because of misclassification as mature forest. Root mean square error (RMSE) and bias when retrieving ASF ranged between 4.3-4.7 years (relative RMSE = 25.5-32.0%) and 0.04-0.08 years respectively. On average, unbiased ASF estimates can be obtained using the method proposed here (Wilcoxon test, p-value > 0.05). However, the bias decomposition by 5-year interval ASF classes showed that most age estimates are biased, with consistent overestimation in secondary forests up to 10-15 years of age and underestimation in secondary forests of at least 20 years of age. Comparison with the classification results obtained from the analysis of extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data showed a good agreement, with Pearson's coefficient of correlation (R) of the proportion of mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest at 1-km grid cells ranging between 0.97-0.98, 0.96-0.98 and 0.84-0.90 in the 2007-2010 period, respectively. The agreement was lower (R = 0.82-0.85) when using the same dataset to compare the ability of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat 5 TM data to retrieve ASF. This was also dependent on the study area, especially when considering mapping secondary forest and retrieving ASF, with Manaus displaying better agreement when compared to the results at Santarem and Machadinho d'Oeste.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge on reliable estimates of areas under sugarcane cultivation is essential for the Brazilian agribusiness, since it helps in the development of public policies, in determining prices by sugar mills to producers and allows establishing the logistics of production disposal. The objective of this work was to develop a methodology for mapping the sugarcane crop area in the state of Parana, Brazil, using images from the Landsat/TM/OLI and IRS/LISS-3 satellites, for the crop years from 2010/2011 to 2013/2014. The mappings were conducted through the supervised Maximum likelihood classification (Maxver) achieving, on average, an overall accuracy of 94.13% and kappa index of 0.82. The correlation with the official data of the IBGE ranged from moderate to strong (0.64 <= r(s) <= 0.80) with average agreement (dr) of 0.81. There was an increase of 2.73% (18,630 ha) in the area with sugarcane in Parana between 2010/2011 and 2013/2014.

TI  - Northern Arabian Sea Circulation Autonomous Research (NASCar) A RESEARCH INITIATIVE BASED ON AUTONOMOUS SENSORS
T2  - OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arabian Sea circulation is forced by strong monsoonal winds and is characterized by vigorous seasonally reversing currents, extreme differences in sea surface salinity, localized substantial upwelling, and widespread submesoscale thermohaline structures. Its complicated sea surface temperature patterns are important for the onset and evolution of the Asian monsoon. This article describes a program that aims to elucidate the role of upper-ocean processes and atmospheric feedbacks in setting the sea surface temperature properties of the region. The wide range of spatial and temporal scales and the difficulty of accessing much of the region with ships due to piracy motivated a novel approach based on state-of-the-art autonomous ocean sensors and platforms. The extensive data set that is being collected, combined with numerical models and remote sensing data, confirms the role of planetary waves in the reversal of the Somali Current system. These data also document the fast response of the upper equatorial ocean to monsoon winds through changes in temperature and salinity and the connectivity of the surface currents across the northern Indian Ocean. New observations of thermohaline interleaving structures and mixing in setting the surface temperature properties of the northern Arabian Sea are also discussed.

TI  - Response of primary producers to the hydrographic variability in the southern region of the California Current System
T2  - CIENCIAS MARINAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of primary producers to seasonal and interannualvariabilities in the hydrographic conditions observed between 1997 and 2012 is analyzed for the southern portion of the California Current System (CCS). The analysis uses the optimum rate of primary productivity (PP) normalized by units of chlorophyll (Chla) in the water column (P-opt(B)) and Chla concentration. In situ PP estimations using the C-14 method were obtained as part of the seasonal cruises conducted by the Investigaciones Mexicanas de la Corriente de California program. Supplementary data included sea surface temperature (SST) as measured by the AVHRR sensor from 1985-2009. We found the mean value of P-opt(B) to be at 5.1 +/- 3.3 mg C. (mg Chla)(-1).h(-1), with maximum ranges of 0.5 and 17.5 mg C.(mg Chla)(-1).h(-1). The relationship between P-opt(B) and SST suggested a phytoplankton community change at around 19 degrees C, which characterized the transitional nature of the southern portion of the CCS. SST data suggested, on the one hand, that on average the 19 degrees C isotherm is located in the vicinity of Punta Eugenia and, on the other, that its spatial variability defined the alternating cool-warm conditions. At the seasonal scale, this isotherm showed a marked latitudinal displacement (from 24 degrees N to 32 degrees N), which was observed to be even out of this range during interannual events associated with El Nino/La Nina. Under both cool-warm hydrographic conditions, the phytoplanktonic community showed large P-opt(B) rates (similar to 6 mg C.(mg Chla)(-1).h(-1)). At the interannual scale, P-opt(B) changes were associated to changes in the abundance and composition of nano-microphytoplankton. Additionally, data suggested that high PP rates during warm periods could be attributed to an enhanced picoplankton contribution.

TI  - Data mining methods applied to map soil units on tropical hillslopes in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A soil survey is the main source of soil spatial information and is very useful in supporting land use decisions, especially for agronomic purposes. However, the continuity of soil surveying in Brazil has been compromised due the minimal amount of government investment in the sector. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of three data mining methods-decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN)-with R software to predict soil map units from the Guapi-Macacu watershed in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Terrain attributes derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), remote sensing data (Landsat 5), and a geology map were used as predictors. Evaluation of the models' performance was based on statistical indices obtained from a confusion matrix by using validation samples. Furthermore, a comparison was performed to analyze the agreement between the maps created from the models and from a conventional soil map (legacy data); sampling locations were not used as input data in the training process. The results indicated better performance from the RF model compared with the DT and ANN models. The accuracy was calculated through validation samples indicating values in the Kappa index corresponding to 0.76 (RF), 0.72 (ANN) and 0.66 (DT). A comparison between the maps obtained from the models and the conventional soil map exhibited better agreement with the RF model (68.7%), followed by the ANN (62.8%), and DT (62.3%) models. The classification accuracy, obtained through comparisons with sampling locations, exhibited correct classification of 57.6% in the RF model, 56.8% in the DT, and 56.1% in the ANN model; the conventional soil map had 69.7% correct classification. In general, most of the confusion between soil map units was observed in Haplic Gleysols, Haplic Acrisols (Clayic) and Fluvisols. In terms of covariates importance, in general, the terrain attributes derived from the DEM had more influence as predictor covariates than the indices obtained from the Landsat data. The application of data mining can improve the methods applied to soil map units, thereby contributing to increasing information related to soil-landscape relationships and enhancing the products of soil surveys.

TI  - Radiolabeled inorganic nanoparticles for positron emission tomography imaging of cancer: an overview
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the last few years, a plethora of radiolabeled inorganic nanoparticles have been developed and evaluated for their potential use as probes in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of a wide variety of cancers. Inorganic nanoparticles represent an emerging paradigm in molecular imaging probe design, allowing the incorporation of various imaging modalities, targeting ligands, and therapeutic payloads into a single vector. A major challenge in this endeavor is to develop disease-specific nanoparticles with facile and robust radiolabeling strategies. Also, the radiolabeled nanoparticles should demonstrate adequate in vitro and in vivo stability, enhanced sensitivity for detection of disease at an early stage, optimized in vivo pharmacokinetics for reduced non-specific organ uptake, and improved targeting for achieving high efficacy. Owing to these challenges and other technological and regulatory issues, only a single radiolabeled nanoparticle formulation, namely "C-dots" (Cornell dots), has found its way into clinical trials thus far. This review describes the available options for radiolabeling of nanoparticles and summarizes the recent developments in PET imaging of cancer in preclinical and clinical settings using radiolabeled nanoparticles as probes. The key considerations toward clinical translation of these novel PET imaging probes are discussed, which will be beneficial for advancement of the field.

TI  - Identifying Irrigated Areas in the Snake River Plain, Idaho: Evaluating Performance across Composting Algorithms, Spectral Indices, and Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are pressing concerns about the interplay between agricultural productivity, water demand, and water availability in semi-arid to arid regions of the world. Currently, irrigated agriculture is the dominant water user in these regions and is estimated to consume approximately 80% of the world's diverted freshwater resources. We develop an improved irrigated land-use mapping algorithm that uses the seasonal maximum value of a spectral index to distinguish between irrigated and non-irrigated parcels in Idaho's Snake River Plain. We compare this approach to two alternative algorithms that differentiate between irrigated and non-irrigated parcels using spectral index values at a single date or the area beneath spectral index trajectories for the duration of the agricultural growing season. Using six different pixel and county-scale error metrics, we evaluate the performance of these three algorithms across all possible combinations of two growing seasons (2002 and 2007), two datasets (MODIS and Landsat 5), and three spectral indices, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDVI, EVI, and NDMI). We demonstrate that, on average, the seasonal-maximum algorithm yields an improvement in classification accuracy over the accepted single-date approach, and that the average improvement under this approach is a 60% reduction in county scale root mean square error (RMSE), and modest improvements of overall accuracy in the pixel scale validation. The greater accuracy of the seasonal-maximum algorithm is primarily due to its ability to correctly classify non-irrigated lands in riparian and developed areas of the study region.

TI  - Retrieval of land surface temperature (LST) from landsat TM6 and TIRS data by single channel radiative transfer algorithm using satellite and ground-based inputs
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study proposes land surface temperature (1ST) retrieval from satellite-based thermal IR data by single channel radiative transfer algorithm using atmospheric correction parameters derived from satellite-based and in-situ data and land surface emissivity (LSE) derived by a hybrid LSE model. For example, atmospheric transmittance (T) was derived from Terra MODIS spectral radiance in atmospheric window and absorption bands, whereas the atmospheric path radiance and sky radiance were estimated using satellite-and ground-based in-situ solar radiation, geographic location and observation conditions. The hybrid LSE model which is coupled with ground-based emissivity measurements is more versatile than the previous LSE models and yields improved emissivity values by knowledge-based approach. It uses NDVI-based and NDVI Threshold method (NDVITHM) based algorithms and field-measured emissivity values. The model is applicable for dense vegetation cover, mixed vegetation cover, bare earth including coal mining related land surface classes. The study was conducted in a coalfield of India badly affected by coal fire for decades. In a coal fire affected coalfield, LST would provide precise temperature difference between thermally anomalous coal fire pixels and background pixels to facilitate coal fire detection and monitoring. The derived LST products of the present study were compared with radiant temperature images across some of the prominent coal fire locations in the study area by graphical means and by some standard mathematical dispersion coefficients such as coefficient of variation, coefficient of quartile deviation, coefficient of quartile deviation for 3rd quartile vs. maximum temperature, coefficient of mean deviation (about median) indicating significant increase in the temperature difference among the pixels. The average temperature slope between adjacent pixels, which increases the potential of coal fire pixel detection from background pixels, is significantly larger in the derived LST products than the corresponding radiant temperature images.

TI  - Alpine grassland fPAR change over the Northern Tibetan Plateau from 2002 to 2011
T2  - ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, two different methods including Digital Camera and Reference Panel (DCRP) and traditional in situ fPAR observation for measuring the in situ point fPAR of very short alpine grass vegetation were compared, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fPAR products were evaluated and validated by in situ point data on the alpine grassland over the Northern Tibetan Plateau, which is sensitive to climate change and vulnerable to anthropogenic activities. Results showed that the MODIS alpine grassland fPAR product, examined by using DCRP, and traditional in situ fPAR observation had a significant relationship at the spatial and temporal scales. The decadal MODIS fPAR trend analysis showed that, average growing season fPAR increased by 1.2 x 10(-4) per year and in total increased 0.86% from 2002 to 2011 in alpine grassland, when most of the fPAR increments occurred in southeast and center of the Northern Tibetan Plateau, the alpine grassland tended to recover from degradation slightly. However, climatic factors have influenced the various alpine grassland vegetation fPAR over a period of 10 years; precipitation significantly affected the alpine meadow fPAR in the eastern region, whereas temperature considerably influenced the alpine desert steppe fPAR in the west region. These findings suggest that the regional heterogeneity in alpine grassland fPAR results from various environmental factors, except for vegetation characteristics, such as canopy structure and leaf area.

TI  - A hierarchical spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model using one image pair
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Image fusion techniques that blend multi-sensor characteristics to generate synthetic data with fine resolutions have generated great interest within the remote sensing community. Over the past decade, although many advances have been made in the spatiotemporal fusion models, there still remain several shortcomings in existing methods. In this article, a hierarchical spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model (HSTAFM) is proposed for producing daily synthetic fine-resolution fusions. The suggested model uses only one prior or posterior image pair, especially with the aim being to predict arbitrary temporal changes. The proposed model is implemented in two stages. First, the coarse-resolution image is enhanced through super-resolution based on sparse representation; second, a pre-selection of temporal change is performed. It then adopts a two-level strategy to select similar pixels, and blends multi-sensor features adaptively to generate the final synthetic data. The results of tests using both simulated and actual observed data show that the model can accurately capture both seasonal phenology change and land-cover-type change. Comparisons between HSTAFM and other developed models also demonstrate our proposed model produces consistently lower biases.

TI  - Oceanic eddy-driven atmospheric secondary circulation in the winter Kuroshio Extension region
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the winter Kuroshio Extension region, the atmospheric response to oceanic eddies is studied using reanalysis and satellite data. The detected eddies in this region are mostly under the force of northwesterly wind, with the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly located within the eddy. By examining the patterns of surface wind divergence, three types of atmospheric response are identified. The first type, which occupies 60%, is characterized by significant sea surface wind convergence and divergence at the edge and a vertical secondary circulation (SC) aloft, supporting the "vertical momentum mixing mechanism". The SCs on anticyclonic eddies (AEs) can reach up to 300 hPa, but those on cyclonic eddies (CEs) are limited to 700 hPa. This can be explained by analyzing vertical eddy heat transport: When northwesterly wind passes the warmer center of an AE, it is from the cold to warm sea surface, resulting in stronger evaporation and convection, triggering stronger upward velocity and moist static heat flux. For the cases of CEs, the wind blows from warm to cold, which means less instability and less evaporation, resulting in weaker SCs. The second type, which occupies 10%, is characterized by divergence and a sea level pressure anomaly in the center, supported by the "pressure adjustment mechanism". The other 30% are mostly weak eddies, and the atmospheric variation aloft is unrelated to the SST anomaly. Our work provides evidence for the different atmospheric responses over oceanic eddies and explains why SCs over AEs are much stronger than those over CEs by vertical heat flux analysis.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Change Detection Based on NSCT-HMT Model and Its Application
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional image change detection based on a non-subsampled contourlet transform always ignores the neighborhood information's relationship to the non-subsampled contourlet coefficients, and the detection results are susceptible to noise interference. To address these disadvantages, we propose a denoising method based on the non-subsampled contourlet transform domain that uses the Hidden Markov Tree model (NSCT-HMT) for change detection of remote sensing images. First, the ENVI software is used to calibrate the original remote sensing images. After that, the mean-ratio operation is adopted to obtain the difference image that will be denoised by the NSCT-HMT model. Then, using the Fuzzy Local Information C-means (FLICM) algorithm, the difference image is divided into the change area and unchanged area. The proposed algorithm is applied to a real remote sensing data set. The application results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively suppress clutter noise, and retain more detailed information from the original images. The proposed algorithm has higher detection accuracy than the Markov Random Field-Fuzzy C-means (MRF-FCM), the non-subsampled contourlet transform-Fuzzy C-means clustering (NSCT-FCM), the pointwise approach and graph theory (PA-GT), and the Principal Component Analysis-Nonlocal Means (PCA-NLM) denosing algorithm. Finally, the five algorithms are used to detect the southern boundary of the Gurbantunggut Desert in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China, and the results show that the proposed algorithm has the best effect on real remote sensing image change detection.

TI  - Estimation of surface-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration using aerosol optical thickness through aerosol type analysis method
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface-level particulate matter is closely related to column aerosol optical thickness (AOT). Previous researches have successfully used column AOT and different meteorological parameters to estimate surface-level PM concentration. In this study, the performance of a selected linear model that estimates surface-level PM2.5 concentration was evaluated following the aerosol type analysis method (ATAM) for the first time. We utilized 443 daily average data for Xuzhou, Jiangsu province, collected using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) during the period October 2013 to April 2016. Several parameters including atmospheric boundary layer height (BLH), relative humidity (RH), and effective radius of the aerosol size distribution (R-ef) were used to assess the relationship between the column AOT and PM2.5 concentration. By including the BLH, ambient RH, and effective radius, the correlation (R-2) increased from 0.084 to 0.250 at Xuzhou, and with the use of ATAM, the correlation increased further to 0.335. To compare the results, 450 daily average data for Beijing, pertaining to the same period, were utilized. The study found that model correlations improved by varying degrees in different seasons and at different sites following ATAM. The average urban industry (UI) aerosol ratios at Xuzhou and Beijing were 0.792 and 0.451, respectively, demonstrating poorer air conditions at Xuzhou. PM2.5 estimation at Xuzhou showed lower correlation (R-2 = 0.335) compared to Beijing (R-2 = 0.407), and the increase of R-2 at Xuzhou and Beijing site following use of ATAM were 33.8% and 12.4%, respectively.

TI  - Multi-Feature Segmentation for High-Resolution Polarimetric SAR Data Based on Fractal Net Evolution Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Segmentation techniques play an important role in understanding high-resolution polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. PolSAR image segmentation is widely used as a preprocessing step for subsequent classification, scene interpretation and extraction of surface parameters. However, speckle noise and rich spatial features of heterogeneous regions lead to blurred boundaries of high-resolution PolSAR image segmentation. A novel segmentation algorithm is proposed in this study in order to address the problem and to obtain accurate and precise segmentation results. This method integrates statistical features into a fractal net evolution algorithm (FNEA) framework, and incorporates polarimetric features into a simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) superpixel generation algorithm. First, spectral heterogeneity in the traditional FNEA is substituted by the G(0) distribution statistical heterogeneity in order to combine the shape and statistical features of PolSAR data. The statistical heterogeneity between two adjacent image objects is measured using a log likelihood function. Second, a modified SLIC algorithm is utilized to generate compact superpixels as the initial samples for the G(0) statistical model, which substitutes the polarimetric distance of the Pauli RGB composition for the CIELAB color distance. The segmentation results were obtained by weighting the G(0) statistical feature and the shape features, based on the FNEA framework. The validity and applicability of the proposed method was verified with extensive experiments on simulated data and three real-world high-resolution PolSAR images from airborne multi-look ESAR, spaceborne single-look RADARSAT-2, and multi-look TerraSAR-X data sets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method obtains more accurate and precise segmentation results than the other methods for high-resolution PolSAR images.

TI  - The Relationship between Urban Land Surface Material Fractions and Brightness Temperature Based on MESMA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between urban land surface material fractions (ULSMFs) and brightness temperature has long attracted attention in research on urban environments. In this paper, a multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) method was applied to extract vegetation-impervious surface-soil (V-I-S) fractions in each pixel, and the surface brightness temperature was derived by using the radiation in the upper atmosphere, on the basis of Landsat 8 images. Then, a clustering analysis, ternary triangular chart (TTC), and a multivariate statistical analysis were applied to ascertain the relationship between the fractions in each pixel and the land surface brightness temperature (LSBT). The hypsometric TTC, as well as the geographical distribution features of the LSBT, revealed that the changes in LSBT were associated with the high fractions of impervious surfaces (or vegetation), in addition to the temperature distribution differences across locations with varying land-cover types. The data fitting results showed that the comprehensive endmember fractions of V-I-S explained 98.6% of fluctuating LSBT, and the impervious surface fraction had a positive impact on the LSBT, whereas the fraction of vegetation had a negative impact on the LSBT.

TI  - Retrieval and Comparison of Forest Leaf Area Index Based on Remote Sensing Data from AVNIR-2, Landsat-5 TM, MODIS, and PALSAR Sensors
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data from multi-source optical and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) sensors have been widely utilized to detect forest dynamics under a variety of conditions. Due to different temporal coverage, spatial resolution, and spectral characteristics, these sensors usually perform differently from one another. To conduct statistical modeling accuracies evaluation and comparison among several sensors, a linear statistical model was applied in this study for retrieval and comparative analysis based on remote-sensing indices from optical sensors of ALOS AVNIR-2 (Advanced Land Observing Satellite Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2), Landsat-5 TM (Thematic Mapper), MODIS NBAR (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance), and the SAR sensor of ALOS PALSAR (Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar), respectively. This modeling used the forest leaf area index (LAI) as the field measured variable. During modeling, six optical vegetation indices were selected for evaluation and comparison between the three optical sensors, while simultaneously, two radar indices were calculated for the comparison between ALOS AVNIR-2 and PALSAR sensors. The gap between the spatial resolution of remote-sensing data and field plot size can account for the different accuracies found in this study. This study provides a reference for the selection of remote-sensing data types and spatial resolution in specific forest monitoring applications with different data acquisition costs and accuracy needs. Normally, at regional and national scales, remote sensing data with 30 m spatial resolution (e.g., Landsat) could provide significant results in the statistical modelling and retrieval of LAI while the MODIS cannot always meet the requirements.

TI  - In-Flight Calibration of GF-1/WFV Visible Channels Using Rayleigh Scattering
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China is planning to launch more and more optical remote-sensing satellites with high spatial resolution and multistep gains. Field calibration, the current operational method of satellite in-flight radiometric calibration, still does not have enough capacity to meet these demands. Gaofen-1 (GF-1), as the first satellite of the Chinese High-resolution Earth Observation System, has been specially arranged to obtain 22 images over clean ocean areas using the Wide Field Viewing camera. Following this, Rayleigh scattering calibration was carried out for the visible channels with these images after the appropriate data processing steps. To guarantee a high calibration precision, uncertainty was analyzed in advance taking into account ozone, aerosol optical depth (AOD), seawater salinity, chlorophyll concentration, wind speed and solar zenith angle. AOD and wind speed were found to be the biggest error sources, which were also closely coupled to the solar zenith angle. Therefore, the best sample data for Rayleigh scattering calibration were selected at the following solar zenith angle of 19-22 degrees and wind speed of 5-13 m/s to reduce the reflection contributed by the water surface. The total Rayleigh scattering calibration uncertainties of visible bands are 2.44% (blue), 3.86% (green), and 4.63% (red) respectively. Compared with the recent field calibration results, the errors are -1.69% (blue), 1.83% (green), and -0.79% (red). Therefore, the Rayleigh scattering calibration can become an operational in-flight calibration method for the high spatial resolution satellites.

AB  - Remote sensing images have been used in many fields, such as urban planning, military, and environment monitoring, but corruption by stripe noise limits its subsequent applications. Most existing stripe noise removal (destriping) methods aim to directly estimate the clear images from the stripe images without considering the intrinsic properties of stripe noise, which causes the image structure destroyed. In this paper, we propose a new destriping method from the perspective of image decomposition, which takes the intrinsic properties of stripe noise and image characteristics into full consideration. The proposed method integrates the unidirectional total variation (TV) regularization, group sparsity regularization, and TV regularization together in an image decomposition framework. The first two terms are utilized to exploit the stripe noise properties by implementing statistical analysis, and the TV regularization is adopted to explore the spatial piecewise smooth structure of stripe-free image. Moreover, an efficient alternating minimization scheme is designed to solve the proposed model. Extensive experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate that our method outperforms several existing state-of-the-art destriping methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative assessments.

AB  - Background. Annual influenza vaccine is recommended for those at greatest risk of severe influenza infection. Recent reports of a negative impact of serial influenza vaccination on vaccine effectiveness (VE) raises concerns about the recommendation for annual influenza vaccines, particularly in persons at greatest risk.Methods. The Influenza Complications Alert Network (FluCAN) is an Australian hospital-based sentinel surveillance program. In this observational study, cases were defined as subjects aged >9 years admitted with influenza confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Controls were subjects with acute respiratory illness testing negative for influenza. Propensity scores were used to adjust for the likelihood of being vaccinated. VE was calculated as 1 - adjusted odds ratio of vaccination in cases compared with test-negative controls.Results. Over 2010-2015, 6223 cases and 6505 controls were hospitalized with confirmed influenza and influenza test-negative acute respiratory illness, respectively. Following stratification by quintile of propensity score, site, and year, VE was estimated to be 43% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37%-49%) overall. VE was estimated to be 51% (95% CI, 45%-57%) in those vaccinated in both the current and previous season, compared with 33% (95% CI, 17%-47%) vaccinated in the current season only and 35% (95% CI, 21%-46%) in the previous season only. Similar results were observed for influenza A/H1N1, influenza A/H3N2, and influenza B strains.Conclusions. Vaccination in both the current and previous seasons was associated with a higher VE against hospitalization with influenza than vaccination in either single season. These findings reinforce current recommendations for annual influenza vaccination, particularly those at greatest risk of influenza disease.
