AB  - Smallholder farms in South East Asia are characterized by small irregular field patterns, dense cloud cover and haze which limits our ability to observe changes in agriculture land-use. Very-high resolution (VHR, < 5 m) Earth observing (EO) satellites have grown into constellations with global repeat coverage that can support multiple observations within a growing season. Here we present a multi-modal approach to map and monitor changes in agriculture at the field scale in the Mekong River Delta with VHR optical imagery from Worldview-1, 2 and 3, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) from Sentinel-1. Our approach leverages the benefits of SAR and VHR imagery with geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) in a high-end computing environment to rapidly map the distribution and size of agriculture fields that are not observable at moderate resolution (> 30 m) in regions with dense persistent cloud cover and haze from biomass burning.

TI  - Folktales: Some Theses
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article suggests a general outlook of the structure and semantics of the folktale. Its text builds up its own worldview, its contents is perceived as the state of being, unlike "non-folktale prose" where the worldview has roots beyond the genre complex in question. The space of the folktale comprises separate loci, their peculiarities determined by the presence of these or those characters, as well as situations typical of these particular loci. The "Self and Other" dichotomy has the following registers: "family", "society", "myth". Nevertheless, the mythic in folktales is that only by its origin. The folktale has nearly always a "social ladder", as the protagonist's adventures must end up "with a bonus", either possessions (wealth), or marriage (spouse), or high status (investiture). The folktale regulates the code of the relations with the other world, as well as the code of success itself. If you behave yourself "right" in this world, the energy of the world will do you only "good". Such "ethics" is based on the exchange of "gifts", and the protagonist's "right" behavior shaped in the folktale. The folktale is the first verbal form in the world recognized as imitation or fiction. Its poetic structure is greatly orientated toward creating an entertaining aesthetic effect which enables breaking off its worldview from that of actual beliefs and rituals. The formalized narrative structures of the folktale play an important part in the emergence of literature, as well as the literature of New Age.

TI  - A South African view of Pentecostalism as another response to modernism
T2  - IN DIE SKRIFLIG-IN LUCE VERBI
M3  - Article
AB  - A popular way used by most sociologists, anthropologists and theologians to define the Pentecostal movement, its origins and growth is by way of the Deprivation Theory, implying that Pentecostalism can be explained in terms of its origins among the poor, marginalised and disenfranchised. However, it is argued that Pentecostal identity was rather formed by its Bible reading practices, its hermeneutics that resulted in its doctrinal understanding of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, the Full Gospel message and the lifestyle it generated that caused others to convert to Pentecostalism. It is submitted that this was the result of utilising a specific Bible reading method prevalent in holiness circles of the 19th century, which involved reading from a primitivist-restorationist and revivalistic perspective, and also served as the primary cause of the establishment of Pentecostalism and its growth. Individuals were attracted to Pentecostalism not because they were deprived although many of them were but with the way they read and interpreted the Bible, the resultant religious quest for Jesus and their enchanted worldview. Deprivation and disorganisation should rather be viewed as facilitating rather than causing its attraction, implying that the popularity of the movement is to be sought somewhere else in the dynamics of the movement itself. It is concluded that Pentecostalism is a countercultural paramodern movement that defined its praxis-oriented identity and restorationist-primitivist spiritual ethos as a social and spiritual response to modernistic liberalism and Protestant fundamentalist cessationist orthodoxy.

AB  - Data is starting at now a champion among the most basic assets for associations in each field. The consistent improvement in the essentialness and to manage and process large amount of data has made another issue: it cannot be dealt with by standard examination strategies and to store such kind of data to use different file system. This issue was, thusly, comprehended through the formation of another worldview: big data. Be that as it may, big data started new problem related to the large quantity data exclusively or the assortment of the information, yet additionally to information security and protection and another side of big data security in terms of file system. To manage such type of data, we are using different file systems starting from Google. This file system works on distributed and parallel systems. We study the different load balancing algorithm and found some of the differences. In this paper, we present what is big data, then how the big data needed security and different types of security issues in big data focused major issues. The main motto of this paper is to provide a survey report on the latest trends in big data and latest security mechanisms that in form of different levels of security like data and infrastructure security.

TI  - Gourmandise in the hierarchy of values: A case study of French and Belgian proverbs and sayings
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paremiological stock of a language is an important source of axiological information that helps to identify the features of a culture, people's mentality, and their worldview. The paper is devoted to the study of gourmandise as a component of the French and Belgian worldviews reflected in the French language paremias. The aim of the research is to determine its place in the hierarchy of values of the native speakers of French and its Belgian variant. The research material includes 202 units obtained from "Dictionnaire de proverbes et dictons" (121 units) and from "Proverbes et dictons de Belgique francophonie" (81 units). The research methods include semantic, axiological, quantitative, and comparative analyses. The results of the study indicate that 5,9% of French and 6,6% of Belgian units of the total number presented in the dictionaries are devoted to food and gourmandize, which proves that they occupy an important place in the hierarchy of values in both cultures. More than half of the gastronomic proverbs and sayings have a positive connotation. Some types of food, such as bread, butter, and eggs, are symbolic for both ethnic groups. The analysis of gastronomic realities has revealed similar French and Belgian values (such as wealth, prosperity, happiness, health, pleasure, life) and antivalues (poverty, hunger, misery, disease, death, etc.). The obtained data contribute to the axiological studies of the worldview of the native speakers of various variants of the French language and can serve as a starting point for conducting similar research of other values, including those based on the material of other languages and cultures.

AB  - The latest generation of geostationary satellites (Himawari 8/9, GOES-16/17, FY-4, GK-2A) carries sensors that closely mimic the spatial and spectral characteristics of widely used polar-orbiting, global monitoring sensors such as MODIS and VIIRS. When combined, data from various currently operating/planned geostationary platforms provide a geo-ring of hyper-temporal (5-10 minutes), multispectral observations at spatial resolutions as high as 500 m. These high frequency observations offer exciting new possibilities for monitoring our planet, including better retrievals of geophysical variables by overcoming cloud cover, enabling studies of diurnally varying phenomena in the atmosphere, land, and the oceans, and support operational decision-making in agriculture, hydrology and disaster management. The NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) team, in collaboration with scientists from JAXA, KARI, NOAA and other international institutions, created the GeoNEX (www.nasa.gov/geonex) pipeline to integrate data from all available geostationary platforms and produce and distribute spatially, temporally, and radiometrically consistent data for the earth science community. We envision various institutions adapting the Geo component (e.g., GeoNOAA, GeoKARI, GeoChiba, GeoJAXA, GeoCMA) and customizing the pipeline and downstream products to serve the local/regional research and applied science communities.

TI  - Optimal Canny's Parameters Regressions for Coastal Line Detection in Satellite-Based SAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Canny's algorithm is a very well-known and widely implemented multistage edge detector. The extraction of coastal lines in space-borne-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images using this algorithm is particularly complicated because of the multiplicative speckle noise present in them and can only be used if Canny's parameters (CaPP) are chosen appropriately. This letter introduces a methodology for computing functional forms for the CaPP, using functions of the image characteristics through a system that combines artificial neural networks (ANN) with statistical regression. A set of CaPP functional forms is obtained by applying this method on synthetic SAR images. Pratt's figure of merit (PFoM) is used to measure the performance of them, obtaining more than 0.75, on average, in the 14400 synthetic SAR images analyzed. Finally, this set of formulas has been tested for extracting coastal edges from real polynyas SAR images, acquired from Sentinel-1.

M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding water balance components is imperative for proper policy and decision making, specifically in the upper part of the Omo-Gibe basin (UOGB) Ethiopia. The objective of this study is to explore the possibility of assessing consumption and availability of water using freely available satellite data and secondary data. Using twenty-three rain gauge stations data, a spatial average of rainfall was computed using the Thiessen polygon approach. Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was estimated through the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS). Input data used are, 16 clouds free Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images covering the study area for estimation of the spatial distribution of actual evapotranspiration covering the whole cropping year from the months of November 2003 to October 2004. Additionally, Priestly and Taylor's approach was used to estimate reference evapotranspiration (ET0). For the study period, the result of estimated precipitation and ETa showed that the UOGB received 41,080 mm(3) of precipitation, while 24,135 mm(3) become evapotranspired. The assessed outflow from the basin is 17.6% of the precipitation and demonstrated that water is a scares resource in the UOGB.

AB  - The Microbiological-Ocean-Cloud Coupling in the High Arctic (MOCCHA) campaign was conducted during August-September 2018 to examine the coupling between the changing High Arctic surface and atmospheric composition, including the production of sea spray aerosols (SSA) from sea ice leads. Sentinel-1 satellite SAR data are used for observations of sea ice leads and open water where SSA may originate due to wind forcing. Results from selected Sentinel-1 SAR scenes show that sea ice leads and open water areas can be identified with co-polarized backscatter at larger incidence angles while water misclassification occurs at smaller incidence due to stronger surface scattering. In contrast, the cross-polarized backscatter remains low at low and high incidence angles. Melt on sea ice during the MOCCHA summertime can confound backscatter signatures that misidentify open sea water. Future analyses can be improved using SARs in synergy with other satellite sensors.

TI  - Assessment of shoreline changes for setback zone establishment from Son Tra (Da Nang city) to Cua Dai (Hoi An city), Vietnam
T2  - VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The most important function of the coastal setback is to minimize damage due to coastal erosion, climate change response, and sea-level rise. There are many directions and methods of researching and assessing coastal changes and coastal erosion. This study presents the results of the shoreline changes in the area from Son Tra (Da Nang City) to Cua Dai (Hoi An City), Central Vietnam based on remote sensing data from 1965 to 2019. Three methods are used to include End Point Ratio (EPR), Linear Regression Rate (LRR), and Weighted Linear Regression (WLR). The results show that the EPR method is effective when calculating the rate of shoreline changes only at two different times. For more objective and reliable calculation, it is necessary to assess the shoreline changes over time. Meanwhile, the LRR method was shown to be superior because all shoreline data were taken into account during the construction of the regression line. However, when there is much shoreline data with different reliability, the WLR method proved more superior because of limited objective errors. The results show that from 1965 to 2019, the coast of the Son Tra - Cua Dai area had quite complicated fluctuations, of which the northern area (Son Tra) tended to accretion, the central area tends to be alternate between accretion and erosion, while the south area (Cua Dai) is strong to very strong erosion. The coast with sudden changes is the Cua Dai area with the shoreline change envelope (SCE) reaching 512 m. The results also allow us to divide the coast of the Son Tra - Cua Dai area into 30 segments. They are clustered into 8 groups with different levels of erosion and accretion. This is an important basis for the setback zone establishment in the study area.

AB  - Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite constellations can provide multispectral images of 10 m, 20 m, and 60 m resolution for visible, near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) in the electromagnetic spectrum. In this paper, we present a sharpening method based on a symmetric skipped connection convolutional neural network, called SSC-CNN, to sharpen 20 m bands using 10 m bands. The main advantage of SSC-CNN architecture is that it brings the features of the input branch to the output, thus improving convergence without using too many deep layers. The proposed method uses the reduced-scale combination of 10 m bands and 20 m bands, and the observed 20 m bands as the training pairs. The experimental results using two Sentinel-2 datasets show that our method outperforms competitive methods in quantitative metrics and visualization.

TI  - Harmonization of Landsat and Sentinel 2 for Crop Monitoring in Drought Prone Areas: Case Studies of Ninh Thuan (Vietnam) and Bekaa (Lebanon)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Proper satellite-based crop monitoring applications at the farm-level often require near-daily imagery at medium to high spatial resolution. The combination of data from different ongoing satellite missions Sentinel 2 (ESA) and Landsat 7/8 (NASA) provides this unprecedented opportunity at a global scale; however, this is rarely implemented because these procedures are data demanding and computationally intensive. This study developed a robust stream processing for the harmonization of Landsat 7, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 in the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, connecting the benefit of coherent data structure, built-in functions and computational power in the Google Cloud. The harmonized surface reflectance images were generated for two agricultural schemes in Bekaa (Lebanon) and Ninh Thuan (Vietnam) during 2018-2019. We evaluated the performance of several pre-processing steps needed for the harmonization including the image co-registration, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions correction, topographic correction, and band adjustment. We found that the misregistration between Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images varied from 10 m in Ninh Thuan (Vietnam) to 32 m in Bekaa (Lebanon), and posed a great impact on the quality of the final harmonized data set if not treated. Analysis of a pair of overlapped L8-S2 images over the Bekaa region showed that, after the harmonization, all band-to-band spatial correlations were greatly improved. Finally, we demonstrated an application of the dense harmonized data set for crop mapping and monitoring. An harmonic (Fourier) analysis was applied to fit the detected unimodal, bimodal and trimodal shapes in the temporal NDVI patterns during one crop year in Ninh Thuan province. The derived phase and amplitude values of the crop cycles were combined with max-NDVI as an R-G-B false composite image. The final image was able to highlight croplands in bright colors (high phase and amplitude), while the non-crop areas were shown with grey/dark (low phase and amplitude). The harmonized data sets (with 30 m spatial resolution) along with the Google Earth Engine scripts used are provided for public use.

TI  - Mapping flood inundation areas over the lower part of the Con River basin using Sentinel 1A imagery
T2  - VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to determine a processing method for rapid flood inundation and potential flood-damaged area mapping in the lower part of the Con River basin, a region most vulnerable to floods in Vietnam, using Sentinel 1A (S1A) image. A threshold from -23 dB to -12 dB of the VV band was identified for extracting the water areas from S1A image and was applied in 28 S1A scenes to identify flood dynamics. The time-series map of flood inundation areas during the period of December 2017 to December 2018 evidenced Tuy Phuoc and northern part of An Nhon as the districts most inundated by the 2017 and 2018 floods, which is consistent to the local records. The round-year trend of total flood inundation area shows strong correlations with the Con river water level (R = 0.75) and local precipitation (R = 0.64) measured in Binh Nghi hydro-meteorological station confirming the appropriateness of the study method and the capability of S1A data in monitoring floods.

TI  - UNDERSTANDING SHORELINE AND RIVERBANK CHANGES UNDER THE EFFECT OF METEOROLOGICAL FORCINGS
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ASIAN AND PACIFIC COASTS, APAC 2019
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th International Conference on Asian and Pacific Coasts (APAC)

AB  - In a context of changing climate, extreme events, like floods or weather are expected to frequently increase. Hence, understanding the role of meteorological forcings affected shoreline evolution and riverbank erosion in spatio-temporal scales, especially Vu Gia - Thu Bon river coast located in Central Vietnam, is significantly remarkable. This is fundamental to interpret the information of shoreline and riverbank erosion-accretion trends. Plus, this helps coastal managers and policy makers give the effective solutions, interventions and strategies for adaptation and responding to possible changes in shoreline and riverbank. The goal of this paper, therefore, is to provide a deeper understanding the effects of meteorological forcings on shoreline and riverbank changes. To do this, the Google Earth images and field survey results in topography changes are implemented. Landsat images are added to better quantify the changes in shoreline and riverbank. More importantly, meteorological forcings extracted from the meteorological metadata and models are carefully analysed to have an insight into physical mechanisms and shoreline and riverbank behaviors. The results confirmed that the northeast winds are accompanied by stronger-than-normal tropical cyclones, which cause high waves on the river system. This is one of the main reasons for stronger shoreline erosion in Cua Dai estuary in the recent years. Additionally, the northeast wind-generated waves in winter are much stronger than the southeast wind-generated waves during the summer. The factors significantly contribute to the changes in shoreline and riverbank. Finally, precipitation is more abundant and northeast winds are more frequent and stronger than normal. This considerably affects the erosion tendency on the river sections at the positions like GiaoThuy or Ky Lam Bridge.

TI  - Landsat Time-Series for Estimating Forest Aboveground Biomass and Its Dynamics across Space and Time: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The free open access data policy instituted for the Landsat archive since 2008 has revolutionised the use of Landsat data for forest monitoring, especially for estimating forest aboveground biomass (AGB). This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent approaches utilising Landsat time-series (LTS) for estimating AGB and its dynamics across space and time. In particular, we focus on reviewing: (1) how LTS has been utilised to improve the estimation of AGB (for both single-date and over time) and (2) recent LTS-based approaches used for estimating AGB and its dynamics across space and time. In contrast to using single-date images, the use of LTS can benefit forest AGB estimation in two broad areas. First, using LTS allows for the filling of spatial and temporal data gaps in AGB predictions, improving the quality of AGB products and enabling the estimation of AGB across large areas and long time-periods. Second, studies have demonstrated that spectral information extracted from LTS analysis, including forest disturbance and recovery metrics, can significantly improve the accuracy of AGB models. Throughout the last decade, many innovative LTS-based approaches for estimating forest AGB dynamics across space and time have been demonstrated. A general trend is that methods have evolved as demonstrated through recent studies, becoming more advanced and robust. However, most of these methods have been developed and tested in areas that are either supported by established forest inventory programs and/or can rely on Lidar data across large forest areas. Further investigations should focus on tropical forest areas where inventory data are often not systematically available and/or out-of-date.

TI  - Mineral Identification and Mapping by Synthesis of Hyperspectral VNIR/SWIR and Multispectral TIR Remotely Sensed Data With Different Classifiers
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral data, which have fine continuous spectrum, have been recognized to be more suitable for the detailed identification and classification of land surface, especially for minerals. The combination of the hyperspectral visible/near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) data with the hyperspectral thermal infrared (TIR) data is proven to be an effective way. However, how those effects are and what are the effects of introduction of multispectral TIR data on the minerals identification and classification are not well studied. To fully evaluate those effects, this article tries to use both simulated data and real data to testify the practicability of introduction of multispectral TIR data for the accuracies of mineral identification and classification. Four classifiers, i.e., spectral angle mapping, spectral feature fitting, orthogonal subspace projection, and adaptive coherence/cosine estimator, are selected in the experiment. Compared with the results using hyperspectral data alone, the introducing of multispectral TIR data in identification and classification has improved accuracies for both the simulated and real data. The overall accuracies are improved about 4%-13% for the simulated data and about 1%-5% for the real data by using different classifiers. Those improvements prove that the spectral diagnosed characteristics in TIR region even for multispectral data help identify and classify minerals. Although the improvements for real data are not well obvious due to the low spatial resolution, the multispectral TIR data are still effective supplements for hyperspectral VNIR and SWIR data in mineral identification and classification.

TI  - HIV/AIDS in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
T2  - HIV/AIDS IN CHINA: EPIDEMIOLOGY, PREVENTION AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in the northwest was ranked sixth in the numbers of reported cases of (HIV) in China up to the end of December 2017. By that time, HIV had affected 0.23% of the total population (56,588 cases had been reported since 1995), the province with third highest cumulative incidence in China. The HIV epidemic in XUAR has similar features to other provinces where the use of non-sterile injecting equipment by people who inject drugs (PWID) generated the development of the epidemic. These similarities included age and gender distribution. The majority of people living with HIV (PLWH) were 20-39 years of age at diagnosis, and women made up 36.7% of reported cases. Sexual transmission was the major transmission route for both women (85.4%) and men (60%) as of 2017. The scale of sexual transmission for women was a specific feature of the epidemic in XUAR. Interventions have had a positive impact. From 2002 to 2017, there were reductions in the numbers of HIV infection, in all of the sentinel surveillance groups. The most significant reduction was among PWID. In 2002, 52.6% tested positive, while in 2017, only 8.15% tested positive. FSW and clients attending clinics for sexually transmitted infections had low prevalence of HIV infection, less than 1% consistently. Male-male sexual transmission is becoming an important transmission route-7.4% of sexual transmissions for men were from male-male sex, and the annual sero-conversion rate in this group was about 5% by 2017. The major challenges in addressing prevention is targeting and focusing interventions to meet the specific needs of ethnic groups and to further extend interventions into key populations at higher risk.

TI  - Characterizing Spatiotemporal Pattern of Vegetation Greenness Breakpoints on Tibetan Plateau Using GIMMS NDVI3g Dataset
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the harsh natural environment on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), its vegetation is sensitive to climate change. Therefore, it is essential to characterize long-term vegetation shifts for understanding of land surface processes across the TP. Gradual greening or browning growth in vegetation greenness is detectable while the alternating process between greening and browning, its timing, and type remain unclear. In this paper, breakpoint in time series of a satellite-derived vegetation index was detected at pixel-level during 1982-2012. The long-term growth procedure of vegetation was then characterized by combining the greening/browning trend for the two sub-periods, on each side of the breakpoint. The combinations of greening/browning status were classified into three categories (monotonic, interrupted and growth reversal). Possible causes for abrupt vegetation changes are discussed in the content of climate change and grassland management. Results show that breakpoints are temporally widely distributed and have significant spatial heterogeneity. About 21 & x0025; (11 & x0025;) of the vegetated area showed significant greening (browning) trends. Vegetation in central and eastern TP has tended to be greening. Browning trends were particularly evident in the southern and northeastern TP and were scarce in the west. About 32 & x0025; of the vegetation was found to change significantly in this analysis. Greening trends occurred more often than browning trends and exhibited both a monotonic and an interrupted growing process. Trend reversal in vegetation was dominated by declining trends. Breakpoints in monotonic and interrupted trends were concentrated in some time points, but those with reversal trends were discretely distributed over time span. Among different ecosystem types, desert ecosystems presented the most significant greening trends, accounting for 53 & x0025; of plant-covered desert. Conspicuous degraded trends were identified on alpine sparse vegetated area. Statistically, breakpoints in precipitation and air temperature are not consistent with those in vegetation greenness index. And grazing projects have not posed a significant effect on abrupt shifts in vegetation greenness.

AB  - This in this study, presents the shoreline position changes of Yanbu coastal zone from 1965 to 2109, using an attempt was made to elucidate the accreting and eroding sites from multitemporal and high-resolution satellite data and of the Yanbu coastline (1965-2019) using geospatial techniques coupled with the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) application. The rates of shoreline changes rates were calculated based on End Point Rate (EPR) Linear Regression Rate (LRR) and Weighted Linear Regression (WLR) and Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) statistical methods to assess the understand short and long term trends. The trend between successive shoreline pairs and between the oldest and the most recent shoreline. The total distance between the oldest and youngest shorelines are reported as Net Shoreline Movement (NSM The results reveal that over a period of 54 years, the overall average rates indicate an accretional trend of the shoreline. The maximum accretion reached was 1655.9 m (30.66, 32.32 and 36.9 m/year based on EPR, LRR and WLR methods respectively) (and is located in the King Fahd Industrial Port zone while the maximum erosion is recorded was in the Yanbu Waterfront area with about -1484.8 m (-37.9 m/year, -32.7 m/year and -33.5 m/year based on EPR, LRR and WLR methods respectively). The EPR (short-term changes) indicate changed trends on the Yanbu commercial port and various parts of the Yanbu Al Sinaiyah coast. An area of about 20 sq. km of sea and islets has been backfilled or dug in for various facilities. Thus, major changes in the configuration of the coastline are linked to human activities. This study provides a synoptic outlook of the degree of potential threat to the coastal system and their potential consequences, with a view to prioritizing actions and developing suitable adaptation.

AB  - Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is an important physical quantity of atmospheric turbidity and a key factor for the atmospheric correction of optical remote sensing image. Several approaches have been developed to retrieve AOD from remote sensing data, and at ground level the sunphotometer is usually used to measure AOD. However, the sunphotometer is expensive and not portable for field campaign, which make it difficult to synchronously obtain AOD data along with other relevant measurement. In order to overcome this problem, this study proposed a new way to estimate AOD using Ground-measured Spectral Skylight Ratio method (GSSR) on the basis that skylight ratio is highly determined by such parameter. In the GSSR method, a look-up table (LUT) containing spectral skylight ratio in 400-1000nm was first established from the MODTRAN code under various AOD levels, solar zenith angles (SZA), and atmospheric types. Based on the LUT and actual skylight ratio measured from a ground spectrometer, the AOD was then determined using a shortest distance between the measurement and the spectral values in the LUT. Finally, the AOD derived from the GSSR method was validated using the AOD data from the CE318 sunphotometer data, and it was found that AOD error was about 0.0185, which demonstrated that the GSSR method can be used to estimate AOD accurately, and can be regarded as an alternative method to estimate AOD in the field work if no sunphotometer is available.

AB  - The Tianwan nuclear power plant located in Jiangsu province of China discharges warm water from its cooling system into the Yellow Sea and may cause ecological consequences. In this study, the sea surface temperature changes before and after the operation of the Tianwan nuclear power plant was studied by using Landsat data. After retrieving the sea surface temperature near Tianwan nuclear power plant, the datum temperature was firstly extracted. Consequently, the thermal pollution value was calculated. Finally, the area distribution maps of different temperature rise levels were analyzed. The results showed that there was no obvious thermal pollution before the nuclear power plant was put into use. Since the commercial operation of the nuclear power plant, the thermal pollution appears around the nuclear power plant. In the following years, the distribution area of thermal drainage has increased. The area of warm temperature pollution at the + 1 degrees C level was the largest in every year.

TI  - Return to the 1960s: the Role of '68 in Paul Auster's Life and Work
T2  - REVUE LISA-LISA E-JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay explores the impact of 1968 on Paul Auster's life and work. Its main analytical focus is on Auster's critique of the anti-authoritative ethos of his generation in the early fictional autobiography Moon Palace (1989), but it draws comparisons to his later work as well, including 4 3 21 (2017) and the autobiographies Hand to Mouth (1997) and Report from the Interior (2013). Auster's participation in the 1968 student uprising and his subsequent witnessing of the radicalization of the student movement have resulted in an authorial stance on '68 that is marked by ambivalence and hindsight bias. Auster's early letters show that Auster subscribed to a Marxist worldview before '68, that his experiences in April changed him, and that he has since assumed center-left position in his prose work. Originally founded on Merleau-Ponty's post-Cartesian philosophy, this position enables Auster to remain sympathetic to the egalitarian and antiwar causes of the Left, but critical of the general rejection of authorities that so characterized the late 1960s. The essay concludes that Moon Palace can be read as an appeal for the depolarization of the American political past.

AB  - The main aim of this study is to propose a Deep Learning framework approach for Urban area classification. The research proposes a multilevel Deep Learning architecture to detect the Urban/Non-Urban Area. The support models/parameters of the structure are Support Vector Machine (SVM), convolution of (Neural Networks) NN, high resolution sentinel 2 data, and several texture parameters. The experiments were conducted for the study region Lucknow which is a fast-growing metropolis of India, using Sentinel 2 satellite data of spatial resolution 10-m. The performance observed by the proposed ensembles of CNNs outperformed those of current state of art machine algorithms viz; SVM, Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). It was observed that our Proposed Approach (PA) furnished the maximum classification accuracy of 96.24%, contrasted to SVM (65%), ANN (84%) and RF (88%). Several statistical parameters namely accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision and AUC, have been evaluated for examining performance during training and validation phase of the models.

AB  - Globalization, economic development of China and growth of cultural and language contacts altogether promote the increase in the acts of intercultural communication. Verbal communication with the representatives of Chinese society enjoins on accounting ethnical psychology, which plays a highly significant role for all kinds of communication in China, including contacts in legal field, in particular drafting legal documents. In the process of verbal communication, the following distinctive features of Chinese ethnical identity must be taken into account: historicism, traditionalism, pragmatism, collective consciousness, syncretism, stability. The research proves that peculiarities of ethnopsychological consciousness determine specific features of drawing up legal documents, which makes the culturological approach essential for comparing language means of expressing legal notions in Chinese and Russian variants of business letters. In the course of research, linguoculturological analysis of Chinese business letters is being carried out: various linguoculturological components of legal field in official documents are investigated and ethnoculturogical peculiarities of communication in legal sphere are discovered. Lexical, grammatical and stylistic features of the texts of legal documents in Russian and Chinese are also considered in the research. Efficiency of Russian-Chinese communication in the legal field is fulfilled through a rather clear structure, words and phrases, where the parties explain their goals and intentions. We believe that achieving effective communication is only possible when there is no "notional ambiguity", dubiousness in legal documents, and when the text is brief and clear. It is the correctly built up text of the document that becomes the main tool for effective communication. (C) 2020 Published by European Publisher.

TI  - AN ALGORITHM OF THE INITIAL APPROXIMATION FORMATION IN THE IONOSPHERIC TOMOGRAPHY PROBLEM WITH INTER-SATELLITE DATA REGISTRATION
T2  - ST PETERSBURG POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY JOURNAL-PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the paper, an original approach to the formation of the initial approximation in the ionospheric tomography problem with inter-satellite registration of total electron content is presented. The direct Radon transform of the electron density (ED)'s orbital profile is proposed to approximate using convolution of the function of latitudinal distribution of ED's maximum in the profile with the kernel function. This approximation makes it possible to estimate the latitude distribution of the ED maximum from the total electron content measurements by the deconvolution procedure. An analytical expression of the convolution kernel was obtained. Based on the proposed approach, two variants of formation of the initial approximation which used different prior information, namely, on the solar activity index and on the height of the ionization maximum in the profile, were considered. An accuracy of the mentioned formation was analyzed by the results of statistical simulation, and it was compared with the previously known approach where both the height of the ionization maximum in the profile and ED at this height were known.

AB  - Rockfalls clusters can be systematic monitored using many different in situ or remote sensing methods: topographical survey measurements with total stations or GPS, mapping with terrestrial laser or photogrammetry using airphotos or high resolution satellite images. As the costs of the aerial photo campaign and the acquisition of very high resolution satellite data are quite expensive the use of cameras on board Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) could be an identical solution for repeated campaigns and systematic monitoring of a rockfall. During the last years UAVs have proved their efficiency for remote sensing monitoring of small areas. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate a cheap but effective solution for an active rockfall monitoring. We present the first experimental results of the synergistic use of UAV and GPS measurements for a rockfall monitoring in Zachlorou village near to the city of Kalavrita, Western Greece. Three UAV flights with RGB, multispectral and thermal cameras were performed. Very accurate digital airphotos, high accuracy DSM and thermal mosaics were produced and the results are presented in the current study.

AB  - The article considers slang as an ideological sign and a sublanguage unit capable of expanding its meaning due to semantic refraction, and also proposes a structural and semantic description of slangisms and proves the idea that they, as a means of metaphorizing a language, endow the utterance with additional meaningful veils, not only affecting its information filling and imagery, but also reflecting the author's individuality, contribute to its emotional and expressive enrichment while maintaining the basic conceptual center, albeit semantically blurred. Observation shows: the more perceptible the semantic bi-planarity of the sublanguage, the more informative the syntaxeme that includes it, respectively, during the functioning of slangism, expressive informativeness is embodied in semantic and emotional increments that affect both the rational-logical and expressive-figurative content of the context. However, regardless of the contextual conditions, the preponderance in the meaning of the described units is always on the side of the expressive-emotional components, accompanied by linguistic veils, focused on pragmatic impact, since it contains an internal suggestive force directed at the communicant. Speech influence in the indicated constructions is performed through the formation and transmission of the author's "I", which makes it possible for the "creator of the text" to reveal the nuances of the meanings of dependent elements and, through a variant change in their positions, expand the boundaries of the subtext. This makes the sublanguage a convenient verbal form of ideology expression, representing the worldview of a person, regulating his upbringing, forming habits, orienting social behavior and reflecting the volume of cultural memory.

CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVI
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - This research is focused on registering the movements along the slope of the several slopes located on south-west of the mountain Stara Planina and establishing their average annual values. Currently at national level there are a low number of studies targeted at operational monitoring of the investigated slopes. These objects are quite specific for research since those kind of natural phenomena are inaccessible by other means or are quite dangerous to be investigated. On the other hand, the moving slopes are causing damages to infrastructural objects such as roads, bridges or power lines. Their behavior is difficult to forecast and for this reason they can be considered as natural hazards. Obtaining precise data for the single slope movements is done by in-situ investigations such as geodetic acquisitions, terrestrial laser scanning, and geological observations, which all require financial resources and human effort. For this reason, we used remotely sensed data from satellite based SAR instruments processed using the DInSAR method in order to analyze the motions of single slope and to establish a technique for the investigation of mountain slopes. An advantage of the selected method is the possibility to register the vertical movements of the whole slope with centimeter accuracy. This approach is based on the free access to the SAR data and tools for their thematic processing provided by ESA. In this study an emphasis is put on the manner how the obstacles encountered during the interferometric processing (e.g. presence of vegetation or topography) have been overcome. From the downloaded set of SAR images covering the region created were two multitemporal InSAR data series from ascending and descending orbits of the satellite. The results from the autumn-winter pairs exhibited good correlation with the expected displacements along the studied slope having a magnitude of 0.8 m.

TI  - <i>The Myth of the Given</i> today: Perspectives of realistic epistemology
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA I KONFLIKTOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the reception of Wilfrid Sellars's The Myth of the Given. The Problem consists in the ontological status of reality and the possibility of empirical knowledge. The ideas of well-known representatives of modern analytical epistemology are analyzed: J. Searle, H. Putnam, J. McDowell, G. Evans, C. Peacocke, W. Child, T. Rockmore, etc. An attempt is made in the article to show that The Myth of the Given is losing its relevance in modern humanistic realism where the world is already becoming a symbolic construct within the epistemological framework. Experience as such is no longer deemed as a linguistic phenomenon in modern epistemology. Sellars's argumentation is convincing only if universalism, in terms of the interpretation of experience and reality, is criticized from the standpoint of radical pluralism of epistemological theories. In this case, indeed, no "Given" exists, viewed as a correlation between the substance of Sensitivity and the only possible world of Reality. It is illustrated that modern analytical epistemology is an arena of competition between two leading positions in the interpretation of the world: externalism and internalism. Despite the contradiction between these theoretical positions, they are in accord in recognizing a pluralistic worldview, which is, moreover, of a "humanistic" nature. These theories address neither "the given" nor "the world of facts". The main trouble with The Myth of the Given is the lack of criteria of objectivity in any act of experience.

TI  - Vasily Zhukovsky and Friedrich Wilhelm von Schadow: Based on Materials From the Painter's Unpublished Letters
T2  - IMAGOLOGIYA I KOMPARATIVISTIKA-IMAGOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents, for the first time, an attempt to reconstruct the context and the object of creative contacts of Vasily Zhukovsky and Friedrich Wilhelm von Schadow (1788-1862), a theorist of painting and head of the Academy of Arts in Dusseldorf. The sources for the reconstruction were the previously unpublished eight letters by the German artist written in the period from 1838 to 1846 and now stored in the Manuscript Department of the Institute of Russian Literature and materials from the creative heritage of the Russian poet and artist. The article establishes new facts about the institutional role of Zhukovsky in the Russian-German cultural ties in the 19th century. Von Schadow gave some of his paintings in the original, in copies or prints for Zhukovsky' s personal collection and for the imperial collection of the future Hermitage. The list of these paintings is, for the first time, compiled in the article. The textual material is illustrated with images from von Schadow's works discussed in the epistolary dialogue. Von Schadow's published manifestos on the theory and criticism of Christian religious painting, which Zhukovsky read and which influenced his artistic worldview in the 1840s, are attributed. The article presents, for the first time, the most significant fragments from von Schadow's letters of 1838-1845 translated into Russian. The fragments fill in the gaps in the objective representation of the scale of Zhukovsky' s activities at court on compiling a collection of Russian paintings both in the institutional and ideological artistic aspects. At the same time, the communication between the German artist and the Russian poet found reflection in Zhukovsky's creative heritage of the late period: in his criticism, works on art theory, prose, and reflections. Von Schadow, in his last letters, and Zhukovsky, in his diary entries, pay special attention to reflections on pedagogical activities and works on the theory of fine arts, as well as on their social and political activities. The parable of the prodigal son was the fmal touch in the creative dialogue of the poet and the artist. Zhukovsky reflected this parable in his unfinished poem about the Wandering Jew. The lines of the poem paint in words fragments from the Sacred History quite in the spirit of von Schadow's paintings: Zhukovsky compares the Wandering Jew who ascended Calvary with the prodigal son and depicts the holistic canvas of the inner and outer space of the character through his eyes. The conclusion is made that the discovered letters from von Schadow to Zhukovsky reveal the adherence of the both to the lofty romantic idea of a synthesis of arts based on the poetics of heartfelt feelings, artistic imagination, active teaching, and religious and mystical experience. Fine arts, science and history, issues of faith and politics of the mid-19th century were a background for the concentration of the correspondents on the rethinking of substantial religious and philosophical issues on the material of eternal biblical plots on the entombment of Christ, taking Christ down from the cross, on reasonable and unreasonable maidens, and, finally, on two parables about the lost sheep and the prodigal son, which became the ultimate embodiment of the dialogue of a poet and an artist in fine arts.

TI  - PRIESTHOOD AND TSARDOM AS VIEWED BY SIBERIAN METROPOLITAN IGNATII (RIMSKY-KORSAKOV)
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Relations between the Orthodox Church and the tsardom of Muscovy in the second half of the seventeenth century have become one of the most important issues of the Church and social agenda. However, the views of the Great Russian episcopate and the degree of their connection with the declarations and claims of the leaders of the Russian Church in the pre-Petrine era remain little-studied. The author suggests that the ideological attitudes at the beginning of Alexei Mikhailovich's reign and during the reforms of Patriarch Nikon forged the world-view of a generation of Russian bishops, including that of Ignatii (Rimsky-Korsakov) (died in 1701), metropolitan of Tobolsk and Siberia, a famous church leader, religious writer, and thinker. The author examines the bishop's activity as that of a bearer of both a traditional and innovative worldview in order to correctly assess Ignaties striving for change and acceptance of innovation. The article refers to a number of works (including unpublished ones) and the bishop's activities in order to reconstruct the metropolitan's views on church-state relations, According to the concept of the "Byzantine (Constantinople) heritage" and philhellenic ideas, lgnatii put priesthood over tsardom in origin, sought the complete independence of the church court, and strove to expand the role of the Church in public life, At the same time, he emphasised the responsibility of royal power to take care of the Church, lgnatii directly writes about tsars' duty to render "reverence and obedience" to the patriarch. An analysis of the Tobolsk bishop's views demonstrates their closeness to those of many figures in the Russian Church at the time, such as patriarchs Nikon, Joachim, and Adrian, philhellenic writers, etc. The views of the higher clergy on the relationship between priesthood and tsardom were new in comparison with the tradition of the sixteenth and first half of the seventeenth centuries, and the officials of the young Tsar Peter were more likely to follow the traditional policy of subordinating the Church to the state, The author concludes that it was precisely the understanding by bishops of the Church's place and role in the tsardom of Muscovy that caused Peter 1 to completely replace Russians in the episcopate with candidates front the Kiev metropolia.

T2  - CURRENT CANCER DRUG TARGETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Selinexor is an oral Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export compound that specifically blocks Chromosomal Region Maintenance protein 1.Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of selinexor plus 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.Methods: In this multicenter phase I trial, mCRC patients, eligible for oxaliplatin-based treatment, were enrolled to receive oral selinexor on days 1, 3, and 8 plus mFOLFOX6 every two weeks. Primary endpoint was the maximum tolerated dose. Secondary endpoints were toxicity, overall response rate, progression free survival, and overall survival.Results: Overall, 10 patients were enrolled, who had prior treatment with oxaliplatin (6/10), irinotecan (8/10), bevacizumab (6/10) or anti-EGFR therapy (5/10). Four consecutive patients received 40 mg selinexor plus mFOLFOX6. All four experienced dose-limiting toxicities and withdrew from the study after a median of two cycles. Thus, this dose level was regarded as toxic and no further patients were evaluated at this dose. Six patients were enrolled with 20 mg selinexor plus mFOLFOX6. Despite better tolerability, four patients withdrew (patient wish) after the first cycle and only two patients continued until disease progression. Most commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events were nausea (80%), diarrhea (70%), vomiting (60%), fatigue (60%), anorexia (40%), and impaired vision (40%). Due to the short treatment exposure, no relevant clinical activity was observed.Conclusion: In patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, selinexor on this dose schedule plus mFOLFOX6 was not tolerable. Other dosing schedules or combinations may be evaluated.

TI  - A GIS-Based Approach in Drainage and Morphometric Analysis of Suvarnavathi River Basin and Sub-watersheds, Karnataka, India
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present case study describes the morphometric analysis and its influence on the hydrology of the Suvarnavathi river basin and its sub-watersheds. ALOS DEM is used to extract slope and drainage layers while GIS software is used in the evaluation of linear, areal and relief aspects of morphometric parameters for 13 subwatersheds of the entire river catchment area. The dendritic drainage pattern of the basin reveals moderate slopes while sub-parallel pattern shows high relief and structural control, especially along the 7th order trunk river of the basin. The circularity ratio, elongation ratio and form factor represent that the elongated study area is in the youth stage of basin development. Sub-watersheds belonging to high relief and slope show high bifurcation ratio and drainage density indicating areas under structural control. Whereas variation in values indicate the difference in topography. Stream frequency of all sub-watersheds shows a positive correlation with drainage density due to the hard rock lithological structures which reveals that the surface area has moderate permeability and groundwater potential is meagre. These studies are useful to mark the groundwater potential zone and artificial recharge area and plan for watershed management.

TI  - The 2014 Mw 6.1 Ludian Earthquake: The Application of RADARSAT-2 SAR Interferometry and GPS for this Conjugated Ruptured Event
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the Zhaotong-Ludian fault is a seismically active zone located in the boundary between the Sichuan-Yunnan block and the South China block, it has not experienced a large earthquake greater than Mw 7 since at least 1700. On 3 August, 2014, an Mw 6.1 earthquake (the Ludian earthquake) ruptured the Zhaotong active belt in Ludian County, Yunnan province, China. This earthquake was the largest earthquake recorded in the region since 2000, and it provides us with a unique opportunity to study the active tectonics in the region. The analysis of the aftershocks showed that two conjugate faults could have been involved in the event. We first used Global Positioning System (GPS) data and C-band RADARSAT-2 imagery to map the coseismic surface deformation. We then inverted the derived coseismic deformation for the slip distribution based on the constructed conjugate fault model. Finally, the coulomb failure stress due to the Ludian earthquake was estimated to investigate the potential seismic hazards in this region. Our investigations showed that the Ludian earthquake was mainly a bilateral rupture event. The major slip of the main shock was located at depths of 0-5 km, which is close but does not superpose with the aftershocks that are mostly located at depths of 5-20 km. Interestingly, the seismic moment released by the aftershocks (6.9 x 10(18) N.m) was greater than that of the main shock (2.6 x 10(18) N.m). This evidence suggests that the accumulated elastic strain at depths of 0-20 km could have been fully released by the Ludian earthquake and its subsequent aftershocks. Furthermore, our analysis of the coulomb failure stress changes due to the main shock showed that the aftershocks could be the result of dynamic triggering rather than static triggering.

TI  - A potential application of height-dependent cloud emission and scattering indices for identifying CrIS clear channels above clouds
T2  - TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data assimilation of hyperspectral Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) clear channels in regions with but not affected by low-level clouds requires a set of height-dependent cloud emission and scattering indices (CESIs) that are sensitive to cloud top pressures. In this study, three CESIs are generated by pairing CrIS longwave and shortwave channels at three altitudes around 212 (CESI-5), 452 (CESI-9) and 1085 hPa (CESI-19). The training dataset for CESIs is the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting analysis. CESI-5 is strongly (weakly) affected by those ice clouds with cloud-top pressures (CTPs) above (below) similar to 300 hPa; CESI-9 is strongly (weakly) affected by those ice clouds with CTPs above (below) similar to 600 hPa; and CESI-19 is highly correlated with the ice cloud optical depth (ICOD) obtained from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) retrieval product. CESIs have latitudinal and scan-dependent biases that need removal. Verified with AIRS ICOD data, CESI-19 is greater than 5 K (6.5 K) if an ice cloud is present. This 5-K threshold gives a probability of correct typing of 85.3% (86.5%), a false alarm rate of 9.5% (5.1%) and a leakage rate of 4.5% (5.0%) during the daytime (nighttime). CESI-5 (CESI-9) is greater than -3 K (-1 K) if an ice cloud is present above 200 hPa (between 200 and 300 hPa). The case of Typhoon Maria (2018) demonstrates the potential of using height-dependent CESIs to identify above-cloud CrIS clear channels.

TI  - Management of clinically node-negative groin in patients with penile cancer
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Malignant penile neoplasms are commonly squamous etiology, with the inguinal nodes being the first echelon of spread. The disease spreads to the pelvic lymph nodes only after metastases to the groin nodes, and this is the most important prognostic factor in penile carcinoma. While treatment of penile carcinoma with proven metastases to the inguinal lymph nodes mandates ilioinguinal lymph node dissection, the treatment of patients with impalpable nodes is more controversial. Overtreatment leads to excessive treatment-related morbidity in these patients, while a wait-and-see policy runs the risk of patients presenting with inguinal and distant metastases, which would have been curable at presentation. Unfortunately, no single imaging modality has been proved to be convincingly superior in the staging, and hence, management of the clinically negative groin has been subject to debate. While some high volume centers have promoted the use of dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy, others advocate the use of the modified inguinal lymph node template to stage the groin adequately. Newer techniques such as video endoscopic inguinal lymph node dissection have been introduced as an alternative to the original radical inguinal lymphadenectomy to reduce morbidity.

TI  - Integrated Cross-Sectional Multiplex Serosurveillance of IgG Antibody Responses to Parasitic Diseases and Vaccines in Coastal Kenya
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and cost-effective identification of areas where co-endemic infections occur would enable public health managers to identify opportunities for implementation of integrated control programs. Dried blood spots collected during cross-sectional lymphatic filariasis surveys in coastal Kenya were used for exploratory integrated detection of IgG antibodies against antigens from several parasitic infections (Wuchereria bancrofti, Schistosoma mansoni, Plasmodium spp., Ascaris lumbricoides, and Strongyloides stercoralis) as well as for detection of responses to immunizing agents used against vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) (measles, diphtheria, and tetanus) using a multiplex bead assay (MBA) platform. High heterogeneity was observed in antibody responses by pathogen and antigen across the sentinel sites. Antibody seroprevalence against filarial antigens were generally higher in Ndau Island (P < 0.0001), which also had the highest prevalence of filarial antigenemia compared with other communities. Antibody responses to the Plasmodium species antigens circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1)(19) were higher in Kilifi and Kwale counties, with Jaribuni community showing higher overall mean seroprevalence (P < 0.0001). Kimorigo community in Taita-Taveta County was the only area where antibody responses against S. mansoni Sm25 recombinant antigen were detected. Seroprevalence rates to Strongyloides antigen NIE ranged between 3% and 26%, and there was high heterogeneity in immune responses against an Ascaris antigen among the study communities. Differences were observed between communities in terms of seroprevalence to VPDs. Seroprotection to tetanus was generally lower in Kwale County than in other counties. This study has demonstrated that MBA holds promise for rapid integrated monitoring of trends of infections of public health importance in endemic areas.

TI  - Husserl and the <i>Allsubjektivitat</i>'s point of view.
T2  - TEORIA-RIVISTA DI FILOSOFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - To appreciate the significance of phenomenological idealism as traditionally unprecedented, I shall provide a clarification of the too often overlooked notion of Allsubjektivitat. Husserl's effort to resolve classical philosophical oppositions - such as those between naive objectivism and psychological subjectivism, theory and practice, etc. - results in the idea of transcendental (all) subjectivity's self-explication (Selbstauslegung). I will argue that, on closer inspection, Husserl's idealism does not consist in a metaphysical worldview but, rather, it coincides with the accomplishment of a concrete task, according to which true being emerges as a practical idea of cooperative determination. Indeed, the procedure of Auslegung reveals how the tension among the world, the I and the others coalesces and how a higher degree of self-awareness (Selbstbesinnung) amounts to a correlative boost in human self-responsibility (Selbstverantwortung) for reason's achievements.

AB  - This paper explores the ecological worldview in Inca's myth and then examines how the worldview is being implemented in Latin America and what its ethics educational implications are. Rainforest Amazon commonly referred to as the lungs of the Earth, Rio de Janeiro of Brazil which declared 27principles on environment and development, the world's first new constitution to recognize the living rights of nature in Ecuador, and the world's first Mother Earth Law in Bolivia which stipulates the rights of nature, are closely related to the Inca mythology and eco-friendly community. And this paper first revealed the prototype of ecological thinking of harmony and cooperation, circular worldview, natural respect, and symbiosis between humans and animals in the Inca mythology. And it argues the ecophilosophical meanings of sumak Kawsay and the implications of Inca myth in ethics education.

AB  - Soil erosion in fired areas is one of the main environmental problem involves degrading the quality of the soil and reducing the productivity of the affected lands. The aim of this work is to implement a procedure that analyzes the change detection of the potential soil eroded in a burned area, and discriminate the amount of potential soil loss. As part of the MESARIP project (in agreement with the Regional Civil Protection) in order to implement the analyses of soil erosion pre and post fire event, using Sentinel 2 data and with the RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) method in a GIS open source environment, a graphical model has been developed. The application of the RUSLE requires a series of consequential spatial analysis elaborations and, according to this scheme, the model has been developed with the Graphical Modeler. QGIS contains in a single environment a multiplicity of tools and algorithms native to other open source GIS software, such as, for example, SAGA GIS and GRASS GIS. The user interface is very simple and requires basic and thematic input data such as DEM, MASK areas or vegetation indices etc. The advantages in the construction of the model can be identified in the standardization of map algebra operations and also in the speed of execution of the steps. Currently the model has been tested in some burned areas in 2019 located in the northern part of the Apulia Region and will be tested in operational mode during the 2020 summer season.

AB  - Coast of Kuala Terengganu is one of the areas subjected to significant shoreline changes in Malaysia. It believed that human activities became one of the causes of this incident. In January 2008, the government of Malaysia approved to upgrade Sultan Mahmud Airport located near Kuala Terengganu coast included improvement to the terminal and runway extension. Due to coastal erosion in the area, in 2015 the government took several actions, including constructing waves breaker around the affected area. This study focuses on detection the shoreline change along the coast of Kuala Terengganu before and after construction during 15 years periods 2003 until 2017 based LANDSAT Images. Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) is an extension for ArcGIS with statistical parameters Linear Regression Rate (LRR) used to identify and measure coastline retreat (Erosion) and advance (Accretion) along the coast. From the analysis, the action will take better information disclosure, and state government can take action to control the coastline changer. Environmental impact assessment benefits occur in many guises, such as improved project design and enhanced decision making.

AB  - Productions of rice in Malaysia is less compared to other rice producers such as Thailand. One of the reasons is lack of management in weeds. Losses due to weeds must be solved in rice production system, they interfere with the activities involved in the field throughout crop growing period. The main problem in rice field is to detect the presence of weeds among the paddy plant. It is hard to detect from plain sight for weeds in the green field by farmers. This research developed a technique to detect and control the weeds in the rice field. Spectral signature of weeds was collected and stored in the mobile apps for weed management application. The spectral signature of weeds species is unique and has their own characteristics. It can be used as a reference on how to detect weeds in the rice field using remote sensing. In this study, the result outcomes are mainly targeting to help all the paddy farmers in Malaysia to increase their production numbers of paddy. In addition, paddy farmers will be introduced with much advance technique to spot on the weeds that have been infesting in their paddy field and can prepare with what strategy to control on different kind of weeds. Different weed species has different physiological characteristics and it requires different type of strategy to counter the growth in the paddy field. Every weed in the paddy field need to be recognized in order to plan a control strategy. By using only naked eyes of a human and the limited view through the side view of the paddy field contributes to the problem of recognizing type of weeds that infesting the area.

TI  - PATRONYMIC AS A SYMBOL OF RUSSIAN CULTURE
T2  - VOPROSY ONOMASTIKI-PROBLEMS OF ONOMASTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper discusses the place of patronymic in the Russian anthroponymicon and the evolution of its functions in modern society. The functional aspect is studied using examples from fiction and journalism, a significant part of the factual material being retrieved from the National Corpus of the Russian language and ( for comparative purposes) from the Czech National Corpus. Apparently, the use or avoidance of patronymic in Russianlanguage communication has important sociolinguistic and pragmatic implications. Using a patronymic, the speaker can manage group relationships and regulate the development of conversation. The article considers specific communicative situations such as wishing to hide an unpleasant or "dangerous" patronymic, omission of patronymic in creative circles (musicians, artists, actors, etc.), addressing "only by patronymic," etc. A particular focus is made on the perception of the Russian patronymic name in a foreign language context (cases of adaptation, omission, transformation of a patronymic, etc). On the functional side, patronymics may denote nationality (seen as a particularly "Russian" trait) and patronymic relation per se (by referring to the father and patriarchal culture). They can be a sign of maturity (as a designation of a grown-up person), status (position in society), and respect. Likewise, they can be used for differentiation (distinguishing namesake people) or concealing (disguising the true family background). The authors also analyze the use of the patronymic-based word-formation pattern for creating nicknames, brand and product names (pragmatonyms), and company names (ergonyms). The latter cases (the Erofeich liqueur, Sam Samych dumplings, Semyonovna seeds, Petrovich building materials store, etc.) may attest to a positive connotation the patronymic has in the Russian worldview.

TI  - Response of the Polar Urals glaciers to the modern climate changes
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of glacier mass balance is usually focused on analysis of middle and large glaciers, so small glaciers on the verge of extinction remain out of the attention of researchers. Studies of glaciers of the Polar Urals, begun in the mid-twentieth century, present in this respect interesting information. The series of observations of them is the longest among other glaciers of the mountainous regions of the Russian mainland in the polar latitudes. New results of quantitative assessment of changes in the size and mass balance of glaciers in this region are presented. To estimate the geodetic balance of the IGAN Glacier, data from photogeodetic surveys of 1963, data of ground-based DGPS surveys of 2008 and 2018 together with a fragment of the digital elevation model (DEM) of the ArcticDEM v3.0 of 2016 were used. Using these data, the DEM of its surface was calculated as of 1963, 2008, and 2018, and the changes in the glacier volume were estimated for the period from 1963 to 2018, during which the glacier had lost 19.7 million m(3) of ice, of which 3.2 million m(3) were lost in the last decade. The average decrease in the surface height was 18.94 +/- 3.22 m, and the maximum - 53.5 +/- 1.0 m. In 1963-2008, the specific massbalance was equal to -317 +/- 59 mm w.e./year, while in 2008-2018 -336 +/- 61 mm/year. Estimation of changes in the size of 30 glaciers of the Polar Urals made from images of the Sentinel-2 satellite had shown that in 2000-2018 the glaciers lost 2.02 km(2) (about 28%) of the area. In comparison with the period of 1953-2000, the average annual rate of reduction of their area doubled and amounted to 0.112 km(2)/year (1.54%/year). Magnitudes of the reduction of individual glaciers are not identical. Within the selection of 30 glaciers, they vary from 7.1% (the Terentyev Glacier) to 61.1% (the Oleniy Glacier). The analysis of changes in temperature and precipitation in 2000-2018 allows us making the conclusion that the reason for the accelerated reduction of glaciers in the Polar Urals in these years is the rise of summer air temperature since beginning of the twentieth century by 1.5 degrees C, to which the lowering of winter precipitation was added in the last decade.

TI  - Student-Reported Attitudes during an Interprofessional Palliative Care Learning Experience: Implications for Dual-Professional Identity, Interdisciplinary Bias, and Patient Outcomes
T2  - PALLIATIVE MEDICINE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The geriatric population in the United States is in need of palliative care (PC), yet it is not consistently established in the curriculum across health care training programs. There is a clarion call to reform the education of health care students using interprofessional education (IPE). The Joint Commission reported that communication errors represent two-thirds of the causes behind provider sentinel events in health care. Objective: The purpose of this study was to design, implement, and assess an IPE curriculum on PC to understand interprofessional student attitudes. Design/Setting: Three professors conducted a mixed-methods study at a California university involving an IPE PC event for 40 nursing and speech-language pathology students, and administered the Interprofessional Attitudes Survey (IPAS) and reflective questions. Results: Qualitative findings indicated that students increased their knowledge about PC and the purpose/value of IPE. Four out of the five IPAS subscales had positive outcomes: teamwork and roles/responsibilities, patient-centeredness, diversity/ethics, and community-centeredness. Interprofessional-biases subscale revealed that 33% of the participants reported biases toward students from other health care disciplines, and 35% reported that students from other health care disciplines held similar biases toward them. However, only 25% did not believe that the interdisciplinary biases interfered with patient outcomes. Conclusion: The study identified the existence of interprofessional biases and prejudices that may impede collaboration among health care professionals resulting in reduced health care outcomes. Faculty and health educators are encouraged to embed IPE into a multidisciplinary curriculum that dismantles preexisting interdisciplinary biases and stereotypes, and constructs dual-professional identity.

TI  - Mapping Recent Shoreline Changes Spanning the Lateral Collapse of Anak Krakatau Volcano, Indonesia
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - We use satellite imagery to investigate the shoreline changes associated with volcanic activity in 2018-2019 at Anak Krakatau, Indonesia, spanning a major lateral collapse and period of regrowth through explosive activity. The shoreline changes have been analyzed and validated through the adaptation of an existing methodology based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery and developed on Google Earth Engine. This work tests the results of this method in a highly dynamic volcanic environment and validates them with manually digitized shorelines. The analysis shows that the size of the Anak Krakatau Island increased from 2.84 km(2) to 3.19 km(2) during 15 May 2018-1 November 2019 despite the loss of area in the 22 December 2018 lateral collapse. The lateral collapse reduced the island area to similar to 1.5 km(2) but this was followed by a rapid increase in area in the first two months of 2019, reaching up to 3.27 km(2). This was followed by a period of little change as volcanic activity declined and then by a net decrease from May 2019 to 1 November 2019 that resulted from erosion on the SW side of the island. This history of post-collapse eruptive regrowth and coastal erosion derived from the shoreline changes illuminates the potential for satellite-based automated shoreline mapping to provide databases for monitoring remote island volcanoes.

AB  - Water depth is an important measure for nautical charts. Accurate methods to provide water depth information are expensive and time costing. For this reason, since late 70's, it started to be estimate by multispectral sensors with empirical models. In the literature there is no investigation using empirical models partitioned in depth intervals, for this reason, we evaluated the accuracy of partitioned and single bathymetric models. The results have shown that to retrieve depth in from 0 to 15 m the single model provided an RMSE of 3.57 m, with a bias of about -0.83 m; while the RMSE for the partitioned model was 2.29 in with a bias of 0.41 in. For updating nautical charts using multispectral sensors it was concluded that the partitioned model can provide a better result than using a single model.

TI  - EFFECTS OF FAR-INFRARED EMITTING CERAMIC MATERIALS ON RECOVERY DURING 2-WEEK PRESEASON OF ELITE FUTSAL PLAYERS
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the effects of far-infrared emitting ceramic materials (cFIR) during overnight sleep on neuromuscular, biochemical and perceptual markers in futsal players. Twenty athletes performed a 2-week preseason training program and during sleep wore bioceramic (BIO; n = 10) or placebo pants (PL; n = 10). Performance (countermovement jump [CMJ]; squat jump [SJ]; sprints 5, 10, and 15-m) and biochemical markers (tumor necrosis factor alpha-TNF-alpha, interleukin 10-IL-10, thiobarbituric acid-reactive species [TBARS], carbonyl, superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT]) were obtained at baseline and after the 1st and 2nd week of training. Delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and training strain were monitored throughout. Changes in Delta CMJ and Delta SJ were possibly (60/36/4 [week-1]) and likely (76/22/2 [week-2]) higher in BIO. Both groups were faster in 5-m sprint in week 2 compared with baseline (p = 0.015), furthermore, BIO was likely faster in 10-m sprint (3/25/72 [week 1]). Significant group x time interaction in %Delta TNF-alpha were observed (p = 0.024 [week-1]; p = 0.021 [week-2]) with values possibly (53/44/3 [week 1]) and likely (80/19/1 [week 2]) higher in BIO. The %Delta IL-10 decreased across weeks compared with baseline (p = 0.019 [week-1]; p = 0.026 [week-2]), showing values likely higher in BIO (81/16/3 [week-1]; 80/17/3 [week-2]). Significant weekly increases in %Delta TBARS (p = 0.001 [week-1]; p = 0.011 [week-2]) and %Delta Carbonyl (p = 0.002 [week-1]; p < 0.001 [week-2]) were observed compared with baseline, showing likely (91/5/4 [week-1]) and possibly (68/30/2 [week-2]) higher changes in BIO. Significant weekly decreases in %Delta SOD were observed compared with baseline (p = 0.046 [week 1]; p = 0.011 [week-2]), and between week 2 and week 1 (p = 0.021), in addition to significant decreases in %Delta CAT compared with baseline (p = 0.070 [week 1]; p = 0.012 [week 2]). Training strain (p = 0.021; very-likely [0/2/98]; week 1) and DOMS was lower in BIO (likely; 7 sessions) with differences over time (p = 0.001). The results suggest that the daily use of cFIR clothing could facilitate recovery, especially on perceptual markers during the early phases of an intensive training period.

AB  - In this study, the capability of polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements to monitor harsh coastal areas is addressed. A meaningful showcase is presented that refers to the Scottish Solway Firth (SF) wetlands, an important coastal ecosystem severely affected by extreme weather conditions. Experiments are undertaken on a pair of full-polarimetric (FP) C-band RadarSAT-2 SAR images collected over SF during July and November 2018 in order to both extract the coastal profile and to identify changes in the scattering behavior along the coastal strip. The results demonstrate the soundness of the proposed approach and the role played by FP SAR measurements to effectively support vulnerability and risk assessments in harsh coastal environments.

AB  - Green open space has an important role in the ecological balance of urban areas with a minimum area that must be approved by 30%. Jember City Region consists of Sumbersari, Kaliwates, and Patrang Sub-Districts which are designated as Regional Activity Centers with four main functions. The distribution of green open space in Jember City can be known quickly and accurately by using remote sensing imagery. The purpose of this study is to study and analyze the distribution of green open space in the city of Jember specifically in the Sub-Districts of Kaliwates, Sumbersari, and Patrang whether it has met the minimum requirement of green open space construction of 30% of the total area. The analysis carried out with the help of Landsat 8-OLI imagery recording 10 June 2018. The method used is the NDVI classification. The results showed that classification of land use using vegetation index is good because it can minimize errors. The total area of determined vegetation green space based on NDVI classification is 23.70 km(2) or around 24.5% of the total area.

CP  - SPIE Future Sensing Technologies Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Remote sensing has provided some water quality data that can be used to assess the suitability of water quality for cultivation. It is the main approach used to map seaweed farming. The aims of this study were to map the seaweed farming potential of the study area and calculate the amount of plastic waste likely to be produced from the use of plastic buoys in seaweed aquaculture. SPOT 6 and Sentinel 2 provide high and moderate resolution satellite imagery that can be used as primary data to map seaweed farming at fine and broad scales. ArcMap application was applied to analyse the vector data of water quality. Weighting and scoring were carried out to give value to the parameters for culture suitability. The plastic waste used as a buoy during cultivation is calculated based on primary data from field surveys. The results suggest that the simple analysis of high and moderate spatial resolution imagery with digitation on screen method can delineate seaweed farming areas efficiently. Furthermore, this method could be applied in the future to monitor the extent of seaweed farms and to predict the amount of plastic waste produced by seaweed farming activities.

AB  - The West Nusa Tenggara region is one of the areas that often experience drought in Indonesia. Mitigation and adaptation efforts for hydro-meteorological disasters must be carried out. The lack of observation data is one obstacle where the climate data in this region is incomplete. Satellite data such as TRMM 3B43 is one of the mainstays in estimating drought events both spatially and temporally. This study aims to estimate the incidence of drought temporally and spatially by using TRMM 3B43 input data and the method of determining drought with SPI. In determining the actual rainfall, the performance of TRMM 3B43 is quite good, especially in Bima and Kediri. However, TRMM 3B43 tends not to explain extreme wet weather events in the case of rainfall in Bima and Kediri. In case of the calculation of drought with SPI-3 with rainfall input data of TRMM 3B43 showing performance that is not too good in estimating drought events compared to SPI-3 with input data of observation data. This is probably because the performance of TRMM 3B43 is not good enough in estimating extreme wet conditions and because SPI uses gamma probabilities in estimating its drought conditions, so the distribution probability cannot explain that drought condition. For spatial case, TRMM 3B43 also is not enough to explain the occurrence of drought in the West Nusa Tenggara.

AB  - On July 29th, 2018 there was an earthquake of 6.4 magnitude occurred in Lombok Island, West Nusa Tenggara. The repercussions of the earthquake cause the area to deform. Deformation refers to any changes in the shape and size of an object. Hence the purpose of this research is to measure the deformation cause by the aforementioned earthquake in Lombok. The deformation calculation is conduct by using the SAR data from Sentinel-1A Satellite Imagery (Interferometric Wide Swath (IW)) using DInSAR method. The effect of deformation cause by an earthquake in Lombok based on DInSAR method is -0.001 m up to -0.134 m with the average -0.026 m and the image coherence is 0.32, with the range for coherence is 0 to 1. The small value of coherence cause by the vegetation density within the research area. The vegetation density will affect the imagery coherence value due to its movement and development thus effecting the backscatter. Hence, the deformation data situate within the vegetation density area will result less accurate data.

AB  - This research aims to model surface roughness for agricultural land using RADARSAT-2 satellite imagery. To obtain the model of surface roughness, the digital number of radar image are converted into backscattering coefficient and used as basis of surface roughness modeling. Furthermore, using the relationship between the backscattering coefficient, local incidence angle, and the wavelength was made initial models for surface roughness. The new equation that can model surface roughness on agricultural land is obtained by performing calibration between the value of the surface roughness from initial models and combinations of initials models with the value of surface roughness from field measurement that the equation resulted y=-591987x(5)+(9.10(6))x4-(6.10(7))x(3)+(2.10(8))x(2)-(3.10(8))x+(2.10(8)) with RMSE value = 0.31 cm, where y is the value of surface roughness modeled (cm) and x is the surface roughness value of the combination of initial models used during the calibration process (cm). The combination of HV, VH polaristation and local incident angle (h(0)HV+h(0)VH) x cos theta produces a correlation value (R-2) = 0.804.

AB  - Monitoring the growth of rice in Indonesia is very important because rice is a staple food of the Indonesian people. The biggest rice producer in West Java is Indramayu. Soil moisture is one of factor in monitoring the growth of paddy. The Monitoring is carried out using SAR image, namely Radarsat-2 Quad-Polarimetric imagery. In estimating the value of soil moisture, required a dielectric constant which is obtained from the value of the Digital Number (DN) that is converted into the backscattering value (so). The approach that used in calculating the dielectric constant is a semi-empirical approach using the Dubois model (1995). The purpose of this study is to estimate the value of soil moisture in order that it can be used in monitoring the growth phase of paddy. The rice growth phase is distinguished in the form of a graph subsequently matched with the results of field photo validation. The results of this research show a positive linear correlation between the Dubois model (1995) and field soil moisture with a level of accuracy of +/- 7.202% volumetric.

AB  - The article is devoted to the study of one of the topical issues of modem linguistic and methodic science - formation of the linguistic knowledge of the bilingual students on the basis of cultural approach. According to the authors of the study, Russian as a worldview subject is intended to form a bilingual language personality, to ensure unity and interaction of language, culture and personality. The cultural approach implies organic unity of the foundations of the linguistics and mastery of communicative skills and skills, ensuring fluent knowledge of Russian literary language in different spheres and situations of communication. Considering the text-centric method as the main linguistic and methodic technique, the author of the article claims the role of the text in the formation of linguistic knowledge of the bilingual students. The given paper concludes that the interaction of the processes of formation of knowledge about language, acquisition of practical speech and language skills, understanding of the read or heard information is carried out on a textual basis. The practical significance of the study is that at the lessons of the Russian language, based on a cultural approach, it is important to work with educational and scientific texts, which serve as means of linguistic knowledge acquiring and are aimed at achieving metasubject results of the bilingual students.

AB  - In recent year, rapid population growth and urban development were observed in Bogor City as a satellite city of Jakarta. In this study, we predicted the city expansion and land surface temperature (LST) in the future. Landsat images of 1997, 2007, and 2017 were used to detect the land use changes. Land use maps in 2007 and 2017 were used for land use prediction in 2027. Slope, distance from the roads, distance from the toll road, and elevation were also used as variables which influenced the land use change. The combination of Multi-Layer Perceptron and Markov Chain (MLP-MC) were applied to forecast the city expansion. We found that the urbanized area will expand by 3759.6 ha between 2017 and 2027. Based on the land use prediction of 2027, we predicted the future LST of 2027. The average LST of the analyzed area in 2027 increased compared to 2017. The future city expansion will increase the area with high LST. This study gives information to the city planners for making a comfortable and sustainable city.

AB  - Franz Cizek and Child Art was introduced to the world through a series of art exhibitions, one of the most well-known for Cizek and his students, being the 1920 Save the Children exhibition, which toured the UK extensively and was taken to the USA in 1923. Paintings, drawings woodcuts and linocuts by Cizek's pupils were selected by humanitarian activist Francesca Wilson and Australia was one of the countries visited. Some of Marianne Mendl's work was included in this exhibition. Exhibitions of children's work were promoted by progressive educationalists.Exhibiting children's work was considered to have social and educational implications. In the century of the child the view of childhood as a discrete part of human development led to the supposition that children may have a unique worldview and the perspective of the child could have meaning and value in its own right. Children's creativity was also seen as a potential expression of renewal after the world had experienced devastating world wars. This feeling was particularly strong after the first-world war and gave impetus to the new education movement. However, children's exhibitions also had a more sombre message than a celebration of children. The Save the Children exhibition, that made Child Art known around the world, was organised to try to raise funds for the children of Vienna who were facing starvation in the wake of the first-world war.In this chapter, we focus on the work of Franz Cizek, discuss the development of Child Art and comment on the relevance of exhibitions of children's work in relation to images of children, new education and as an expression of liberalism.

TI  - Falciparum Malaria in Febrile Patients at Sentinel Sites for Influenza Surveillance in the Central African Republic from 2015 to 2018.
T2  - Interdisciplinary perspectives on infectious diseases
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Malaria is a major public health issue in the Central African Republic (CAR) despite massive scale-up of malaria interventions. However, no information is available on the incidence of malaria in febrile illness cases or on the distribution of malaria infection according to demographic characteristics, which are important indicators and valuable epidemiological surveillance tools. This study therefore aimed to characterize malaria in the network of sentinel sites set up for influenza surveillance. A retrospective analysis was conducted to explore the data from these sentinel sites from 2015 to 2018. The Paracheck-Pf rapid diagnosis test kit was used to screen for malaria in febrile illness cases. A total of 3609 malaria cases were identified in 5397 febrile patients, giving an incidence rate of 66.8%. The age group of 1-4 years was the most affected by malaria (76.0%). Moreover, prevalence varied across different sentinel sites, with the Bossembele Health Center, located in a rural area, showing an incidence of 96%, the Saint Joseph Health Center in a semiurban area of Bangui showing an incidence of 75%, and the Bangui Pediatric Complex in an urban site with an incidence of only 44.6%. Malaria transmission was holoendemic over the four-year study period, and malaria incidence decreased from 2016 to 2018. The incidence of malaria coinfection with influenza was 6.8%. This study demonstrated clear microspatial heterogeneity of malaria. Malaria was consistently the most frequent cause of febrile illness. Including sites in different climate zones in the CAR will allow for a more representative study.

AB  - Expectations for SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellites that can observe a target area through clouds and during nighttime are emerging, especially in Asia where high cloud cover rates prevent from the satellite monitoring with optical sensors. We will build a constellation of the small SAR satellites to realize short term revisits, shorter than one day to take advantage of SAR sensors that can acquire data regardless of weather and time in a day. We expect the constellation expands needs of the SAR data to business and private decision making. and develop a market for commercial use. We will launch the first demo satellite in 2020. We are already preparing to build the second satellite and will make six satellite constellation until 2022. Our final goal is to build a constellation of 25 satellites.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates the interconnectedness between language, power and liberty. Using two of Dr Joseph Boakye Danquah's letters written to President Nkrumah (Ghana) and working within the frameworks of language and power and language and liberty (Obeng, present article), we demonstrate that although by being candid, Ghanaian political actors in opposition risk personal danger, such actors have strategies for seeking the protection of their liberty (positive and negative) and for challenging powerful political actors' actions. The syntactic features used for seeking liberty include factives, antithetic constructions, collocations and voice; the discourse-pragmatic features include inferencing, political pronouns, presupposition, in-group anthroponyms, politeness and metalanguage. In conclusion, language behavior in Ghana's political ecology is intricately coordinated with political actors' worldview of and stance on liberty and their willingness to speak candidly instead of giving up on words.

In this study we will address the heavy rains that swept through the Wasit province and the heavy rain that descended from the mountains in Iran to Wasit province and led to floods, these floods were studied using radar images from ESA(European Space Agency) Sentinel-1 satellite before and after the floods on 3rd September, 2018 And November 26th of 2018 which is centered at latitudes 32.6844953 and longitudes 47.3953694 with a dual polarization capability (VV+VH), where the radar images are not affected by the poor weather conditions of clouds and rain day or night and have a capacity of 6-day revisit as compared to multi-spectral images (optical images) that depends on sunlight. All the required processing was carried out through the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and remote sensing techniques, the areas affected by the floods were calculated (1256.34 km(;)). The results obtained were compared with the results of international organizations such as Charter institute for Disaster management indicating a significant correlation with the results.

TI  - MEANS OF LANGUAGE OBJECTIFICATION OF THE GERMAN KNIGHT IMAGE IN THE ARTISTIC PICTURE OF WORLD IN MIDDLE AGES
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of historical, culturally motivated ideas about the German knight, which are objectified in the language not only in conventional, unified standards, but primarily in socio-ethnocultural assessments and stereotypes, is presented. The material of the study was German knightly novels: "Tristan" ("Tristan") by Gottfried of Strasbourg, "Poor Heinrich" ("Der arme Heinrich") by Hartmann von Aue, "Eneasroman" by Heinrich von Veldeke. Particular attention is paid to the study of indicators of the national specificity of the image of the German knight. It is proved in the work that the actualization of lexical units that serve to represent the image of a knight is largely specific and due to the genre specificity of Western European literature texts of the Middle Ages. It is stated that the knowledge of medieval German culture bearers about the surrounding reality, objectified by the semantics and pragmatics of linguistic and speech units, structures, compositions, united as a whole by the characteristics of the surrounding world are accumulated in the artistic picture of the world in the Middle Ages. It is concluded that the image of a knight embodies the complex of worldview coordinates and values of the knightly estate, which are recorded in a verbal (artistic) text in the form of a specially organized system of knowledge and ideas about the world.

M3  - Article
AB  - Soil pH is an indispensable part of the soil bionetwork, but so vulnerable to the dynamics of land-use change. Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of soil pH is thus important for sustainable land use planning and management. In this study, we developed an approach based on geographically weighted regression-kriging (GWRK) to predict the continuous variation of soil pH up to 15 cm depth. The approach is compared to multiple linear regression-kriging (MLRK) using a total of 220 soil observations and 28 candidate auxiliary data, including climatic, topographic, and remotely sensed data. Results revealed that organic matter, sand, silt, temperature, and Landsat 8 operational land imager band 7 can explain the spatial variability of soil pH. GWR-based (local) models remarkably improved the prediction accuracy of soil pH compared to the MLR-based (global) models considering the root mean square error (i.e., 0.33 vs. 0.15; 0.37 vs. 0.17, respectively) and the coefficient of multiple determination (R-2) (i.e., 0.59 vs. 0.74; 0.43 vs. 0.55, respectively). In conclusion, the use of GWR-based models revealed that the correlations between soil pH and environmental covariates were not stationary in space. Forested areas tended to be very strongly to moderately acidic, while croplands were slightly acidic to neutral. The GWR-based models demonstrated their utility in improving predictive soil mapping. These findings will support spatially-targeted soil pH management for improved food security and ecosystem health.

TI  - Belief in Metamorphosis Developmental Psychology as Theoretical Foundation of Cultural Anthropology
T2  - ANTHROPOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The idea that the borders between different natural species can be easily bridged by metamorphoses was central to the ancient worldview. Humans were believed to be able to undress their human appearance and to transform into any beast whichever, or, conversely, animals were believed to appear as human beings. This belief permeated daily life and ritual practice. The notion of metamorphosis was also central to ancient metaphysics: it affected ideas regarding creation and maintenance of the cosmos, as well as birth and death of living beings. This article demonstrates that developmental psychology can explain both the universal existence of this belief in premodern societies and its disappearance in modern societies. People staying on the preoperational stage cannot avoid believing in metamorphosis because it is an inevitable part of the cognitive patterns of this stage. People staying on the concrete and formal operational stages are in fact no more able to share these ideas because the notion of the invariance of natural kinds is an inevitable part of higher psychological stages. The article points to the fundamental importance of developmental psychology for ethnological research, especially for the study of ancient worldview.

TI  - Coastal Erosion of the Russian Arctic: An Overview
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An overview of 16 sites of coastal erosion monitoring at the fastest retreating key sites across the Russian Arctic was made. All of these coasts are composed by permafrost, creating specific conditions of their evolution and making them very sensitive to sea ice reduction and ice-free period increase along with the temperature growth, resulting from the ongoing climate change. Erosion of permafrost coasts is among the fastest destructive geomorphic processes in the Arctic. For each key area, data from literature on sediment composition, coastal morphology, permafrost properties and climate evolution were collected, assessed and compared. Rates of coastal retreat in the XX-XXI century derived from direct field measurements and processing of remotely sensed data were analyzed; mechanisms and drivers of coastal erosion were estimated. Patterns of spatial variability and temporal evolution of the coasts were suggested. The influence of different factors of coastal dynamics on thermodenudation (destruction of the bluffs during thawing of permafrost and ground ice) and thermoabrasion (erosion resulting from direct contact of waves with the frozen bluff) was estimated.

TI  - Ecological functions of the modern vegetation cover of the Stanovoy Highlands
T2  - VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An integral evaluation of the modern vegetation cover of the Stanovoy Highlands has been carried out on the basis of identifying priority ecological functions for vegetation communities in model sites of the mountain system (in the Upper Angara depression and in the North-Muya Range). Identification of the typological diversity of vegetation and the ecotopic relations of communities, conducted on the basis of field data and remote sensing data, made it possible to compile vegetation maps of model sites with the allocation of five priority ecological functions (permafrost-stabilizing, anti-erosion, anti-avalanche, drainage, water-regulating) for vegetation communities of different altitudinal belts (mountain taiga, sub-tundra, tundra belts). An analysis of the current state of vegetation has been done on the basis of changes in the forest area for the period from 2000 to 2018. Trends in the change of functions of communities have been determined. The ecological and geographical approach to determining the diversity of functions of the vegetation communities of the Stanovoy Highlands revealed the specifics of the botanical diversity of the mountain territory according to altitudinal and regional patterns. The mountain taiga belt is composed of vegetation communities (mainly larch forests) that perform a wide range of environmental priority functions in various ecotope conditions. Sparse forests and dwarf pine communities perform environmental protection functions in conditions of steeply sloping relief in the sub-tundra belt. High-mountain communities are characterized by a drainage function in the top levels of ranges in the tundra belt. The composed phytoecological maps of vegetation have made it possible to identify the spatial structure of the mountain biome on the example of model areas according to the actual dynamic of vegetation cover of the Stanovoy Highlands connected with cutting and fires. Approbation of the cartographic method in the study identifies the prospects for its use in ecological mapping with an evaluation of the functions of vegetation communities in mountain ecosystems.

AB  - This paper is a comparative analysis of the creation myths of Korea(mainland, Jeju Island) and the mythical elements(mytheme) of the creation myths of the Mường in Vietnam and the worldview and values ​​that are captured there. The research subjects are <Changsega>(Mainland), <Cheonjiwangbonpuri>(Jeju Island) in Korea, and <Nguồn gốc của dất va nước(Origin of Land and Water)> of the Mường in Vietnam. The main research method is to compare and analyze the differences seen by common mythemes and the worldview and values ​​in creation mythology. As a result of comparative analysis, several common mythemes including opening of Heaven and earth, the emergence of the Genesis god, the marriage of the Genesis god, the adjustment of the sun and the moon, the creation of human beings, the origin of water and fire, the competition for ownership of the human world and the punishment of wicked people (including monster, Evil spirits) are confirmed. However, significant differences are found in worldviews and values. The creation myth of Korea leads to the genealogy of creation and human ethics, and shows a world view that values ​​it. Vietnam's creation myth shows the genealogy of the creation and the human origin, and emphasizes the importance of the relationship. And It shows a worldview that emphasizes cooperation and cooperation between the 'sky-ground', 'water-cosmic tree', 'earth-human village', and 'animal-human' pairs. As a result, Korea's creation myth shows values ​​that emphasize results rather than process, and Vietnam's creation myth shows values ​​that emphasize process rather than results.

TI  - Israel’s Identity and Origin : Focusing on Ancient Near Eastern Archives and Ethnic Designation

T2  - ACTS Theological Journal
T2  - ACTS 신학저널

AB  - In the opinion of most scholars, the identity and origin of Israel lies at least in the state of a national tendency. The term ‘Israel’ is either after the emergence of an independent state, or the returning community of captivity has used this designation, and he editors of the text-as opposed to the historical narrative context of the biblical narrative-add a theological meaning and interpret it in the Bible. And they would put this term into the text as an interpretive indicator. Biblical authors use the term Israel without categorical distinction for the existential continuity of the listener’s present and past events. Thus, the identity and origin of Israel can be vague. The aim of this study is to retrospectively trace traces of memories beyond historical relics and data to find a factual and linguistic basis for Israel’s identity and origin. To this end, the researcher used non-biblical data (reading of ancient monuments and the possibility of recent interpretation), archaeological records of Palestine, and a method of synthesizing data in the Bible. Ugarit’s list of the warriors (end of the 13th century BC) reveals that the name “Israel,” which includes the deity “El,” was not an unfamiliar name in the region of the Levant. In the Merenphtha Stele (1209/8 BC), Israel refers to human groups, not regions or territories. However, this stone monument does not tell whether Israel had a single origin. The monument of Salmaneser III (853 BC) and the monument of Mesa of Moab (840 BC), respectively, indicate that since the mid-9th century, Israel has exercised power on the stage of history as a political entity occupying a region in northern Palestine. Ancient data from the 12th century BC to the middle of the 9th century BC remain silent without directly mentioning Israel. In order to trace the traces left in the memory of the worldview, the researcher looked at the naming method of peoples, one of the old linguistic conventions, and revived the interpretive meanings engraved in the memories of the time beyond linguistic expressions.The nomenclature for nations includes: 1) nomenclature according to the origins or regions (Edom, Moab, Ammon), 2) nomenclature according to historical background (Philistines), 3) nomenclature according to cities (Duro, Sidon, Assyria, Babylon). All the neighboring peoples in the Canaanite basin-except for the Philistines-were based on their ancestor names, but all the Mesopotamian civilizations and neighboring countries followed the city name. As a result of examining the designation of Israel,Israel had both the ancestral name and the geographical name. Therefore, from the beginning, this designation had nothing to do with the political entity and the state. Thus, this designation dates back to before the period, not after the period of the kingdom or the period of captivity. The idea of “Israel” as a human group based on a certain degree of homogeneity that it originated from an ancestor, was assigned a specific area by God was inherent. In conclusion, the study of the designation of nations in the Bible clearly expresses the origin of Israel based on homogeneity and the identity of God assigned the land to live in. Therefore, the existing general view of the use of this designation as the period of state formation or post-captivity should be revised.

AB  - In this study, we developed an automatic flood detection method using ALOS-2 and ancillary data. Our method can be automatically processed and provide easy-to-understand flood information rapidly for users working on-site disaster response. A Bayesian probabilistic model was used for integrating ancillary data (quasi-realtime flood simulation) and multiple SAR-derived images (amplitude and coherence). We also used a land-use/land-cover map to improve the flood classification result. We examined our methods using ALOS-2 data in the 2015 flood in Japan and obtained an accurate flood map in good agreement with reference data.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) data can be reliably obtained at high spatial resolution through the disaggregation of passive microwave-derived SM, Optical/thermal data are classically used as fine scale information in such a disaggregation procedure. The point is that optical data are unavailable under cloudy conditions and their relationship with SM is strongly affected by vegetation cover, Alternatively, Sentinel-1 provides radar data at an unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution, despite the complex relationship between backscatter and SM that often requires ancillary data for calibration. Hence the idea of combining disaggregation- and Sentinel-l-based SM retrieval approaches on clear sky days and to run the so-calibrated radar-based algorithm irrespective of weather conditions, This study undertakes preliminary analyses before both approaches can be efficiently merged. It consists of 1) extending the applicability of DISPATCH (disaggregation) algorithm to full-vegetated areas, in order to optimize the spatial match between disaggregation- and radar-based approaches and 2) providing a first comparative assessment of DISPATCH and the recently released Copernicus 1 km resolution SM data sets over a contrasted area including dryland and irrigated crops. Results indicate significant differences between both data sets, thus highlighting the potential of synergies between them.

AB  - The application of Satellite Differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) has become a reliable solution as a tool for mapping and monitoring geohazards. Few years ago, the main applications of these techniques were devoted to science. However, nowadays, the easy access to SAR imagery and the maturity of the techniques to exploit these type of data has widened the user's spectrum from only scientists to professional and decision makers. The advent of Sentinel-1 satellites has significantly contributed to this achievement. In particular, in the field of geohazard risk management, Sentinel-1 has solved one of the main constraining factors that hindered the operational use of interferometric techniques in the past: the lack of systematic acquisition plans. In this context, Sentinel-1 assures worldwide coverage with short temporal baselines (6 to 24 days). This has supposed a definitive step towards the implementation of DInSAR based techniques to support decision makers against geohazards. In this work, we show the first experiences of the remote sensing unit of the Geological and Mining Survey of Chile (Sernageomin) with Sentinel-1 data. Three different case studies in different areas of the Chilean territory are presented. The examples illustrate how DInSAR based techniques can provide different levels of information about geohazard activity in different environments.

AB  - The paper describes a number of simplified methods of mapping of the urban environment surface temperature in order to study the structure of the urban heat island. It is very important to take into account the climatic and environmental variables of the territories when planning modern cities and settlements. To solve such problems, methods of remote sensing data are used increasingly. The study of multispectral satellite images provides more information about the characteristics of objects on the earth's surface, as well as data on the distribution of various types of land use. Maps of the earth's surface temperature (LST) can be used for studying the urban microclimate and localization of temperature anomalies of the city, as well as for urban planning tasks. The article considers the operation of processing a series of satellite images of urban areas for the summer period, followed by the study of temporary changes in the temperature portrait of the city. The paper considers the use of semi-automatic methods for obtaining satellite images in the thermal field, as well as a separate study of images in the near-infrared field to search for bright point sources of heat. Radiometric and atmospheric correction was performed on satellite data using the QGIS package and the Semiautomatic Classification Plugin extension. Based on the results of the study, thermal anomalies were localized in the city, and the boundaries of the heat footprint of new neighborhoods were determined.

AB  - In an era of increasing wildfires frequency and intensity an accurate estimation of the emissions released to the atmosphere is essential to reduce their impacts. In this study, we improve the accuracy of our estimations by introducing field measurements of biomass and adapting the burning efficiency factors to different levels of burn severity computed from Sentinel-2 data. The biomass measured in the field complemented the data found in the literature. The emissions derived were compared with the emissions from the GFED product showing a good agreement, although GFED values were higher than ours, suggesting that GFED may overestimate the emissions due to their coarse resolution and the generalized factors applied to large ecosystems.

TI  - Local climate zones classification method from Copernicus land monitoring service datasets: An ArcGIS-based toolbox
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - Local Climate Zones (LCZ) have become a worldwide standard for identifying land cover classes, according to their climate-relevant morphological parameters. The LCZ's are mostly used to evaluate urban climate performance, particularly the relationship between the urban heat island effect (UHI) and the characteristics of the builtup environment. The World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) has provided a supervised LCZ classification method based only on moderate resolution free satellite imagery, mostly Landsat 7 or 8 (30 m pixel size, in the visible spectrum brands); however, its' results are less accurate for European cities. Conversely, alternative geographic information system (GIS)-based methods developed so far require information that is hardly available to all, such as building footprints or heights. Here, the ArcGIS based LCZ from Copernicus Toolbox (LCZC) provides an alternative classification method that uses only freely accessible information from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS), being possible to replicate it in 800 European urban locations. The method combines Urban Atlas (UA) and Corine Land Cover (CLC) with Tree Cover Density, Dominant Leaf Type and Grassland information, to produce a higher-resolution baseline shapefile that is classified according to each feature's dominant characteristics. The LCZC toolbox output is a LCZ raster map. It has been validated in five European cities: Athens, Barcelona, Lisbon, Marseille, and Naples.The LCZC toolbox provides an alternative LCZ GIS-based classification, based on freely accessible CLMS datasets.The use of CLMS shapefile higher-resolution inputs, particularly the UA and CLC datasets, ensures an output LCZ map that has greater detail and higher accuracy.The availability of CLMS information in 800 European urban areas guarantees that the method can be replicated in those locations.

TI  - EVALUATION OF ALGORITHMS FOR LAND USE AND LAND COVER CLASSIFICATION IN THE CENTRAL PORTION OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL STATE FROM HIGH AND MEDIUM SPATIAL RESOLUTION IMAGERY
T2  - GEO UERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing classification algorithms of land use and land cover as well as images from sensors on satellites with different spatial resolutions are essential to determine the most suitable for each location. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of supervised classification algorithms, Maximum Likelihood (MLE) and Bhattacharyya, using medium spatial resolution (OLI/Landsat 8) and high (REIS/RapidEye) images in localized municipalities in the central of Rio Grande do Sul state. For this were used OLI/Landsat 8 and REIS/ RapidEye sensor images with spatial resolution of 30 and 5 m, respectively. The classification of both images was performed by the MLE and Bhattacharyya algorithms with the definition of six classes of land use and land cover, these being Native Forest, Planted Forest, Exposed Soil, Agriculture, Field and Water. To evaluate the efficiency of the classification were used 120 points distributed randomly stratified in each municipality, 20 points in each class of land use and land cover. The quality of the classification was analyzed by Kappa and global accuracy indices, and the error of omission and commission was calculated. According to the results, the kappa index was higher for the classifications using the REIS/RapidEye sensor images for both algorithms, totaling 85.33% (MLE) and 83.67% (Bhattacharyya). In this context, it was possible to conclude that the REIS/RapidEye images and the MLE algorithm stand out for the best results, which are more adequate for the study area.

TI  - The inclusion of the indigenous people Pupykary/Apurina in the contemporary context
T2  - ARQUIVOS BRASILEROS DE PSICOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to discuss the inclusion of indigenous students with disabilities in municipal schools in villages where Pupykary/Apurina live, in the municipality of Boca do Acre, in the south of the state of Amazonas. In this sense, we discuss how we can weave a relationship between disability, as defined by the Brazilian Inclusion Law and by the social activism of disability, and indigenous conceptions of disability, especially from the perspective of the worldview Pupykary/Apurina. The question in focus took us to the field of inclusion: what are the meanings of inclusion for people with disabilities from the perspective of indigenous peoples, in particular Pupykary/Apurina? We conclude by pointing out the urgency of affirming epistemic decolonial disobediences, which lead us to public policies aimed at indigenous people with disabilities that take into account the uniqueness of indigenous ways of life.

TI  - Mitigating the effects of omission errors on area and area change estimates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on Earth's land surface and change over time has never been easier to obtain, but making informed decisions to manage land well necessitates that this information is accurate and precise. In recent years, due largely to the inevitability of classification errors in remote sensing-based maps and the marked effects of these errors on subsequent area estimates, sample-based area estimates of land cover and land change have increased in importance and use. Area estimation of land cover and change by sampling is often made more efficient by a priori knowledge of the study area to be analyzed (e.g., stratification). Satellite data, obtained free of cost for virtually all of Earth's land surface, provide an excellent source for constructing landscape stratifications in the form of maps. Errors of omission, defined as sample units observed as land change but mapped as a stable class, may introduce considerable uncertainty in parameter estimates obtained from the sample data (e.g., area estimates of land change). The effects of omission errors are exacerbated in situations where the area of intact forest is large relative to the area of forest change, a common situation in countries that seek results-based payments for reductions in deforestation and associated carbon emissions. The presence of omission errors in such situations can preclude the acquisition of statistically valid evidence of a reduction in deforestation, and thus prevent payments. International donors and countries concerned with mitigating the effects of climate change are looking for guidance on how to reduce the effects of omission errors on area estimates of land change. This article presents the underlying reasons for the effects of omission errors on area estimates, case studies highlighting real-world examples of these effects, and proposes potential solutions. Practicable approaches to efficiently splitting large stable strata are presented that may reduce the effects of omission errors and immediately improve the quality of estimates. However, more research is needed before further recommendations can be provided on how to contain, mitigate and potentially eliminate the effects of omissions errors.

TI  - Meteorological drivers of interannual variation in transparency of mountain lakes
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In mountain lakes, water transparency is regulated primarily by materials loaded from the surrounding catchment. Consequently, transparency within a lake can vary over time due to meteorological conditions that affect hydrologic inputs. Furthermore, lake responses to these inputs may depend on catchment characteristics. We examined the relationships between meteorological conditions and interannual variation in transparency over thirteen years in a set of four lakes in Yoho National Park, British Columbia, Canada. We measured mid-summer transparency as the attenuation coefficient of 320 nm and collected meteorological data daily with an automatic weather station located near the study lakes. Despite their close proximity, lakes varied in the strength of associations between transparency and cumulative precipitation across a range of durations. Specifically, transparency in non-glacially fed Lake Hungabee was most strongly correlated with cumulative precipitation in the fifteen days preceding sampling, whereas glacially fed Lakes Opabin and Oesa were most strongly affected by longer periods of cumulative precipitation. Consequently, there was relatively little temporal synchrony in interannual transparency variation among lakes. Our results suggest that both the timing and amount of precipitation as well local hydrology must be considered when predicting effects of climate change on mountain lake ecosystems even within a single region.

AB  - Melaleuca forest or locally known as Gelam forest mostly occur in beach ridges interspersed with swales (BRIS) sandy areas, coastal, wetland, peatland, and lowland regions. It is a mono-specific species dominance ecosystem, where Melaleuca cajuputi trees are dominant. It is fringing along the coast of Terengganu and Kelantan and certain parts along the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The landscape is small but it has equal importance to other ecosystems in terms of local environmental functions and economic contributions. The benefits include timber for building constructions and furniture and other traditional uses, such as for fuel wood, charcoal, tea-tree, honeybee breeding areas and others. However, this forest is inevitable from threats by anthropogenic activities such as land clearing and conversion to other land uses that can affect the ecosystem. These activities occur because most of this ecosystem reside on stateland areas, where development is rapid. Only small patches of this forest was protected as Permanent Forest Reserve, which is secure from any threat. Currently the information about the tracts and extents of this forest is very scarce. Therefore, this study was carried out to acquire latest information on the distribution and extent of Melaleuca forest in Peninsular Malaysia through the utilization of remotely sensed data. Optical images from Landsat-8 OLI were used as primary input for this study. Spectral characteristic from visible and infrared regions were analyzed to produce a specific vegetation index for recognizing Melaleuca forest ecosystem on the images. The study demonstrated that the Melaleuca forest covers some 23,000 ha in Peninsular Malaysia that are intact but vulnerable to surrounding threats. The findings of study should attract attentions from the relevant State Governments to take appropriate management actions to protect this unique and priceless ecosystem in the future.

AB  - Surgery in the form of both mastectomy and breast conservation is the main step in the treatment of breast cancer. Numerous studies have shown an equivalent long-term survival for breast conserving surgery (BCS) and mastectomy. Patients desire and tumor characteristics, especially size and multicentricity, are the key factors that affect the decision between these two types of surgery. Patients with any contraindication for radiotherapy or previous history of radiation to the breast field are not suitable for BCS. There are few absolute contraindications for BCS, and early pregnancy is listed among them; mastectomy is preferred in the first trimester of pregnancy to avoid the impact of delaying radiation therapy on outcome of the cancer.

TI  - Expansion of Impervious Surfaces and Their Driving Forces in Highly Urbanized Cities in Kyrgyzstan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of urban areas due to population increase and economic expansion creates demand and depletes natural resources, thereby causing land use changes in the main cities. This study focuses on land cover datasets to characterize impervious surface (urban area) expansion in select cities from 1993 to 2017, using supervised classification maximum likelihood techniques and by quantifying impervious surfaces. The results indicate an increasing trend in the impervious surface area by 35% in Bishkek, 75% in Osh, and 15% in Jalal-Abad. The overall accuracy (OA) for the image classification of two different datasets for the three cities was between 82% and 93%, and the kappa coefficients (KCs) were approximately 77% and 91%. The Landsat images with other supplementary data showed positive urban growth in all of the cities. The GDP, industrial growth, and urban population growth were driving factors of impervious surface sprawl in these cities from 1993 to 2017.Landscape Expansion Index (LEI) results also provided good evidence for the change of impervious surfaces during the study period. The results emphasize the idea of applying future planning and sustainable urban development procedures for sustainable use of natural resources and their management, which will increase life quality in urban areas and environments.

AB  - The study examines metaphorical expressions in Igbo. It specifically analyzes the linguistic and cultural values, and beliefs in Igbo metaphors. The study adopted the Key Informant Interview method in data collection as well as introspection as a native speaker of Igbo. It was discovered that interpretation of Igbo metaphorical expressions involves the linguistic features of implicature, inference and referencing well as understanding of the cultural nuances of the referents used in Igbo metaphors. The study identified that metaphorical expressions concretize the Igbo worldview. This worldview, beliefs and values are represented in the cultural connotations of referents of Igbo metaphors. The study identified some referents with their cultural connotations such as animals; and natural/physical objects. The author concludes that understanding of metaphor in Igbo entails knowledge of cultural and contextual nuances of the referent of the metaphor in the Igbo language and culture.

AB  - Yoon Jaecheon has pioneered and established a new direction for essay literature. Proving its literary value, he has led the development of Korean essay literature by establishing theories of essay literature and proposing critical criticism, open attitudes, and a fusion-oriented spirit. First, Yoon Jaecheon’s essay literary theory rediscovered the value of natural phenomena based on the principle of relationship with humanity and circularity, and he added the reflective depth of ecological consciousness. The awareness and writing of positive ecological consciousness, which embraces the universal order of creation and extinction and imprints the signs of production rediscovered in extinction, is the ultimate message he has continually conveyed. In addition, Yun Jaecheon’s essays are, basically, mixed with two heterogeneous philosophies, namely romantic and experimental. This indicates that Yoon has always pursued an experimental writing method to overcome the limitation while dreaming of an ideal world that is impossible to realize. This is Yoon Jaecheon's essay writing strategy. In addition, the various forms of experimental essay that Yoon Jaecheon shows in the new forms of literature required in the future are valid for the future of essay writing. In particular, his free consciousness and experimental writing can be described as “the modernity of the essay.” This modernity covers the trends of modernism, postmodernism, and avant-garde, while maintaining the future orientation by forming a triangular axis of theory, creation, and criticism. Yoon Jaecheon's essay literature theory is that our essay literature should be firmly established in the essay literature. It is necessary to find professional essay writers, introduce full-scale literary theories into the works, and focus on establishing academic systems and theories. The essay theory to secure the literary status of the essay was presented through the criticism of the conventional essay concept suggested by earlier enlightenment, which was vague to a researcher of essay literature. In this way, Yoon Jaecheon can reach the spirit of literature by breaking down the prejudice of fixed thoughts and expanding the value of personality by breaking down the prejudice of fixed ideas and thoughts based on the characteristics of essay literature that builds freedom in the form of infinity and sanctions. To explore the positive development of essay literature, this study showed the correspondence that future essays should aim for, through the fusion of genres and inter-media mixing. In this context, research on essay writing will provide a solution and a foundation for research on the essential tasks of essays, and further expand the author’s theory, which is the subject of scholarly research on essays.

TI  - The Uncharacteristic Occurrence of the June 2013 Biomass-Burning Haze Event in Southeast Asia: Effects of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and Tropical Cyclone Activity
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the worst haze events to ever hit Peninsular Malaysia occurred in June 2013 due to smoke from Riau, Central Sumatra. While biomass-burning in the region is common, the early occurrence of a haze episode of this magnitude was uncharacteristic of the seasonality of extreme fire events, which usually occur between August and October in the Maritime Continent (MC). This study aims to investigate the phenomenology of the June 2013 haze event and its underlying meteorological forcing agents. The aerosol and meteorological environment during the event is examined using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire hotspot detections and aerosol optical thickness retrievals, satellite-based precipitation retrievals, and meteorological indices. These datasets are then supported by a WRF-Chem simulation to provide a comprehensive picture of the event's meteorology and aerosol transport phenomenology. While extreme fire events are more characteristic of El Nino years, the MODIS fire count over the MC in June for the years 2001-2015 was highest in 2013 when neutral El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions prevailed. Although, the mean daily precipitation for June 2013 was below average for June 2003-2015. An early active tropical cyclone (TC) season occurred in 2013, and results show that the combined induced subsidence and flow enhancement due to TC Bebinca and the dry phases of a strong Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) event contributed to the event intensification. Results also show that Bebinca induced a decrease in surface relative humidity of at least 10% over Riau, where fire hotspots were concentrated.

TI  - Geospatial analysis of wetland dynamics: Wetland depletion and biodiversity conservation of Isimangaliso Wetland, South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Isimangaliso Wetland (IW) in KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa has a variety of wetlands that contribute valuable ecosystem services to a notable number of people, the natural species habitat and tourism interests. Wetlands are epoch-making reproducing and nourishing zones for wildlife and give shelters and protection for sea creatures. As with any natural habitat, wetlands are important in supporting species diversity as well as providing the climate moderating element. This study aimed at appraising the spatial pattern of the Isimangaliso Wetland, the potential determinants and effects of the wetland depletion between 1987 and 2017 using remote sensing and GIS approach. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images acquired for 1987, 1997, 2007 and Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery for 2017 was acquired from the archives of United States Geological Survey (USGS) for the analysis using ArcGIS 10.2. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) analyses between 1987 and 2017 successfully revealed the significant depletion of the water surrounding IW area which might be as a result of natural or human activities which may include climate change, built-up areas and agricultural activities. In 1987 and 2017, the results showed that wetland extent was 655.416 Km(2) and 429.489 Km(2) respectively which connotes that IW has witnessed significant changes during the study period over the area. It was also revealed that the other land features (vegetation, built-up, open surface and rocky surface) over the area increased from 2149.911 Km(2) to 2375.838 Km(2) in 1987 and 2017 respectively. The overall classification accuracy of 97.55% and Kappa coefficient of 0.941. This wetland depletion might have a significant impact on biodiversity including human and animals as well as plants thus diminishing its world heritage status. Consequently, this natural gift needs to be conserved to create a livable environment for wetland animals in order to moderate local climate as well as preserve human wellness and protection by reducing flood disaster and maintaining efficient water quantity and quality in the area.

TI  - Stage III melanoma: Sentinel node biopsy, completion lymph node dissection and prospects of adjuvant therapy. A French national survey on current and envisaged practices
T2  - ANNALES DE DERMATOLOGIE ET DE VENEREOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The recent publication of randomized trials investigating the efficacy of adjuvant therapy and completion lymph node dissection at microscopic stage III melanoma calls for a reappraisal of melanoma management from different angles: indications for sentinel lymph node biopsy, indications for completion lymph node dissection in microscopic -stage disease, and adjuvant therapies. Our objective was to evaluate current practices and to question French onco-dermatologists about any changes they envisaged in their practices in the light of recent publications. Methods. We conducted a national survey among members of the Cutaneous Oncology Group of the French Society of Dermatology in October 2017. Results. Forty French health centers were included, and 53 individual responses were collected. Sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma was performed at 75 % of the centers. Before the summer of 2017 and the publication of MSLT-II (proving the absence of any therapeutic benefits for complete lymph node dissection in microscopic stage III melanoma), when a positive sentinel lymph node was diagnosed, immediate completion lymph node dissection was performed at 90 % of the centers. After the publication of MSLT-II, 45 % of the respondents considered stopping this practice. The risk -benefit ratio prompted prescription of nivolumab and of combined dabrafenib + trametinib as adjuvant therapy by respectively 96 % and 79 % of respondents, while the corresponding rates for interferon and ipilimumab were only 21 % and 15 %. Conclusion. Early melanoma management stands on the verge of major changes thanks to the arrival of efficient adjuvant therapies and a decrease in immediate completion lymph node dissections for patients with microscopic stage III is also anticipated. 0 2019 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - <i>The Family of Man</i> and its Echoes in International Photography Exhibitions in Croatia During the 1950s and 1960s
T2  - RADOVI INSTITUTA ZA POVIJEST UMJETNOSTI-JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF ART HISTORY
M3  - Review
AB  - The American photography exhibition The Family of Man was opened in 1955 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. This project of the Luxembourg-American photographer Edward Steichen was a great success in the USA, but also globally, because soon after its closing in New York, five different versions of it went on tour around the world. The exhibition was shown in 38 countries, and its world tour was funded by the United States Information Agency, whose mission was to inform the world about the American society, culture, and politics.Many aspects of The Family of Man indicate the orientation of American cultural policy in the 1950s, some elements of which stem from situations in the 1930s and 1940s. Steichen was influenced by photographs taken for the needs of the Farm Security Administration, which showed scenes of rural poverty in the United States during the Great Depression. Influence on Steichen can also be found in the 1948 series of reports People are People, the World Over published in Ladies' Home Journal, where everyday life in various parts of the world was illustrated from a sociological and anthropological point of view. With all the messages it intended to send, The Family of Man primarily showed how the Americans imagined an American family as the exclusive nucleus of social life. This unquestionable and at that time unavoidable image of the world did not include photographs of the Holocaust, which was followed by the avoidance of other "undesirable" content.Steichen's exhibition toured Yugoslavia twice. Its second version, with small changes compared to the one shown at MoMA, visited Belgrade in 1957, and the following year a new, slightly modified version was shown in Zagreb, at the Fairgrounds, which in the 1950s became a place where the visitors could get acquainted with the "American dream". In the 1950s and 1960s, international exhibitions in Croatia followed the pattern set by The Family of Man in that they juxtaposed the forces of good and evil, on the one hand readily presenting topics that emphasized family, love, and marital relations, linking them with social life, music, dance, education, science and religion, while on the other avoiding other subjects such as loneliness, suffering, violence, death, or war. The growing Americanization of the countries behind the Iron Curtain and the close relations between the USA and Yugoslavia probably influenced the choice of subjects in photographs shown at the international exhibitions in the country. The Family of Man had set the rules that many photographers were now following. On many levels, it promoted the American way of life and worldview, presented through the medium of photography.At the same time, international photography salons were organized in Croatia, primarily with the aim of presenting to the public the activities of various schools of photography or photo clubs, where their work was evaluated through the successes of their members at juried group exhibitions. The similarity of subjects in the exhibited works shows the impact that the "American exhibition" had on many photographers and jury members of the photography salons during the 1950s and 1960s, as they adopted the subjects presented by Steichen to the public as the desirable photographic narrative of their own events.

AB  - Microclimatic conditions in the urban domain show a high degree of variability, which may not be fully captured with terrestrial weather station networks. Relying on the use of weather station data as external boundary conditions may therefore cause deviations in simulation-supported energy assessment inquiries. This contribution addresses this issue by exploring the application potential of satellite-based thermal remote sensing data for more realistic representations of external microclimatic boundary conditions in building energy modelling. For this purpose, three different remote sensing datasets are compared with the air temperature observations from terrestrial weather stations. Our findings indicate a significant relationship between remote sensing data and air temperature observations with 0.901 R-2, and up to 0.938 R-2 in individual dataset comparisons. Moreover, air temperature is estimated from satellite-acquisitions with an overall RMSE of 2.96 k.

TI  - The role of the Russian state in the development of the educational system among the Muslim peoples of the North Caucasus (XIX century)
T2  - DIALOG SO VREMENEM-DIALOGUE WITH TIME
M3  - Article
AB  - The article raises questions about the evolution of the Islamic education system in the North Caucasus throughout the nineteenth century. The aim of the work is to identify the forms of Muslim education in the North Caucasus, their transformation. When solving research problems, such general scientific methods as methods of analysis and synthesis, concretization, generalization were applied. The sources for the preparation of the article were archival calculations, statistical reports and descriptions, materials of the pre-revolutionary periodicals, regulatory and legal regulations, as well as modem scientific literature. The chronological framework of the study is due to the fact that it was in the 19th century that the innovation policy of the Russian Empire in the field of education in relation to the Muslim peoples of the peripheral regions was most vividly and vividly revealed. It is proved that throughout the XIX century there was a transformation of institutions that provide religious education. It was determined by the policy of the Russian administration in relation to Islam and Muslims in the North Caucasus. To this end, in 1847, the Caucasus Educational District was created, whose activity was to popularize education among the mountain peoples. Its functions consisted in the prolongation of Russian legislative standards relating to the opening of various types of educational institutions: schools, county schools, gymnasiums and gymnasiums. This system of education remained unchanged until 1917.

TI  - A THEORY OF EVOLUTION AS A PROCESS OF UNFOLDING
T2  - COSMOS AND HISTORY-THE JOURNAL OF NATURAL AND SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work I propose a theory of evolution as a process of unfolding. This theory is based on four logically concatenated principles. The principle of evolutionary order establishes that the more complex cannot be generated from the simpler. The principle of origin establishes that there must be a maximum complexity that originates the others by logical deduction. Finally, the principle of unfolding and the principle of actualization guarantee the development of the evolutionary process from the simplest to the most complex. These logical principles determine the existence of a virtual ideological matrix that contains the sequence of the preformed and folded morphogenetic fields. In this manner, the evolutionary process consists of the sequential unfolding and actualization of these fields, which is motorized by a process of teleologization carried out by the opening consciousness of the forms included in the fields of the ideological matrix. This theory leads to a radical change of perspective regarding the materialist worldview, and places life at the center of the evolutionary process as an activity carried out by a consciousness that seeks to fulfill a purpose by actualizing its own potentialities.

TI  - FEATURES OF REPRESENTATION OF POEMS BY A. LUZHIKOV IN RUSSIAN TRANSLATIONS
T2  - EZHEGODNIK FINNO-UGORSKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-YEARBOOK OF FINNO-UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article first reviews the quality of translations of the poems of the Komi poet A. Luzhikov into Russian. At the time of the harsh change of life paradigms, at the end of the 20th century, due to acute mental trauma, a motive for dividing the world appears in his poetry. Many poems by A. Luzhikov speak of the death of the Komi life equal to the death of the world. His lyrical hero is out of society. Translators strove to convey the dramatic and tragic emotional tone of his poems, the aesthetics of the poetic loneliness of the lyrical hero, reflecting a person's worldview in the era of the global crisis. In the collection of poems we can count about 20 very successful translations in which the metro-rhythmic pattern, the figurative-lexical system of works, and the tension of the feelings of the lyrical hero are adequately recreated. In general, the translations maintain an open expression, conveyed by rhetorical figures; there are artistically accurate and faithfully conveyed images, the poetical and philosophical terminology is saved. At the same time, many translations used some template expressions and ready-made cliches and added stylistic "decorations" alien to poetry by A. Luzhikov (and generally to the Komi poetry). Moreover, in Russion versions, exclamatory and interrogative syntactic constructions were replaced by narrative ones. Such translation transformations led to a decrease in the emotional intensity of texts, and in general, to a distortion of the ethnocultural image of the the Komi poet's world.

TI  - LANDSCAPE MAPPING OF HARD-TO-REACH AREAS. A CASE STUDY FOR THE BOLONSKY STATE NATURE RESERVE (RUSSIA)
T2  - NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The system for monitoring the environmental state of Protected Areas should be based on landscape (geosystem) differentiation of an area represented by a number of landscape (geosystem) maps. Such a map shows combinations of interacting components and spatial elements of the natural environment as a single set. However, the development of such a cartographic basis for many Protected Areas in the Russian Far East and Siberia is a very labour-consuming process and it requires large investments due to a lack of knowledge and inaccessibility of such areas. The creation of a landscape map over relatively short time and maximally objectively is possible using methods for interpretation of aerial photos made by unmanned aerial vehicles (DJI Phantom 4) in combination with the Earth remote sensing data with a medium spatial resolution (Sentinel-2), field data and available literature sources. The Bolonsky State Nature Reserve (Khabarovsky Krai, Russia) was selected for this research. This area has an important international status. So, Lake Bolon and the mouths of the Selgon and Simmi rivers is Wetlands of International Importance; Lake Bolon is a Key Bird Area. The study of this area is difficult due to its location within the highly flooded and waterlogged northeastern part of the Middle Amur Lowland. During field studies in 2017-2018, we first studied the landscape structure of the Bolonsky State Nature Reserve. We created maps of relief types, vegetation classes and landscapes at the 1:100 000 scale. In addition, four key sites (scale of 1:5000) have been justified and described in detail as a "milestone" of spatio-temporal changes in wetland geosystems for long-term monitoring. Within the lowland aggraded plain, we have identified three subclasses of aggraded plains of alluvial, lacustrine and alluvial-lacustrine genesis with different combinations of meso-and microrelief. For 12 types of plant communities represented in the Bolonsky State Nature Reserve, their proportion was identified in the landscape structure of the Protected Area. There were larch and mixed larch-small-leaved forests, deciduous forests, small-leaved forests, forest-meadow, forest-wetland and floodplain complexes. For the first time, the paper describes in detail the plant associations of the mire and meadow-mire ecosystems occupying 80% of the area of the Bolonsky State Nature Reserve. On four key routes, a detailed descriptions of mire facies have been conducted using field research data and information from air photographic surveys using unmanned aerial vehicles. These data allowed us to obtain information about functioning of the ecosystems in the Bolonsky State Nature Reserve. The final map presented two types of one landscape class, which include 23 landtypes of the four terrene types. We showed that besides of natural factors, the geosystems of the Protected Area are affected significantly by wildfires having predominantly an anthropogenic origin. The data of Earth remote sensing obtained in 1996-2018 confirm the considerable effect of the wildfire influence on the landscapes of the Protected Area. At the same time, the obtained data indicate that post-fire successions have a high intensity being tended to restore the original status of geosystems. The Bolonsky State Nature Reserve has been affected by wildfires during more than 80 year. However, there are currently no data on the initial state of geosystems in the Protected Area.The comparison of the obtained results and data on the wetland development in the Middle Amur Lowland allowed us to consider the geosystems of this area as a unique "milestone" to study the wetland-developing processes in the south of the Far East.

TI  - Time Delay Evaluation on the Water-Leaving Irradiance Retrieved from Empirical Models and Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal delays and spatial randomness between ground-based data and satellite overpass involve important deviations between the empirical model output and real data; these are factors poorly considered in the model calibration. The inorganic matter-generated turbidity in Lake Chapala (Mexico) was taken as a study case to expose the influence of such factors. Ground-based data from this study and historical records were used as references. We take advantage of the at-surface reflectance from Landsat-8, sun-glint corrections, a reduced NIR-band range, and null organic matter incidence in these wavelengths to diminish the physical phenomena-related radiometric artifacts; leaving the spatio-temporal relationships as the principal factor inducing the model uncertainty. Non-linear correlations were assessed to calibrate the best empirical model; none of them presented a strong relationship (<73%), including that based on hourly delays. This last model had the best predictability only for the summer-fall season, explaining 71% of the turbidity variation in 2016, and 59% in 2017, with RMSEs < 24%. The instantaneous turbidity maps depicted the hydrodynamic complexity of the lake, highlighting a strong component of spatial randomness associated with the temporal delays. Reasonably, robust empirical models will be developed if several dates and sampling-sites are synchronized with more satellite overpasses.

TI  - Long-Term Mapping of a Greenhouse in a Typical Protected Agricultural Region Using Landsat Imagery and the Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The greenhouse is the fastest growing food production approach and has become the symbol of protected agriculture with the development of agricultural modernization. Previous studies have verified the effectiveness of remote sensing techniques for mono-temporal greenhouse mapping. In practice, long-term monitoring of greenhouse from remote sensing data is vital for the sustainable management of protected agriculture and existing studies have been limited in understanding its spatiotemporal dynamics. This study aimed to generate multi-temporal greenhouse maps in a typical protected agricultural region (Shouguang region, north China) from 1990 to 2018 using Landsat imagery and the Google Earth Engine and quantify its spatiotemporal dynamics that occur as a consequence of the development of protected agriculture in the study area. The multi-temporal greenhouse maps were produced using random forest supervised classification at seven-time intervals, and the overall accuracy of the results greater than 90%. The total area of greenhouses in the study area expanded by 1061.94 km(2) from 1990 to 2018, with the largest growth occurring in 1995-2010. And a large number of increased greenhouses occurred in 10-35 km northwest and 0-5 km primary roads buffer zones. Differential change trajectories between the total area and number of patches of greenhouses were revealed using global change metrics. Results of five landscape metrics showed that various landscape patterns occurred in both spatial and temporal aspects. According to the value of landscape expansion index in each period, the growth mode of greenhouses was from outlying to edge-expansion and then gradually changed to infilling. Spatial heterogeneity, which measured by Shannon's entropy, of the increased greenhouses was different between the global and local levels. These results demonstrated the advantage of utilizing Landsat imagery and Google Earth Engine for monitoring the development of greenhouses in a long-term period and provided a more intuitive perspective to understand the process of this special agricultural production approach than relevant social science studies.

AB  - The sensitivity of the backscattering coefficient and the interferometric coherence to surface soil moisture changes and wheat crops growth was analyzed using the time series derived from C-band Sentinel-1. Results show that the interferometric coherence is sensitive to wheat biomass while the backscatter intensity is more influenced by the surface soil moisture (SSM) changes. A new method to retrieve SSM combining the interferometric coherence and C-band backscattering coefficient acquired by Sentinel-1 is tested over two irrigated wheat plots during two growth seasons around Marrakech city (center of Morocco). It is shown that SSM can be estimated with a reasonable accuracy from sowing to harvest (R=0.65; RMSE=0.07 m(3)/m(3); bias=0.01 m(3)/m(3)). These results enhance the potentialities of Sentinel-1 data for SSM retrieval even in the presence of a dense canopy.

Sentinel-1 backscattering coefficient differences between two orbits (morning and evening) are analyzed over an irrigated and voluntarily stressed wheat field. A physical model of backscatter prediction is evaluated for wheat and used to examine the sensitivity of radar differences to the VWC for a range of surface soil moisture and biomass conditions. Results highlight the potential of C-band diurnal differences for the monitoring the water stress over agricultural canopies.

AB  - This study investigates the use of Sentinel-2A (S2A) and Landsat-8 (L8) OLI for monitoring of turbidity in reservoir waters. Using observed in situ data from 18 sampling stations for Chebara Reservoir in Kenya, the study developed an empirical multivariate regression model for turbidity estimation from atmospherically corrected, band adjusted and spectral resolution standardized S2A and L8 bands. Best results for turbidity estimation were obtained from the regression of in situ data with B2 (blue) and B3 (green) bands as [Rrs(B2/B3(boolean AND)2+Rrs((B2/B3)] for S2A and [Rrs((B3/B2)] for L8. Both S2A and L8 retrieved turbidity with high and nearly equal accuracy of R(boolean AND)2 > 0.75 from the visible and NIR bands, with nearly similar RMSE of 0.5 NTU and NMAE% being higher for S2A by more than 30% as compared to L8' s average NMAE% of 15%. The study shows that for both S2A and L8 sensors, and the proposed empirical regression algorithm suffices in the rapid and cost-effective quantification of turbidity inland reservoir waters. Using spatial interpolation for the visualization of the correlation between the predicted and observed turbidity, the L8 results were found to be more significant than the turbidity estimations using S2A bands.

TI  - Political-military crises and vegetation dynamics in Mont Peko National Park in Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its creation, Mont Peko National Park has been subject to various anthropogenic pressures, which increased during the period of armed conflict in Cote d'Ivoire between 2002 and 2011. The intensification of pressures appears to have brought an increased rate of deforestation in the park. To test this hypothesis, this study aimed to determine the effects of the conflict period on forest dynamics in the park. For this purpose, four Landsat satellite images were analysed to examine land use changes before, during and after the period of conflict. Our results show a sharp reduction in forested areas during the period of conflict, followed by further reductions in the post-conflict period. In percentage terms, 5.65% of losses occurred before the conflict period at an annual rate of 0.42%, as against 28.03% during the conflicts at an annual rate of 3.92% and 34.02% after the conflicts at an annual rate of 14.41%. This worsening deforestation in the park is linked to the illegal cultivation of cocoa. Existing pressures have thus been exacerbated by the large-scale arrival of peasant populations in the protected area during the conflict period. Our results also show the vulnerability of protected areas during conflicts and the urgency of taking security measures to prevent the risk of degradation, thus further highlighting the need for constant monitoring and management to accelerate forest regeneration in park areas converted to cocoa plantations.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Commercial six-axis force-torque sensors suffer from being some combination of expensive, fragile, and hard-to-use. We propose a new fiducial-based design which addresses all three points. The sensor uses an inexpensive webcam and can be fabricated using a consumer-grade 3D printer. Open-source software is used to estimate the 3D pose of the fiducials on the sensor, which is then used to calculate the applied force-torque. A browser-based (installation free) interface demonstrates ease-of-use. The sensor is very light and can be dropped or thrown with little concern. We characterize our prototype in dynamic conditions under compound loading, finding a mean R-2 of over 0.99 for the F-x, F-y, M-x, and M-y axes, and over 0.87 and 0.90 for the F-z and M-z axes respectively. The open source design files allow the sensor to be adapted for diverse applications ranging from robot fingers to human-computer interfaces, while the sdesign principle allows for quick changes with minimal technical expertise. This approach promises to bring six-axis force-torque sensing to new applications where the precision, cost, and fragility of traditional strain-gauge based sensors are not appropriate.

M3  - Article
AB  - We are presenting the latest results of multi-sensor observations of short-term pre-earthquake phenomena preceding significant earthquakes. We study satellite thermal infrared radiation (OLR) anomalous signals in association with three major earthquakes, which occurred in Xinjiang province, China at different periods M7.3 of 02.12.2014; M6.2 of 08.12.2012; and M7.2 of 03.20.2008. We systematically apply multi-sensor satellite thermal data and ground temperature /humidity and estimates of the atmospheric chemical potential (ACP) parameter. Data analyses include NOAA NPOESS, the Chinese geostationary satellite FY-2D, and in-situ hourly NOAA data from the Hotan weather station. In all three cases, we detected atmospheric satellite OLR anomalies developed near the epicenter area and ACP increases (significant change for 2008 and 2014, weak for 2012) over the major Altyn Tagh fault lines within 10-20 days before the earthquake event. These findings demonstrate the occurrence and reoccurrence of transient variations of these parameters, implying their connection with the earthquake preparation process.

M3  - Article
AB  - Formulation of the problem. In this article the author describes monitoring of landscape objects within protected area. We created 'image of landscape' from remote sensing data. The developed methodology allows to obtain remotely information about visual changes, to analyze and predict the further development of landscapes of the facies level. It is difficult to investigate nature conservation areas at the facies level in areas with plant diversity. Field methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, but changes can occur frequently. We offer a methodology for identifying indicative landscape objects by creating an image and its visualization using high-resolution satellite imagery decoding Sentinel-2 (resolution 10 m) and Planet Scope (resolution 3 m). This method with using satellite imagery of study makes it possible to gain access to the terrain that is accessible in hard-to-reach places, namely in swampy areas, in dense forest impassable territories and others.The purpose of the article. The main goal is creating methodic for recognition indicative objects of landscape within protected territories through the appearance of visual changes by the cameral method.Materials and methods. We have improved the method of processing satellite images to identify indicative objects of changes in landscapes at the facies level. We used the method of controlled classification to obtain "a picture" of the landscape in office conditions, carried out an analysis of comparison on the ground and identified objects of interest. Based on experiments we chosen supervised classification and methods for different resolution of remote sensing data.Results and scientific novelty. We have changed the traditional landscape study process and approach in our work. We created a landscape rendering model and then carried out work directly on the ground, comparing the characteristics. this allows you to explore the territory at a distance, in hard-to-reach places and in protected areas, which allows a person to analyze information at a distance, predict and take further measures to preserve landscapes and individual objects.Practical significance. Identification of indicative objects within protected areas allows monitoring changes in landscapes, analyzing and taking measures to preserve them. Systematization of the entire analysis during processing allows you to identify changes in time even in hard-to-reach regions and quickly receive information remotely. The analyzed data allow designing a successful combination of the normal functioning of nature and human activity.

TI  - Phenotype Frequencies of Major Blood Group Systems (Rh, Kell, Kidd, Duffy, MNS, P, Lewis, and Lutheran) Among Blood Donors in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia
T2  - JOURNAL OF BLOOD MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The understanding of blood group phenotypes in Saudi Arabia is limited to the ABO and Rh blood groups. Data for the other major blood group phenotypes in different populations have been widely studied and used as a reference for identifying antigennegative blood in hospital blood banks. Such information is crucial for facilitating the challenging task of providing antigen-negative blood for patients with multiple antibodies.Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of the major blood group phenotypes in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia and compare them to phenotypes in other populations.Methods: A total of 100 volunteer Saudi donors were included in this study. Red blood cells from the donors were subjected to antigen typing of the major blood group systems (Rh, Kell, Kidd, Duffy, MNS, Lewis, Lutheran, and P) using the gel microtube technique.Results: From the Rh blood group system, the e antigen was found in 97% of donors, followed by c at 86%. The Cellano (k) antigen of the Kell system was found in all donors, whereas the Kell (K) antigen was only found in 8 % of donors. The K+k- phenotype was not detected in our study. Unexpectedly, for the Duffy blood group system, the null phenotype Fy (a-b-) was found in 61% of donors. In the MNS blood group system, M+N-S+s+ was the most common phenotype at 24%.Conclusion: The frequency of blood group phenotypes in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia differs from that in other populations because of the diverse ethnic backgrounds of those living in that region. The findings of this study can be used to establish a local donor registry to help provide antigen-negative blood for patients with unexpected antibodies or to create an in-house antibody identification panel to add to the commercial panel that would be useful for confirming antibody identification results.

AB  - The conducted research has focused on the anthropogenic phenomenon of induced seismicity and the effects it causes on the terrain surface, i.e. displacements. This is a very dangerous phenomenon that may cause damage of urban infrastructure and poses a threat to human life and health, when its magnitude reaches significant values. The research determined surface displacements caused by induced shock, which occurred on 29.01.2019 on magnitude M = 4.8 in Rudna mine (Legnica-Glogow Copper District, Poland). Sentinel-1 data was used to calculate displacements, which were processed using the DINSAR method in two software: GMT5SAR and SNAP. The maximum displacements obtained in the present study were: 92 mm in the GMTSAR program and 118 mm in the SNAP program. Obtained differences could be caused by individual program settings and implemented algorithms.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXII held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference

AB  - Europe is covered by distinct climatic zones which include semiarid, the Mediterranean, humid subtropical, marine, humid continental, subarctic, and highland climates. Land use and land cover change have been well documented in the past 200 years across Europe 'where land cover grassland and cropland together make up 39%2. In recent years, the agricultural sector has been affected by abnormal weather events. Climate change will continue to change weather patterns, for some regions, this will have a positive impact. For other regions, it will be negative. Hail, heavy rainfall, floods, and droughts may lead to a reduction in agricultural land in some regions with an additional impact on biodiversity. For that reason, major climatic and hydrological variables such as temperature, precipitation, vegetation index, and soil moisture must be regularly monitored and the trends of their deviations from the normal must be observed. This research investigates the quantity of potato production in the future in two stages. In the first stage, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)3 models are used for yield and soil moisture forecasting. The models are trained on a dataset acquired in time series from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS)4 satellite from 2010 to 2019 and are compared by statistics on potato production from EUROSTAT5 at the national scale. In the second stage, the approach uses Support Vector Machine (SVM)6 architecture of Sentinel 2 Vegetation Index satellite imagery together with weather and Sentinel 1 surface soil moisture information for the EU-28 member countries by season 2018 for single potato fields. Agricultural statistical data such as crop calendar, map, production area, yield, and acreage are collected from Eurostat while vector data collection from Land Use and Land Cover Survey (LUCAS) and Land Cover from national to small scale agriculture (CORINE)8. The ARIMA output performances measure Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). RMSE for soil moisture forecasting is 0.3792, 0.2816, 0.2679, 0.2110, and 0.1791 for East, West, South, North, and Centre EU respectively. MSE for potato yield forecasting is 0.0954, 0.081, 0.0589, 0.0447, and 0.0199 for North, Centre, East, South, and West EU respectively. The number of known crop field areas and the distance between them are different for each country and this alters the dimension of the classification input. Two countries of EU-28 do not contain information on potato location while the input dimensions of another two are too big to perform. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis of SVM has been implemented for a total of 24 states. The classification accuracies for kernel Radial Basis function are 98.53% in Austria, 99.39% in Centre of UK, 99.64% in Italia, 99.12% in Bulgaria and Greece, 99.43% in Sweden for Centre, West, South, East, and North EU, respectively, with the Sentinel Vegetation Index. The classification accuracies change with the amount of ground -truth data. The results show that some geographical and socio-economic biases like the chemical composition of the soil or the degree of automation in the agricultural sector are influencing in the statistical analysis.

T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is an essential process for SAR image analysis and interpretation. Recent advances in imaging technologies have allowed data sizes to grow, and a large number of applications in many areas have been generated. However, analysis of high-resolution SAR images, such as classification, is a time-consuming process and high-speed algorithms are needed. In this study, classification of high-speed denoised SAR image patches by using Apache Spark clustering framework is presented. Spark is preferred due to its powerful open-source cluster-computing framework with fast, easy-to-use, and in-memory analytics. Classification of SAR images is realized on patch level by using the supervised learning algorithms embedded in the Spark machine learning library. The feature vectors used as the classifier input are obtained using gray-level cooccurrence matrix which is chosen to quantitatively evaluate textural parameters and representations. SAR image patches used to construct the feature vectors are first applied to the noise reduction algorithm to obtain a more accurate classification accuracy. Experimental studies were carried out using naive Bayes, decision tree, and random forest algorithms to provide comparative results, and significant accuracies were achieved. The results were also compared with a state-of-the-art deep learning method. TerraSAR-X images of high-resolution real-world SAR images were used as data.

AB  - In this study, cutting speed V, feed rate f, depth of cut a and tool radius R of surface roughness R of hardened 42CrMo4 (52 HRC) material with ceramic insert having different Ra, Rz and Rt) and cutting forces (Radial force Fx effect) tangential force Fy and feed force Fz were investigated experimentally. For the experimental design, Taguchi's mixed-level parameter design (L18) was used (2x1.3x3). Signal-to-noise ratio S/N was used to evaluate the test results. Using the Taguchi method, cutting parameters and cutting forces giving optimum surface roughness were determined. Regression analysis is applied to predict surface roughness and cutting forces. ANOVA was used to determine the effects of machining parameters on surface roughness and cutting forces. According to ANOVA analysis, the most important cutting parameters were found to be the cutting depth between feed rate and cutting forces for surface roughness. Verification experiments were performed and it was observed that optimization was applied successfully.

AB  - Normalized different water indices (NDWIs) derived from satellite images are commonly and successfully utilized in surface water body detection and mapping. In this study, the water body detection capability of three NDWI models (NDWI(Green, NIR), NDWI(Green, SWIR1) and NDWI(Green, SWIR2)) generated using 28 multitemporal Landsat-8 OLI multispectral satellite images was analyzed for Atikhisar Dam Lake, the only water source of Canakkalecity's central district in Turkey between 2013 and 2017. This study focused on two important open research questions: (i) Which NDWI model produces the most superior results? and (ii) How much does accuracy change in the use of 15 m and 30 m spatial resolution satellite data? For the accuracy analysis, area values extracted from the NDWI models were compared with in-situ lake area values as measured by the General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI). The results of this study show that as the lake area grows, discrimination of water from other classes is better with NIR region, and that the performance of NDWI(Green, NIR) is relatively better in terms of lake expansion effect. Results also indicate that hydrometeorological factors such as precipitation and evaporation and anthropogenic factors such as irrigation and daily consumption are decisive in lake area variations. The order of accuracy from high to low was found to be NDWI(Green, NIR), NDWI(Green, SWIR1) and NDWI(Green, SWIR2), and 15 m spatial resolution data generated better results than 30 m resolution.

TI  - Detection of oil pollution impacts on vegetation using multifrequency SAR, multispectral images with fuzzy forest and random forest methods
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil pollution harms terrestrial ecosystems. There is an urgent requirement to improve on existing methods for detecting, mapping and establishing the precise extent of oil-impacted and oil-free vegetation. This is needed to quantify existing spill extents, formulate effective remediation strategies and to enable effective pipeline monitoring strategies to identify leakages at an early stage. An effective oil spill detection algorithm based on optical image spectral responses can benefit immensely from the inclusion of multi-frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, especially when the effect of multi-collinearity is sufficiently reduced. This study compared the Fuzzy Forest (FF) and Random Forest (RF) methods in detecting and mapping oil-impacted vegetation from a post spill multispectral optical sentinel 2 image and multifrequency C and X Band Sentinel - 1, COSMO Skymed and TanDEM-X SAR images. FF and RF classifiers were employed to discriminate oil-spill impacted and oil-free vegetation in a study area in Nigeria. Fuzzy Forest uses specific functions for the selection and use of uncorrelated variables in the classification process to yield an improved result. This method proved an efficient variable selection technique addressing the effects of high dimensionality and multi-collinearity, as the optimization and use of different SAR and optical image variables generated more accurate results than the RF algorithm in densely vegetated areas. An Overall Accuracy (OA) of 75% was obtained for the dense (Tree Cover Area) vegetation, while cropland and grassland areas had 59.4% and 65% OA respectively. However, RF performed better in Cropland areas with OA= 75% when SAR-optical image variables were used for classification, while both methods performed equally well in Grassland areas with OA 65%. Similarly, significant backscatter differences (P < 0.005) were observed in the C-Band backscatter sample mean of polluted and oil-free TCA, while strong linear associations existed between LAI and backscatter in grassland and TCA. This study demonstrates that SAR based monitoring of petroleum hydrocarbon impacts on vegetation is feasible and has high potential for establishing oil-impacted areas and oil pipeline monitoring.

AB  - The sheep herding is a typical way of subsistence helping to preserve the steppe character of The Central Bohemian Highlands (in the region of Louny, Czechia). After 1989, herds were liquidated without replacement by other suitable forms of farming. As a result, shrubs started to grow in the steppe areas in the analyzed region. Since 2010, the traditional sheepherding began to return to the Central Bohemian Highlands Protected Landscape Area. The archival remotely sensed data (aerial imagery, satellite imagery) were used to analyze the land-cover change. The archival aerial images for the period 1953 - 2014 were processed to analyze the landscape change. Each of the processed orthophotos was analyzed with a focus on the not original shrubs and trees. Several thousands of points were digitized to analyze the influence of the sheep herding on the land-cover of the steppe grasslands.

AB  - At the Faculty of Environment UJEP, we focus on landscape change detection and environmental monitoring using the methods of geoinformatics the past 20 years. This paper aims to present the methods of remotely (contactless) sensed data used for this purpose. The high-resolution aerial imagery (using the Hasselblad 100MPix camera) is regularly used for monitoring the open-pit mining activity, water-dam lowstands, and in combination with multispectral imagery (satellite and air-born) to monitor and evaluate the health of the forests. The large water dams in this region are on a regular base surveyed with bathymetric mapping allowing evaluation of morphological changes in the water-dam bottoms. The newly acquired laser-scanning device Riegl VUX1-LR is a great tool for modeling the landscape under the trees.

TI  - Estimating canopy LAI and chlorophyll of tropical forest plantation (North India) using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the free and full access to images from Sentinel-2 satellite, the interest to use this data for quantitative retrieval of vegetation parameters is ever-increasing. LAI and chlorophyll are two key variables which are desired for studying productivity, nutrient and stress status of vegetation. Studies carried out on croplands using simulated Sentinel-2 MSI and parametric approach have identified vegetation indices (VIs) with high sensitivity to LAI and chlorophyll. To test how Sentinel-2 red-edge based VIs perform for retrieval of LAI and Chlorophyll of tropical mixed forest canopies, this study has been performed. The field measurements of LAI and chlorophyll content were recorded in a total of 28 ESUs (Elementary Sampling Units) in Bhakra range in the Tarai Central Forest Division, Uttarakhand (India). The in-situ measurements were statistically correlated with Sentinel-2VIs and strength of correlation was validated using Predicted Residual Error Sum of Squares (PRESS) statistic. Field LAI corrected for foliage dumpiness effect improved correlation of VIs with LAI. Among all VIs tested, Normalized Difference Index (NDI) offered highest positive correlation (R-2 = 0.79, p < 0.05) with LAI while Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index (RECI) (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.24 g/m(2), p < 0.05) and Simple Ratio (SR) 740/705 (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 0.27 g/m(2), p < 0.05) were the most closely related to chlorophyll content. VIs with red-edge and NIR combinations offered best results. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Individual tree segmentation is a challenging task due to the labour-intensive and time-consuming work required. Remote sensing data acquired from sensors coupled in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) constitutes a viable alternative to provide a quicker data acquisition, covering broader areas in a shorter period of time. This study aims to use UAV-based multispectral imagery to automatically identify individual trees in a chestnut stand. Tree parameters were estimated allowing its characterization. The leaf area index (LAI) was measured and was correlated with the estimated parameters. A good correlation was found for NDVI (R-2 = 0.76), while this relationship was less evident in the tree crown area and tree height. This way, our results indicate that the use of UAV-based multispectral imagery is a quick and reliable way to determine canopy structural parameters and LAI of chestnut trees.

TI  - The Quebec Low Back Pain Study: a protocol for an innovative 2-tier provincial cohort
T2  - PAIN REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The neurobiological mechanisms underlying recovery from or persistence of low back pain (LBP) remain misunderstood, limiting progress toward effective management. We have developed an innovative two-tier design to study the transition from acute to chronic LBP. The objective of the first tier is to create a provincial web-based infrastructure to recruit and monitor the trajectory of individuals with acute LBP. The objective of the second tier is to fuel hypothesis-driven satellite data collection centers with specialized expertise to study the role of biomechanical, epigenetic, genetic, neuroanatomical, ontological, physiological, psychological, and socioeconomic factors in LBP chronicity. Methods: This article describes the first tier of the protocol: establishment of the Core Dataset and Cohort. Adults with acute LBP will be recruited through networks, media, and health care settings. A web-based interface will be used to collect self-reported variables at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Acute LBP will be defined according to the Dionne 2008 consensus. Measurements will include the Canadian minimum data set for chronic LBP research, DN4 for neuropathic pain, comorbidities, EQ-5D-5L for quality of life, and linkage with provincial medico-administrative databases. The primary outcome will be the transition to chronic LBP, as defined by Deyo 2014. Secondary outcomes include health care resource utilization, disability, sick leave, mood, and quality of life. Perspective: This study brings together diverse research expertise to investigate the transition from acute to chronic LBP, characterize the progression to recovery or chronicity, and identify patterns associated with that progression.

TI  - KLECHALNY CUSTOM AS A SPIRITUAL PHENOMENON OF UKRAINIAN CULTURE
T2  - SKHIDNOIEVROPEISKYI ISTORYCHNYI VISNYK-EAST EUROPEAN HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Purpose of the Article. The research paper aims at introducing a scientifically substantiated characteristics of the klechalny custom, its origin and content within the context of the Ukrainian spiritual culture. The Methodology of the Research. The research methodology is based on the principles of historicism, objectivity and comprehensiveness. The authors have applied the methods of a typological and comparative historical analysis. The Scientific Novelty. The scientific novelty of the obtained results consists in the attempt to reconstruct the tradition of decorating dwellings and farm buildings with tree brandies and herbs as well as to present a new perspective on its origin and semantic content. The Conehasions. In the research it has been proved that the Ukrainians used ritual greener; primarily, to invite deceased relatives to their homes on the eve of Zeleni Sviata (Pentecost holidays) and Holy Trinity Day. Indeed, according to traditional beliefs, all major calendar holidays should occur with the obligatory presence of deceased relatives, since the success of the living people in household management and family life depended on their support and help. The meticulous analysis of the data-based materials suggests that the klechalny custom is very ancient in origin, its roots go back to the historical period when there was no division of deceased people into diffeient categories. The absence of ancient ideas about demons in the Ucrainian worldview testifies to the vague reception of them, their predominant identification with the spirits ofancestors (anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, phytomorphic, not personified); all traditional ceremonies were ended with the ancestors' send-offs, rather than the destruction of "evil". Just only later; the reception of "close ones" (forefathers) and various demonological characters were formed on the basis of the cult of the dead. Simultaneously; we can observe the differentiation in using verdure embellishment, that is to say, in the interior the greenery was designed for "didy" (ancestors) and in the exterior the greenery was designedfirr "nrsalky" (mermaids). In turn, this fact explains the existence ofdifferent ways the Ukrainians treat and deal with the Trinity greenery after the holiday.

AB  - Using the hyperspectral image (HSI) Moffett Field (AVIRIS spectrometer), which is characterized by a high variety of natural and urban environments, we study the decomposition of HSI pixel signatures into empirical modes and low-frequency residues of different orders. For the study, 6 types of objects were selected: 1) vegetation; 2) concrete; 3) soil; 4) seawater (fairway); 5) shallow seawater; 6) salt. HSI noisy channels are automatically detected and excluded from consideration. It is established that the first mode is least correlated with the signature and its low-frequency residue. Correlation grows with an increase in the mode order. Modes of 1-3 orders can be attributed to weakly correlated with the pixel signature, but they carry information about the image. To determine the physical sense of high-frequency modes, the correlation of empirical modes of the same order belonging to different materials was estimated, and a high correlation level between the modes was established, decreasing with increasing the order. The average value of the mutual correlation coefficients of the modes of different objects is: for the first mode - 0.90; for the second - 0.82; the third - 0.74. Supposed that the high correlation of the first modes is associated with the influence of the atmosphere. The potential possibility of using empirical modes in algorithms for correcting the influence of the atmosphere and detecting glare pixels by the magnitude of the amplitude bursts has been established.

TI  - The Notion of Bliss (Ananda) in Hindu Tantric Philosophy: Essentials of Tantric Anandavada
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The interest of Tantric schools to the theme of bliss (ananda) was due to historical and religious reasons. With the development of Tantrism, it was considered that bliss is an integral part of the nature of the Deity itself. Tantric authors constantly mention the word ananda, it is often included in the titles of various Tantric texts. The Tantric "anandavada" ("the doctrine of bliss") can be derived on the basis of primary sources that have come down to us. Tantrism borrows the notion of bliss from the Indian tradition, but gives it its own features. The notion of ananda is manifested in various areas of the Tantric worldview. From the ontological point of view, ananda is integrated into the transcendent reality. In this case, bliss can be understood in three ways. First, ananda is a part of the absolute; secondly, it is a union of two divine principles forming the absolute; thirdly, it is the dynamic aspect of the absolute, its Sakti (ananda-sakti). Tantra also knows various types of bliss per se, building them into a kind of "ladder". In Tantrism, liberation is often associated with bliss. The soteriological bliss is essentially the same as cognitive bliss, since spiritual knowledge is the source of liberation in Tantra. In the course of practical activity, the adept tries to experience the bliss, which becomes for him the guarantee of the future permanent blissful state.

TI  - Optimized Lithological Mapping from Multispectral and Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images Using Fused Multi-Classifiers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most available studies in lithological mapping using spaceborne multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing images employ different classification and spectral matching algorithms for performing this task; however, our experiment reveals that no single algorithm renders satisfactory results. Therefore, a new approach based on an ensemble of classifiers is presented for lithological mapping using remote sensing images in this paper, which returns enhanced accuracy. The proposed method uses a weighted pooling approach for lithological mapping at each pixel level using the agreement of the class accuracy, overall accuracy and kappa coefficient from the multi-classifiers of an image. The technique is implemented in four steps; (1) classification images are generated using a variety of classifiers; (2) accuracy assessments are performed for each class, overall classification and estimation of kappa coefficient for every classifier; (3) an overall within-class accuracy index is estimated by weighting class accuracy, overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for each class and every classifier; (4) finally each pixel is assigned to a class for which it has the highest overall within-class accuracy index amongst all classes in all classifiers. To demonstrate the strength of the developed approach, four supervised classifiers (minimum distance (MD), spectral angle mapper (SAM), spectral information divergence (SID), support vector machine (SVM)) are used on one hyperspectral image (Hyperion) and two multispectral images (ASTER, Landsat 8-OLI) for mapping lithological units of the Udaipur area, Rajasthan, western India. The method is found significantly effective in increasing the accuracy in lithological mapping.

AB  - This work, in the theoretical light of the History of Present Time, proposed to construct an analysis of the History Teaching of the Shoah, more specifically from the audiovisual materials of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, expanding the Brazilian academic research in the field of studies called "Teaching Pedagogy of Collective Traumas". We will try to discuss the set of materials chosen, which include testimonies of survivors of the Shoah, appropriating a content analysis. It was established what these materials elucidate on the teaching of this subject, problematizing its methods and objectives, as well as about the proper role of the teacher as a tool of this teaching. From this perspective, Shoah's History Teaching establishes itself as a possible tool in the fight against fascism, in the negation of revisionist theories, and in the understanding of a new worldview about the moral, ethical and juridical values of society in the post-war.

TI  - A Long-Term Passive Microwave Snowoff Record for the Alaska Region 1988-2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowoff (SO) date-defined as the last day of observed seasonal snow cover-is an important governor of ecologic and hydrologic processes across Alaska and Arctic-Boreal landscapes; however, our understanding and capacity for the monitoring of spatial and temporal variability in the SO date is still lacking. In this study, we present a 6.25 km spatially gridded passive microwave (PMW) SO data record, complimenting current Alaskan SO records from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Landsat, but extending the SO record an additional 13 years. The PMW SO record was validated against in situ snow depth observations and showed favorable accuracy (0.66-0.92 mean correlations; 2-10 day mean absolute errors) for the major climate regions of Alaska. The PMW SO results were also within 10 days of finer spatial scale SO observational records, including Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS), MODIS, and Landsat, for a majority (75%) of Alaska. However, the PMW record showed a general SO delay at higher elevations and across the Alaska North Slope, and earlier SO in the Alaska interior and southwest regions relative to the other SO records. Overall, we assign an uncertainty +/-11 days to the PMW SO. The PMW SO record benefits from the near-daily temporal fidelity of underlying brightness temperature (Tb) observations and reveals a mean regional trend in earlier SO timing (-0.39 days yr(-1)), while significant (p < 0.1) SO trend areas encompassed 11% of the Alaska domain and ranged from -0.11 days yr(-1) to -1.31 days yr(-1) over the 29-year satellite record. The observed SO dates also showed anomalous early SO dates during markedly warm years. Our results clarify the pattern and rate of SO changes across Alaska, which are interactive with global warming and contributing to widespread permafrost degradation, changes in regional hydrology, ecosystems, and associated services. Our results also provide a robust means for SO monitoring from satellite PMW observations with similar precision as more traditional and finer scale observations.

In recent years, the global navigation satellite system-interferometric reflection (GNSS-IR) has become a new type of remote sensing technology with low cost, all-weather capability, and a high temporal resolution. It has been widely used in the fields of snow depth, sea level, soil moisture content, and vegetation water content. The normalized microwave reflectance index (NMRI) based on GNSS-IR technology has been proven to be effective in monitoring changes in VWC. This paper considers the advantages and disadvantages of remote sensing technology and GNSS-IR technology in estimating VWC. A point-surface fusion method of GNSS-IR and MODIS data based on the GA-BP neural network is proposed to improve the accuracy of VWC estimation. The vegetation index products (NDVI, GPP, LAI) and the NMRI that unified the temporal and spatial resolution were used as the input and output data of the training model, and the GA-BP neural network was used for training and modeling. Finally, a spatially continuous NMRI product was generated. Taking a particular area of the United States as a research object, experiments show that (1) a neural network can realize the effective fusion of GNSS-IR and MODIS products. By comparing the GA-BP neural network, BP neural network, and multiple linear regression (MLR), the three models fusion effect. The results show that the GA-BP neural network has the best modeling effect, and the r and RMSE between the model estimation result and the reference value are 0.778 and 0.0332, respectively; this network is followed by the BP neural network, in which the r and RMSE are 0.746 and 0.0465, respectively. MLR has the poorest effect, with r and RMSE values of 0.500 and 0.0516, respectively. (2) The spatiotemporal variation in the 16 days/500 m resolution NMRI product obtained by GA-BP neural network fusion is consistent with that in the experimental area. Through the testing of GNSS stations that did not participate in the modeling, the r between the estimated value of the NMRI and the reference value is greater than 0.87, and the RMSE is less than 0.049. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper is optional and effective. The spatially continuous NMRI products obtained by fusion can reflect the changes in VWC in the experimental area more intuitively.

TI  - Nonuniformly-Rotating Ship Refocusing in SAR Imagery Based on the Bilinear Extended Fractional Fourier Transform
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nonuniformly-rotating ship refocusing is very significant in the marine surveillance of satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The majority of ship imaging algorithms is based on the inverse SAR (ISAR) technique. On the basis of the ISAR technique, several parameter estimation algorithms were proposed for nonuniformly rotating ships. But these algorithms still have problems on cross-terms and noise suppression. In this paper, a refocusing algorithm for nonuniformly rotating ships based on the bilinear extended fractional Fourier transform (BEFRFT) is proposed. The ship signal in a range bin can be modeled as a multicomponent cubic phase signal (CPS) after motion compensation. BEFRFT is a bilinear extension of fractional Fourier transform (FRFT), which can estimate the chirp rates and quadratic chirp rates of CPSs. Furthermore, BEFRFT has excellent performances on cross-terms and noise suppression. The results of simulated data and Gaofen-3 data verify the effectiveness of BEFRFT.

AB  - The Colville River is the largest river basin (similar to 53,000 km(2)) in Alaskan Arctic. The residents of Nuiqsut, an established Alaska Native community of similar to 400 people, rely heavily on the Colville for their subsistence needs. Nonetheless, the changing river dynamics caused by accelerated bank erosion and consequent river siltation is making travel on the Colville increasingly difficult and in some cases dangerous. We used summer 2017 scenes from three optical sensors (PlanetScope, Sentinel 2, and Landsat) with resolution ranging from 3 - 30 m along with field measurements of water-depth to map shallow-water sites along a 45-km stretch of the Colville River. We found a strong correlation (R-2 = 0.9) between field-measured water depths and image-derived reflectance quantity (natural log ratio of green over red bands). We also analyzed a relative depth mapping technique which can be used to map shallow-water sites from optical images in the absence of field-measured water depths.

AB  - The remote sensing imageries are helpful in monitoring the urban environment, specifically the growth analysis of urban impervious surfaces as they can provide quick and accurate information about these surfaces over the large geographical areas. The recently developed high spatial and spectral resolution hyperspectral sensors are capable of extracting impervious surfaces with very high accuracy. Therefore, this study utilizes AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data of Jodhpur, Rajasthan region of India for the analysis. Further, on the basis of existing literature, RGB and NIR bands are selected for generation of three Impervious Surface Index (ISI). The results of the analysis suggest that, Green-NIR combination provides best extraction result with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 95.20 %, while result of Blue-NIR with OA 90.28 % appears to be better than Red-NIR, which is having OA as 85.29 %. These results have also been verified using histogram plot of various urban land cover classes.

AB  - To monitor changes in the landscapes at local to regional scales, a large amount of multi-temporal remote sensing products are required for the analysis. Due to the frequent need for remote sensing-based results, research as well as commercial organizations required automated, faster and more efficient methods for downloading and subsequently, processing the enormous amount of such remote sensing datasets. In this study, we have designed and developed geospatial data processing frameworks enriched with automated data search, download, and processing of Sentinel-1,-2 data. The analysis-ready outputs i.e. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and radar backscatter (sigma degrees) etc. are essential in operational remote sensing use cases such as crop area, crop health, crop loss mapping. The overall framework for Sentinel-1,-2 has been successfully implemented in the Python programming environment.

TI  - Analysis of relationship between cereal yield and NDVI for selected regions of Central Europe based on MODIS satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation satellite technologies allow the status of crops to be assessed at various geographical scales. The most popular vegetation index for analyzing this status is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This article studies the relationship between the NDVI and cereal-grain yield in selected regions (corresponding to NUTS2 levels) of four Central European countries: Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. The remote sensing data cover the vegetation seasons (from the beginning of March until the end of June) of 2012-2016, and were obtained using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor of NASA's Terra satellite. The average NDVI of the data was calculated for both the entire area and the arable-land area of the regions (according to the Corine Land Cover program). Statistical analysis includes correlation and linear regression analyses between cereal grain yield and mean NDVI for entire area and arable land of the regions in each year of the study. They are strongly correlated from the beginning of March until mid-May (most of the correlation coefficients for arable land are between 0.50 and 0.85), the strongest relationship being around the beginning of April in the Czech Republic and Slovakia (most of the correlation coefficients are between 0.80 and 1.00). In most regions of Poland, the relationships are quite strong, but in German regions they are weak and inconsistent. Regression coefficients (slopes) for relationships between the NDVI in the beginning of April and the grain yield of cereals range from 10.8 to 26.2. This means that an increase in the NDVI in early spring by 0.1 unit increases the grain yield of cereals by about 1.1-2.6 t/ha. The obtained results are promising because they prove the possibility of forecasting cereal grain yield at the regional level, three-four months before the harvest, which is important for planning food policy.

AB  - A prompt and accurate assessment of building damage is critical for disaster assistance and emergency monitoring. Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has become one of the most effective methods in damage assessment, owing to its all-weather/all-time observation ability and abundant polarization scattering information of target. In this study, we discussed the distribution law of Touzi decomposition polarization parameters before and after building collapse, based on the ALOS PALSAR data in the L band and the simulated SAR images in the Ku band. The experimental results show that the alpha(s1) component obtained by Touzi decomposition can be used for building damage assessment, and is universal in L-band and Ku-band SAR images.

TI  - Identifying spectral features of characteristics of <i>Sphagnum</i> to assess the remote sensing potential of peatlands: A case study in China
T2  - MIRES AND PEAT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sphagnum mosses are the dominant species of natural peatlands, which are important in the global carbon cycle. There is increasing interest in the use of sensors mounted on satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles in association with management of the ecological resources of peatlands, e.g. for monitoring purposes. Since Sphagnum mosses grow with many other vascular plants in the same habitat, the spectral signals of Sphagnum moss pixels in the remote sensing image are mixed, so investigation of their spectral characteristics forms a basis for remote sensing of peatlands. In this study, the spectral characteristics of Sphagnum magellanicum Brid were analysed at various levels (field and laboratory hyperspectral, laboratory plant physiology, satellite sensors) and compared with those of other plants, in order to examine the potential for developing remote sensing methods to distinguish Sphagnum. The results showed that: (1) the unique spectral characteristics of S. magellanicum that might be used to distinguish it from other plants are located in the near-infrared and shortwave infrared (NIR-SWIR; 760-2400 nm) region of the reflectance spectrum, and especially in the two water absorption bands (980 and 1150 nm); (2) the cell structure of S. magellanicum (which is the basis of its large water-holding capacity) explains the very low reflectance in the NIR-SWIR and the sensitivity of reflectance in the IR to moisture; and (3) the identification of Sphagnum from satellite remote sensing data should be based on sensors which have more infrared channels such as Sentinel-2A MSI, and on vegetation indices established in the NIR-SWIR such as MSI (moisture stress index) and NDII (normalised difference infrared index).

AB  - The Western Region of Paraguay is naturally dry which makes it vulnerable to almost permanent drought events. Hence, low cost drought monitoring is necessary. Therefore, an index derived from satellite image information was used for this purpose. The Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI) was used with the objective of studying the characteristics (temporal and spatial distribution) of drought in the Western Region of Paraguay from years 2005 to 2017 and relate drought point values of NDDI to the land use cover of the study area. Terra satellite's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensor images were used for the calculation of NDDI. The driest month of all years (July) and the wettest month of all years (December) were averaged to analyze spatial tendencies. The NDDI was contrasted spatially with the Land Use Cover of the Western Region to pinpoint the location of the highest values. The year 2015 had the highest value of 0.9847 in agricultural land use in the Department of Boqueron. The NDDI was a good indicator of drought throughout the region and could be a complement for in-situ measurements.

Lately, there is a growing evidence for an ophthalmologic symptom (conjunctivitis) to be connected with the disease. This seems to happen in early stages of the infection by SARS-CoV-2, and thus, it is of major importance to understand the mechanism through which the virus can facilitate such a symptom. Here, we are proposing a molecular mechanism through which the novel coronavirus could act in order to affect the eye and use it as another, secondary but alternative, point of entry to the host organism.

AB  - High precision remote analysis of biochemical variables can enable scientists to obtain very crucial information about crop plants. This information can help in the development of future strategies to protect the crops from different biotic and abiotic stresses thus improving the growth, yield and productivity of crops. Using Sentinel-2 data in combination of drone data for assessing biochemical variables in crop plants is the best choice for timely and accurate monitoring of these variables in the field. As Sentinel-2 data have high temporal as well as spatial resolution and also visible, infrared and red-edge region spectral bands which are highly sensitive to different vegetation properties. It is observed that these bands not only solve the problem of assessing the different crop variables, but its derivatives can provide detailed information on spectral features of crop plants in the form of vegetation indices. Also, for assessing the crop biochemical variable with satellite imagery, the challenge is the accurate identification of that particular agriculture field where the crop has to be monitored. For this purpose, precise agriculture field information is required, which can be obtained using drone images. Therefore, in this paper, a study is conducted to explore the possibility of Sentinel-2 band derivatives, i.e., vegetation indices in analyzing the sensitivity for biochemical variables of different varieties of sugarcane crops. A correlation analysis is carried out for sensitivity analysis between satellite-derived parameters and crop plant biochemical variables. It is observed that the maximum biochemical variables were quite sensitive with different vegetation indices.

AB  - Bioenergy plants are widely used as a form of renewable energy. It is important to monitor the vegetation and accurately estimate the yield before harvest in order to maximize the profit and reduce the costs of production. The automatic tracking of plant development by traditional methods is quite difficult and labor intensive. Nowadays, the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) became more and more popular in precision agriculture. Detailed, precise, three-dimensional (3D) representations of energy forestry are required as a prior condition for an accurate assessment of crop growth. Using a small UAV equipped with a multispectral camera, we collected imagery of 1051 pictures of a study area in Kompolt, Hungary, then the Pix4D software was used to create a 3D model of the forest canopy. Remotely sensed data was processed with the aid of Pix4Dmapper to create the orthophotos and the digital surface model. The calculated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values were also calculated. The aim of this case study was to do the first step towards yield estimation, and segment the created orthophoto, based on tree species. This is required, since different type of trees have different characteristics, thus, their yield calculations may differ. However, the trees in the study area are versatile, there are also hybrids of the same species present. This paper presents the results of several segmentation algorithms, such as those that the widely used eCognition provides and other Matlab implementations of segmentation algorithms.

T2  - ALTRE MODERNITA-RIVISTA DI STUDI LETTERARI E CULTURALI
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetal flotsam - undesirable or discarded and dead vegetation - holds and important position in the poetic imagery of Theodore Roethke's production of the 1930s and '40. In Roethke's first two volumes (Open House and The Lost Son and Other Poems), weeds and dead plants are the protagonists of poems that are strikingly different from each other in style and content. "Long Live the Weeds" - Roethke's "rewriting" of Gerard Manley Hopkins' "Inversnaid" - expresses a reassuring worldview where "the ugly of the universe" is a necessary and even joyfully welcomed part of the universe's natural order. In the "Lost Son Narratives" the faith in such idea is cyclically lost and reconquered by the conscience perceiving nature in its concreteness. In the Greenhouse Poems the interaction between the crude and simple representation of uprooted and decomposing plants, in particular poems like "Weed Puller" and "Flower Dump", and the sequence's portrayal of the entire vital balance of the greenhouse conveys an even more problematic and open-ended view of nature. As a thorough analysis and comparison of "Long Live the Weeds!" (first published in 1936) and sections the two aforementioned poetic sequences (published in their entirety in 1948) will show, in Roethke's first two collections, the evolution of his modes of representation of vegetal flotsam mirrors the evolution of his conception of nature and existence.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires have increased at an alarming rate in recent years, with multiple consequences in Nepal's forest ecosystem and landscapes. The research used remote sensing and GIS technology as well as statistical tools for developing forest fires risk models in two major landscapes of Nepal, i.e., Terai Arc Landscape (TAL) and Chitwan Annapurna Landscape (CHAL). A multi-parametric weighted index model was adopted to derive and demarcate the forest fire-risk map with risk variables such as vegetation, topographic factors, land surface temperature, and proximity to the road and settlements. To enhance the use of a fire risk map, collinearity between variables was checked (VIF <2) and validated with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) hotspots and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method. The MODIS hotspot data from 2001 to 2018 was also evaluated which indicates that the number of fire counts has a strong relation (R-2 =0.82) with the burn area. Broadleaved forest in the pre-monsoon season is highly vulnerable to forest fire. More than half of the total forested area (65%) is in high fire risk, particularly in the TAL region. The study results could assist the decision-makers to implement preventive measures by minimizing the risk and impacts of forest fires.

AB  - Compromised relays in clustered IoT networks can be used to launch attacks that cannot be easily detected using the traditional security algorithms. In this paper, we consider an attack where a compromised relay deliberately drops the packets received from the IoT devices it serves. Such an attack causes the IoT devices to retransmit more frequently, thereby increasing their processing load. As a result, their batteries will drain at a faster rate. The difficulty in differentiating a genuine packet drop event from a malicious packet drop event makes it necessary to develop a novel Intrusion Detection System (IDS) specially tailored for detecting such an attack. The IDS is installed in a special node called a sentinel, which monitors the network. The sentinel also estimates the packet retransmission rate of the IoT devices, a parameter required for the IDS. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated experimentally on a clustered network.

TI  - A Statistical Model for Estimation of Soil Moisture in Paddy Field Using Microwave Satellite Data
T2  - PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH M
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of soil moisture using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter values, over agricultural area, is still difficult. SAR backscatter is sensitive to the surface properties like roughness, crop cover, and soil type, along with its strong sensitivity to soil moisture. Hence, to develop a methodology for agricultural area soil moisture estimation using SAR, it is necessary to incorporate the effects of crop cover and soil texture in the soil moisture retrieval model. A field experiment was conducted by the authors and used along with Sentinel 1A SAR data to estimate the soil moisture in the paddy agricultural fields. Generally, the water used for irrigation in the study region was obtained from ground water. As in the hot climate conditions ground water level would be reduced, and the water for irrigation must be supplied optimally. Hence, available soil moisture in the field was estimated from SAR data on the day of satellite passing the crop fields and utilized for deciding the amount of water to be supplied. The soil moisture values of soil samples that are collected from the agricultural field are calculated with the laboratory experiments. A soil moisture retrieval model is derived and proposed in this paper after a comparative analysis of experimental soil moisture values and satellite values. The feasibility of above model for paddy agricultural fields is validated using the field measurements.

TI  - Monitoring of Agricultural Areas by using Sentinel 2 Image Time Series and Deep Learning Techniques
T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVI
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - This paper presents a system that aims to exploit Sentinel 2 image Time Series (TSs) and deep learning techniques to perform agricultural monitoring in large areas. Although deep learning proved its effectiveness to classify optical multispectral data, this peculiar classification task shows many challenges: (1) the considered TSs are noisy due to the presence of clouds that corrupts the multitemporal spectral signature, thus affecting the classification results, (2) TSs of different tiles are made up of images acquired in different dates (different temporal sampling), and (3) a large training database of labeled samples is needed to train the deep model from scratch. To address these problems, this paper presents an approach based on three main steps: (1) a preprocessing step that aims to generate temporally homogeneous TSs of images across tiles that accurately represent the phenological behavior of the crops, (2) a training set extraction step that automatically establishes a large training database leveraging publicly available thematic products, and (3) a multitemporal deep learning classification where a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network is used for crop type mapping. Experimental results show that the proposed system architecture is promising for solving large-scale problems. The considered deep architecture achieved the most balanced classification results compared to existing state-of-the-art method, obtaining a mean Fscore (F1%) of 78.32% and an Overall Accuracy (OA%) of 85.86.

TI  - A Covariance-Based Approach to Merging InSAR and GNSS Displacement Rate Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with the integration of deformation rates derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. The proposed approach relies on knowledge of the variance/covariance of both InSAR and GNSS measurements so that they may be combined accounting for the spectral properties of their errors, hence preserving all spatial frequencies of the deformation detected by the two techniques. The variance/covariance description of the output product is also provided. A performance analysis is carried out on realistic simulated scenarios in order to show the boundaries of the technique. The proposed approach is finally applied to real data. Five Sentinel-1A/B stacks acquired over two different areas of interest are processed and discussed. The first example is a merged deformation map of the northern part of the Netherlands for both ascending and descending geometries. The second example shows the deformation at the junction between the North and East Anatolian Fault using three consecutive descending stacks.

AB  - Extrinsic contrast agents with excellent light absorption properties in the second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1350 nm) region can be a key to enhance the contrast of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in deep tissues. Here, we demonstrated a photoacoustic (PA) contrast agent at 1064 nm optical wavelength for deep-tissue in vivo PAI. We successfully synthesized nickel(II) dithiolene-based polymeric nanoparticles (NNP) that have strong absorption at NIR-II light and generate improved PA signal with a 1064 nm pulse laser. To confirm the feasibility of the NNP, we have conducted both in vitro and in vivo PA experiments and acquired highly contrast-enhanced PA images. We successfully obtained contrast-enhanced PA images of a tube filled with NNP deeply located below several layers of chicken tissue. The maximum PAI penetration depth was about 5 cm. Next, we performed bladder, sentinel lymph node and gastrointestinal tract, which are clinically important, PAI in rats to confirm that NNP could be utilized as a PA agent in deep tissues in vivo. NNP was injected into each of the three cases, and we confirmed that PA contrast was significantly increased after the injections. These results demonstrate that the enhanced PA signals generated by irradiating 1064 nm laser to NNP in deep-tissue has sufficient contrast for PAI. Based on the excellent absorbability of NNP at 1064 nm and the translability of clinical PAI systems, this study is expected to provide a great opportunity for a variety of studies on non-invasive deep tissue in vivo.

AB  - Photoacoustic imaging is gaining great attention in the medical world due to its significant potential for clinical translation. Light excitation in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window (1000-1350 nm) has resolution and penetration depth suitable for several clinical applications. However, the significant challenge exists for clinical translation because of the absence of notable intrinsic chromophores in this clinically significant optical range to generate diagnostic images.Methods: We present newly developed a biocompatible nickel dithiolene-based polymeric nanoparticle (NiPNP), which have a strong and sharp absorption peak at 1064 nm, as a photoacoustic contrast agent to boost specific absorbance in the NIR-II window for in vivo deep tissue imaging.Results: We confirm the enhanced PA signal by NiPNP's strong light absorption in the NIR-II window (287% higher than that of NIR-I) and deep tissue imaging capability (similar to 5.1 cm) through in vitro experiment. We have successfully acquired diagnostic-quality in vivo photoacoustic images in deep tissue (similar to 3.4 cm) of sentinel lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tracts, and bladders of live rats by using clinically viable imaging system.Conclusions: Our results prove that with strong absorption in the NIR-II window and with deeper imaging depth, the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging with NiPNP is feasible for preclinical studies and thus would facilitate further clinical investigations.

TI  - Axillary Sampling as an Alternative Option for Complete Nodal Response in Triple Negative and HER2 Type Breast Cancer Patients after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - Journal of Breast Disease
M3  - research-article
AB  - Purpose: In patients with locally advanced breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is widely used. It has a distinct advantage in the downstaging of the primary tumor and provides important information about treatment response. With its increasing usage, concerns over the appropriate management of the axilla have emerged. In this study, we compared oncological outcomes of conventional axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) over axillary sampling (AS) with radiotherapy (RT) in patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: In this retrospective study, we included female patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2 type breast cancer who underwent breast and axillary surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy between May 2011 to December 2016. A total of 89 patients’ medical records were eligible for analysis. We defined AS as removal of at least four axillary lymph nodes located near the sentinel lymph nodes without full exposure of the axillary vein, long thoracic nerve, and thoracodorsal nerve. Results: The median follow-up period was 47.00 months. The disease-free survival was 69.66 months in the AS with RT group and 69.02 months in the ALND group (p=0.280). The invasive disease-free survival was 75.16 months in the AS with RT group and 78.44 months in the ALND group (p=0.218). Conclusion: AS with radiotherapy might be a feasible surgical option in patients with TNBC and HER2 type breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

AB  - Predicting road traffic speed is a challenging task due to different types of roads, abrupt speed change and spatial dependencies between roads; it requires the modeling of dynamically changing spatial dependencies among roads and temporal patterns over long input sequences. This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal graph attention (ST-GRAT) that effectively captures the spatio-temporal dynamics in road networks. The novel aspects of our approach mainly include spatial attention, temporal attention, and spatial sentinel vectors. The spatial attention takes the graph structure information (e.g., distance between roads) and dynamically adjusts spatial correlation based on road states. The temporal attention is responsible for capturing traffic speed changes, and the sentinel vectors allow the model to retrieve new features from spatially correlated nodes or preserve existing features. The experimental results show that ST-GRAT outperforms existing models, especially in difficult conditions where traffic speeds rapidly change (e.g., rush hours). We additionally provide a qualitative study to analyze when and where ST-GRAT tended to make accurate predictions during rush-hour times.

AB  - This study, by introducing and examining a “Critical Rereading-Group Discussion-Critical Rewriting” example class, from the standpoint of gender equality, aims to prove that this class model is a meaningful tool that can be used in education on both gender equality and writing simultaneously. “A Lucky Day” by Jin-geon Hyun was used as the basic text.Activities such as drawing a mind map of keywords on gender inequality, finding proverbs and expressions containing gender discrimination, and looking for problematic parts and evidence in “A Lucky Day” were carried out through a group discussion. Then, based on the discussion, each student rewrote the story individually. In their recreated works, they criticized characters’ problematic actions and remedied some of them through various methods, including taking on the role of a character, restructuring the story, and changing the time setting.They also sought solutions to gender problems and reflected on current situations of gender equality. They took various sharp, fresh approaches to describing the characters, structuring the story, building themes, and so on. In this writing class, most students seized the opportunity to reflect on their own opinions and change their views concerning gender problems. At the same time, they learned about the benefits of rereading and rewriting.If the class model is modified or extended, critical rewriting can be applied to other themes. Likewise, the theme of gender equality can be combined with many different types of writing. It is expected that critical rewriting will help college students overcome their limited mindsets and worldview, and thus, grow as social beings who have more balanced views and take action to support what is right.

Since peat soils consist of large organic matter, it is important for the carbon cycle in the tropical area. This study aimed at the delineating of the distribution of drainage canals using microwave images. As the result of validation, overall accuracy was 56.3 % and about 10 % of the peatland areas detected as the drainage canals. For further study, a Keetch Byram Drought Index-based groundwater table will be revised applying the decreasing effect by drainage canals.

TI  - Satellite-Based Estimation of Carbon Dioxide Budget in Tropical Peatland Ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatland ecosystems are known as large carbon (C) reservoirs and affect spatial and temporal patterns in C sinks and sources at large scales in response to climate anomalies. In this study, we developed a satellite data-based model to estimate the net biosphere exchange (NBE) in Indonesia and Malaysia by accounting for fire emissions (FE), ecosystem respiration (R-e), and gross primary production (GPP). All input variables originated from satellite-based datasets, e.g., the precipitation of global satellite mapping of precipitation (GSMaP), the land surface temperature (LST) of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), the photosynthetically active radiation of MODIS, and the burned area of MODIS fire products. First, we estimated the groundwater table (GWT) by incorporating LST and precipitation into the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI). The GWT was validated using in-situ measurements, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 24.97 cm and an r-squared (R-2) of 0.61. The daily GWT variations from 2002 to 2018 were used to estimate respiration (R-e) based on a relationship between the in situ GWT and flux-tower-observed R-e. Fire emissions are a large direct source of CO2 from terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere and were estimated by using MODIS fire products and estimated biomass. The GPP was calculated based on the MODIS GPP product after parameter calibration at site scales. As a result, averages of long-term (17 years) R-e, GPP, FE, and NBE from whole peatlands in the study area (6 degrees N-11 degrees S, 95-141 degrees E) were 66.71, 39.15, 1.9, and 29.46 Mt C/month, respectively. We found that the NBE from tropical peatlands in the study area was greater than zero, acting as a C source. R-e and FE were influenced by El Nino, and the value of the NBE was also high in the El Nino period. In future studies, the status of peatland degradation should be clarified in detail to accurately estimate the C budget by applying appropriate algorithms of R-e with delineations of types of anthropogenic impacts (e.g., drainages and fires).

AB  - Hazardous Noxious Substance (HNS) is transported entirely through large vessels, so there is always a potential risk of marine HNS spills. In the event of an HNS accident, it can cause enormous human and property damage, so prompt detection is required. However, there is a limit to human access by ship, we need to use remote sensing data. In this study, ground experiments using hyperspectral cameras were performed to construct a spectral library of HNS. We classified the HNS and non-HNS by applying the hyperspectral mixture algorithm, and presented the HNS detection probability for every pixel by calculating the spectrum-based abundance fraction. The results of this study are expected to be used to estimate the extent of HNS spill in the event of a marine HNS accident.

TI  - The Four Books and Confucian Ecological View
T2  - 선교와신학
M3  - research-article
AB  - This article aims to explore a Confucian ecological worldview based on “The Four Books, ” which are “The Great Learning, The Works of Mencius, The Analects of Confucius, and The Doctrine of the Mean, ” that can offer a worthy resource for an antidote to the contemporary environmental circumstances. The contemporary people have accomplished rapid economic and scientific development, however, they have stressed these to the damage of the environment, which leads to an ecological crisis. In that sense, we need to look at the Confucian tradition, as found in the Four Books, which has much to provide the contemporary need for the creation of and a conversion to an ecologically friendly worldview. In exploring environmental issues through the Confucian tradition, I select the Four Books for two reasons: first, Confucians treat the Four Books as their canonical ones, and second, they utilize their canonical books in disordered circumstances like an ecological crisis. My assertion is that teachings from the Four Books can provide us an overview of environmental ethics that is necessary to build up the basic ground for a completely new and proper way to approach the present ecological crisis. In this study, I will claim the benefits of grounding a Confucian ecological dialogue in an understanding of these texts that Chu Hsi (1130-1200) defined as ‘the central of the Confucian canon.’ In the light of the Four Books, I will proceed in the following way: first, I will discover how the language used by Confucian thinkers offers environmentally friendly metaphors, second, I will explore the organic cosmology of Confucianism linked to the Way of Heaven, third, I will investigate the reciprocal relationship between human beings and ecology, which, and fourth, I will scrutinize the notion of the sage, a perfect model for humanity to follow. In a nutshell, the Four Books could invite contemporary people toward an environmentally conscious life and offer guideline for harmony and love between people and our natural neighbor.

AB  - This article examined the methodology of Confucius’ philosophical counseling.First, writer outlined fundamental concern and stage of life of Concucianism. Thiswork explained that Confucianism is “philosophy as an art of living”, which havevarious practical wisdoms and techniques for solving the problems of life. Next, writerdiscussed the methodological characterisitc of Seo(恕). Particularly, Seo means amethod of embodied knowing based on empathy and its purpose is to acquire apronesis through a unity of wisdoms and methods. Finally, writer elucidated thecharacteristics of Zhongyong(中庸) from the perspective of methodology. Whenconsidering its specific feature, it have indicated a dynamic sense of balance of mindand affairs in everyday life thorugh pursuing a sense of the middle way. Inconclusion, Seo and Zhongyong can be difined as ‘“Beyond-Method” Method’or‘“Non-Method” methodology’which consisted of unitification of virtue and method.this methodological worldview in Confucianism provide implications for modernphilosophical counseling. Especially it suggests that counselor refrains from activelyintervening in the counseling process and pays attention to the client's peculiarpersonality, needs, intellectual level, and solution ability. In addition to, it is orientedto induce awareness that clients can voluntarily reflect on their problems within thenarrative structure of their lives and solve them in a middle way.

AB  - This study examines the construction of the system and topography of the modern Korean crafts industry through the life of Yoo Kangyul, a craftsman and printmaker, born in 1920 during the Japanese colonial rule and ended on the road of economic growth in Korea in 1976. He began his full-fledged activities after the Korean War, and was at the site of the institutional foundation of contemporary art in the spectrum of national reconstruction and modernization. While helping to systematize specialized areas of art such as education and exhibitions, he created the territory of the art&craft world, while steadily expressing his desire for art into works. At that time, the situation of the artist, who moved between the establishment of an institution through participation in the public domain and the artist’s will to express it, can be guessed. The main content of this study is to examine the contemporary worldview and art issues, focusing on the specific process of this. In the introduction, as the term ‘art&craft world’ suggests from the issue of the Korean situation, art system, and genre boundaries since the 1950s, we looked at the situation in which the craft landscape was built by the institutions through majors and exhibitions by experts. Next, the activities of the Korean Art and Culture Research Institute under the National Museum of Korea and the Korean Craft Demonstration Center, which are two large institutions that establish the craft industry, were reviewed. Finally, we will see the problems of the educational system in the craft world through the system and the desire for free art to escape from the system and realm through the reading of the work. This is a historical example that reminds us of the dilemma of the system and domain of tradition and modern dualization, overlapping and connotation with contemporary art, intersection with design, and separation from the art world beyond the time when Kangyul Yoo lived and until today.

AB  - Based on monthly average groundwater recharge over a nearly 10 year period, results of fully integrated hydrologic modeling of SWAT-MODFLOW, land cover, land use, soil type and hydrologic response unit (HRU) was used to assess the dominant influencing factors of groundwater recharge spatial patterns in Jangseong district. As dominant factors, land cover was FRSE (forest-evergreen) and soil type was Samgag. Landsat-8 OLI imaging spectrometer data were acquired in the period 2003 to 2004 and seasonal bare soil lines (BSL) were estimated through NIR-RED plot. Extent of slope of BSL was from 1.092 to 1.343 and the intercept was from -0.004 to -0.015. To know correlation between spatial groundwater recharge and soil-vegetation indices (PVI, NDVI, NDTI, NDRI), this study employed frequency and regression analysis. On May, RED band increased up 3 to 4 times compared to other seasons and only one turning point appeared as recharge-index with upward parabola bell shape as results of existing research. Considering precipitation, if the various studies for relationship between groundwater recharge and soil-vegetation index just like NDVI are performed, it is possible to estimate groundwater recharge through analyzing remote sensing data.

AB  - This paper presents a simple microwave backscattering model achieved by reducing the number of input parameters, based on sensitivity examinations of the input parameters of the 1st-order radiative transfer(RT) model. The proposed model can be used to compute the microwave backscattering coefficients in agricultural areas. First, we generated an extensive database of microwave backscattering coefficients corresponding to various vegetation and surface conditions, using the 1st-order RT technique. This database comprises the backscattering coefficients of agricultural areas acquired via COSMO-SkyMed synthetic aperture radar and the Hongik polarimetric scatterometer and also the backscattering coefficients computed using existing scattering models and in-situ measured ground-truth data corresponding to radar data. Subsequently, we examine the sensitivity of the input parameters based on the difference between backscattering coefficients and global sensitivity analyses. Among a total of 32 input parameters, based on the sensitivities calculated for various vegetation types, frequencies, and ranges, 12 input parameters of the RT model exhibited the highest sensitivity.Thereafter, we verified the accuracy of the proposed simple scattering model for agricultural areas. The root mean square error(RMSE) between the measurement data and the simple model is approximately 0.95 dB, whereas the RMSE between the measurement data and the 1st-order RT model is 0.91 dB. Although the number of input parameters for the simple model is reduced by approximately one third, the accuracy of the scattering model is maintained.

AB  - This paper addresses two subjects: the current state of religion in French West Africa, and Christian missions in Burkina Faso. French-speaking West Africa accounts for one-third of Africa and holds a very important position in terms of mission strategy. However, fewer missionaries are dedicated to this region than the other English-speaking ones although this place needs the same love, care and dedication. Therefore, this paper aims to give insight on French West Africa and the challenges of the current state of Christian mission.In Burkina Faso, a French-Western West African country, traditional religions were already established in their belief system before Islam and Christianity entered. Traditional religions are centered on clan, tribe and community rather than the individual. These values can be observed through culture, religion, society, and customs, and much of their lives are moving with traditional religion.Their Islam is not pure Islam, but a mixed Islam, or Islam that grew up with traditional religions. They have a strong tradition of religion, such as making a piece of paper with a verse from the Quran, healing Muslims and chasing evil spirits. For them, Islam can be explained as an action-based religion based on traditional religion.Christianity is no different, which is why a missionary theo-logical approach is needed for sharing the gospel. In addition, it is very important to make sure that the correct Christian worldview is established from an early age in order to break the traditional beliefs that are located deep in the worldview.In the field, missionaries of various nationalities are working in various ways, such as church planting, educational mission, medical mission, mission for the street children, Bible translation, and disabled mission. But they all leave much to be desired. The areas left to be addressed in this paper will require ongoing research. It is also expected to bring about missiological work through interest and follow-up research in French-speaking West Africa.

TI  - Band-Based Best Model Selection for Topographic Normalization of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Map
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic effect in remote sensing images is severe in high mountainous areas. Efficiently to reduce the effects, several topographic normalization models have been proposed. Since the performance of the models is largely dependent on the spectral band and land surface type, the best performance model can vary from image to image in an area as well as from band to band in an image. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map has been widely used for the vegetation monitoring and assessment. An efficient reduction of the topographic effect in the NDVI map must be required for the spatial analysis of the vegetation monitoring and assessment. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to select the best topographic normalization model in each band to reduce the topographic effect of NDVI maps. The histogram structural similarity (HSSIM) index was used for the model selection because the index allows to select the best model in each band of an image. Five topographic normalization models were used for the test, which include the sun-canopy-sensor (SCS), statistical-empirical, C-correction, Minnaert, and Minnaert + SCS. The performance of the proposed method was validated by using two different season Landsat-8 OLI images including the forest area of northern Malaysia. The standard deviations of the two NDVI maps generated from the test images were reduced by about 53.1% and 28.6% after correction in profile analysis. The coefficient of determination (R-2) between the two different NDVI maps increased from 0.626 to 0.759. It indicates that the proposed method effectively reduced the topographic effect of the NDVI maps. This result implies that the proposed method can work well in the topographic normalization. Furthermore, the proposed method would be successfully applied to index maps including the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), etc.

AB  - The article studies an issue of application of remote sensing technology for determination of arable land degradation. Under the modern land use conditions, the processes of soil layer destruction, particularly on arable land, have been recognized as negative large-scale development factor. It is caused byimpact of excessive anthropogenic processes on agriculture land. The authors analyse determination of arable land degradation, using data of transformations of the vegetation cover, referring to the space multispectral satellite images Landsat. The process of investigationrequires anti-erosion organization of the territory. While processing multispectral satellite images, the principal task is to reproduce the information, which provides the best depiction of the processes of arable land degradation. Transformation of vegetation cover and dynamics of the processes of soil erosion have been chosen as indicators, characterizing arable land degradation. To measure these indicators, it is necessary to use multispectral satellite images of the medium spatial resolution along with supplementary geospatial data - digital model of topography, soil map and climatic characteristics of the studied territory. The authors of the article have performed estimation of the erosion processes by determination of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). According to the results of the conducted research, the authors have developed thelocal level thematicland degradation map on the territory of village Velyka Ozymyna in Lviv region.This map demonstrates that in the period 2000-2019 18 % of the studied territory was subjected to degradation processes. Considering the discovered changes in land use, the authorsperformed modelling of the expected land degradation level on the studied territory by 2050. According to the data of modern remote sensing, it is possible to make forecast concerning the progress of soil destruction and arable land degradation in the future. It will secure efficient decision-making on optimization of agricultural land use and land protective activities.

M3  - Article
AB  - Forests, as one of the most important natural resources in the world, are facing several challenges due to human activities and climate changes. The timely detection of forest fires plays an essential role in managing this wealth. Despite several well-developed fire detection methods, the detection of fires in early hours is still challenging. In this paper, we developed a new near-real-time hybrid method for fire detection that has high sensitivity to small and cold forest fires as well as less rate of false alarms. This method is based on the detection of both spatial and temporal changes. The change detection technique was used, and the identification of fire pixels was performed in the area with a significant change compared to the previous time. Since most of the false fire pixels had almost the same temperature in the images, they were masked. This mask allowed us to reduce the fire thresholds that lead to detect small fires. Furthermore, the omission and commission errors were minimized. The proposed algorithm was applied to forty case studies in the north of Iran. The identified fire pixels were validated with ground observations collected by the Forests, Range and Watershed Management Organization of Iran. Results show that the proposed algorithm was able to detect small and cool-case fires efficiently.

TI  - PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF REMOTE SENSING DATA WITH MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE TO DETERMINE SOIL COLOR
T2  - Polish Journal of Soil Science
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present research is the determination of soil color by spectral bands and indices obtained from MODIS images. For this purpose, soil samples were collected from East Azerbaijan Province (Iran) and their color and texture were investigated through Munsell color system and hydrometer method, respectively. Stepwise regression, principle component analysis and sensitivity function methods were employed to find the dominant indices and bands using artificial neural network (ANN) as one of the machine learning techniques. The improved indices as the model input had better performance, for example, the calculation of correlation coefficient between indices and hue showed 51.48% increase of correlation coefficient with comparison of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to modified soil adjustment vegetation index (MSAVI) and 54.54% correlation enhancement of soil adjustment vegetation index (SAVI) compared to MSAVI. Stepwise regression method along with error criteria decline may enhance the performance of soil color model. In comparison with multivariate regression, ANN model exhibited better performance (with a 12.61% mean absolute error [MAE] decline). Temporal variation of modified perpendicular drought index (MPDI) as well as band 31 could justify the Munsell soil color components variations specifically chroma and hue. MPDI and thermal bands could be employed as a precise indicator in soil color analysis. Thus, remote sensing data combined with machine learning technique can clarify the procedure potential for soil color determination.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENGINEERING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - When talking about land cover, we need to find a proper way to extract information from aerial or satellite images. In the field of photogrammetry, aerial images are generally acquired by optical sensors that deliver images in four bands (red, green, blue and nearinfrared). Recent researches in this field demonstrated that for the image classification process is still place for improvement. From satellites are obtained multispectral images with more bands (e.g. Landsat 7/8 has 36 spectral bands). This paper will present the differences between these two types of images and the classification results using support-vector machine and maximum likelihood classifier. For the aerial and the satellite images we used different sets of classification classes and the two methods mentioned above to highlight the importance of choosing the classes and the classification method.

AB  - Tuzla City, Bosnia and Herzegovina, is very famous for salt mining. The intensive extraction of brine from the underground salt deposit caused accumulative subsidence of up to -12 m from 1956 to 2003. It induced serious damage to residences, buildings, and infrastructures. Although the activity of brine extraction was officially stopped in 2007, reports of subsidence are still on-going for some areas of Tuzla City according to a previous study. In the present study, a satellite-based method, i.e., Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), is applied for the subsidence monitoring of the induced underground brine extraction. Since October 2014, SAR data obtained by the Sentinel-1A and -1B satellites (European Space Agency: ESA) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) multi-temporal analyses have been employed to obtain the spatial distribution and the temporal transition of the land subsidence. The accuracy and effectiveness of the SBAS-DInSAR method are assessed and evaluated by using the real-time kinematic GNSS monitoring system. DInSAR detected that the subsidence is still on-going at a velocity of -36.4 mm/year in some areas, especially in an area northeast of the center of the city. This study presents the validity and effectiveness of SBAS-DInSAR as a useful subsidence monitoring tool.

AB  - This study was conducted to analyze the changes in mangrove area and the density level of mangrove based on satellite imagery and field surveys in Untung Jawa Island. The image data used was Landsat image data acquired in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2019. Apart from those, sentinel-2 data received in April 2019 were also retrieved to be compared with field data to see the density level and its accuracy. Image analysis to determine the area and density of mangroves was the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) model. Measurement of mangrove vegetation in the field was obtained by the line plot transect method. The results of temporal image data analysis showed the changes in mangrove area from 2000 (8.46 ha), 2005 (7.56 ha), 2010 (8.45 ha), 2015 (10.65 ha) and 2019 (6.89 ha). In 2019 the mangrove density was dense, while the result of the field survey was categorized as very dense. The level of accuracy for density using remote sensing data is 92.5%. Through the results of the field survey, the mangrove diversity was relatively low, mangrove species on the island was very uneven, and the dominant species was Rhizophora mucronata.

M3  - Article
AB  - Oreomunnea mexicana is relict and threatened species; it constitutes a dominant tree element in the foggy forest of the Sierra Juarez, Oaxaca. The species is emblematic and is incorporated into the worldview of the inhabitants of the region, where, in addition, it performs very important ecological functions and ecosystem services. The aim of the present work was to analyze the diversity and genetic structure, as well as to evaluate the spatial genetic structure on a fine scale using molecular markers for in situ conservation activities. Dominant markers called inter simple sequence repeat were used with which individuals from nine populations (25 per population) and 120 individuals from a plot of 400 m(2) were analyzed. The results showed high levels of genetic diversity (H-e = 0.405 +/- 0003) and moderate levels of gene flow (N-m = 2.25) and low genetic differentiation (P < 0.001; 8%). The fine spatial genetic structure showed a random distribution, while the kinship analysis exhibited high genetic similarity among the analyzed individuals. High levels of diversity suggest that the species is not genetically degraded, however, due to its fragmented distribution and high environmental vulnerability, it is suggested for its conservation in situ, priority should be given for immediate protection to the populations of El Relampago (due to its great genetic diversity), the Panteon and the Orquidiario due to its low genetic diversity and the high vulnerability due to anthropic and environmental disturbance.

AB  - The amplitude of the backscattered signal collected by space-born radars, e.g., Sentinel-1, when illuminating snow-covered areas, is strongly dependent upon the conditions of the snow. In particular, there is a potential evidence of a relationship between the melting phases of the snowpack and the amplitude of the backscattered signal. However, the exact quantitative description of this phenomenon it is not fully determined. This paper proposes a first-order preliminary model, based on plane-wave incidence on stratified media, to describe the effect of several physical parameters of the snowpack (depth, liquid water content, density, snow water equivalent) on the amplitude of the backscattered signal. The model is tested against experimental data for a site in the Italian Alps (Malga Fadner), where data from Sentinel-1, as well as in-situ data about the composition of the snowpack, are available for entire winter season 2017/18, showing good general agreement.

TI  - Comparison between satellite and ground data with UAV-based information to analyse vineyard spatio-temporal variability
T2  - OENO ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the greatest challenge for vine growers is to improve the yield and quality of grapes by minimizing costs and environmental impacts. This goal can be achieved through a better knowledge of vineyard spatial variability. Traditional platforms such as airborne, satellite and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) solutions are useful investigation tools for vineyard site specific management. These remote sensing techniques are mainly exploited to get the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is useful for describing the morpho-vegetational characteristics of vineyards. This study was conducted in a vineyard in Tuscany (Italy) during the 2017, 2018 and 2019 seasons. Ground data were acquired to detect some agronomic variables such as yield (kg/vine), total soluble solids (TSS), and pruning weight (kg/vine). Remote sensed multispectral images acquired by UAV and Sentinel 2 (S2) satellite platform were used to assess the analysis of the vegetative variability. The UAV NDVI was extracted using both a mixed pixels approach (both vine and inter-row) and from pure canopy pixels. In addition to these UAV layers, the vine thickness was extracted. The aim of this study was to evaluate both classical Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and spatial statistical methods (Moran Index-MI and BILISA) to assess their performance in a multi-temporal comparison between satellite and ground data with UAV information. Good correlations were detected between S2 NDVI and UAV NDVI mixed pixels through both methods (R-2 = 0.80 and MI = 0.75). Regarding ground data, UAV layers showed low and negative association with TSS (MI = -0.34 was the lowest value) whereas better spatial autocorrelations with positive values were detected between UAV layers and both yield (MI ranged from 0.42 to 0.52) and pruning weight (MI ranged from 0.45 to 0.64). The spatial analysis made by MI and BILISA methodologies added more information to this study, clearly showing that both UAV and Sentinel-2 satellite allowed the vigour spatial variability within the vineyard to be detected correctly, overcoming the classical comparison methods by adding the spatial effect. MI and BILISA play a key role in identifying spatial patterns and could be successfully exploited by agricultural stakeholders.

TI  - Identifying Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and psychiatric comorbidity for children and youth in care: A community approach to diagnosis and treatment
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Several challenges exist when making a diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) and identifying co-morbid psychiatric illness, particularly for children and youth accessing child welfare services. Here, we describe an integrated three-phase approach to the identification of FASD and psychiatric comorbidity for children and youth in care, consisting of: (1) completion of a standardized neurobehavioral screening tool by a child protection worker (CPW); (2) assessment by a pediatrician, including facial measurements and; (3) integration of findings in a psychiatric assessment.Main Findings: The majority of participants (14/18, 78%) of youth who were suspected by a CPW and pediatrician of a diagnosis of FASD using the screening tool were determined to have met criteria. A diagnosis was made in all cases where there was confirmed history of prenatal exposure and a majority of these youth were found to have sentinel facial features of FASD. Psychiatric comorbidity was diagnosed and treatment recommendations made for all children and youth referred.Conclusions: This study supports the utility of an integrated community approach to diagnosing and treating comorbid psychiatric disorders in FASD by employing existing child protection and physician services in a community setting. Based on these preliminary findings, we encourage that youth who access formal care systems be screened for FASD by their CPW and are provided with appropriate pediatric and psychiatric assessments to clarify the diagnosis, while also identifying comorbid psychiatric illness to target appropriate interventions.

TI  - Proteomics of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Early Breast Cancer for Identification of Thymidylate Synthase as a Potential Biomarker to Flag Metastasis: A Preliminary Study
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women across the world. Some of the patients who present in the early stage of disease are affected by metastasis to the axillary group of lymph nodes. The first among this group that is affected is called as sentinel lymph node, and its diagnosis is crucial for the staging of cancer thereby dictating the type of surgical therapy. Therefore, the sentinel lymph node status provides the most relevant information to the surgeon and patient prognosis. The expanded utilization of breast conservation surgery has declined the morbidity associated with mastectomy and axillary lymph node surgery. Recent interest is, therefore, centered on techniques that allow accurate assessment of the sentinel lymph node metastasis. A current procedure such as sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) that is used to assess axillary lymph node metastasis is neither specific nor sensitive, and besides, it is time-consuming.Objective: To compare the protein profiles between metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes to identify a biomarker that can flag lymph node metastasis.Materials and Methods: Women with early breast cancer were screened using mammography imaging and recruited to the study. Surgical resection was done to remove the breast tissue, and sentinel lymph node was identified using fluorescein and methylene blue tracer. Lymph node was sliced, and one set was sent for histopathology, which was considered the gold standard to assess the metastatic status of the lymph node. One set of slices was taken for proteomic experiments. Proteins were labelled with fluorescent cyanine tags and were subjected to difference gel electrophoresis experiment. Differentially expressed spots that had at least a twofold relative ratio and consistent pattern across three sets of biological replicate experiments were marked. Gel spots were trypsin digested and identified on mass spectrometry machine. Validation study was done by Western blot experiment on the same set of samples.Results: Thymidylate synthase has a twofold higher expression in the metastatic sentinel lymph nodes as compared to non-metastatic lymph nodes in early breast cancer patients.Conclusion: Differential in gel expression proteomics is an ideal platform for the identification of potential protein biomarker candidates that can differentiate metastatic from non-metastatic lymph nodes in early breast cancer. The identification of thymidylate synthase offers a scope to develop an on-table diagnostic kit to assess the status of sentinel lymph nodes during mastectomy procedure to guide surgical management of axillary lymph nodes in early breast cancer.

AB  - Hai Phong Bay, situated in Northern Vietnam, has been facing the problem of sedimentation for decades. The Cam river, falling into Hai Phong Bay, brings significant amount of sediments to the bay causing complex turbidity in the area. Since Hai Phong Bay is situated adjacent to Ha Long Bay, one of UNESCO world heritage, monitoring the turbidity in Hai Phong Bay is vital not only to tackle with the sedimentation problem in the bay but also to preserve relatively lower turbidity in Ha Long Bay. This study monitors the turbidity in Hai Phong Bay from 2002 to 2018 using satellite images and measured data. Hai Phong Bay has an area of as large as 550 km(2) and thus it is virtually difficult to capture the spatiotemporal variation of the suspended sediment concentration through in-situ measured data. In such a context, use of satellite images may be one of preferred options. This study uses satellite images of the data archive of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to capture the spatiotemporal variation of the suspended sediment concentration. The obtained results clearly show a significant reduction of the suspended sediment in Hai Phong Bay after the years of the 2010s. According to the analysis, it was also evident that time-varying turbidity in the western part of the bay is highly correlated with the river discharge unlike the eastern part of the bay. This feature may indicate that sediment transport in the east-west direction is not dominant and the sediment discharge from the river mouth located on the west side of the bay may have relatively less impact on sedimentation in the eastern part of the bay.

TI  - Primary cutaneous cryptococcal infection due to fingolimod - Induced lymphopenia with literature review
T2  - IDCASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Cryptococcus. Neoformans (C. neoformans) is an encapsulated heterobasidiomycetous fungus responsible for opportunistic infections worldwide in immunocompromised patients. Clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic respiratory tract colonization to disseminated infection in any human body part. The central nervous system (CNS) and pulmonary diseases garner most of the clinical attention. Secondary cutaneous cryptococcosis is an uncommon manifestation seen as a sentinel sign commonly in disseminated cryptococcal infection. Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis (PCC) is a rare manifestation seen in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. It is a discrete infection with different epidemiological trends. Immunosuppressive therapy (corticosteroids, tacrolimus) predisposes a patient to acquire this clinical entity. We present a case of an elderly Caucasian male on fingolimod for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis with nonhealing scalp lesions for four years. He was a referral to our healthcare center for the presence of fungal elements seen on a scalp biopsy fungal stains. Final cultures returned positive for C. neoformans susceptible to fluconazole (MIC = 8 mu g/mL). The CD4 count was 13 cells/uL, and workup for CNS and disseminated cryptococcal infection were negative. Fingolimod is an immunomodulator that acts on sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors, affecting the lymphocytes. Pubmed literature review revealed few case reports (< 5) with PCC in patients on fingolimod. To our knowledge, ours is the first case with scalp cryptococcosis, with the lowest CD4 count while being on fingolimod. No randomized controlled trial data exist for the treatment of PCC. Therapy initiated with oral luconazole for six months with significant improvement at three months. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The availability of green spaces is an important issue for urban populations worldwide, given the benefits that the green spaces provide for health, well-being, and quality of life. But urban green spaces are not always distributed equally for different population groups within cities. Latin America is the second most urbanized region of the world, but there are few published studies analysing the green space availability for different urban population groups, and less so analysing the long-term trends. This work presents an analysis of long-term availability of urban green spaces by different socioeconomic status population groups in Medellin city, Colombia, using open geospatial data and open software tools. The results indicate that disparities between different groups have been decreasing in the last years, but there are still efforts to do. Showing this kind of analysis based on open data and tools is essential as it opens the possibility for replicating it in other cities with scarce budgets.

AB  - Land cover classification using satellite images is an important tool in the study of terrestrial resources. Satellite based information is presently available as huge sets of high resolution images from a large number of satellites like Sentinel, Landsat8, etc. Land cover classification from these images is a difficult task because of very large sized data and high variation types. Deep Neural Networks can play a vital role in this regard and can perform classification on these large sized data. Related works in this field have used lighter models and included a large number of handcrafted parameters which requires domain knowledge on the subject. It is realised that most models are too shallow for such a complicated image. In this paper, a deeper Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model without any satellite image specific parameters is proposed. On SAT4 and SAT6 images, our 13layered network has achieved better accuracy upto 99.84% and 99.47% which is state-of-the-art. It is still called lightweight model because most models in Artificial Intelligence(AI)-CNN are much deeper and larger than ours.

TI  - Monitoring and Detecting Archaeological Features with Multi-Frequency Polarimetric Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing for archaeology, an unequivocal method capable of automatic detection of archaeological features still does not exists. Applications of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing for archaeology mainly focus on high spatial resolution SAR sensors, which allow the recognition of structures of small dimension and give information of the surface topography of sites. In this study we investigated the potential of combined dual and fully polarized SAR data and performed polarimetric multi-frequency and multi-incidence angle analysis of C-band Sentinel-1, L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) and of C-band Radar Satellite-2 (RADARSAT-2) datasets for the detection of surface and subsurface archaeological structures over the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) site of Gebel Barkal (Sudan). While PALSAR offers a good historical reference, Sentinel-1 time series provide recent and systematic monitoring opportunities. RADARSAT-2 polarimetric data have been specifically acquired in 2012/2013, and have been scheduled to achieve a multi-temporal observation of the archaeological area under study. This work demonstrated how to exploit a complex but significant dataset composed of SAR full polarimetric and dual polarimetric acquisitions, with the purpose of identifying the most suitable earth observation technique for the preservation and identification of archaeological features. The scientific potential of the illustrated analysis fits perfectly with the current delicate needs of cultural heritage; such analysis demonstrates how multi-temporal and multi-data cultural heritage monitoring can be applied not only for documentation purposes, but can be addressed especially to those areas exposed to threats of different nature that require a constant and prompt intervention plans.

AB  - The rapid growth of urbanization has altered the urban surfaces posing serious threats to natural ecosystems in the urban area worldwide. Landscape changes have a negative impact on urban ecosystem services. In this paper, we estimated the changes in ecosystem services value (ESV) in terms of land use land cover (LULC) for the 2014-2019 period in the Khulna City of Bangladesh. Landsat-8 images were used to estimate land use land cover changes over the study periods. The changes of ESV were calculated by following the previously published global value coefficient. The results show that the water body and vegetation significantly decreased in the study area. The net decline of ESV from 2014-2019 was US$ 2.4 million. The highest contribution of change in total ESV was the loss to the water body. We suggest formulating a sustainable land use policy to ensure ecological balance with urban growth.

AB  - This study contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of Total Solids in Suspension (TSS) on the coast of Caravelas, Extreme South of Bahia, Brazil. Images obtained by the OLI sensor (Landsat 8) on 12/29/2014 and 1/30/2015 were used to the creation of an empirical predictive model of superficial TSS, elaborated by linear regression adjusted by least squares. The results showed a good adjustment for 12/29/2014 (RMSE = 5.89; RE = 19.2 %; R-2 = 0.89; N = 14) and a reasonable adjustment for the image of 01/30/15 2015 (RMSE = 13.33; RE = 57 %; R-2 = 0.5; N = 6). The model proved to be consistent. However, the monitoring of impacts resulting from dredging activities would be more effective after a new work outlined to consider the regional variability of TSS, including the plume generated by dredging.

TI  - Integration of DInSAR and SBAS Techniques to Determine Mining-Related Deformations Using Sentinel-1 Data: The Case Study of Rydutowy Mine in Poland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground coal exploitation often results in land-surface subsidence, the rate of which depends on geological characteristics, the mechanical properties of the rocks, and the applied extraction technology. Since mining-related subsidence is characterized by "fast" displacement and high nonlinearity, monitoring this process by using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is very challenging. The Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach needs to predefine an a priori deformation model to properly estimate an interferometric component related to displacements. As a consequence, there is a lack of distributed scatterers (DS) when the selected a priori deformation model deviates from the real deformation. The conventional differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) approach does not have this limitation, since it does not need any deformation model. However, the accuracy of this technique is limited by factors related to spatial and temporal decorrelation, signal delays due to the atmospheric artifacts, and orbital or topographic errors. Therefore, this study presents the integration of DInSAR and SBAS techniques in order to leverage the advantages and overcome the disadvantages of both methods and to retrieve the complete deformation pattern over the investigated study area. The obtained results were evaluated internally and externally with leveling data. Results indicated that the Kriging-based integration method of DInSAR and SBAS can be effectively applied to monitor mining-related subsidence. The root-mean-square Error (RMSE) between modeled and measured deformation by InSAR was found to be 11 and 13 mm for vertical and horizontal displacements, respectively. Moreover, DInSAR technique as a cost-effective and complementary method to conventional geodetic techniques can be applied for effective monitoring fast mining subsidence. The minimum and maximum RMSE between DInSAR displacement and specific leveling profiles were found to be 0.9 and 3.2 cm, respectively. Since the SBAS processing failed in subsidence estimation in the area of maximum deformation rate, the deformation estimates outside the maximum rate could only be compared. In these areas, the good agreement between SBAS and DInSAR indicates that the SBAS technique could be reliable for monitoring the residual subsidence that surrounds the subsidence trough. Using the proposed approach, we detected subsidence of up to -1 m and planar displacements (east-west) of up to 0.24 m.

TI  - THE PERFORMER AND TRADITION: PERSONALITY AS A PHENOMENON IN TRANSMISSION OF THE UDMURT CULTURAL HERITAGE

M3  - Article
AB  - For the first time, this article concentrates on the phenomenon of personality in the Udmurt ethnical culture. This is a good framework to talk about Olga Nikolaevna Solovyova (1932-2018), well-known among the Udmurt as Dzhaky/Dzhakapay/Dzhaky apay (litt.: Jay/aunt Jay). There are several reasons for scientific interest about her: she had a huge knowledge of singing repertoire and rituals, she was able to improvise freely within her local tradition, she had exceptional musical abilities.The analysis of Olga Solovyova's character as a performer allows to connect the songs in her repertoire with her singer's fate. Many of her non-ritual songs are indeed autobiographic narratives with her reflections about her unhappy life, her fate as an orphan. A large corpus in her songs belongs to the so-called personal songs, a kind of memory about a person in musical, singing form. Another original feature in her singing art was the knowledge of other communities' songs (Russian, Mari, Tatar), from the surrounding villages, both in the original languages as in translation into Udmurt. Because of her knowledge of the local ritual tradition, Olga Solovyova was a significant and respected member of her village community. Until her life's last day, she respected the traditional worldview positions, the behavioural rules, the canons of ritual and singing performance, which she endeavoured to instil in her entourage. All this arose genuine interest in social and scientific circles. And today, when she is no more among us, her name comes back to life in numerous different projects.

TI  - Current role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the management of cutaneous melanoma: A UK consensus statement
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) has been at the forefront of the surgical staging of melanoma patients for the past 15 years. The high accuracy of this prognostic staging procedure is now recognised in all international guidelines for melanoma. However during this period there have been a number of important changes in the management of melanoma, many occurring within the past five years. The outcomes of five recent randomised Phase 3 trials have established the role of adjuvant targeted therapy and immunotherapy in resected Stage 3 and Stage 4 disease and have potentially changed the role of SNB. Two landmark international prospective studies have examined the benefit of performing a completion lymph node dissection (CLND) following the detection of microscopicallyinvolved sentinel nodes. Finally, the marked increase in the incidence of melanoma and the role of SNB in potentially guiding therapy has resulted in a significant increase in the pathological workload of the dermatopathology services.To address these issues a multi-disciplinary consensus meeting involving many melanoma experts from the UK was convened in May 2018. Three main areas were considered: oncology, surgery and pathology. This report is a summary of the conclusions reached, which were agreed by the clinicians attending the meeting and then externally peer reviewed. The recommendations summarised in this Consensus Statement. (C) 2019 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Opioid use and harms associated with a sustained-release tapentadol formulation: A post-marketing surveillance study
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: A sustained-release formulation (SRF) of tapentadol has been marketed in Australia since February 2013. This study examined tapentadol SRF extra-medical use, attractiveness for extra-medical use, and associated harms in Australia.Methods: This post-marketing study comprises analyses of Australian community sales data (2011-2017) for eleven pharmaceutical opioids (prescription and over-the-counter codeine disaggregated); calls to three poisons information centres (covering five of the eight jurisdictions in Australia) related to pharmaceutical opioids and coded by the centres as 'misuse' or 'abuse' (2011-2017); and interviews with people who inject drugs (n = 888) recruited as part of the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) from all Australian capital cities (2017).Results: Population-level availability of tapentadol SRF increased from market launch, comprising the sixth largest market share of all opioid unit sales, and third greatest share in oral morphine equivalent milligrams sold, in December 2017. Lifetime tapentadol SRF use among the IDRS sample (n = 888) was low (1.5%; 95%CI 0.9-2.5), with few reporting past-6 month non-prescribed use or injection. Non-fatal overdose following tapentadol use was self-reported by less than 1% (95%CI 0.1-0.8). Between 2013-2017, 1.1% (n = 25) of pharmaceutical opioid `misuse/abuse' calls were related to tapentadol, and predominantly the SRF.Conclusions: Increasing utilisation of tapentadol sustained-release formulation was observed, along with indications of extra-medical use and harms associated with use, although on a smaller scale relative to other opioids. These findings need to be interpreted in the context of the low level of exposure to tapentadol sustained-release formulation among the sentinel population of people who inject drugs.

AB  - Solar spectral irradiance fluctuates periodically. MgII can describe solar activity and convert solar reference spectrum irradiance according to solar activity. In this paper, we first calculate the MgII, based on multiple solar spectra and construct a time-dependent MgII curve after considering the aggregation level of the curve. Then the error transfer formula of the MgII prediction value participating in the spectral time-varying calculation is derived. The requirement of absolute calibration accuracy is 3%, and the acceptable maximum prediction algorithm error need to below 2.24%. In the prediction algorithm, the Fourier first-class fitting is used for the principal components of the MgII curve, and the Fourier multi-class fitting is used for the high-frequency components. The order is determined by the fitting effect of the Fourier series at the end of the curve. Finally, MgII of the next 200 days and 3 years is predicted at 10 time points, and maximum average error between the true values and the predicted values is 1.863%(200 days) and 1.922%(3 years), which is less than the acceptable error of 2.24%. Predicting solar activity based on MgII is helpful for satellites to obtain accurate observation data.

AB  - The advent of satellite altimetry brought a revolution in monitoring sea level height in ocean and offshore areas. Satellite altimetry missions are constantly evolving over time and provide valuable products that assist, among others, in the precise estimation of Mean Sea Level (MSL) and its periodic update. Over the recent years, MSL has seen a rapid rise, mainly due to climate change and the increase of global temperature, which accelerates the melting of onshore snow and ice reserves, along with the thermal expansion of the oceans. Concordantly, several islands and coastal regions face the danger of 'drowning' or flooding. Therefore, Cyprus, being an island in the Southeastern region of the Mediterranean Sea mandates the continuous monitoring of sea level to determine the risk of flooding, especially in coastal zones. This paper presents a first endeavor to estimate MSL in Cyprus using Copernicus Sentinel-3 altimetric data from 2016 to date. The results were validated against MSL observations from the Cyprus national tide gauge network and a discussion on the use of Sentinel-3 data as an indispensable monitoring tool is carried out.

AB  - This research addresses the use of Sentinel-1 time series with the aim of detecting spatio-temporal changes in the coastal environment. To this end an automatic and unsupervised coastline detection method is proposed. First, we apply a temporal averaging filter that allows encapsulating the temporal variations in coastal areas, e.g. due to tides or vegetation, and at the same time it allows reducing the speckle, without decreasing the spatial resolution of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images Then, based on the distinctive backscattering values of the sea and land classes we employ an iterative hierarchical tiling method in order to accurately characterize the two classes by a bimodal distribution. The latter is then segmented by a thresholding and region-growing procedure to separate the sea and land classes. The proposed method is applied to two different SAR time-series, each one acquired throughout one year. The extracted yearly coastlines are then analyzed in order to identify spatio-temporal changes. Experimental results showcase coastal area changes between occuring 2018 and 2019 and that were caused by the hurricane Michael hitting Northwest Florida in October 2018.

AB  - Quantum Computing has been invigorated by the introduction of the first commercially available computers. Quantum Annealers (QAs) like the D-Wave are now housing similar to 5000 quantum-bits, and quantum computing, a potentially disruptive technology, is closer to becoming a reality than ever. Here we investigate quantum-assisted approaches to image registration of MODIS images using QAs. We present two approaches: (1) a mapping of image matching to a quadratic-unconstrained-binary optimization problem and (2) a machine learning approach that employs generative models trained using quantum annealing statistics. Results are shown and discussed.

TI  - An Intergenerational Ecological Jurisprudence: The Supreme Court of Colombia and the Rights of the Amazon Rainforest
T2  - LAW TECHNOLOGY AND HUMANS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2017, 25 young Colombians, aged 15 to 25, filed the first climate change and future generations lawsuit in Latin America (the Amazon case). Assisted by the organisation Dejusticia, the young plaintiffs filed an accion de tutela-a special mechanism under the Colombian Constitution that allows individuals to demand the protection of their fundamental rights. The plaintiffs argued that the current deforestation rates and their destructive consequences were violating their future right to a healthy environment. Remarkably, the Supreme Court of Colombia, in which the action was filed, ruled in favour of the plaintiffs, granting their petition and guaranteeing their right to enjoy a healthy environment, as well as their future rights to life, health, food and water. To enforce its judgment, the Court ordered that the Colombian Government formulate an action plan and an intergenerational pact to protect the Amazon. Most importantly, the court went beyond the grounds raised by the plaintiffs and recognised the Amazon rainforest as a subject of rights. Located within a growing network of constitutional, legislative and judicial initiatives in a growing number of jurisdictions, the Amazon case is but one example of the emergence of a novel ecological jurisprudence that is emerging around the globe. The Amazon case is particularly emblematic, as it reveals a profound ontological shift among younger generations, for whom a purely anthropocentric worldview appears to be increasingly representative of an untenable sense of alienation. The Amazon case also creates hope for a world in which an ecological jurisprudence is at the core of the current intergenerational discourse, the focus of which appears to be the global reconceptualisation of our collective self for generations to come.

M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer management during COVID-19 pandemic has changed and in case of COVID-19 patients with simultaneous neoplasia, it has been strongly recommended to treat Sars-CoV-2 infection firstly.PRESENTATION OF CASE: We reported a case of a 53-years-old women with early breast cancer and simultaneous asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to COVID-19 breast cancer recommendations she underwent hormone neoadjuvant treatment as a bridging therapy for surgery. Six months from the diagnosis, after virus eradication, patient underwent breast surgery. No SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found both in the surgical specimen and sentinel lymph node but micrometastasis were reported. During the last follow-up, the patient was in good clinical condition and started the adjuvant chemotherapy.DISCUSSION: COVID-19 outbreak determined the publication of temporary recommendation leading to an extensive use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. Although endocrine therapy is a mainstay in the adjuvant treatment, its role in the neoadjuvant schedule is unclear.CONCLUSION: Upfront awake surgery should be preferred especially in asymptomatic COVID-19 patient with early breast cancer when monitoring of tumor response is not feasible.

AB  - This study aimed to identify the effect of the positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) phenomenon on the spatial, temporal distribution of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the East Season in Padang Sea in 2019. The method used in this research was the Kriging analysis method applied in oceanographic parameter satellite imagery extraction point data. By applying the method, we produced the maps of the spatial distribution variation of chlorophyll-a content and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). The data of IOD events in 2019 showed the occurrence of a strong positive IOD phenomenon that caused anomaly in the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in Padang Sea. The interpretation of Aqua-Modis level 2 satellite image data showed that the sea surface temperature during the East Season was relatively cold, which was in the minimum temperature ranging from 18.5-22 degrees C with a normal temperature condition of 28-29 degrees C. The minimum chlorophyll-a concentration in the East Season was 0.252 mg/m3; while the maximum value reached 18.5 mg/m3. The distribution value of chlorophyll-a concentration was 1.028 mg/m3.The RMSe Cross Validation value obtained was 0.504 for SST and 0.363 for chlorophyll-a with a mean SST of -0.0005 and mean chlorophyll-a of -0.0039.

AB  - To assess the damage produced by wildfires on forest ecosystems is a critical task for their subsequent management and ecological restoration. Satellite-based optical images provide reliable ex-ante and ex-post data about vegetation state, making them suitable for the aforementioned purpose. In this study we assessed the damage produced on two forested lands by the series of wildfires occurred in central Chile during summer 2017. Arithmetic differences from pre- and post-fire NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), NDWI (normalized difference water index) and NBR (normalized burnt ratio) were retrieved from a Sentinel-2 image set embracing four near-anniversary summer dates: 2016 (ex-ante), 2017, 2018 and 2019 (ea post). The nine index-derived differences resulting were correlated to CBI (composite burn index) data collected in the field during summer 2019, and a model constructed by a stepwise regression was formulated. Results show that planted forests exhibited a somewhat smaller biomass recovery than native ones, in part due to their post-fire clearing and preparation, deriving in a smaller tree cover. CBI poorly performed because its calculation includes low vegetation strata largely recovered at the time of the field data collection. However, when overstory field data were used alone correlations noticeably increased (r= 0,66-0,74). This was because during the field campaign this stratum was still appreciably damaged, thus better matching with the data provided by the indices-derived differences, intrinsically more representative of uppermost vegetation layers. The burn damage was mapped on both study areas employing the best performing regression model, based on NDW2016-2019, NDWI2016-2017, NBR2016-2017 and NBR2016-2017 differences (adjusted.R-2= 0.72, p < 0.005, root mean square error = 0.38). The use of approaches like this one in other areas of central Chile, where wildfires are increasing their frequency and intensity, might contribute to better lead post-fire management and restoration actions on their damaged forest ecosystems.

TI  - The other as a mirror. Approaches to the process of religious and identity transculturation in Saramago, Labarca and Costa
T2  - MOENIA-REVISTA LUCENSE DE LINGUISTICA & LITERATURA
M3  - Article
AB  - Transculturation is a concept coined by Fernando Ortiz that has been applied preferably in Cuba and has been extended by Latin America for the analysis and study of the cultural products of a territory that has incessantly received the migration of different worldview peoples. We seek to extrapolate this theoretical concept coined in Latin America to other colonial contexts of the former Iberian empires. Hence, the objective of this article is to evaluate the relevance of the term transculturation as an epistemic category, to address the comparison of three novels of different origin, since this process-transculturation-allows and favors the emergence of new identities, both for colonized and for colonizers. The purpose of such a comparative task is to discuss the disfigured imaginary, inheritance of imperialism, which has underestimated the knowledge of subjected peoples. The corpus is composed by A viagem do elefante (2008) by Jose Saramago and O ultimo olhar de Manu Miranda (2000) by the Mozambican writer Orlando Da Costa, both written in Portuguese, along with the Chilean novel Butamalon (1994) by Eduardo Labarca. The comparative analysis of these fictional narratives focuses on the process of religious transculturation, which ranges from the considerable distance between representatives of the empire and colonized people, in Saramago's novel, to the fusion of cultures from which a new collective identity is born, in those of Costa and Labarca. KEYWORDS. Transculturation, alterity, identity, postcolonialism.

TI  - Influences of leaf area index and albedo on estimating energy fluxes with HOLAPS framework
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The High resOlution Land Atmosphere surface Parameters from Space (HOLAPS) programme provides a modeling system to maximize the use of satellite-based products and ensure internally consistent estimation of surface water and energy fluxes. Leaf area index (LAS) and land surface albedo are two key parameters for estimation of latent and sensible heat fluxes with HOLAPS. Thus, to facilitate the generation of long-term high accuracy latent and sensible heat fluxes, high quality global long-term LAI and land surface albedo datasets are essential. The Quality Assurance for Essential Climate Variables (QA4ECV) project released quality-assured longterm LAI and albedo datasets with traceable and reliable uncertainty information provided in the dataset. Taking MODIS-BNU-LAI and MODIS albedo as reference, different global long-term LAI and albedo datasets including GlobAlbedo, QA4ECV and GLOBMAP were investigated for estimation of latent/sensible heat fluxes with HOLAPS in this study. The results show that all albedo datasets show similar accuracy for estimation of latent and sensible heat fluxes when validated against FLUXNET observations. The QA4ECV LAI leads to worse latent heat flux estimation due to its use of effective LAI rather than green leaf LAI. Sensitivity analysis also shows that the HOLAPS estimated latent heat flux (LE) is more sensitive to uncertainty in LAI than land surface albedo. Overall, the combined use of QA4ECV albedo and GLOBMAP LAI is suggested for estimation of latent/sensible heat fluxes with HOLAPS. The root mean square differences (RMSD) between estimations and FLUXNET measurements are 54 (30) W/m(2) for hourly (monthly) latent heat flux, and 80.5 (24.5) W/m(2) for sensible heat flux, which are comparable to estimates with MODIS and other reported studies.

AB  - To take the advantages of a variety of remote sensing data, the application of remote sensing image change detection is a very important choice. Remote sensing image change detection is large in computing capacity and time-consuming, and with the development of modern remote sensing technology, however, the amount of various remote sensing data obtained is getting larger and larger to find a change detection in the Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) images accurately for effective computing power.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Ocean Tidal Loading in InSAR Measurements Determined by Kinematic PPP Solutions of a Regional GPS Network
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal crustal deformation caused by ocean tidal loading (OTL) varies spatially and temporally, and this spatiotemporal variation in satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements needs to be determined. In this article, we propose a spatiotemporal modeling method to estimate the OTL displacements in InSAR measurements using the kinematic precise point positioning (PPP) solutions of a regional GPS network. We tested the method through an experiment using 25 Sentinel-1B images and long-term observations of 172 GPS reference sites from Southern California. The experimental results suggest that there are significant OTL and solid Earth tide effects in the differential InSAR interferogram, which is greater than 40 mm. We find that the spatial characteristics of OTL variations can be expressed as a high-order polynomial in the two variables of latitude and longitude, and the spatiotemporally modeled PPP tidal estimates of the high-density GPS sites can provide high precision OTL correction for all the pixels in the interferogram. In the last part of the study, we show that the spatial large-scale signals in the differential interferograms of Sentinel-1B data are mainly atmospheric delay, solid Earth tidal, and OTL effect, and demonstrate the importance of the tidal correction in the InSAR measurements.

TI  - Estimation of shortwave solar radiation using the artificial neural network from Himawari-8 satellite imagery over China
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we use an artificial neural network (ANN) method to estimate the downward surface shortwave radiation (DSSR) over China from Himawari-8 geostationary satellite data. As the training data of the DSSR estimation algorithm, ground-observed DSSR (GOS) data is compiled to complete the ANN method. GOS data from 89 stations over mainland China in 2016 are divided into training, testing and validation samples with a proportion of 3:1:1, in order to perform the DSSR estimation and accuracy validation. As a result, estimated DSSR from Himawari-8 data in 2016 shows good consistency with validation samples of ground observed DSSR, holding the determination coefficient and root mean square error of 0.90 and 88.86W m(-2) for the hourly mean DSSR, and 0.96 and 24.46W m(-2) for the daily mean DSSR, respectively.To investigate the spatio-temporal variation of daily DSSR in China, we performed the first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis based on the ANN-derived DSSR estimates. The spatial pattern of the first EOF mode reveals a larger DSSR variation in northeast and northwest China, in contrast to the smallest variation appeared in the southwest. The hourly ANN-derived DSSR analysis shows a peak point at noon (local time) in each region, particularly in the Tibetan Plateau. In terms of the monthly and annual DSSR spatial distribution, the regions with higher elevations, such as Northwest, Tibetan Plateau and Inner Mongolia Plateau in China, have larger DSSR than other regions. In contrast, relatively low DSSR appears in the southwest and the northeast of China through the year. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Predicting cloud movement and dynamics is an important aspect in several areas, including prediction of solar energy generation. Knowing where a cloud will be or how it evolves over a given geographical area can help energy providers to better estimate their production levels. In this paper we propose a novel approach to predicting cloud movement based on satellite imagery. It combines techniques of generating motion vectors from sequential images with neural networks. First, the images are masked to isolate cloud pixels, then Farneback's version of the Optical Flow algorithm is used to detect motion from one image to the next and generate motion vector flow for each pair of images. After that, a feed forward back propagation neural network is trained with the vector data derived from the dataset imagery. Different parameters for the duration of the training, size of the input, and the neighborhood radius of one point in the scene are used. Promising results are presented and discussed to weight the potential of the proposed algorithm for forecasting cloud cover and cloud position in a scene.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In this work, the theoretical foundations of a method to identify and routinely correct the phase unwrapping errors affecting a sequence of time-redundant sequence of differential SAR (DInSAR) interferograms are presented and discussed. Although the proposed method has principally been developed to work with differential SAR interferograms that form a triangleshaped network in the temporal/perpendicular baseline plane, as originally exploited by Extended Minimum Cost Flow (EMF) phase unwrapping (PhU) technique, it may simply be adapted to work with any network of time-redundant interferograms. The fundamental idea is to exploit the phase inconsistencies of triples of (already) unwrapped sequence of interferograms, prior to the application of any inversion for the generation of surface displacement time-series, to independently identify, for every SAR pixels, the 2 pi-multiple integers corrections to be applied to the unwrapped phases for adjusting the time-inconsistent phase unwrapping errors. This goal is achieved by solving a simple and computationally efficient network-based minimumcost-flow optimization problem. Some preliminarily experimental results, which have been obtained by processing a sequence of Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) SAR images collected over the California bay area, are presented.Y

AB  - We use Sentinel-1 A/B InSAR to measure deformation rates of -2 to 2.5 cm/yr in the Delaware Basin from fluid injection and extraction relating to oil and gas activity. Long-wavelength atmospheric effects make it challenging to obtain reliable time series, which are necessary to study the time-dependent deformation. We show that high-pass filters isolate the short-wavelength deformation signals from broad-scale atmospheric contributions. Future work will explore automatic ways to choose the most-suitable filter, which may be applied to other tectonically-stable regions.

TI  - Flood mapping employing local, regional and global scale modeling methods for the Uruguay river
T2  - REVISTA ELETRONICA EM GESTAO EDUCACAO E TECNOLOGIA AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The delimitation of flooded areas is important information for natural disaster management, environmental impact prediction and for territorial planning. Flooding occurs when water levels overflow the limits of a river's channel and seep into the floodplains. When they affect people, they are considered a natural disaster. The delimitation of a flooded area, in the occurrence of an extreme event, can be performed by using field techniques, such as mapping, surveying through the afflicted area or by taking aerial photographs. However, field survey is not a trivial task and not always does it allow for the attainment of the necessary data for a given project. For that purpose, there are various techniques that can be used to assess flood-spots. Some techniques are simpler, being based only on a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and such is the case of the HAND model (Height Above Nearest Drainage), which has garnered plenty of fame recently in the process of applying delimitations to possibly flooded areas. Other techniques are more complex, like the use of hydrodynamic modeling. There are large-scale hydrologic-hydrodynamic models that simulate runoff generation and water transportation processes in the river basin from rainfall, basin, and meteorological data. This is the case of the large-scale distributed hydrological model called MGB (Modelo de Grandes Bacias), which has been developed and employed in these types of cases. However, there are no studies in the literature that compare the results produced by these multiple approaches using differing degrees of complexity and spatial scales. It was precisely to fill this gap in scientific literature that this work was developed. Featured here, for the first time, is the validation of the MGB model's performance in two versions, one of regional scale and another of continental scale (MGB AS), in delimiting the flooded areas, compared to a satellite image of the inundation; and with two versions of the HAND model, one generated by a local study and the other by a global reference. The case study used in this validation was a major flood that occurred in the Uruguay River, near the town of Itaqui (Rio Grande do Sul), which borders Brazil and Argentina, in October 1997. The results show that the MGB model, both in the regional and the continental scales, could delimit the flooded area, with a few overestimations in the northern portion of the image. The HAND method at the local scale also allowed a mapping of the flooded area, with overestimates for more springhead-like areas in small tributaries. The HAND method at the global scale, on the other hand, proved to be inadequate for the purpose of delimiting flooded areas in this region. The leading cause is believed to be the small drainage area threshold linked to the utilized global HAND product. From the calculation of performance metrics, like hit rate, false alarm ratio and criticality index, Regional MGB was the one that most adequately expressed the extent of the flood observed in the Landsat 5 image when compared to the others, followed by MGB AS.

T2  - GEO UERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat islands (UHI) refer to the increase in the surface and atmospheric temperature, reaching metropolises and medium cities globally. Changes in land use, climate, and topography modulate the UHI. Understanding the relationship of these factors helps to identify causes and consequences. The study focuses on this area, with surface temperature (ST) analysis, UHI formation, and connection with other variables. The study area is the sixth-largest city in the state of Minas Gerais (Montes Claros), in an AW climate zone (Koppen). The ST modeling was based on the thermal band Landsat 5 and 8 for months August 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2018. Multivariate statistical analysis was applied between ST information, land use, and geomorphometric data. From 1991 to 2018, ST increased, converting ranges from 22 to 26 degrees C to over 28 degrees C, with the formation and an increase of 333% of UHI (UHI => 4 degrees C average/period). Natural factors of solar radiation, altitude, wind circulation index, and slope exposure face influence the dynamics of ST. However, the increase in ST has a better relationship with urban density and lower vegetation levels. The reduction of the UHI problem should focus on planning land use and increasing vegetation greenness.

AB  - The state of vegetation cover at the territory of Archinskoye, Shinginskoye, Kazanskoye, Yuzhno-Tabaganskoye and Zapadno-Ostaninskoye hydrocarbon deposits in the Tomsk Region was studied using satellite data from the MODIS spectroradiometer. The time series of the values of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were calculated for the period from 2007 to 2019. Analysis of the dynamics of changes in the average EVI values allowed us to determine the minimal and maximal values of the index for the studied territories, and to identify a trend of an increase in its values, which indicates a good (non-depressed) state of vegetation and an improvement in the environmental situation of the studied territories of oil-producing complexes in the Tomsk Region.

AB  - The use of satellite data for analyzing the dynamics of values of vegetation indices for vegetation of the territory of the Myldzhinskoye hydrocarbon field of the Kargasoksky district of the Tomsk region is considered. Based on MODIS satellite data (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), the time series of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were calculated. Annular zones relative to the Myldzhinskoye hydrocarbon field with radii of 10, 20, 30 and 40 km have been constructed using the ArcGis geographic information system. The average values of the EVI index for each of the constructed zones were calculated. The results of the evaluation of the long-term dynamics of the EVI vegetation index showed a specific index of seasonal cyclicity for the `internal' zone (radius 10 km) of the Myldzhinskoye hydrocarbon field of the Tomsk Region. Seasonal cyclicity in this area is characterized by a reduced length of vegetation period for plant communities.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) techniques can be applied to predict and monitor drought conditions due to climate change. Predicting future vegetation health indicators (such as EVI, NDVI, and LAI) is one approach to forecast drought events for hotspots (e.g. Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions). Recently, ML models were implemented to predict EVI values using parameters such as land types, time series, historical vegetation indices, land surface temperature, soil moisture, evapotranspiration etc. In this work, we collected the MODIS atmospherically corrected surface spectral reflectance imagery with multiple vegetation related indices for modeling and evaluation of drought conditions in the MENA region. These models are built by a total of 4556 and 519 normalized samples for training and testing purposes, respectively and with 51820 samples used for model evaluation. Models such as multilinear regression, penalized regression models, support vector regression (SVR), neural network, instance based learning K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and partial least squares were implemented to predict future values of EVI. The models show effective performance in predicting EVI values (R-2 > 0.95) in the testing and (R-2 > 0.93) in the evaluation process.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICANA RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article offers comparative ethnographic exploration of Komfa ritual engaged to "entertain the ancestors" that is central to the way of life of Spiritualists in Guyana. Practiced primarily by Guyanese of African descent and considered an Africa-derived tradition, Komfa worldview nonetheless draws on cultural inheritances of various Guyanese backgrounds. Embracing Komfa worlds serves as historical and genealogical inquiry into often indistinct, polysemous pasts wherein spirit guides lead devotees through emancipatory journeys of familial and personal (re)discovery. Komfa can best be understood through comparative analyses foregrounding "adjacent" Black Atlantic religious idioms. Frameworks developed in interrogating practices at the "margins" of Candomble, Lukumi, and Vodou situate Komfa and the spectrum that African-inspired religions encompass. In particular, existing ethnographic literature on Espiritismo as practiced in Cuba and elsewhere furnishes critical perspectives through which to understand Komfa that are more adequate than the bodies of scholarship consulted by researchers studying Komfa thus far.

TI  - The ideological origins of the genesis of messianic concepts in european sociopolitical thought
T2  - DIALOG SO VREMENEM-DIALOGUE WITH TIME
M3  - Article
AB  - The early ideas of politics and governance and the subsequent national ideologemes in Europeans states were grounded in religiopolitical imagery, namely Christian imagery. During the medieval era, the Christian worldview became the foundation of protomessianic concepts within the framework of state ideologies in many European countries. Those concepts were meant to explain the historical role and significance of different national entities. This article analyses the possible influence of the Old Testament imagery of Israel in relation to the genesis of those concepts in European intellectual history.

TI  - Spectra of the two official GLEs of solar cycle 24
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on ground-level data and on satellite data we determine in this work the observational spectrum of both, the Ground Level Enhancement of May 17, (2012) the so-called GLE71 and the Ground Level Enhancement of September 10, 2017 (GLE 72). We describe a simplified method to obtain the experimental spectrum at ground level. Data of the GLE71 and GLE72 indicate the presence of two different populations, each one with a different energy spectrum. On the other hand, we explore the kind of phenomena that take place at the source in these two particular events. In contrast with other methods based on the temporal synchronization between electromagnetic emissions of flares and coronal mass ejections (CME), here we develop an alternative option based on the study of the accelerated particles, by adjusting our theoretical spectra to the observational spectra. The main results of this work are the derivation of the source and acceleration parameters involved in the generation process. These results lead us to construct possible scenarios of particle generation in the source for each one of the two studied GLEs. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work we propose the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks for multivariate time series of satellite data for crop yield estimation. Recurrent nets allow exploiting the temporal dimension efficiently, but interpretability is hampered by the typically overparameterized models. The focus of the study is to understand LSTM models by looking at the hidden units distribution, the impact of increasing network complexity, and the relative importance of the input covariates. We extracted time series of three variables describing the soil-vegetation status in agroecosystems -soil moisture, VOD and EVI- from optical and microwave satellites, as well as available in situ surveys on crops across Continental U.S. to perform the experiments. Firstly, the models were validated in error terms. Secondly, the trained models were visualized and, thirdly, some useful statistics were extracted from the hidden unit activation heatmaps, accounting for redundancy and cluttering of activation responses. Results reveal how networks assign most of the relevance to soil moisture and focus on two phenological stages of crop growth.

TI  - LINGUISTIC AND CULTURAL FEATURES OF CHINESE STUDENTS STUDYING THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE (USING THE EXAMPLE OF STREET NAMES IN CHINESE AND RUSSIAN CITIES)
T2  - 14TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED2020)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)
CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - The article analyzes the experience of teaching the Russian language and theoretical disciplines to Chinese students at RUDN University (Russia). Recently, a large number of students from the People's Republic of China choose to study at RUDN University. Chinese students also come annually for language courses that last from 1 month to 1 year, which gives grounds for compiling special textbooks for them, in particular study guides, small bilingual dictionaries, and reference materials on intercultural communication. When teaching the Russian language to the Chinese, it is necessary to take into account the cultural component, as the worldview of China and Russia differs significantly. This paper proposes an analysis of differences in the linguistic culture of the Russian and Chinese languages using the example of street names in Chinese and Russian cities.The scientific novelty of the study is represented in a comparative description of hodonyms that is displayed as educational language material, which is also of practical value.The article gives classifications of Russian and Chinese hodonyms and analyzes in detail the differences in street names that are largely dictated by divergence in the perception of the world. Hodonyms as a part of the culture of any nation reflect the cultural identity of people speaking different languages and the particularity of nomination in them. The study of hodonyms involves deeper understanding of the culture of people who speak Chinese. As an illustrative material, hodonyms are used in teaching the Russian language at the preparatory faculty. Russian hodonyms have a number of features, some of which present a certain difficulty in the foreign students' mastering the Russian language at a beginner level. The greatest difficulty in studying Russian hodonyms is their declension, which is a grammatical feature of the inflected Russian language. At an advanced level, while studying the street names of Chinese and Russian cities students for whom the Chinese language is native are offered their linguistic and cultural analysis. The comparative study of Russian and Chinese hodonyms shows that they are closely connected with cultural traditions in China and Russia.

TI  - Is preoperative ultrasound of the axilla necessary in screen-detected breast cancer?
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary ultrasound (US) with fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of suspicious lymph nodes helps identify patients with axillary metastases preoperatively avoiding a 2-step axillary procedure. However, it does not accurately differentiate between low and high axillary tumour burden. Our aim was to determine the rationale of preoperative axillary US in screen-detected breast cancer.Methods: We retrospectively analysed patients, aged between 50 and 69 years, which had an invasive breast cancer diagnosed in the Slovenian National Breast Cancer Screening program between January 2012 and June 2017. Proportion of patients that proceeded directly to ALND and the proportion of patients with unnecessary ALND as a result of positive US-FNAB were calculated.Results: Altogether 892 patients were eligible for analysis. Preoperative US of the axilla was performed in 856/892 (96%) patients, while 36/892 patients (4%) did not undergo US of the axilla. We have found out that upfront ALND due to positive US-FNAB was performed in 91/856 (10.6%) patients. 116/856 patients (13.6%) had tumours in inner quadrants and maximal mammographic tumour size <= 2 cm. Among them only 1/116 (0.9%) proceeded directly to ALND due to positive US-FNAB.The final pathology of those who underwent upfront ALND due to positive US-FNAB showed low axillary tumour burden not meeting the indications for ALND in 13/91 (14.3%) patients.Among patients without preoperative axillary US, only 1/36 (2.8%) met the indications for ALND.Conclusion: Our results showed that performing US of the axilla is not justified in screen detected breast cancer patients.

T2  - Radiology and oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two prospective randomized studies analysing cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases and rapid development of systemic adjuvant therapy have changed our approach to stage III CM treatment. The aim of this study was to compare results of retrospective survival analysis of stage III CM patients' treatment from Slovenian national CM register to leading international clinical guidelines.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 2000, all Slovenian CM patients with primary tumour ≥ TIb are treated at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana and data are prospectively collected into a national CM registry. A retrospective analysis of 2426 sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies and 789 lymphadenectomies performed until 2015 was conducted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests.RESULTS: Positive SLN was found in 519/2426 (21.4%) of patients and completion dissection (CLND) was performed in 455 patients. The 5-year overall survival (OS) of CLND group was 58% vs. 47% of metachronous metastases group (MLNM) (p = 0.003). The 5-year OS of patients with lymph node (LN) metastases and unknown primary site (UPM) was 45% vs. 21% of patients with synchronous LN metastasis. Patients with SLN tumour burden < 0.3 mm had 5-year OS similar to SLN negative patients (86% vs. 85%; p = 0.926). The 5-year OS of patients with burden > 1.0 mm was similar to the MLNM group (49% vs. 47%; p = 0.280).CONCLUSIONS: Stage III melanoma patients is a heterogeneous group with significant OS differences. CLND after positive SLNB might still remain a method of treatment for selected patients with stage III.

AB  - Waveform re-tracking analyses have been proven to increase the accuracy of sea surface height (SSH) estimation from satellite altimeters specifically in coastal areas. However, each re-tracking algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses so that no dominant algorithm can be applied to any water condition. The study purpose was to obtain the best SSH estimation from altimeter satellite data using waveform re-tracking analyses with fuzzy logic system. The fuzzy logic system was used to select the best SSH values from the results of waveform re-tracking analyses. The data used in this study were level-2 SGRD data from Jason-2 and Jason-3 in Natuna Waters in 2016-2018. Waveform re-tracking with fuzzy logic system can reduce standard deviation of SSH up to 23.3 cm from the on-board (oceanic) algorithm standard deviation. The highest Improvement Percentage (IMP) value from each observation track was constantly generated by re-tracking with fuzzy logic system up to 70.3%. The result of this study showed that this analysis can produce SSH values with the best accuracy in each track observation.

AB  - In this study, stem volume measured by the Swedish National Forest Inventory were modelled using the k nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm, with k=1, 3, or 5 neighbors. As independent variables, the combination of two satellite sensors were used: the active radar sensor TanDEM-X and the passive optical sensor Sentinel-2. The results indicate that stem volume per species can be predicted relatively accurately, mainly due to the inclusion of Sentinel-2 data, while the total stem volume is largely predicted well due to inclusion of the TanDEM-X phase height. The prediction of total stem volume was, however, not significantly improved with the additional spectral information from Sentinel-2 about the tree species. The kNN method is somewhat limited in the highest range of volumes, since no extrapolation is supported. Thus, it is important to have a reference dataset representing the entire range of the population for a successful application. The main advantage of combining the two data sources is the convenient procedure of obtaining both the tree species classification and volumes (divided per species) in a single method. It is concluded, that when sufficient reference data are available, the kNN approach with a combination of radar and optical data provides additional information about the stem volumes (in terms of tree species), but without improving the prediction of the total stem volume accuracy.

T2  - Ecologica Montenegrina
M3  - Article
AB  - Every year wildfires bring damages to the environment of Montenegro, and, in particular, to the Lake Skadar/Shkodra environment. Wildfires are caused by dry and hot weather which is established yearly from July to September, and is likely linked to the regional climate change. In this study we used high resolution optical imagery (OLI Landsat-8 and MSI Sentinel-2A,-2B) to analyze concentrations of suspended particulate matter and chlorophyll-a in Lakes Skadar/Shkodra and Sas in order to understand the potential impact of wildfires on the lake ecosystem. The surface of burnt areas was calculated for different regions around Lakes Skadar/Shkodra and Sas. Our data showed that SPM values in lake water increase during wildfire. The highest SPM value was observed in the area around the mouth of the left branch of River Moraa where the largest areas affected by fires were observed. The SPM concentration in water of Lakes Skadar/Shkodra and Sas generally decreased after rainstorms. The need for implementation of a comprehensive fire management program that includes monitoring of impact of fires on aquatic ecosystems and their biota is emphasized.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Energy yield is a key metric for evaluating the performance of photovoltaic systems. It describes the total amount of energy generated by a photovoltaic (PV) installation over a given period, typically a year, and depends on physical properties of the solar cell like efficiency, band gap and temperature coefficient, as well as the operating conditions in a given location. Because the response of a solar cell to these conditions varies, two photovoltaic technologies may have a different energy yield, even if their lab efficiency is identical. Predicting energy yield accurately is important to system operators and installers to estimate the technical and economic performance of a PV installation. In this paper, we summarize our findings about satellite based energy yield predictions of solar cells with various technologies.

TI  - Investigating large methane enhancements in the US San Juan Basin
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2014, a satellite-based map of regional anomalies of atmospheric methane (CH4) column retrievals singled out the fossil fuel rich San Juan Basin (SJB) as the biggest CH4 regional anomaly ("hot spot") in the United States. Over a 3-week period in April 2015, we conducted ground and airborne atmospheric measurements to investigate daily wind regimes and CH4 emissions in this region of SW Colorado and NW New Mexico. The SJB, similar to other topographical basins with local sources, experienced elevated surface air pollution under low wind and surface temperature inversion at night and early morning. Survey drives in the basin identified multiple CH4 and ethane (C2H6) sources with distinct C2H6-to-CH4 emission plume ratios for coal bed methane (CBM), natural gas, oil, and coal production operations. Air samples influenced by gas seepage from the Fruitland coal formation outcrop in La Plata County, CO, had enhanced CH4, with no C2-5 light alkane enhancements. In situ fast-response data from seven basin survey flights, all with westerly winds, were used to map and attribute the detected C2H6 and CH4 emission plumes. C2H6-to-CH4 plume enhancement correlation slopes increased from north to south, reflecting the composition of the natural gas and/or CBM extracted in different parts of the basin. Nearly 75% of the total detected CH4 and 85% of the total detected C2H6 hot spot were located in New Mexico. Emissions from CBM and natural gas operations contributed 66% to 75% of the CH4 hot spot. Emissions from oil operations in New Mexico contributed 5% to 6% of the CH4 hot spot and 8% to 14% of the C2H6 hot spot. Seepage from the Fruitland coal outcrop in Colorado contributed at most 8% of the total detected CH4, while gas venting from the San Juan underground coal mine contributed <2%.

TI  - Information Ecology as a "Survival Strategy" of a Person in the Digital Environment
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The digital environment has already become a lifeworld of modern man. In this new lifeworld, the fundamental parameters of human existence, such as space and time, are being transformed. The forms of interpersonal and linguistic communication, types of personal identity and ways of understanding reality are changing. The main target of the impact of the digital environment is the human brain as a biological substrate of the psyche. In particular, under the influence of the digital environment, the nature of the adaptation of information by the human brain is changing. As a result, transformations (often negative) occur in various fields: emotional and behavioral (changes in needs and motivation, impaired empathy and attachment), cognitive (clip thinking, weakening of the synthesizing capabilities of the mind). These transformations entail changes in the human mind, in the ways of his self-identification, in his worldview and culture. The author traces how all these processes are studied in the recently developed new scientific field - information ecology. An attempt is also being made to philosophically reflect on how information ecology can help in a positive change in the digital environment that best meets human needs and requirements. Information ecology is a kind of culture of interaction with the digital environment. Its development is a manifestation of environmentalism - an "environmental change" in the study of the digital environment.

TI  - Surgical treatment of breast carcinoma after neoadjuvant therapy.
T2  - Rozhledy v chirurgii : mesicnik Ceskoslovenske chirurgicke spolecnosti
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant therapy (NT) applied before breast cancer surgery can lead in favourable cases to regression of the tumor or its total disappearance - pathological complete response (pCR). Due to downstaging after NT, the extent of the surgery can be reduced. pCR represents an important prognostic factor for survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of NT resulting in pCR on our sample of patients and to assess the frequency of locoregional recurrence (LRR) depending on the extent of the surgery in postoperative care.METHODS: This retrospective study was performed on asample of 96 patients who underwent breast cancer surgery between 2006 and 2018 after previous NT. On the basis of the histological examination after surgery we evaluated the degree of regression and thus also pCR. In postoperative care we followed the patients for any occurrence of LRR in the breast and axilla.RESULTS: pCR (Chevallier 1) was observed in 26 cases - 27.1%. During follow-up in postoperative care, 8 cases of LRR occurred - 8.3% (5.2% after mastectomy and 2.1% after breast-conserving surgery). Mean follow-up was almost 30 months with the median of 26.5 months.CONCLUSION: With the development of new NT procedures asignificant rise in pCR has occurred, predominantly in HER 2+ and triple negative subtypes, thus leading to adecreased incidence of LRR. The number of breast-conserving surgeries with sentinel lymph node biopsy is rising. In aselect group of patients breast-conserving surgery is safe and is associated with alow number of LRR events.

TI  - SOCIOLOGICAL COMPREHENSION OF THE PRESENT-DAY UKRAINIAN SOCIETY MODERNIZATION
T2  - SCIENCE AND INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Despite its widespread usage, the concept of "modernization" is not clearly defined. Concretization of its meaning depends on the researcher's worldview position.Problem Statement. The introduction of neoliberal economic principles did not lead to the improvement of society and the growth of human well-being. It transformed Ukraine into a raw-material appendage of global capitalism and the poorest country in Europe.Purpose. To analyze public opinion on the modernization of Ukrainian society and identify the prospects for science and innovative development in Ukraine.Materials and Methods. Analysis of statistical information and scientific publications on the problems of modernization, data of the sociological monitoring of social changes in Ukrainian society and two expert surveys (scientists of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and specialists on innovative development).Results. The author has proved that the transformation of Ukrainian society is not, in essence, a modernization. It is a neoliberal experiment under the guise of modernism, which rejected Ukraine from the cohort of the most industrially and scientifically developed countries to the periphery of the modern world, led to impoverishment and total despair of the majority of citizens. The author substantiates that it is impossible to modernize Ukraine and turn to innovative development within the existing neoliberal model and the oligarchic power rooting. As a result of financial genocide and the lack of state support, science in Ukraine is deprived of the opportunity to effectively perform its public functions, in particular, to be one of the decisive agents of modernization of society in the interests of all citizens.Conclusions. The specific political and ideological interests of a global capital stand behind the theory of modernization as an ideological and theoretical construct of modernity. The theory and practice of neoliberal modernization imposed on Ukraine as the main mean of reaching the path of successful socio-economic development have not lived up to the expectations and led to a chronic crisis state of the society. It requires finding another alternative model of development.

AB  - The characterization of snow conditions and the estimation of snow water equivalent (SWE) are the main goals of this paper, achieved through the exploitation of multi-frequency SAR data at both C- and X-bands from Sentinel-1 (S-1) and COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) satellites, respectively. Dry/wet snow conditions have first been assessed using C-band S-1 images. Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis was carried out by using datasets of in-situ snow measurements (i.e. snow depth, density, snow grain radius, temperature and wetness) collected in South Tyrol region, in north-eastern Italy. Simulations based on the Dense Medium Radiative Transfer (DMRT) forward electromagnetic model were considered to interpret and assess the experimental findings. Two retrieval algorithms for SWE estimation from X-band SAR data were implemented. These algorithms are based on machine learning approaches, i.e. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The training of the algorithms accounts for experimental data and DMRT model simulations and, then is applied to a selection of X-band CSK StripMap HIMAGE scenes collected over the test area. The results are promising, and pave the way for further analysis and validation to exploit the potential of SAR for snow parameter retrieval.

AB  - The knowledge of the distribution of crop types is of great importance to numerous applications at regional to global scales. Different techniques, including microwave remote sensing methods, have been developed for automatized, accurate crop mapping, however, the discrimination of crops with similar morphology and phenology remains a challenge. In this study, we investigate how to distinguish wheat and barley fields by applying statistical methods and a long-short term memory network to backscatter observed by the C-band SAR instrument onboard the Sentinel-1 satellite.

AB  - The Sentinel-2 mission is dedicated to land monitoring, emergency management and security. It serves for monitoring of land-cover change and biophysical variables related to agriculture and forestry. The mission is also used to monitor coastal and inland waters and is useful for risk and disaster mapping. The Sentinel-2 mission is fully operating since June 2017 with a constellation of two polar orbiting satellite units. Both Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B are equipped with an optical imaging sensor MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument) which acquires optical data products with spatial resolution up to 10 m.Accurate atmospheric correction of satellite observations is a precondition for the development and delivery of high quality applications. Therefore the atmospheric correction processor Sen2Cor was developed with the objective of delivering land surface reflectance products. Sen2Cor is designed to process monotemporal single tile Level-1C products, providing Level-2A surface (Bottom-of-Atmosphere) reflectance product together with Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), Water Vapour (WV) estimation maps and a Scene Classification (SCL) map for further processing.The paper will give an overview of the Level-2A product content and up-to-date information about the data quality of the Level-2A products generated with Sen2Cor 2.8 in terms of Cloud Screening and Atmospheric Correction. In addition the paper gives an outlook on the next updates of Sen2Cor and their impact on Level-2A Data Quality.

AB  - Vietnam is located in the tropical monsoon region belonging the Northwest of the Pacific Ocean, one of the six cyclone generating regions of the world. Annually, about 5-6 tropical cyclones (TCs) making landfalls in Vietnam bringing heavy rains and induced flooding, particularly to the Central coastal region because of its topography and geographic configuration. In a context of climate change, severe phenomena such as TCs, floods are projected to be more unusual. Therefore, an investigation of TCs and their induced precipitation system becomes increasingly important. The study focused on investigating characteristics of horizontal and vertical precipitation structure of TCs affecting the central region of Vietnam in relation with their tracks and landing regions by using radar satellite data of TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) and microwave rainfall retrieval of GSMaP (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation). We use spatial analysis method for precipitation structure associated with TCs in a relative coordinate of TC's center. The radial variation of the precipitation system is described by the average intensity of precipitation in azimuth from the storm center outwards. The results revealed that the vertical structure of TC precipitation changes in different directions in term of the rain intensity and frequency, confirming the asymmetry of the rainstorm, especially for TCs with weak intensity and changing direction. There is a correlation between the rainfall intensity near the surface and the storm height, but the degree of correlation varies within each storm, the correlation coefficient is lower when the tropical cyclone system approaching the central coast of Vietnam.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study aims to enhance the capacity of dengue prediction by investigating the relationship of dengue incidence with climate and environmental factors in the Mekong Delta region (MDR) of Viet Nam by using remote sensing data.Methods: To produce monthly data sets for each province, we extracted and aggregated precipitation data from the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation project and land surface temperatures and normalized difference vegetation indexes from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite observations. Monthly data sets from 2000 to 2016 were used to construct autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to predict dengue incidence for 12 provinces across the study region.Results: The final models were able to predict dengue incidence from January to December 2016 that concurred with the observation that dengue epidemics occur mostly in rainy seasons. As a result, the obtained model presents a good fit at a regional level with the correlation value of 0.65 between predicted and reported dengue cases; nevertheless, its performance declines at the subregional scale.Conclusion: We demonstrated the use of remote sensing data in time-series to develop a model of dengue incidence in the MDR of Viet Nam. Results indicated that this approach could be an effective method to predict regional dengue incidence and its trends.

AB  - Satellite imagery provides a unique source of data given its spatial and temporal coverage, with different level of detail that can be used in numerous applications. In this study, we present a long-term coastline monitoring in the coastal region of Tra Vinh province using the Landsat 5/8 images from 1988 to 2018. We analyzed 38 Landsat 5/8 images (in which the area of cloud and cloud shadow is less than 10% of total image area) using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System. Firstly, a multi-temporal cloud removal method consisting of radiometric correction, cloud and cloud shadow detection, and image reconstruction was implemented and applied to remove cloud and cloud shadow in images. The coastline monitoring derived from Landsat images in the period of time from 1988 to 2018 was then performed by using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. The results showed that the magnitude of erosion rate along the coast in Hiep Thanh, Dong Hai, Truong Long Hoa and Vinh Long communes, which is obtained from Landsat 8 images, was comparable with the observed values. The averaged value of erosion rate was -3.50 m/year when using Landsat 8 images, while its value was -0.60 m/year when using Landsat 5 images. Finally, the descrepancy of long-term coastline monitoring from Landsat 5/8 images was discussed.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of C-Band SAR in Contributing to Burn Severity Mapping in Tropical Savanna
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to map burn severity and to understand how it varies as a function of time of year and return frequency is an important tool for landscape management and carbon accounting in tropical savannas. Different indices based on optical satellite imagery are typically used for mapping fire scars and for estimating burn severity. However, cloud cover is a major limitation for analyses using optical data over tropical landscapes. To address this pitfall, we explored the suitability of C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for detecting vegetation response to fire, using experimental fires in northern Australia. Pre- and post-fire results from Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter intensity data were compared to those of optical satellite imagery and were corroborated against structural changes on the ground that we documented through terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter (VH) proved sensitive to the structural changes imparted by fire and was correlated with the Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR) derived from Sentinel-2 optical data. Our results suggest that C-band SAR holds potential to inform the mapping of burn severity in savannas, but further research is required over larger spatial scales and across a broader spectrum of fire regime conditions before automated products can be developed. Combining both Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data will likely yield the best results for mapping burn severity under a range of weather conditions.

AB  - Accurately measuring chlorophyll a concentrations within the world's oceans is an important part of building our understanding of its underlying processes and the human impact on it, and developing tools to do this is an area of active study. Some methods used today to collect this data include in-situ fluorometers on board automated Biogeochemical Argo floats, flow-through fluorometers on board oceangoing vessels, and ocean color algorithms applied to remote sensing data. While shipborne field fluorometers are the most accurate of the three since they can be recalibrated before and after each expedition, they are limited in spatial and temporal coverage due to their dependence on expensive oceanographic research cruises. The Biogeochemical floats help to increase the coverage of fluorometer data by automating the data collection, but are known to suffer from sensor drift over time since their fluorometers cannot be serviced and calibrated regularly. Remote sensing data has by far the greatest spatial and temporal coverage of the three methods, but is known to be significantly less accurate in certain regions and is limited to surface measurements. This study compares these three measurement methods by analyzing data collected by a 10AU Field and Laboratory Fluorometer connected to a flow-through system, data from a Biogeochemical Argo float, and satellite data from the VIIRS-SNPP dataset in the same region. The results of comparisons between each of these collection methods are presented.

AB  - Providing climate data records to infer seasonal and interannual variations from multiple heterogeneous sources is a challenging data fusion. We combine the Compressive Sensing (CS) and Deep Learning (DL) into a single framework for fusing data from multiple sensors to improve spatial and temporal resolution for long term analysis. CS is used as an initial guess to combine data from multiple sources. DL models, using Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM/RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), refine and further improve the data fusion from CS algorithm's output. The proposed framework has been tested the using daily global observations from two satellites the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) and the JAXA Greenhouse gases from Orbiting Satellites (GOSAT). Our framework achieves lower errors and high correlation compared with the original data. The quality of fused data is evaluated by comparing again AmeriFlux ground station's datasets. Long term trends using fused data over the United States indicate an increase of 8 parts per million (ppm) annually in XCO2 over four years with Root Mean Square Errors of 0.39 ppm and correlation of 0.98 compared with original data. Interannual variability of the seasonal cycle shows an increase in years 2015 - 2017, but a sharp decrease in 2018.

AB  - When it entered into the era of big data, Earth observing systems developed into a new stage, namely characterized by low cost, multi-national, multi-sensor and multi-modal with varying spatial and spectral resolutions confronting new challenges and opportunities. Climate data records from multiple data sources are used to infer seasonal and interannual variations which will advance and promote the development of data fusion methods. Compressed sensing is a new framework in which data acquisition and data processing are merged. It provides a new fantastic way to handle multiple observations of the same field view from complementary remote sensing instruments, allowing us to recover information at very low signal-to-noise ratio.We will particularly point out that a Compressive Sensing based framework is flexible enough for combining the two measurement systems by fusing the data from the two satellites, NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory -2 (OCO-2) and the JAXA Greenhouse gases from Orbiting Satellites (GOSAT) to calculate the interannual Net XCO2 variability over land for three latitudinal regions, Alaska/Canada, United States and the Amazon/Brazil. The OCO-2 design is optimized for sensitivity to XCO2 variations, with an unprecedented combination of spatial resolution (about 3km) with narrow nadir coverage, while GOSAT provides broader spatial coverage (10km) with wider scanning coverage. There are different temporal degradations of both instruments over time because GOSAT was launched in 2009 and OCO-2 was launched in 2014. Both instruments infer CO2 concentration from high-resolution measurements of reflected sunlight and use similar inversion algorithms to retrieve CO2 concentrations. Both are passive satellites providing on-orbit global measurements of the greenhouse gas, XCO2, for the years 2015 -2018. The results of the CS data fusion framework show that the fused data have Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) varying from 1.31 ppm to 4.12 ppm compared with original data, depending on the region of study and gridding resolution. Validation of fused data compared with AmeriFlux station towers observations shows RMSE of 2.68 ppm.

TI  - Global Iterative Geometric Calibration of a Linear Optical Satellite Based on Sparse GCPs
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Independent methods for geometric calibration (GC) have become an important research direction in the field of optical satellite technology. The main purpose of this research is to eliminate dependence on ground calibration sites using relative constraints between images. Based on a systematic analysis of these relative constraints, we found that it was difficult, if not impossible, to completely eliminate ground constraints, although the number of ground control points (GCPs) required can be greatly reduced. To achieve practical GC with high accuracy and low cost, we proposed a new method to compensate for systematic errors in linear optical satellite data acquisition using only the relative constraints between two overlapped images, namely, the corresponding elevation constraints and sparse GCPs. We first demonstrated the feasibility of GC with relative constraints and established an optimized GC model suitable for these relative constraints. We then presented a global iterative method to eliminate inaccuracies in internal calibration caused by the different distributions of GCPs within two images. The nadir (NAD) linear camera on board the Zi-Yuan 3 (ZY-3) satellite was used to evaluate the feasibility of the presented GC method; the results indicated that the present method effectively compensated for systematic errors. Thus, this article demonstrated the feasibility of GC without calibration sites.

AB  - The physics of near-Earth space - the Earth's upper atmosphere, ionosphere, and magnetosphere - is a fast-growing field of modem space research. Databases of geospace projects must take into account the nature of the measurements consisting of a prolonged record of the space parameters along the satellite's orbit (temperature, neutral and charged particle densities, electric and magnetic field components, etc., more than several dozen variables in total). The measured data must be matched to the satellite's position (in contrast, let's say, to solar space telescope that only requires time matching). The user query to the data storage is therefore represented by both spatial and temporal constraints. This drives the need for a specific database, API (Application Programmer's Interface), and user interface structure.A special centre for collection, processing, and distribution of satellite data is under development at the Space Research Institute of the NASU-SSAU (Ukraine). It is aimed, first of all, for the Ionosat-Micro and the Aerosol-UA projects but designed with an ability to host data from any geospace mission in mind.The goal of this article is to introduce the structure of the core component of this centre - the PROMIS information system (abbreviated from PROcessed Measurements of Ionospheric Satellites), available at https://promis.ikd.kiev.ua , to the expert community and to get feedback and suggestions on further improvements to usability and tbnctionality of this system.

AB  - Due to urban development and artificial heat emission, temperature rise and climate problems in urban areas are increasingly imminent.Rising temperatures and climate in urban areas have taken a toll on citizens’ lives.In particular, with the rise of global temperature, extreme heat and tropical night and other unusual high temperature phenomena occur frequently. In this study, multi-spectral Landsat satellite images were used to extract Cheongju-si’s brightness temperature, landuse classification, normalized difference vegetation index((NDVI), and analyze the correlation between green space change and temperature change. The analysis results show that if the proportion of green space increases by 10%, generally viewed the temperature decreases by 0.44℃. To reduce the temperature by 1℃, the increase of 0.081 NDVI is needed.Through the relationship between the distribution of green space and temperature, this paper provides reference for the urban planning and construction of Qingzhou city in the future.

TI  - Retrospective analysis of the diagnostic effectiveness of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in vulvar cancer
T2  - GINEKOLOGIA POLSKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Inguinal lymphadenectomy used in the treatment of vulvar cancer often results in complications, such as lymphoedema or abnormal wound healing. Aim of this study was assessment of the diagnostic effectiveness of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedure in patients treated due to vulvar cancer.Material and methods: Eighty-four patients diagnosed with squamous cell vulvar carcinoma (FIGO I-IV) underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy with technetium 99 to map sentinel lymph node. During surgery sentinel lymph nodes were identified and resected, followed by complete bilateral groin lymphadenectomy.Results: Sentinel lymph nodes were mapped with lymphoscintigraphy and biopsied in 84.3% and 90.1% of patients, respectively. False negative predictive value (FNPV) was 9.1% and false negative rate (FNR) was recorded in 16.7% of cases. Patients in advanced stages (FIGO III and IV) had significantly lower rate of lymphatic mapping compared to those in stage I and II (OR = 0.148, p = 0.022). Detection of sentinel lymph node in lymphoscintigraphy for tumor grade 2 and 3 was nearly eight times lower than for grade 1 cancers, however without statistical significance (OR = 0.126, p = 0.058).Conclusions: The use of SLNB should be limited to vulvar cancer patients in early clinical stages.

TI  - Metastatic and non-metastatic sentinel inguinofemoral lymph nodes in vulvar cancer show an increased lymphangiogenesis
T2  - ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and objective. Lymph node involvement is a strong predictor of disease recurrence and patient survival in vulvar cancer. The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) screening, the incidence of skip metastases, and lymph node lymphangiogenesis.Materials and method. Fifty-five patients participated in this prospective, single centre study. A double SLN screening method was employed using radiocolloid (technetium-99 sulfur colloid) and 1.0% Isosulfan Blue. Immunohistochemistry, using a mouse monoclonal antibody against D2-40, was used to evaluate lymphatic vessel density (LVD). All calculations were performed using STATISTICA software v. 10 (StatSoft, USA, 2011); p<0.05 was considered significant.Results. Using both methods of SLN detection, 100% accuracy was achieved, and skip metastases were diagnosed in only one woman (1.82%). Peri-tumour median LVD was significantly increased compared with matched intra-tumour samples (p <0.001), while median LVD was significantly lower in negative, compared with positive SLN, regardless of whether matched non-SLN were negative (p <0.001) or positive (p= 0.005). Metastatic SLN exhibited significantly higher median LVD compared with matched negative non-SLN (p =0.015), while no significant difference in median LVD was detected between positive SLN and matched positive non-SLN. However, negative SLN had a significantly higher median LVD compared with matched negative non-SLN (p = 0.012).Conclusions. SLN detection is a safe and feasible procedure in vulvar cancer. In patients without nodular involvement, SLN, compared with non-SLN, exhibited significantly higher median LVD, which may be an indication of its preparation to host metastases, and thus requires further investigation.

TI  - Effects of common pharmaceutical drugs (paracetamol and acetylsalicylic acid) short term exposure on biomarkers of the mussel <i>Mytilus</i> spp
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pharmaceutical drugs in the wild may pose significant risks to non-target exposed organisms. This situation is even more troublesome for coastal marine or estuarine environments, located in the vicinity of large human conglomerates, for which the putative number of pollutants is extremely high, and the regime by which wild organisms are exposed is continuous. In addition, the number of studies addressing this issue is still scarce, despite evidences that show the potential contamination profiles and adverse biological effects in organisms from such areas. In this study, the ecotoxicity of common pharmaceutical drugs (namely paracetamol and acetylsalicylic acid) was assessed, by studying the susceptibility of the mussel species Mytilus spp to oxidative stress after being exposed for 96 h to increasing but ecologically relevant concentrations of the two mentioned pharmaceuticals (paracetamol: 0, 0.5, 5, 50, and 500 mu g/L; acetylsalicylic acid: 0, 0.1, 1,10, and 100 mu g/L). The oxidative status in exposed organisms was analyzed by measuring oxidative stress biomarkers, namely catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), and lipoperoxidation (LPO) levels, whose alteration was indicative of chemical exposure, in both digestive gland and gills of the organisms. In addition, the food uptake and the nutritional reserve status of exposed organisms were also assessed, by measuring the consumption of ingested food, and levels of tissue reserves of glycogen in gills and digestive gland. No significant alterations were observed in the assessed oxidative stress parameters so it was possible to hypothesize that the studied drugs may have probably exerted a limited alteration of antioxidant defenses and damage, which was reverted by the activation of defensive adaptive mechanisms. This set of data evidenced that the pro-oxidative metabolism that was already described for both drugs in other animal models, was not fully established in the exposed mussels. On the contrary, glycogen reserves were substantially changed after exposure to both toxicants, being possible to observe opposite responses caused by both drugs. Food uptake was not altered following exposure to the drugs. Further evaluations are thus required to conclude about both drugs ecotoxicity and other parameters, namely seasonality, which should be considered when performing ecotoxicology tests, especially with the selected species.

TI  - Evaluation of species identification and rabies virus characterization among bat rabies cases in the United States
T2  - JAVMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVETo evaluate species identification and rabies virus (RABV) characterization among samples from bats submitted for rabies testing in the United States and assess whether a standardized approach to specimen selection for RABV characterization could enhance detection of a sentinel event in virus dissemination among bats.SAMPLEUnited States public health rabies surveillance system data collected in January 2010 through December 2015.PROCEDURESThe number of rabies-tested bats for which species was reported and the number of RABV-positive samples for which virus characterization would likely provide information regarding introduction of novel RABV variants and translocation and host-shift events were calculated. These specimens were designated as specimens of epizootiological importance (SEIs). Additionally, the estimated test load that public health laboratories could expect if all SEIs underwent RABV characterization was determined.RESULTSSpecies was reported for 74,928 of 160,017 (47%) bats submitted for rabies testing. Identified SEIs were grouped in 3 subcategories, namely nonindigenous bats; bats in southern border states, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands; and bats of species that are not commonly found to be infected with RABV. Annually, 692 (95% CI, 600 to 784) SEIs were identified, of which only 295 (95% CI, 148 to 442) underwent virus characterization. Virus characterization of all SEIs would be expected to increase public health laboratories' overall test load by 397 (95% CI, 287 to 506) samples each year.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCESpecies identification and RABV characterization may aid detection of a sentinel event in bat RABV dissemination. With additional resources, RABV characterization of all SEIs as a standardized approach to testing could contribute to knowledge of circulating bat RABV variants.

TI  - Excess Path Delays From Sentinel Interferometry to Improve Weather Forecasts
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A synthetic aperture radar can offer not only an accurate monitoring of the earth surface deformation, but also information on the troposphere, such as the total path delay or the columnar water vapor at high horizontal resolution. This can be achieved by proper interferometric processing and postprocessing of the radar interferograms. The fine and unprecedented horizontal resolution of the tropospheric products can offer otherwise unattainable information to be assimilated into numerical weather prediction models, which are progressively increasing their resolving capabilities. A number of tricks on the most effective processing approaches, as well as a novel method to pass from multipass differential interferometry products to absolute tropospheric columnar quantities are discussed. The proposed products and methods are assessed using real Sentinel-1 data. The experiment aims at evaluating the accuracy of the derived information and its impact on the weather prediction skill for two meteorological events in Italy. The main perspective of the study is linked to the possibility of exploiting interferometric products from a geosynchronous platform, thus complementing the inherent high resolution of SAR sensors with the required frequent revisit needed for meteorological applications.

AB  - This study analysed climate variables data in four stations over Thailand. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained from Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were also used to determine climatic trends in the areas under focus. The linear regression, Mann-Kendall trend, and Sen's slope tests were applied. Rain (R) gave higher values in July to October for most regions except in the Songkhla. Amount of R increased in all regions. Rainy season is caused by the Southwest monsoon, which is a normal occurrence in Thailand from June to September. However, this monsoon tended to begin earlier and last longer (May to October) than expected. Mean temperature (T-mean) values were found to be significantly higher from March to May and increased in all stations. The highest significant increases of annual T-mean were found in the North. There was no significant trend in annual R (Rainfall) at the 1% and 5% significance level in all stations. The AOD values were likely to increase in almost all stations. The highest significant increase of annual AOD was observed in Ubon Ratchathani.

AB  - In the framework of a project funded by the Italian Space Agency (Algoritmi-METEMW), experimental activities based on airborne multi-frequency microwave radiometric measurements and simultaneous ground-truth data collection have been carried out in Central Italy, in an agricultural area close to Florence. The aim of the project was the development of innovative algorithms for the estimate of hydrological parameters integrating active and passive microwave data. The retrieval algorithms are based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). IFAC multi-frequency microwave radiometers (at L, C, and X bands) have been installed on ultralight helicopters, which overflew the area in concomitance with SMAP and Sentinel-1 (S-1) image acquisitions. Comparisons of new data with past results confirmed the already stated relationships between microwave indices and soil and vegetation parameters. Soil moisture content (SMC) values estimated from L-band radiometric data are very close to those retrieved using the ANN algorithm. This result confirms the possibility of validating satellite algorithms with airborne microwave radiometers.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the poems by Marina Tsvetaeva in the aspect of elemental symbolism. The article aims to describe traditional for Russian linguistic culture and individual author's symbolism of the earth in M.I. Tsvetaeva's poems. The choice of the research object stipulates scientific novelty of the study, which was fulfilled applying descriptive and conceptual research methods. It has been noted, that the symbols, traditionally assigned to Russian linguistic culture, are represented in the poems by Tsvetaeva as pre-Christian: the earth is described by the poetess as a place of habitation, residence, Motherland, a house, arable land; the symbol of imperishability and support. The earth is one of the extrema - the lower and the upper points in vertical dimension, where the former denotes the ground and the Man as opposed to the latter, nominating the Heaven and the Creator. The ground is a Christian symbol of modesty, it is associated with death, ashes, a grave pit. The analysis undertaken has enabled to reveal individual author's symbols of the earth: earth - rock / stone; earth - mountain, unknown land - the sea, the earth - the air, the salt of the earth - talented people / victim. It has been shown, that the author's perception of a particular worldview fragment supplements the conceptual structure of macro concept "earth" with characteristics, which are not included into the structure of national concept.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances in tropical forests cause short-and long-term alterations in forest structure, species composition, and successional processes. However, improved understanding of the impacts of disturbance on forest functioning is needed to support forest management and conservation. In this study, we investigated the phenological responses of two sites in the Brazilian Amazon to forest degradation (selective logging and forest fires). We used MODIS-derived time-series to assess pre- and post-disturbance trajectories of two vegetation indices: Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). We found that our study sites present different VI seasonality, and that selective logging did not cause phenological shifts. Fires, on the other hand, caused explicit EVI shifts in the transition from wet to dry season in the driest site and barely no shifts in the wettest site, and yearlong NBR shifts compared to intact forests at both sites. Changes in the magnitude and timing of phenological events highlight human-induced changes in tropical forests functioning. If widespread, these shifts may have large-scale implications for carbon sink stability in tropical regions.

TI  - A Cloud and Cloud Shadow Detection Method Based on Fuzzy c-Means Algorithm
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud and cloud shadow detection is an important preprocess before using satellite images for different applications. It can be considered as a classification process, in which the objective pixels are partitioned into cloud/cloud shadow or non-cloud/non-cloud shadow classes. However, some cloud pixels, especially the thin cloud pixels, can be considered as a mixture of reflectances of clouds and land objects. In fuzzy clustering, the data points can belong to two or more clusters; hence, fuzzy clustering may better characterize the status of one given pixel belonging to clouds or non-clouds. The fuzzy c-means method (FCM), one typical fuzzy clustering method, was utilized in this study for cloud and cloud shadow detection. In addition, the "flood-fill" morphological transformation may misclassify some clear-sky areas surrounded by clouds as cloud shadows as a whole, so a modified cloud shadow index calculation was proposed. Moreover, a cloud and cloud shadow spatial matching strategy based on the projection direction and spatial coexistence was used to exclude some pseudo cloud shadows. Fewer predefined parameters and spectral bands are needed is one characteristic of the proposed method. In this study, 41 scenes including 27 Landsat ETM+ images in eight latitude zones and 14 Landsat OLI images comprising seven land cover types, including barren, forest, grass, shrubland, urban, water, and wetlands areas, with percentages of cloud cover from 4.99% to 97.63%, were utilized to confirm the validity of the FCM. The detected results demonstrate that the thick and thin clouds along with their associated cloud shadows can be precisely extracted by using the FCM. Compared with the function of mask (Fmask) method, the FCM has relatively lower producer agreement rates, but it misclassifies as clouds fewer clear-sky pixels; compared with the support vector machine (SVM) method, the FCM can achieve better cloud detection accuracy. The results demonstrate that the FCM can attain a better balance between cloud pixel detection and non-cloud pixel exclusion.

T2  - FINISTERRA-REVISTA PORTUGUESA DE GEOGRAFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The general duty of home confinement imposed in Portugal during the 45 days of State of Emergency due to the Covid-19 pandemic restricted leisure time to spaces surrounding houses. In this sense, considering the health benefits provided by green spaces, the main objective of this research is to identify injustices in the usufruct of these spaces in the municipalities of Braga and Guimardes, based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. The results show that 19% of the territory of Braga and Guimaraes presents a problematic situation in the use of green spaces, especially in the urban centres and surroundings areas, where vegetation is very depleted. It should also be noted that, in Guimaraes, diffuse urbanization/industrialization promotes the existence of critical areas also outside the urban perimeter, especially in the villages. This mapping constitutes an important input for emergency plans for similar situations, contributing to the maximization of resources when implementing measures that promote vegetation.

AB  - Initial results of biomass estimation in the La Fusta area from existing equations found in literature are presented. As expected, accuracy of general equations suffer from the equation coefficients being obtained from fitting training data from different sites. It is also clear from the results that there is a high variance between different methods, in particular when complex data mixture is applied. Biomass is difficult to assess for dense forests, as pixels are saturated. This must be considered when planning field-data collection, with more samples in dense forest to provide more robust estimators from the training phase. The SAR-only (PALSAR) method from eq. 4 provided the most bias in results, overestimating with respect to the other methods.Y

AB  - Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image time series have been employed for the analysis of temporal patterns of natural features in terms of the extended polarimetric scattering properties. However, the time series provide a rich scattering information that can be used for tracking and analyzing the evolution of targets, individuating smooth and/or abrupt changes. In this work we propose a wavelet framework that exploits the information from polarimetric features and analyze them to both mitigate the speckle effect on the multi-temporal information and improve the targets homogeneity using the multi-temporal information. The framework combines the powerful description from the main polarimetric decomposition features and the temporal analysis using geometrical wavelet transform. The analysis is applied on a multi-temporal polarimetric dataset of Radarsat-2 images acquired over the Argentiere glacier site.

TI  - Protection against imposing unfavorable contract terms by the dominant party in the russian legislation: issues of ensuring the balance of convenience
T2  - JURIDICAS CUC
M3  - Article
AB  - Legal issues of counteracting the imposition of unfavorable contract terms by the dominant party raise a number of theoretical and practical problems. The authors of the article try to determine the legal nature of imposition and develop methods of comprehensive counteraction to this violation in order to ensure the balance of convenience. From the philosophical perspective and a certain worldview, the study is based on the balance of convenience regarded as the objective foundation of legal regulation. The main philosophical and scientific methods used in this article include the dialectic method, the formal-legal method, the method of legal hermeneutics, as well as the comparative-legal and empirical methods. The theoretical basis is represented by scientific works in the field of civil, administrative, entrepreneurial and procedural branches of law. The legal nature of imposition as a type of violation should be determined with due regard to the general logic of antitrust regulation. The parallel use of both public and private law necessitates the development of procedural legal means ensuring uniform law enforcement and the balance of convenience. First of all, the unity of approaches regarding legal tools of public and civil law should be concerned with the definition of features and the essence of elements compiling the imposition itself. The authors also propose approaches to the formation of an appropriate procedural model.

AB  - Models for the prediction of soil texture for the Abitibi River Forest (ARF) region in the District of Cochrane in Ontario, Canada were created from environmental covariates generated from remotely-sensed data as soil formation factors. A novel approach of incorporating LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) retrievals for the entire study area to derive covariates of canopy height model (CHM) and gap fraction was investigated. CHM and gap fraction had high variable importance for the soil texture models fitted for the region, with CHM being the most important variable out of a set of 104 predictors, and gap fraction among the top predictors. Random forest (RF) and support vector machine with radial basis functions (SVM Radial) approaches were utilized for the soil texture classification. The inclusion of CHM and gap fraction with other environmental predictors improved upon the accuracy of soil texture models, with accuracy scores exceeding 0.7 and Cohen's kappa greater than 0.5. Prediction maps for soil texture were generated for the ARF study region.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The aim of the article is to study manifestations of the underwater topography features in the northern part of the White Sea in the images made by the spaceborn synthetic aperture radars (SAR) Sentinel-1A, Sentinel-1B.Methods and Results. In the SAR images, the bottom features are revealed as bright and dark brightness anomalies. The anomalies were observed at the wind speed ranging from 2.6 to 10.8 m/s, and became reverse (bright anomalies turned dark and vice versa), when a tidal current changed its direction. It is shown that the observed SAR imagery contrasts correlate to divergence of a current formed by interaction of a tidal flow with the bottom topography inhomogeneities. The simulated SAR contrasts agree with the observations, and confirm the relation between the observed SAR contrasts and the current divergence. Together with modeling the SAR contrasts, the contribution of different mechanisms to formation of the observed modulations of the normalized radar cross section was qualitatively estimated. The wave breaking effect was especially accentuated. The method for retrieving the underwater bottom topography based on the relationship between the bottom gradient and the SAR imagery contrasts is proposed.Conclusions. Location of the bottom inhomogeneities in the shallow water region on the whole coincides with that of the tidal current divergence and convergence zones, which are observed as brightness anomalies in the SAR images. Breaking of surface waves is the main contributor to the observed SAR contrasts. The bottom topography reconstructed from the SAR contrasts, and the actual one resulted from the bathymetry maps are in good agreement. Some discrepancies are interpreted as possible changes in depth and shape of the bottom topography features induced by action of strong currents and waves.

TI  - Remote Sensing for Optimal Estimation of Water Temperature Dynamics in Shallow Tidal Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the increasing anthropogenic pressures on lagoons, estuaries, and lakes and considering the highly dynamic behavior of these systems, methods for the continuous and spatially distributed retrieval of water quality are becoming vital for their correct monitoring and management. Water temperature is certainly one of the most important drivers that influence the overall state of coastal systems. Traditionally, lake, estuarine, and lagoon temperatures are observed through point measurements carried out during field campaigns or through a network of sensors. However, sporadic measuring campaigns or probe networks rarely attain a density sufficient for process understanding, model development/validation, or integrated assessment. Here, we develop and apply an integrated approach for water temperature monitoring in a shallow lagoon which incorporates satellite and in-situ data into a mathematical model. Specifically, we use remote sensing information to constrain large-scale patterns of water temperature and high-frequency in situ observations to provide proper time constraints. A coupled hydrodynamic circulation-heat transport model is then used to propagate the state of the system forward in time between subsequent remote sensing observations. Exploiting the satellite data high spatial resolution and the in situ measurements high temporal resolution, the model may act a physical interpolator filling the gap intrinsically characterizing the two monitoring techniques.

AB  - The results of studies of atmospheric aerosol over the territory of Russia are of great interest from the point of view of environmental and climatic problems. The article presents the results of the spatial-temporal variability of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) over the Asian Part (AP) of the Russian Federation in recent decades. The Database (DB) "Aerosol optical thickness of the atmosphere from satellite and ground-based observations" created by the authors was used. The presented trends in AOT changes (annual values, summer values) and statistical estimates of real empirical series show that there is a good agreement between the annual values of AOT for satellite and ground-based values, for monthly values the discrepancy has more value. Based on observational and reanalysis data, the interannual variability of the average annual and average summer values of the total radiation flux coming to the surface was studied. The empirical typification of interannual changes in the intra-annual course of the cloud cover values (%) over the considered time interval was carried out. The analysis was performed for the Tiksi Arctic station and for the Yakutsk, Ussuriysk, Irkutsk and Yekaterinburg stations located in the AP of the Russian Federation.Introduction

AB  - Increasing awareness of the adverse impacts of human-induced environmental change have prompted the need for more sustainable development and proactive planetary restoration. An essential component is to equip stakeholders with timely and reliable data that provide informed understanding of landscape change across varying spatial and temporal scales. The Earth Observation Data for Ecosystem Monitoring (EODESM), which is based on the Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS), is an open source system allowing routine and automatic generation of land cover and change maps from Earth Observation (EO) data. It is currently being developed and implemented at national scales through the Living Wales project (https://wales.livingearth.online) using multi-source freely available EO data, including those provided by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 sensors. Airborne LiDAR, Open Street Map, Copernicus High Resolution Layers, and National Forest Inventory data have also been integrated. These EO data are transformed into Environmental Descriptors (EDs) which are then combined in EODESM to generate land cover maps. From those maps, changes are detected in the landscape using the evidence-based change module. The system allowed generation of nationally consistent land cover maps for Wales (UK) at 10 m spatial resolution. Using the evidence-based change module, 2017-2019 multi-year forest clearcutting as well as daily changes in water extent associated with flooding were identified and described. As the system is independent of temporal and spatial scale, EODESM has the capacity to classify diverse landscape changes across multiple time frames (e.g., localised episodic events or decadal processes) and provides robust, consistent and interpretable classifications. Furthermore, additional EDs can be ingested, which provides a logical and simple approach to tailoring user requirements. EODESM shows considerable promise for directing short to long-term restoration and enhancing natural resource management in support of greater ecosystem resilience.

TI  - How pharmacoepidemiology networks can manage distributed analyses to improve replicability and transparency and minimize bias
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Several pharmacoepidemiology networks have been developed over the past decade that use a distributed approach, implementing the same analysis at multiple data sites, to preserve privacy and minimize data sharing. Distributed networks are efficient, by interrogating data on very large populations. The structure of these networks can also be leveraged to improve replicability, increase transparency, and reduce bias. We describe some features of distributed networks using, as examples, the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies, the Sentinel System in the USA, and the European Research Network of Pharmacovigilance and Pharmacoepidemiology. Common protocols, analysis plans, and data models, with policies on amendments and protocol violations, are key features. These tools ensure that studies can be audited and repeated as necessary. Blinding and strict conflict of interest policies reduce the potential for bias in analyses and interpretation. These developments should improve the timeliness and accuracy of information used to support both clinical and regulatory decisions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Global trends in agricultural production and environmental management require the mandatory use of geoinformation technologies and Earth remote sensing data as a basis for informational support for effective management of land and soil resources. Therefore, it is important to develop a methodology for using space scanning data to create spatially-differentiated soil quality management systems, which take into account the quantitative estimates of spatial soil variation and the results of pedotransfer modeling to evaluate soil quality and create optimal agrotechnologies. Experimental studies in different regions of Ukraine showed the effectiveness of the developed technology for soil decoding by multispectral space data with high spatial resolution to determine soils, which are different in complex assessment of soil physical quality for the diagnosis of especially valuable, optimal and modal parameters of soils, their degraded and underproductive kinds. Coherent analysis of the results of space image classification and geostatistical processing of soil field surveys is effective for a reasonable extrapolation of evaluation results at large territories and the development of agrotechnologies, which provide optimal conditions for development of agricultural plants and increase their productivity.

AB  - This article is devoted to the science place problem study in culture, its relationship with other sociocultural phenomena. The purpose of the article is to identify the post-non-classical science relationship specifics with such a phenomenon of modern culture as design. The identification of this specificity can serve as an argument that testifies to the rootedness of post-non-classical science in modern culture. To achieve this goal, the authors set the following tasks: 1) analysis of the science sociocultural determination levels and types; 2) the disclosure of the postnon-classical science and modern design features; 3) the identification of the correlation between them. The authors proceed from the idea of synchronism or parallelism as a form of interaction of sociocultural phenomena and processes. A comparative analysis of the post-nonclassical science and modern design main characteristics reveals their common features. The authors associate the existence of these correlations with the sociocultural, worldview influence of postmodernism. The obtained result confirms the idea of the post-non-classical science rootedness in modern culture.

TI  - Traumatization of consciousness as a new form of political violence
T2  - RUDN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY-VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV SERIYA SOTSIOLOGIYA
M3  - Review
AB  - This article is a review of the book by Zh.T. Toshchenko The Society of Trauma: Between Evolution and Revolution (Theoretical and Empirical Analysis) (Moscow: "Ves Mir"; 2020). In recent years, a new type of political violence has developed - traumatization of consciousness, which is especially typical for 'the society of trauma'. The book by Toshchenko examines the challenges that the world and Russia face due to the complex changes in public consciousness, which are mostly of a man-made character. Previously the research focused on the relatively individual questions such as 'pathological agency' (P. Sztompka) or construction of the politically biased meanings that traumatized the public consciousness (J. Alexander), while Toshchenko defines the issue much broader dysfunctional changes of the whole society - and studies its transformations through the realities of 'the society of trauma', the features of which can be seen in different countries that entered the path of a long, turbulent, unstable and unsustainable development. In the societies of trauma, there are no clear worldview ideas, which leads to gaps and paradoxes in the public consciousness and to the loss of life guidelines. Political pressure on the public consciousness is exerted through 'soft power' based on demagogy about democracy, freedom and human rights. Toshchenko sees the way out of the society of trauma and the way for overcoming the ideological and political anomie in the development of civil activity and the strategic goal and means to achieve it. The book allows to identify further research topics, in particular, the study of new mechanisms for traumatizing the public consciousness, which would help to search for the transition of our society to the humanistic development trend.

TI  - Integrating Models and Remote Sensing Data for Distributed Glacier Mass Balance Estimation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an approach to improve the estimation of the glacier mass balance (GMB) of six selected alpine glaciers in the European Alps. This is achieved by combining three complementary data sources: hydroclimatological model, remote sensing (RS) data, and ground measurements. The hydroclimatological model provides spatially distributed mass balances. RS supplies spatially distributed surface characteristics. The ground point measurements provide the mass balance at the local scale. The combination of these data sources allows us to improve the spatial resolution of the model output and its GMB estimates. We used the alpine multiscale numerical distributed simulation engine model (AMUNDSEN), which considers the processes of accumulation and ablation of snow and ice for the area of the entire glacier (with a given spatial and temporal resolution). In the proposed integration approach, we first compute the deviations between the GMB simulation (afforded by the hydroclimatological model) and the ground measurements. Then, the RS data are used to define a feature space (which objectively characterizes the glacier surface properties). The method estimates the adjustment required to the model, for each unlabeled sample, leveraging on its neighboring labeled samples in the feature space. This allows us to apply similar adjustment to samples sharing similar glacier surface conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed integration approach achieves an average root-mean-square error of 460mm (compared to 732 and 661mm obtained by the hydroclimatological model and the standard regression models, typically used for parameters estimation).

TI  - ESCHATOLOGICAL IMAGES IN THE LIVING SPEECH OF THE CONTEMPORARY OLD BELIEVERS OF PERM PRIKAMYE
T2  - IZVESTIYA URALSKOGO FEDERALNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-GUMANITARNYE NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - This article considers the reflection of certain peculiarities of Old Believer religious consciousness in the language of the contemporary Prikamye Old Believers. The description of vocabulary, phraseology, paremiology, and utterances found the living speech of contemporary believers is aimed at the restoration of the cultural context of tradition and revealing the peculiarities of expression of the eschatological theme, the main one for Old Believer ideology. Observations of the living speech of the Old Believer dialect bearers help reveal a set of linguistic forms expressing the meaning of human existence, including vocabulary and proverbs reflecting the ideas of Old Believers concerning death and new birth of the world, the ways of death visualisation, posthumous existence, and fate of the souls of the dead. In the course of interpretation of such means, supplemented by the descriptions of the Old Believer ritual practices, the author reveals the attitude tradition bearers have towards death as well as the peculiarities of their life ideals and moral values. To reveal cultural and ideological meanings, the author analyses the figurativeness of words and expressions existing in the Old Believer vocabulary, comparing religious and cultural connotations of language forms under study. While describing the means representing the ideas of the end of the world and the person's death, the author emphasises their relation to religious texts and verbal pre-Christian tradition symbolism. The author concludes that the Old Believer linguistic worldview reflects a peculiar syncretic worldview which is associated with the fading away of the tradition and the decline of religious literacy. The linguistic representation of the Old Believer worldview peculiarities denotes that not only book learning, but also naive religious archaic ideas have an effect on their consciousness.

AB  - Peatlands contain a large amount of the carbon stocks of the biosphere. Mapping the extent, locations and conditions of peatland at the landscape scale has implications for carbon inventories, conserva- tion and ecosystem services assessments. Digital Soil Mapping provides a (geo)statistical framework to quantitatively model relationships between soil properties measured or observed on the ground and environmental covariates. The main aim of this paper was to present some successful examples of DSM for northern peatlands and their condition, in particular mapping and modelling peat presence and condition using a range of available earth observation sensors. Remote sensing data were also used to map the potential of the peat being degraded. The two results were combined to provide a probabilistic indication of where degraded peat can be found in Scotland. The results could be validated with good outcomes that visually agree with the expert evaluation and the common knowledge of the landscape. These probabilities and uncertainties need to be taken into account to improve further modelling such as earth surface modelling or carbon accounting.

AB  - The concept of digitalization of agricultural production in the Russian Federation provides for the implementation of measures to develop and create a system of geographic information monitoring and decision support in crop production. The aim of the research was to conduct geoinformation monitoring of rice crops to develop methods for automated mapping of their condition and yield forecasting. The studies were carried out on a test site of the Federal State Budget Scientific Institution "Federal Scientific Center of Rice" with an area of 327 hectares. The main cultivated crop is the Flagman rice variety. The survey was performed by a quadcopter with a MicaSense RedEdge-M multispectral camera mounted on a fixed suspension. The shooting period using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was limited to early June and additionally used the Sentinel-2A satellite data covering the entire analyzed period (06/05/2019 - 08/29/2019). To assess the state of rice crops, the normalized relative vegetative index NDVI was used. Based on the NDVI distribution and yield information from the combine TUCANO 580 (CLAAS), a statistical analysis was carried out in fields 7 and 9 All-Russian Research Institute of Rice ("VNII Rice"). Testing of the experimental methodology for monitoring crops in 2019 on the basis of remote sensing of test plots and geoinformation modeling and the statistical apparatus should be considered satisfactory.

AB  - In recent decades integration of GIS platform is the primary for land use change monitoring and forecast it. Among various methods of GIS integration in agricultural or forest studies have a very important role in region such the Republic of Mari El. Land use change can directly transform wide landscapes, impact on the biodiversity and eco-productivity. Hence, observations and methods needed to quantitatively assessment land cover dynamics that influence the sustainability of forest management. The relevance of the problem is due to the importance of forest disturbances monitoring, tracking of changes and defense from emergency situations. The main objective of this research is to create the maps of land use change of the Republic of Mari El using remote sensing data and geospatial technologies. GIS-based map algebra was applied for calculating land use change with the use of integration of remote sensing data. The resulting maps show how different types of land use and land cover parameters have changed. The entire modeling approach support the essential logic of probabilistic indicates of change.

TI  - POSTMODERNISTIC PROJECT AND CONTEMPORARY UKRAINIAN LITERATURE
T2  - ROCZNIKI HUMANISTYCZNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The main subject of the research in this article is the exhaustion of postmodernism as a philosophical doctrine and aesthetical practice. Postmodernism has not became a universal phenomenon in contemporary Ukrainian literature, which is reliving the difficult process of emerging from colonial dependence. It existed in Ukraine between 1986-1991 as an answer to the worldview that was popular in the West. The end of this artistic direction the author associates with those events which took place in 2013-2014, when Ukrainian society and Ukrainian culture moved into a new phase of existence. The consequences of these events, reflected in the media, public opinion and also in literature, led to the rejection of the postulates of postmodernism. It should be said that these postulates reveal a clear dysfunctionality. The postmodernist play and general scepticism, as can be seen, can be not only a position taken by an independent, intellectual person, but also an imitation strategy that conceals a neo-imperial doctrine which is portrayed as a liberal project. Sometimes it is too difficult to distinguish one from the other. Thus, the boundaries of postmodernism are clearly defined, or more precisely, the prevalence of its basic principles are. Over time, this phenomenon has received radically different interpretations, which is why a systemic deconstruction of the whole project is required. From such a point of view, therefore, a thesis about the death of postmodernism has its reasons, especially in Eastern Europe. From the Ukrainian perspective, the characteristic crossing of time and place (Eastern Europe) has put the Western project of postmodernism into a stupor, prompting us to search for alternative worldviews and aesthetic models. However, this artistic direction can motivate modern Ukrainian intellectuals in its own way, opening up new horizons in the comprehension of this epoch.

AB  - The present study is focused on the littoral zone between Rome and Civitavecchia, where the spatio-temporal dynamics of the land cover has been analysed during the last thirty years, by means of Remote Sensing and GIS procedures. In a few decades, the coastal municipalities within the study area have considerably increased their inhabitants. Population and urban expansion have grown in parallel, at the expense of agricultural and natural areas, especially in the narrow coastal strip between the sea and the hills. Landsat satellite data from 1990 to 2019 have been processed and classified in order to describe and map the Land-Cover change (LCc). Maps have been suitable integrated with population data and other geospatial layers (transportation network). The results obtained allowed to understand the natural and rural land transformations, especially those related to the urban growth and expansion that are related to the proximity of Rome City.

TI  - University and Congress as Interdisciplinary Communicative Environment (Experience of Philosophical Comparison)
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article actualizes the problem of the university community as a key meaning-forming scientific environment and the congress as a form of scientific communication. The perspectives of interdisciplinary communication in the university environment and also the experience of Russian philosophical congresses, which have become an important factor in the scientific consolidation of the Russian philosophical community, are considered as material for this kind of comparison, designed to demonstrate the substantial similarity of the problems arising in scientific communities. The author notes the similarity of the problems arising in the formation process of the disciplinary diversity (specialization) of the university environment and the similarity between the functioning of the classical within a modern university (on the example of Belgorod State University) and the problems that are solved at philosophical congresses. Philosophical congresses help to overcome a period of disciplinary fragmentation, which philosophy is now also going through. At the same time, the author notes the importance of the experience gained within the framework of philosophical congresses for solving the problems of university education, in which philosophy traditionally plays an important role in ensuring interdisciplinary communication between faculties. It explains the need for consistent and various attention to philosophical congresses on the part of Russian national universities, which are going through the time of searching for historically well-timed forms of scientific and educational activity. Due to the practical development of personal worldview and methodological beginnings of cognitive activity of high educational level, the author proposes for discussion at the upcoming philosophical congresses (Russian and international) topics related to the question of prospects of philosophical communities in universities. According to the author, it can be the subject of a broad discussion at the next Russian philosophical congress.

TI  - Exploring the Impact of Various Spectral Indices on Land Cover Change Detection Using Change Vector Analysis: A Case Study of Crete Island, Greece
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study was to explore the impact of various spectral indices on the performance of change vector analysis (CVA) for detecting the land cover changes on the island of Crete, Greece, between the last two decades (1999-2009 and 2009-2019). A set of such indices, namely, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), albedo, bare soil index (BSI), tasseled cap greenness (TCG), and tasseled cap brightness (TCB), representing both the vegetation and soil conditions of the study area, were estimated on Landsat satellite images captured in 1999, 2009, and 2019. Change vector analysis was then applied for five different index combinations resulting to the relative change outputs. The evaluation of these outputs was performed towards detailed land cover maps produced by supervised classification of the aforementioned images. The results from the two examined periods revealed that the five index combinations provided promising performance results in terms of kappa index (with a range of 0.60-0.69) and overall accuracy (with a range of 0.86-0.96). Moreover, among the different combinations, the use of NDVI and albedo were found to provide superior results against the other combinations.

AB  - MODIS Aqua derived primary production and sea surface temperature (SST) data are used for calculating the f ratio and new production using previously developed models. Developed models were validated with in-situ new production and f ratio values from cruise dataset collected during September 2014. The regression between derived and bottle measured Pnew value showed R<sup>2</sup> =0.553, SEE=[plus or minus]51.632, MNB=-0.414 and RMSE=[plus or minus]266.398. Similarly f ratio is validated with in-situ derived value showed the clear underestimation with a R<sup>2</sup> =0.537, SEE=[plus or minus]0.016, MNB=-0.560 and RMSE=[plus or minus]0.182. The seasonal and inter-annual variation of primary production, f ratio and new production showed the clear seasonal pattern between the seasons. The high (133.64 mgCm<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) and low (31.69 mgCm<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) new production ranges are observed during premonsoon and summer seasons. The integrated primary production and f ratio of all the seasons provides a significant R<sup>2</sup> =0.585. This is used to estimate the total annual primary production of Bay of Bengal as [approximately]11%. The minimum (0.028 GTCyr<sup>-1</sup>) and maximum (0.037GTCyr<sup>-1</sup>) annual new production observed for the years of 2014 and 2006. In the entire processes of primary production, new production rate was less and it indicates Bay of Bengal largely as the regeneration based basin than the new production.

AB  - The article presents the results of the analysis of words-stimuli "home", "Motherland", "Russia", "Russian", "language", undertaken with consideration of the data obtained in a pilot associative experiment with Russian-speaking groups of migrants (ethnic Jewish and Germans), living in Munich (Germany). A comparative analysis of experimental data and the data given in associative dictionaries was performed with the aim to reveal the influence of respondents' ethnic background on transformation of associative fields, which is connected with changes in cultural environment. The authors draw a conclusion that in the fields with the words-stimuli "Russia", "Russian language" the respondents' quantitative reactions demonstrate a low level of change, coinciding with the ones, stipulated in the dictionaries. This type of words-stimuli is labeled as "migratory stable" and is opposed to "migratory unstable" in the contents of associative fields with the words-stimuli "home", "Motherland". Some noticeable changes and trends of considerable transformations under the influence of the foreign culture environment are discovered. The respondents' quantitative reactions deviate from those registered in the dictionaries. The article gives reasons for transformations and/or preserving the contents of associative fields of the words-stimuli under study. The ethnic characteristics of the groups under experiments are stated having little influence on transformation of the associative fields, whereas the cultural background, the worldview was formed at, demonstrates some considerable effect on their consciousness.

T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: for the first time, the article considers the representations that affect the problem of periodization of the formation of the ancient Ugric community (the ancestors of the Mansi, Khanty, and Hungarians) and their division into the Hungarians and Ob Ugric peoples. Transition stages from one period to another are revealed, which are manifested in the migrations of peoples. Folklore plots reflecting the Ugric period are reconstructed and their comparison with ethnic history is reproduced. The analysis of the language material provides an understanding of the existence of each period, conveys the essence of the values and historical processes of the time under study.Objective: to reveal based on the analysis of folklore texts and data of the language of the Northern Mansi group (Sosva and Sygva dialects) new ideas about the periods of the ethnic history of the Ugric community.Research materials: manuscript texts of P. E. Sheshkin's notebooks, his personal archive, as well as published expedition records of researchers of the XX century.Results and novelty of the research: during the analysis of folklore and language materials, we identified main stages in the formation of the Ugric community. Each of the periods is distinguished by its characteristic features: 1. phase of development - the presence of large associations (tribes), the direction of their migration, settlement, conditions of existence and their changes; 2. phase of completion - the collapse of large associations into small groups (sometimes assimilation), their movement, settlement, marriage contacts; 3. transition period (general) - the end of the << fairy-tale era >> is caused by new relevant aspects of the worldview in connection with the ideas formed by the Heroic Epos in new conditions.Folklore data of the periodization of Ugric community are reflected in its ethnic history.The novelty of the study lies in the introduction of little-known folklore, ethnographic materials and practically disappeared, Lombovozh subdialect of the Sygva dialect of the Northern group of the Mansy, collected by P. E. Sheshkin. In practical terms, the material of the article can be used by cultural scientists, ethnographers, linguists, and folklorists.

T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is a first attempt to discover binary oppositions used by P.D. Boborykin in the book about Rome, "The Eternal City". Three oppositions are revealed: "ordinary - unusual", "Italians - Russians" and "Rome - other European cities", their role in solving the memoirist's main task is defined, which is to create a text about a unique city with a focus on cognitive function. The particular attention is paid to the peculiarities and functions of binary oppositions in these memoirs. It is argued that the presence of oppositions is aimed to provide more favorable conditions for the reader to assimilate the information contained via the worldview more familiar to the addressee of the text. According to the well-known D.-H. Pageaux's classification, the opposition in this book should be attributed to such kind of "filia" as is most likely the main one for the texts with a focus on a cognitive function. In addition, the author presents here the studies of the mechanism of the interaction between the poles in the binary opposition presented in these memoirs and the processes of formation of the pole of the object of perception and the pole of the subject of perception. It is argued that the mechanism of the interaction between the poles is aimed at gradually enlarging the pole of the object of perception unto the basic opposition "friend or foe" through the use of all the three identified oppositions. At the same time, the pole of the subject of perception does not change its contents, since it is actively formed by the author in advance, including the usage of the technology similar to a modern sociological survey. And if the enlargement of the pole of the object of perception in the process of narration can receive the status of an invariable attribute of an educational text with the help of further research in this direction, then the active formation of the pole of the subject of perception by the author, especially based on the technology of opinion polls, is most likely a common sign of documentary discourse, which include memoirs as well.

AB  - School had a main place in the formation of the worldview of all generations of soviet people. School textbook often became the first (and with someone the only) source of information about the world for people whose childhood and youth fell on 1937-1991. In the article it was analyze the school textbooks on "History of the USSR", "History of the Ancient World", "History of the Middle Ages", "Modern History", "Contemporary History", which was used in the soviet school of the 1930s - 1980s. One aspect was singled out: what information about Japan was present in soviet school textbooks on "History" (and whether it was present at all), how large the volume of this information was and what concepts were laid down to the worldview of generations who studied "History" in the soviet school from 1937 to 1991. The chronological boundaries are determined by the release date of the first soviet school textbook on history and before the collapse of the USSR.

TI  - Remote Sensing Applications for Insurance: A Predictive Model for Pasture Yield in the Presence of Systemic Weather
T2  - NORTH AMERICAN ACTUARIAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A robust predictive model for crop yield is essential for designing a commercially viable index-based insurance policy. Index-based insurance for crops is still at a relatively infant stage, and more research and development is needed in order to address a main limitation, which is referred to as basis risk. Traditionally, ground weather station measurements have been the most common approach used in weather indices, and this approach has often led to high levels of basis risk. Recent advances in satellite-based remote sensing provide new opportunities to use publicly available and transparent "big data," to potentially make index-based insurance policies more relevant by reducing basis risk. This is the first article to provide a comprehensive comparison of 13 pasture production indices (PPIs), including those developed based on satellite-derived vegetation and biophysical parameter indices using data products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). A validation protocol is established, and a unique dataset covering the period 2002 to 2016 from a network of pasture clip sites in the province of Alberta, Canada, is used to demonstrate new applications for insurance based on remote sensing-derived data. The results of the satellite-derived PPIs are compared to PPIs based on ground weather station data as benchmarks, which to date are the most common design for index-based insurance. Overall, the satellite-based indices report higher correlations with the ground truth forage yield data compared to the weather station PPIs. As an example, in 2015 and 2016 the best performing satellite-based PPIs produced correlations close to 90 %. When considering the whole sample period, the highest overall average correlation is 62.0% for the biophysical parameter PPI based on FPAR 500-m MODIS, and the lowest overall average correlation is 43.8% for the vegetation PPI based on EVI 250-m MODIS. Comparatively, the highest correlation reported for the weather station indices is for precipitation, at 12.51 %. Other predictive models based on principal component analysis and shrinkage methods (such as lasso, ridge regression, and elastic net) are considered to address the issues of variable selection and dimension reduction in insurance design. This research makes an important contribution to the field of actuarial science and insurance, because it highlights potential new opportunities for insurance design and predictive analytics using large and comprehensive satellite datasets that remain relatively unexplored to date in insurance practice. Though forage is used as the example here, the research could be extended to other crops, and other areas in the property and casualty sector, including for fire and flood.

TI  - From the "Logic of Meaning" to the Fates of Russia (Reflection on the Book of A.V. Smirnov <i>Vsechelovecheskoye</i> <i>vs</i>. <i>obshchechelovecheskoye</i>)
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The plot of the book is formed by two problem knots. The first of them is weaved out of questions of the logical bases of various civilizations and opportunities of rational contact dialogue between them. Discussion of these questions leads to a conclusion that rational mutual understanding between civilizations is possible irrespective of the fact which logics prevail in each of them. Rationality does not reduce to logical rules as well as the reason is not exhausted by logic. It includes a reflection over the ontological assumptions which are the cornerstone of language, creative imagination, the principles of practice. Also reflections over worldview intuitions are within its competence. Modern rationalism breaks off with apriority of criteria of rationality, but recognizes a variety of fundamental forms of rationality. The future of mankind in many respects depends on whether it will manage to keep this variety, without reconciling with inevitability of the clash of civilizations. The second knot - some questions of the special Russian civilization possessing own logic of "vsechelovecheskoye", distinguishing it from the "western" civilization which applies for the "obshchechelovecheskoye" in nature of the principles. The author of the book tries to answer these questions, developing the ideas of N.Y. Danilevsky and Russian "Eurasians". However it is impossible to tell that he manages to resolve the contradictions internally inherent in these ideas. More likely, its developments can serve as an incentive for further judgment of historical ways of Russia. There is also open a question of communication of the mentioned problem knots: how from discussion of epistemological problems to pass to the analysis of the principles which lie in the basis of regional and world civilizations?

TI  - TICK-BORNE INFECTIONS OF DOGS IN SERBIA: A REVIEW OF RESEARCH
T2  - Veterinarski Glasnik
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased prevalence of tick-borne disease in humans and animals is an important public health issue. Dogs can be clinically ill, reservoirs of tick-borne pathogens, or sentinel populations for research. Certainly, small-scale research has been conducted in dogs and this review will focus on the recent studies of emergent and re-emergent tick-borne pathogens in dogs in Serbia. Babesiosis stands out as the most common and important tick-borne disease in dogs. In addition to this pathogen, the presence of Hepatozoon canis and "Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum" in the blood of dogs was proved using molecular methods. Seroreactivity in dogs has been proven for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex, Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia ewingii, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Rickettsia conorii, and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). The presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. complex, A. phagocytophilum, Rickettsia spp. from the group of spotted fevers, and TBEV in ticks indicates the geographical distribution and potential for infecting humans, dogs, and other animals in Serbia. Further systematic, comprehensive, well designed, bacteriological, virological, parasitological, epidemiological, clinical (infectological), and acarological research is needed in Serbia.

AB  - Understanding the historical trend of land development provides an invaluable source of information for policy-makers, environmental planners, and regional scientists. This information is useful in the study of the impacts of past decisions and natural conditions on the patterns of the trend. In this study, we built a hybrid algorithm that benefits from various techniques of land change detection to map the land development process in a given region. Data transformation and band differencing were used to construct a new feature class from the temporal satellite data. For data of three consecutive decades, a pairwise comparison of images was conducted. A clustering algorithm was applied to the constructed feature class to identify the location of new land developments. The results indicate a user 's and producer 's accuracy of 90.3%. The findings of this study are useful in the study of historic trends in land development and its patterns.

TI  - The development of non-coherent passive radar techniques for space situational awareness with the Murchison Widefield Array
T2  - PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF AUSTRALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of active and non active satellites in Earth orbit has dramatically increased in recent decades, requiring the development of novel surveillance techniques to monitor and track them. In this paper, we build upon previous non-coherent passive radar space surveillance demonstrations undertaken using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). We develop the concept of the Dynamic Signal to Noise Ratio Spectrum (DSNRS) in order to isolate signals of interest (reflections of FM transmissions of objects in orbit) and efficiently differentiate them from direct path reception events. We detect and track Alouette-2, ALOS, UKube-1, the International Space Station, and Duchifat-1 in this manner. We also identified out-of-band transmissions from Duchifat-1 and UKube-1 using these techniques, demonstrating the MWA's capability to look for spurious transmissions from satellites. We identify an offset from the locations predicted by the cataloged orbital parameters for some of the satellites, demonstrating the potential of using MWA for satellite catalog maintenance. These results demonstrate the capability of the MWA for Space Situational Awareness and we describe future work in this area.

AB  - Object-based image analysis (OBIA) method has been proven to improve the accuracy value on benthic habitat mapping. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of several classification algorithms on benthic habitat mapping based on OBIA method with and without input feature of Hue Saturation Intensity (HSI) in the Pajenekang island waters, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Sentinel-2A satellite imagery with 10 m(2) spatial resolution acquired on 3 September 2018 was used in this study. During OBIA analyses, we segmented the object into 5, 10, and 15 classes and treated each of them with input features of mean+ratio vs mean+ratio+hue saturation intensity (HSI). We later classified the benthic habitat by applying several classification algorithms such as the Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT). The results showed that the Bayes algorithm produced highest accuracy of 78.35% within 10 segmentation classes and input features of mean+ratio+HSI followed by the KNN of 71.13% with 5 segmentation classes and input features of mean+ ration+HSI. The addition of HSI input features into OBIA analyses increased the accuracy of benthic habitat classification mapping of 4.13% with the Bayes classification algorithm.

AB  - A landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope. Landslides are a type of "mass wasting," which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rock under the direct influence of gravity. The present research paper is an attempt to assess the vulnerability of Shimla Tehsil to landslides. Five causative factors such as land use and land cover, slope morphometry, relative relief, lithology, and hydrogeology are used to calculate the landslide vulnerability. Survey of India, Geological Survey of India Toposheets, ASTER GDEM, and LANDSAT 8 OLI/TIRS sensor were used as data sources. The causative factors were analyzed and processed in GIS environment. The weightages were assigned based on ratings derived fromBureau of Indian Standards, pp 1-19, 1998, [1] for macroscale landslide mapping. Finally, the factors were integrated using weighted overlay method to produce final vulnerability map. The final output was categorized into four types based on the Total Hazard Estimated Index (THED) ranging from very low hazard to high hazard. The output reveals that the entire Shimla Tehsil falls under four categories of vulnerability ranging from very low vulnerability to high vulnerability. 62.02% of the Shimla Tehsil is prone to low hazard followed by very low at 26.10%, moderate at 11.55%, and high covering only 0.32%. Most of the major settlements are located along moderately vulnerable area.

AB  - Mapping of urban environments is a challenging task because of the dense and heterogeneous nature. Constantly developing infrastructures necessitate frequent updating of the urban database. The spatial pattern of built-up land use indicates the growth of cities and incorporating vertical components in the calculation of built-up volume is essential to plan for a sustainable future. In this study, the urban builtup volume is estimated through built-up area that is derived from high-resolution LISS IV data using deep learning techniques and height data is derived from Cartosat-1 stereo images using photogrammetric methods. The results indicate that the eastern part of the city has urban volume development compared to the central business district. This result can be used as a reference indication for characterizing economic growth, proxy measure to various parameters such as population, traffic conditions, power consumption, telecom network planning, etc.

AB  - Spectral vegetation index (SVI) is a mathematical combination of image spectral bands, especially ranges from visible to near infrared portion of the light spectrum. The purpose of SVI is to emphasize the vegetation content information from an image and doesn't directly correlate with any physical or bio-physical characteristics of vegetation. One of the important biophysical parameters of vegetation that can be derived from SVI is Leaf Area Index (LAI). LAI can be defined as one half the total green leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area and considered as an indicator to determine the level of mangrove health. Various SVIs have been developed and different SVI affects the accuracy of the LAI model. This study aimed to (1) compare and contrast the performance of several SVIs applied to WorldView-2 (WV-2) image to estimate the LAI, and (2) find the most accurate model for estimating LAI of mangrove forest in Perancak Estuary, Bali. The SVI used are Simple Ratio (SR), Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Green Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (GARI), dan Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI). The LAI models developed were based on the semi-empirical relationships between SVIs and field LAI measured from hemispherical photograph. The corresponding values of both parameters were correlated to find the regression function for the modelling. The results show that the best accuracy was obtained from NDVI which has an R-2 value of 0.83 and an estimation accuracy of 89.10 %.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the important factors in the physics of land surface processes to ensure the temperature change in the environment. Sumatra is one of the biggest islands in Indonesia that is suffering from deforestation. The objective of this study was to determine LST changes in Sumatra Island from 2000-2019. LST-day data for each region of Sumatra island were analyzed with cubic spline to see the seasonal pattern and get the LST changing value. The highest LST-day change was in the central region of Sumatra Island which was 0.3842 degrees C/decade (Z: 8.51, 95% CI: 0.296, 0.473). The lowest LST-day change was in the central north region of Sumatra Island which was -0.1574 degrees C/decade (Z: -3.022, 95% CI: -0.2596, -0.055). The overall LST-day change was 0.1621 degrees C/decade (Z: -3.022, 95% CI: -0.2596, -0.055).

AB  - Spectral reflectance and backscattering's of remotely-sensed data presents significant details of different objects on the Earth's surface in numerous applications of space technology. In this study, satellite datasets such as Sentinel-1 i.e. synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 satellite datasets i.e. multispectral data is used in order to effectively classify crop patterns of rainfed regions of India. The study areas have been selected in Jhansi district of Uttar Pradesh, Buldhana district of Maharashtra and Ballari district of Karnataka. These three (3) selected districts contains rainfed and irrigated agricultural lands. In the initial stage baseline map of cropland has been prepared by the following concepts; a baseline map is a map including the total cropland area i.e. Rabi and Kharif and non-cropped area's i.e. man-made (infrastructures + urban), permanent water, permanent vegetation (forest), and other land cover's depending on the area (for instance wetlands, etc.). This is generated by using annual temporal descriptors (TD). In the next, Sentinel-2 MSI high-resolution satellite data has been further used for crop pattern map derived by applying the supervised classification following the machine learning algorithms (MLA) techniques. The accuracy level of crop pattern map of Ballari district is 84.04%, Jhansi district is 89.3%, and of Buldhana district is 83.09%. The total crop land area in Ballari district is 0.582 million ha, with the total crop types covered area is cotton 32%, groundnut 23%, maize 29%, pearl millet 10% and paddy 6%. The total cropland area in Jhansi district is 0.507 million ha, with the total crop types covered area is black gram 65%, paddy 10%, groundnut 17%, and peppermint 8%. The total cropland area in Buldhana district is 0.686 million ha, with the total crop types covered area is cotton 24%, maize 7%, pigeon pea 16%, sorghum 25% and soybean 28%, respectively.

TI  - GROTESQUE IN BUNIN'S PROSE AND JOURNALIST ESSAYS
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The following article contains a study of grotesque forms of poetry and writing used by Bunin for portraying the state of Russian life from 1916 to 1920s based on the contents of his two stories and three journalist works. I is shown that Bunin's grotesque style is not related to comic aspects of his artistic mind (M. M. Bakhtin), but is rooted from the tragic worldview and in its contents are related to such categories as frightening, absurd, das Unheimliche (horrible, omnious), monstrous (W. Kayser, I. P. Smirnov). A plentora of grotesque forms of poetry and writing is unveiled. In "Old lady" and "Mad painter" stories, an atmosphere of grotesque is created with a whole system of contrasts, introduction of a grotesque subject and also an intermedial visual pattern, which originates from a teratological style of medieval visionary art, and principles of fine arts as a whole. In "old lady" the narrator plays a role of a grotesque object, he emphasizes the grotesque reality by grotesque narrative. In "Mad painter" this role is occupied by a character who is not only contrasted to the world but is also a creator of das Unheimliche, whish deforms this world. In the stories reality is shown indirectly - through different reflections / mirrors that transform unique to regular and play a role of a magnifying glass, which even further unveils the monstrosity and absurdity of the earlier mentioned facts. In "Notorious pig" the grotesque narrative is completed by many grotesque subjects, suppressed by the objective course of events, stripped off their personal identity and created the horrible "documents of age". "Moonshine and champagne" highlights the topic of sweet soulfulness of intellectuals towards the people. In "Human finger soup" grotesque imagery, appearing from epistolary dialogue with Gorky becomes a means of symbolic synthesis. Cannibalism is explained as a base for new Russian regime. In journalist works, Bunin extensively utilizes the effect of alienation, dissolution of subjective identity in objectivity, a principle of a magnifying glass. Bunin's grotesque, enriched with bright objectivity and visuality of linguistic imagery, becomes a powerful means of conceptualization of the writer's thought and its aesthetical embodiment.

AB  - Carbon stock estimates are very important to support carbon policies at the regional level and sustainable environmental management. Rubber plantation is one of the carbon-absorbing ecosystems, due to its long life and large biomass content. The aim of this study was to estimate the above-ground carbon stock based on Sentinel 2A remotely sensed imagery, through vegetation index approaches. In the initial stage, the image was corrected radiometrically to obtain a bottom of atmosphere (BoA) reflectance values, so that all spectral indices that were run could provide reliable results. The vegetation indices used in this study were RVI (Ratio Vegetation Index), NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index), ARVI (Atmospheric Resistant Vegetation Index), and SARVI (Soil and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index). The values generated from those indices were correlated with field data of carbon stock, which was derived from breast height diameter (BHD)-based biomass measurements and allometric equations. Correlation and regression analyses of carbon stock and vegetation indices were then used to interpolate the samples to the entire study area, using exponential, logarithmic, and quadratic equations. The resultant above ground carbon stock maps were then tested for accuracy assessment using field data collected independently. It was found that the ARVI-based estimation model with BoA reflectance radiometric correction, combined with exponential regression equation, showed the best accuracy values of 84.48% (supported by r2 = 0.473). Based on this model, the above-ground carbon stock estimate in Ngobo and Getas Plantation, PTPN IX were 527,072.39 tons in an area of 2,656,615 hectares, or 198.4 tons/hectares.

TI  - A Multivariate and Spatiotemporal Analysis of Water Quality in Code River, Indonesia.
T2  - TheScientificWorldJournal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The efficacy of a water quality management strategy highly depends on the analysis of water quality data, which must be intensively analyzed from both spatial and temporal perspectives. This study aims to analyze spatial and temporal trends in water quality in Code River in Indonesia and correlate these with land use and land cover changes over a particular period. Water quality data consisting of 15 parameters and Landsat image data taken from 2011 to 2017 were collected and analyzed. We found that the concentrations of total dissolved solid, nitrite, nitrate, and zinc had increasing trends from upstream to downstream over time, whereas concentrations of parameter biological oxygen demand, cuprum, and fecal coliform consistently undermined water quality standards. This study also found that the proportion of natural vegetation land cover had a positive correlation with the quality of Code River's water, whereas agricultural land and built-up areas were the most sensitive to water pollution in the river. Moreover, the principal component analysis of water quality data suggested that organic matter, metals, and domestic wastewater were the most important factors for explaining the total variability of water quality in Code River. This study demonstrates the application of a GIS-based multivariate analysis to the interpretation of water quality monitoring data, which could aid watershed stakeholders in developing data-driven intervention strategies for improving the water quality in rivers and streams.

TI  - Appraisal of hydro-meteorological factors during extreme precipitation event: case study of Kedarnath cloudburst, Uttarakhand, India
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash flood is an uncertain and most catastrophic disaster worldwide that causes socio-economic problems, devastation and loss of infrastructure. One of the major triggering factors of flash floods is the extreme events like cloudburst that causes flooding of area within a short span of time. Therefore, this study aims to understand the variations in hydro-meteorological variables during the devastating Kedarnath cloudburst in the Uttarakhand, India. The hydro-meteorological variables were collected from the global satellites such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, modelled datasets from Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer and National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). For the validation of satellite meteorological data, the NCEP Global analysis data were downscaled using Weather Research and Forecasting model over the study area to achieve the meteorological variables' information. The meteorological factors such as atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature, rainfall, cloud water content, cloud fraction, cloud particle radius, cloud mixing ratio, total cloud cover, wind speed, wind direction and relative humidity were studied during the cloudburst, before as well as after the event. The outcomes of this study indicate that the variability in hydro-meteorological variables over the Kedarnath had played a significant role in triggering the cloudburst in the area. The results showed that during the cloudburst, the relative humidity was at the maximum level, the temperature was very low, the wind speed was slow and the total cloud cover was found at the maximum level. It is expected that because of this situation a high amount of clouds may get condensed at a very rapid rate and resulted in a cloudburst over the Kedarnath region.

TI  - Building Footprint Extraction from Very-High-Resolution Satellite Image Using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) Technique
T2  - APPLICATIONS OF GEOMATICS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Geomatics in Civil Engineering (ICGCE)
CL  - Roorkee, INDIA
AB  - Building footprints are an important input in several urban applications such as master plan preparation, development of 3D city building models, rooftop solar energy potential estimation, tax compliance evaluation, or study of population distribution in cities. The very high spatial resolution (VHR) image is invariably required for the extraction of building footprints. However, the conventional pixel-based approaches have limited success in building footprint extraction owing to inherent heterogeneity of the urban environment. In this research, we have therefore appliedObject-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) for building footprints extraction from Cartosat-2 series data. The image was segmented into several objects on the basis of spectral and spatial homogeneity of pixels. The objects were thereafter classified using nearest-neighbor classification approach. Finally, these classified objects were further subjected to segmentation into smaller objects and classified using decision-rules. The combination of supervised nearest-neighbor classification with decision-rules resulted in an accuracy of over 82.5% in the extraction of building footprints. The results of the study will be used to develop a 3D city model of Ahmedabad city and assess the changes in the built-up volume in the city.

TI  - Worldview Essence and Cosmic Connotations of Religious Feelings
T2  - PHILOSOPHY AND COSMOLOGY-FILOSOFIYA I KOSMOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to identify the essence and features of the cosmic nature of religious feelings, their various meanings, which are unfolded in the system of the "Person-Absolute" relationship. The authors reveal the essence of cosmic religious feeling as the experience of unity, the harmony of a person with nature, with the Universe, in which the experience of beauty (aesthetic feelings), sacred (religious feelings), moral (moral feelings), and intellectual (scientific feelings) are combined. In the trinity of religious feelings - immediate experience, manifestation, and comprehension - certain spiritual existential meanings are fixed, which reflect the unity of the human and the Divine, the finite and the infinite. The authors compare such phenomena as "cosmic religious feeling," "transpersonal experiences," and "peak experiences" and describes their similarities and differences. Religious feeling is immanently inherent in life-meaning orientation, which is associated with the experience of infinity, immortality, and that is due to socio-cultural realities. Religious feeling "expresses" the desire to go beyond the finite, to establish itself in the infinite, and thereby contribute to the integrity of the personality. It should be noted that these experiences are of great importance for the person, differing in generalization, originality, and relate mainly to the emotional states. The authors conclude that the infinity is inherent in religious feelings, which leads to the presentation of them as a cosmic religious feeling that combines religious, intellectual, and aesthetic features resulting in the formation of cosmic consciousness as a certain worldview strategy.

TI  - HOW JOSEF SKVORECKY SOUGHT AND COULD NOT FIND A PATH TO SOCIALISM
T2  - KNJIZEVNA SMOTRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article focuses on the writer Josef Skvorecky and follows the development of his civic and political attitudes after the defeat of German Nazism, i.e., approximately from 1941-45. In the context of Skvorecky's literary writings it concerns a period in which culminates the inevitable phase of the author's youthful poetic creativity and his early prose writings, while simultaneously his most important novel, The Cowards, is in the making. (Still, Skvorecky in the said period didn't publish, his entire work remained in manuscripts and could be read only by his closest friends.) After 1945 Skvorecky's natural Christiansocial orientation confronted ideas of state socialism, buttressed by the political prestige of the Soviet Union and the Czech Communist Party, but also the social degradation of conservative values and the status of the bourgeoisie. The evidence that Skvorecky sought a personal path towards an authentic "worldview", independent of the obviously prevailing social trends, is provided principally by Skvorecky's manuscript published only in the 1990s (The New Canterbury Tales), and were often published only fragmentary (the epic poem Do Not Despair!, the collection February Tales) or were never published (fragments of the novel The Sons of the Just, the poem Things of Life); some of which are here presented the first time ever. The significant source in the articles subsumes also Skvorecky's published and unpublished correspondence from the 1940s and the 1950s. Although Skvorecky was considered an explicit political opponent to the most of his peers from the Youth Union, the cited sources demonstrate that in difficult times he kept his faith in the idea of socialist humanism, but would not bow to its being vulgarized by communist ideology and its means of coercion.

TI  - Behavior of Cutaneous Adnexal Malignancies: a Single Institution Experience
T2  - PATHOLOGY & ONCOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous adnexal malignancies are biologically and pathologically diverse, and associated with a range of clinical outcomes. Given their rarity, the prognosis and optimal treatment of these neoplasms remains unclear. A single institution database from a tertiary care cancer center of patients treated for malignant cutaneous adnexal tumors was retrospectively analyzed. Clinicopathologic variables and outcome measures were analyzed in patients undergoing wide excision with or without sentinel node biopsy. 103 patients were analyzed; the majority of tumors were of eccrine sweat gland derivation (n = 69, 70%), and these exhibited a higher rate of nodal involvement and overall worse outcome. Sixteen patients (16%) demonstrated nodal metastasis, which included 10 (10%) with nodal disease at presentation and 6 who developed nodal metastasis during followup. 20 patients underwent sentinel node biopsy, and 2 (10%) had a positive sentinel node. 62% of nodal metastases occurred in patients with porocarcinoma. Seven patients died of disease (7%) with a median time from diagnosis to death of 48 months (range, 10-174). After a median follow up of 44.7 months, age > 70 years and larger tumor size were significantly associated with worse overall survival. Adnexal malignancies are rare tumors, and there is a paucity of information to guide the clinician in determining optimum surgical and medical treatment. Tumors of eccrine derivation, especially porocarcinomas, have a high risk of nodal involvement and may be considered for sentinel node biopsy.

T2  - NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the manuscript of the book "Sacred faith. The book of life and sufferings of the Old Believers of Sym" written by N. G. Sidorkina (Golovko). Although created at the very beginning of 21st century (2002), the text deals with the complex history of life and isolation Titovtsy (a group of Old Believers) experienced in the 20th century, especially along the Middle Yenisei. The authors examine the manuscript as an original work by a contemporary Old Believer. The article focuses on the Old Believers of the Titov accord living along the "Yenisei Meridian", a unified confessional space of the Chasovennoye accord which includes the Krasnoyarsk territory and Tuva, and on these people's authentic worldview.The authors study how the manuscript was created, as well as its content. Its uniqueness is due to the "internal dialogue" and autoethnographic reflection. The preliminary analysis of the text's sources, and the use of expedition methods of textual study, helped both demonstrate the authenticity of the manuscript and describe its importance for the current historiography of the Old Belief It is significant that the researcher herself using her field experience, turned her life into a continuous study of a distinctive group of Old Believers.The article also examines the expressive genre of the manuscript, which contributes to the "Old Believer writing" as a cultural phenomenon and reveals its structural and semantic features. According to the Sidorkina's concept, the manuscript is equally focused on both confessional and general literacy. This "double" erudition and active appeal to both worldviews have mutually determined further development of Old Believer thought.

AB  - Asian (Eastern) Russia is a globally important agricultural region but has received little attention in the literature. This book chapter evaluates the history of agricultural development in Asian Russia, often colloquially called Siberia, which is a vast region that stretches from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. First, we summarize agro-environmental conditions across the region. Second, we present the dynamics of land use, crop and milk yields from medieval times until recent years and discuss the major underlying causes that bring about the observed changes in the extent and intensity of agricultural production. We then briefly discuss untapped agricultural potentials in the region regarding expanding cultivated areas and particularly regarding increasing productivity in crop and livestock production. We particularly focus attention on socio-economic and environmental impediments that limit uncovering such production potentials in the region.

TI  - Monitoring of Drought Condition and Risk in Bangladesh Combined Data From Satellite and Ground Meteorological Observations
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a very complex natural hazard and has a negative impact on the global ecosystem as a whole. Recently Bangladesh has been experiencing by different degree of dryness as a consequence of high climate variability, affecting the crop production to a great extent in the last couple of decades. In this context, the present study was made an effort to assess and analyse drought characteristics based on two drought indices, i.e., Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and model agricultural drought risk with Fast-and-frugal decision tree (FFT) model in Bangladesh from 2001 to 2016. We identified drought occurrence and its dynamics with three-time scale, i.e., SPI3J (November-January), SPI3A (February-April) and SPI6A (November-April), and three rice-growing seasons, i.e., Aus (March-July), Aman (June-November), and Boro (November-May) from TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data. The results demonstrate that TRMM had good consistency with rain gauge measurement compared to CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) and PERSIANN-CDR (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record) data to derive SPI3J, SPI3A and SPI6A. Overall results confirmed that more drought frequency observed in SPI6A than SPI3J and SPI3A time scale, representing moderate to severe drought throughout the country. Regarding agricultural drought resulting from VCI demonstrated Boro rice-growing season as more vulnerable crop growing season affected by severe to extreme drought event. Validation results of VCI exhibited a high correlation with rice yield data than in-situ soil moisture data. Results of the FFT model show that out of ten predictor variables SPI3J and SPI6A caused agricultural drought with SPI value less than & x2212;1.08 and & x2212;1.21 respectively. Additionally, the model characterized SPI3J and SPI6A as the most critical driving factors with the highest balanced accuracy triggering agricultural drought risk in Bangladesh.

AB  - A post-classification processing technique for noisy multichannel image that includes the method of local spatial filtering of segmented images in pseudo colors and multilayer classification algorithm is proposed. The post-classification processing effectiveness is verified for satellite image degraded by additive white Gaussian noise. It is demonstrated that the presence of noise in remote sensing data complicates the recognition task in pixel-by-pixel classification leading to a large number of arising errors. It is shown that post-classification processing can significantly increase overall probability of correct recognition of objects in noisy images.

AB  - A task of classification of multichannel remote sensing images compressed in a lossy manner is considered. It is recalled that lossy compression usually leads to reduction of classification accuracy both in aggregate and for particular classes. Distortions due to compression are characterized by visual quality metric desired values of which can be provided at compression stage. Dependence of probability of correct classification on image quality and compression ratio is analyzed for several widely used classifiers using a test image composed of three component images of Landsat data in visible range. It is shown that different classifiers are sensitive to distortions introduced by lossy compression in sufficiently different degree. We also propose a way to combine classifiers' outputs to improve classification results.

AB  - This study aims at mapping Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) in the region of Roraima, Brazil, using time-series of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. All available Sentinel-1 images covering the study area were used and classified using two machine learning algorithms, namely random forest and multilayer perceptron. LULC heterogeneity with the SAR process complexity makes the process challenging in distinguishing certain classes. Results show that SAR data could be used for LULC mapping, as rainforest, savannas, water, and sandbank/outcrop classes. But cannot provide accurate separation for all classes, mainly for those with similar geometrical structures, such as regeneration areas, perennial crops, and buritizais.

AB  - Under the NOAA AVHRR GAC Reanalysis project (RAN), a global dataset of consistent sea surface temperature (SST) retrievals from 1981-on will be created from multiple NOAA AVHRRs using the ACSPO system. Following release of RAN1 dataset in 2016, the initial RAN2 Beta 01 ("RAN2 B01") dataset was produced from NOAA-07, 09, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16 from 1981-2003. This paper evaluates the initial RAN2 B01 dataset and compares it with two other SST datasets, the NOAA-NASA Pathfinder v5.3 ("PF") and ESA CCI v2.1 ("CCI"). The time series of monthly global biases and standard deviations with respect to uniformly quality controlled in situ SSTs, and clearsky fractions (percent of SST pixels to the total ice-free ocean) are compared. `Skin' and `depth' SSTs, only available in RAN and CCI data sets, and sensitivity of 'skin' SST to true SST, are also compared. The RAN B01 outperforms PF. Compared to CCI, it generally delivers more clear- sky observations, often with a better accuracy and precision for both `skin' and `depth' SSTs. The sensitivity to true SST is lower and more variable in RAN2 B01, than in CCI. The RAN2 B01 performance following large volcanic eruptions needs improvements.

AB  - The global leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR) product-VNP15A2H, generated from the first VIIRS sensor, has inherited the scientific role of MODIS data and provides 8-year time-series dataset from 2012 to present. Compared to MODIS products, the VNP15A2H still lacks intensive evaluation and validation efforts, which arises the priority to study its quality and stability in the context of the upcoming retirement of MODIS and launching of a series of VIIRS. This paper documents the trend of product quality as well as LAI/FPAR magnitude using a multi-year (2013-2018) and multi-site (445 sites) dataset We analyze 46 composites in each year and 7 biome types respectively and find that both LAI/FPAR and its accuracy do not show significant trends during the studied period, which guarantees our confidence to continue the long-term data record using VIIRS observations.

TI  - BEST FRIENDS FOREVER? MODELING THE MECHANISMS OF FRIENDSHIP NETWORK FORMATION
T2  - 2020 WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE (WSC)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Winter Simulation Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The formation of friendships and alliances is a ubiquitous feature of human life, and likely a crucial component of the cooperative hunting and child-rearing practices that helped our early hominin ancestors survive. Research on contemporary human beings typically finds that strong-tie social networks are fairly small, and reveals a high degree of physical (e.g., age) and social-structural (e.g., educational attainment) homophily. Yet, existing work all too often underestimates, or even ignores, the importance of abstract, symbolic homophily (such as shared identities or worldviews) as a driver of friendship formation. Here we employ agent-based modeling to identify the optimal variable weights influencing friendship formation in order to best replicate the results of existing empirical work. We include indicators of physical and socialstructural homophily, in addition to symbolic homophily. Results suggest that the optimization values that best replicate existing empirical work include strong variable weightings of kinship, shared worldview, and outgroup suspicion.

M3  - Article
AB  - Mathematical knowledge plays a system-forming role in education. The aim of this paper is to find out the didactic features of mathematical knowledge formation. The study involved 50 professors, 300 students. The criteria of mathematical knowledge acquisition include reliability, autonomy, and stability. The main study objectives are as follows. First, to clarify and scientifically substantiate special functions of mathematical knowledge in the process of engineering activity (bijection, formalization, relativity, and robustness). Second, to determine the formation of academic and applied mathematical knowledge. Technical knowledge can be applied using the special functions of mathematical knowledge. For example, in the form of mathematical models, or in a stable mathematical component in the professional outlook. The academic mathematical knowledge is focused on the systematic integrity of purpose, content, forms, methods and means of education. Along with transdisciplinary holistic worldview formation. Applied mathematical knowledge is focused on integration of teaching, educating, developing functions of education to acquire common cultural and professional competences. In modern conditions of rapid computerization, the opportunities to use mathematical analysis and modeling are increasing. However, basic mathematical knowledge is needed to assess the reliability of computer solutions.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Latin American GRSS and ISPRS Remote Sensing Conference (LAGIRS)
CL  - Santiago, CHILE
AB  - Changes in snow albedo (SA) on several basins of the central Andes of Argentina are associated with the possible deposition of light-absorbing particles (LAP) in the austral spring. To demonstrate this possibility, we correlate SA with daily data of snow cover (SC), aerosol optical depth (AOD) and land surface temperature (LST) available from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board NASA Terra satellite during 2000-2016, and other derived parameters such as days after albedo (DAS) and snow precipitation (SP) from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMNI). We used satellite pixels with 100% snow cover to obtain monthly average value of SA, LST, AOD, DAS and SP performing multiple regression analysis. Further, we analysed biomass burning emissions in northern Argentina using MODIS products MCD64 collection C6 as possible source for snow pollution. Aerosol deposition and trajectories were analysed using WRF-Chem atmospheric numerical prediction model, with inventories of regional anthropogenic emissions of own elaboration (lat. 0.025 x long. 0.025) and the estimation of open burning emissions from the FEN global inventory (Fire INventory from NCAR).

TI  - Modelling above-ground biomass stock over Norway using national forest inventory data with ArcticDEM and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Boreal forests constitute a large portion of the global forest area, yet they are undersampled through field surveys, and only a few remotely sensed data sources provide structural information wall-to-wall throughout the boreal domain. ArcticDEM is a collection of high-resolution (2 m) space-borne stereogrammetric digital surface models (DSM) covering the entire land area north of 60' of latitude. The free-availability of ArcticDEM data offers new possibilities for aboveground biomass mapping (AGB) across boreal forests, and thus it is necessary to evaluate the potential for these data to map AGB over alternative open-data sources (i.e., Sentinel-2). This study was performed over the entire land area of Norway north of 60' of latitude, and the Norwegian national forest inventory (NFI) was used as a source of field data composed of accurately geolocated field plots (n = 7710) systematically distributed across the study area. Separate random forest models were fitted using NPI data, and corresponding remotely sensed data consisting of either: i) a canopy height model (ArcticCHM) obtained by subtracting a high-quality digital terrain model (DTM) from the ArcticDEM DSM height values, ii) Sentinel-2 (S2), or iii) a combination of the two (ArcticCHM + S2).Furthermore, we assessed the effect of the forest- and terrain-specific factors on the models' predictive accuracy. The best model (,i.e., ArcticCHM + S2) explained nearly 60% of the variance of the training set, which translated in the largest accuracy in terms of root mean square error (RMSE = 41.4 t ha(-1)). This result highlights the synergy between 3D and multispectral data in AGB modelling.Furthermore, this study showed that despite the importance of ArcticCHM variables, the S2 model performed slightly better than ArcticCHM model. This finding highlights some of the limitations of ArcticDEM, which, despite the unprecedented spatial resolution, is highly heterogeneous due to the blending of multiple acquisitions across different years and seasons. We found that both forest- and terrain-specific characteristics affected the uncertainty of the ArcticCHM + S2 model and concluded that the combined use of ArcticCHM and Sentinel-2 represents a viable solution for AGB mapping across boreal forests. The synergy between the two data sources allowed for a reduction of the saturation effects typical of multispectral data while ensuring the spatial consistency in the output predictions due to the removal of artifacts and data voids present in ArcticCHM data. While the main contribution of this study is to provide the first evidence of the best-case-scenario (i.e., availability of accurate terrain models) that ArcticDEM data can provide for large-scale AGB modelling, it remains critically important for other studies to investigate how ArcticDEM may be used in areas where no DTMs are available as is the case for large portions of the boreal zone.

T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study addresses the use of multiple sources of auxiliary data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data for inference on key biophysical parameters in small forest properties (5-300 ha). We compared the precision of the estimates using plot data alone under a design-based inference with model-based estimates that include plot data and the following four types of auxiliary data: (1) terrain-independent variables from UAV photogrammetric data (UAV-SfM); (2) variables obtained from UAV photogrammetric data normalized using external terrain data (UAV-SfM(DTM)); (3) UAV-LS and (4) ALS data. The inclusion of remotely sensed data increased the precision of DB estimates by factors of 1.5-2.2. The optimal data sources for top height, stem density, basal area and total stem volume were: UAV-LS, UAV-SfM, UAV-SfM(DTM) and UAV-SfM(DTM). We conclude that the use of UAV data can increase the precision of stand-level estimates even under intensive field sampling conditions.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the patterns of everyday life of the Old Believers-wanderers in the territory of Kargopol district of the Olonets province. It draws upon new archival materials of church and secular origin, as well as a number of significant works by the nzissionaries. The study explores peculiarities of the wanderers' worldview, the forms and methods of their preaching activity, and the structure of their communities. The wonderers' teaching was deeply eschatological, which led to a complete break with "the world of Antichrist". The study provides a detailed description of the everyday life of the wanderers. An important feature in the life of these communities was constant and intensive ties between territories where their co-religionists were present. Particular attention is paid to the problems of mutual perception and confrontation between the wanderers and government representatives (police and clergy). The wanderers' activities, in spite of their eschatological attitudes, showed in fact their intense involvement with the outside world.

AB  - The motto of this work is to evaluate retrieval of surface soil moisture (5 cm) using Sentinel-1a C-band data Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Data for this study is collected from Yanco Study site, Australia. Yanco study site consists of 37 soil moisture measuring stations at every 20 min interval for various soil depths and it also provides other Hydro-Meteorological information. SAR backscattered energy is a function of soil roughness and soil moisture. Surface roughness is eliminated using change detection approach. The R2 performance statistics revealed that between Backscattered energy and NDVI there is no relation. Volumetric soil moisture and backscattered energy showed a positive correlation with R2 = 0.57 and 0.43 for VH and VV polarization. Dielectric constant also showed a positive correlation with backscattered energy having R2 = 0.62 and 0.38 for VH and VV polarization respectively. By taking into account of all these affecting parameters, a regional Semi-empirical model is developed to retrieve surface Soil moisture over the study area.

AB  - The research aims to assess the urban expansion of Ulaanbaatar city spatially and temporally by using remotely sensed data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Despite the city covers 0.03% of Mongolian territory, 68% of the population resides in Ulaanbaatar. These high rates of urbanization origins several environmental and health problems (e.g. the highest rate of air pollution in the world). The dispersion and expansion of urban areas calculated using the urbanization intensity index and Shannon's entropy-based on USGS Landsat TM and ETM+ imageries (Landsat Multispectral Scanner with bandwidth 0,5-1,1 mu m and 60 m resolution; Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus with 30 m resolution and bandwidth 0,45-2,35 mu m). The urbanization intensity index and Shannon's entropy value increase indicates that urbanization is at a higher rate by 1990- 2017 and demonstrating urban sprawl's rapid increase has transformed from low density-dispersed to medium density- leapfrog spatial expansion.

TI  - Characteristics of melanoma in the elderly.
T2  - Revista do Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates melanoma characteristics in the elderly.METHODS: A retrospective descriptive analytical study was carried out by reviewing the medical records of patients aged 60 years or older, diagnosed with primary cutaneous melanoma, and treated at Hospital Erasto Gaertner, Curitiba, Parana, from 2013 to 2017.RESULTS: We studied 139 patients aged 60-98 years (average, 70.3 years) and found melanoma to be more common in women (52.5%) than in men. Lesions mainly affected the limbs (32.3%) and head (24.4%), showed signs of ulceration (33.8%), and could be classified into the nodular histological (29%), extensive superficial (27%), and acral (12%) types. The average Breslow index was 1.2 mm. Metastasis occurred in 33% of the patients and mainly affected lymph nodes (36%) and the central nervous system (CNS, 20%). The first procedure conducted in 79% of the cases was surgical resection. Sentinel node mapping was carried out in 41.7% of the cases, and surgical treatment alone was indicated in 70% of the patients. The disease recurred in 34.5% of the patients, and 17.9% succumbed to the disease. These results indicate that the elderly have poorer prognosis when cancer treatment is delayed.CONCLUSION: Melanoma of the limbs and head, intermediate Breslow index, metastatic lymph node and CNS metastases, and relapse result in fatal outcomes. Direct strategies, such as prevention and early detection, as well as uniform and adequate treatment, are needed to improve disease management in the elderly.

AB  - The United States is in the midst of a children's mental health crisis, with rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide increasing precipitously. Evidence produced by children's mental health services research can help address this crisis by informing public policy decisions about service delivery, system design, and investments in the social determinants of mental health. Unfortunately, the policy impact of children's mental health services research is limited because evidence often fails to reach policy makers, be responsive to their needs, resonate with their worldview, or reflect the contexts in which they make decisions. Dissemination strategies-defined as the development and targeted distribution of messages and materials about research evidence pertaining to a specific issue or intervention-can help address these challenges. Yet, limited integrated guidance exists to inform the design of such strategies. This article addresses this need by synthesizing the results of empirical studies to provide guidance about how to enhance the dissemination of children's mental health services research to policy makers. The article provides four recommendations about the content of policy maker-focused dissemination materials, discusses how strategic framing and message tailoring can increase the chances that evidence is persuasive to policy makers, and highlights strategies to ensure that evidence reaches policy makers.

AB  - The population of Jakarta Special Province continues to grow, most significantly after the 1960s, causing an increase of population density. The expanding population has been stimulating the development of the province, reflecting the rising demand of the population including land. Eventually, it influences the urbanization process and affects the dynamic of land utilization in Jakarta. This research is aimed to understand the correlation between urbanization phenomena and landuse change in Jakarta Special Province. The research implements the utilization of statistics, topographic map, and remote sensing data as well. The satellite image (Sentinel-2 Imagery) was used to determine urban area and non urban area which then describes the land urbanization level. During 3 years, Jakarta has experienced landuse change especially in residential area, green open space, and industrial area. In 2017, the urban area covered 76.89 percent of Jakarta's land and the coverage increased into 78.35 percent in 2019. Land urbanization level raised from 77.16 percent into 78.03 percent which means that roughly 77 percent to 78 percent of land in Jakarta has been urbanized.

TI  - Internetworking flood disaster mitigation system based on remote sensing and mobile GIS
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood verification and mitigation based on ground survey has been impeded by many factors. For instance, damage assessment exclusively by onsite expedition could be delayed by restricted access, especially during heavy flooding. To devise appropriate mitigation measures, resources required to thoroughly investigate the incidents in response to disaster could be overwhelming. Moreover, inadequate equipment and non-standardized flood reporting process could also undermine the maneuver. As a consequent, rescue mission was inevitably deferred until the reported incidents had been confirmed. To address these issues, this paper presents an internetworking system for assisting flooding disaster mitigation. Its main contributions were two folds. Firstly, its data intelligent was driven by convergence of both user and official reports of flood incidents and those automatically detected from remotely sensed images. Secondly, the reliability of reported information was ensured by two-factor verification, i.e. by using a state-of-the-art deep learning strategy and by official investigations. The verified incidents were then presented in augmented graphical reports, which were practical in public inquiry and official uses in devising efficient and cost-effective disaster mitigation measures. The developed system was deployed in different cities, most affected by recent floods. Numerical and subjective assessments herein demonstrate the merits of the system.

TI  - Joint analysis of field and remote data in assessing the structure and composition of forests for the western part of Moscow region
T2  - VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - For the test area in the central part of the Russian Plain (the western sector of Moscow region), the results of a joint analysis of field research data, multispectral remote sensing data (MRSD) and a digital elevation model (DEM) are presented. An assessment of the organization and coenotic diversity of the forest cover of the territory has been carried out. A total of 38 syntaxons with the rank of association groups were identified based on releves, using the ecological-phytocoenotic approach. The overall quality of discrimination of the selected units according to the releves and species cover was 84.5 %. The relief characteristics were considered one of the main factors of the natural differentiation of forest cover. The source of information about the altitudes of the territory was the SRTM v.3 data, for which the relief characteristics (slopes, curvatures, illuminances) of various levels of hierarchical organization were calculated. The quality of discrimination of syntaxons based on the relief characteristics was 49.6 %. Landsat 5 and 8 images, as well as indices calculated based on spectral hands, were used as remote sensing data. The quality of the discriminant analysis in this case was 49.8 %. The quality of discrimination carried out in a joint analysis of the characteristics of relief and MRSD amounted to 64.6 % of the originally defined syntaxons. Thus, the sharing of information about the relief and MRSD improved the separation of the selected classes by 15 %. The map of typological diversity of the vegetation cover for the studied territory was calculated, which characterizes the spatial structure and composition of the forest cover of the studied region. The main characteristics of the relief, which together define the conditions of habitat and, largely, differentiate the considered groups of associations in space, are highlighted.

TI  - Modern Dilettantism
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Letter
AB  - The article offers a new understanding of dilettantism as the characteristic of a modern worldview on the basis of assessment of information technologies development as of an element of human evolution. The intraspecific competition is defined as a factor of entry of new technologies into daily occurrence. Article considers the prerequisites of a new self-identification of human beings in connection to the development of the technological environment of their existence at the beginning of the 21st century. The modernity is characterized as the time of illusion of possession of information space. The paper traces the formation of a modern amateur making decisions and acting on the basis of an illusion of the direct interaction with the global environment of data. Authors come to the conclusion that opposition of human being and technologies does not al low to explain consequences of interaction between humans and new information space. The theoretical and methodological bases for such a formulation of the problem are the particular provisions of the theory of instrumental evolution of M. McLuhan, the concept of the post-modernity of A. Giddens, and the idea of "the flat world" of Th. Friedman.

AB  - There are different approaches to the issue of literary space in modern literary studies. The typological approach is the most productive one, reflecting the fundamental parameters of the author's worldview and performing genus, genre, and style functions. This approach also provides for identifying and describing basic spatial images and models, which are the basis of the world of literary fiction in the work of literature. The study of literary space in close connection with the event-related level, the system of spatial relationships between characters, the spatial point of view of the author and their characters, other significant components of the literary text allows one to penetrate deeper into its ideological content, understand characters and their inner state, come closer to the disclosure of the author's idea. Having selected basic models which represent the "objectively existing" and suitable for living environment (real space), characterize the inner world of characters ( psychological space) and build a fictional reality (virtual space), we focus on the study of mixed models, taking into account the fact that there is always an experiment in the so-called "strong" texts. This research paper materials are based on "The Terracotta Old Woman" novel (2011), written by E. Chizhova, the Booker Prize winner. The paper describes structural and semantic types of space, according to the content and functional criterion (geographical, cultural, family, social and psychological models), which identify the general principles of artistic vision and determine the value of each spatial components in stylistic harmony.

AB  - Earth cover of the city of Baghdad was studied exclusively within its administrative border during the period 1986-2019 using satellite scenes every five years, as Landsat TM5 and OLI8 satellite images were used. The land has been classified into ten subclasses according to the characteristics of the land cover and was classified using the Maximum Likelihood classifier. A study of the changing urban reality of the city of Baghdad during that period and the change of vegetation due to environmental factors, human influences and some human phenomena that affected the accuracy of the classification for some areas east of the city of Baghdad is presented. The year 2019 has been highlighted because of its privacy in changing the land cover of the city of Baghdad because of the amount of rain that exceeded its natural levels by far.

TI  - Monitoring Water Quality Parameters of Taihu Lake Based on Remote Sensing Images and LSTM-RNN
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term dynamic monitoring of the water quality of freshwater resources is of great significance to the stable and orderly operation of human society. Most studies only use one of the measured data from the monitoring station and the remote sensing satellite data as the data source. However, a single data source will cause inaccuracy and incompatibility of the water quality monitoring results. Few studies start from practical applications to generate digital images of water quality changes. Furthermore, the performance of shallow neural networks in water quality monitoring is not often ideal. Considering the above problems, we proposed a long short-term memory network model (LSTM) to invert four key water parameters including pondus hydrogenii (PH), dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-H). Moreover, the model was applied to the satellite images of various periods to generate the inverted image of each water quality parameter. The proposed model has exhibited excellent performance in the water quality assessment of the project, with the coefficient of determination (R-2), the relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE), and the mean relative error (MRE) values of 0.83, 0.16, and 0.18, respectively. And the inverted images are also consistent with the official information.

TI  - Changes in land use/land cover and net primary productivity in the transboundary Ili-Balkhash basin of Central Asia, 1995-2015
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remotely sensed data, we documented changes in land use/land cover (LULC) from 1995 to 2015 and net primary productivity (NPP) from 2000 to 2014 in Central Asia's 415,048 km(2) Ili-Balkhash Basin (IBB). This basin, which is shared by China and Kazakhstan, is in the midst of significant socioeconomic transformation due to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the emergence of Kazakhstan, and the economic rise of China. Grazing land covered 82.4% of the IBB in 1995; water bodies and bare land were the only other LULC categories occupying more than 3% of the basin's area. Changes in LULC were most evident on the Chinese side of the border, where crop production areas increased and grazing areas decreased between 1995 and 2015. The area of irrigated cropland in China grew by nearly 30%, primarily in the upper Tekes River valley and along the Ili River near the border with Kazakhstan. In contrast, the irrigated lands in Kazakhstan shifted geographically during this period, but the extent did not change. Expansion of wetlands and permanent water bodies, which occupied 2.1 to 2.9% and 4.6 to 4.7%, respectively, of the IBB in 1995 and 2015, was associated with accretion of Lake Balkhash and Kapchagai Reservoir in Kazakhstan and the construction of new reservoirs in China. NPP of the basin approached 700 g C m(-2)/year in a few areas but was generally less than half this level and characterized by a declining trend except in highly productive irrigated areas of dense, stable vegetation. NPP decreases of more than -10 g C m(-2)/year were apparent in mountainous and upland areas, as well as broad band of grassland and cropland in Kazakhstan. Areas surrounding Lake Balkhash were characterized by unstable to moderately stable, often sparse vegetation.

TI  - Dynamic change of Lake Qinghai shoreline from 1973 to 2018
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The unique geographical location of Lake Qinghai not only plays a role as a natural regulator for the climate around the lake, but also has abundant resources on the shoreline. Accurate and timely grasp of the shoreline dynamic changes of Lake Qinghai is of great significance to protect the ecological environment along the lake. Based on Landsat MSS/TM/OLI remote sensing images from 1973 to 2018 and water level data from 1961 to 2017, this paper studied the changes of shoreline and its impact on bird habitats. At the same time, the main factors affecting shoreline changes were discussed in combination with area, water level and meteorological data. The main conclusions are as follows : (1) In the past 45 years, the areas with the greatest changes in the shoreline of Lake Qinghai have been the Lake Shadao on the east coast, the Bird Island on the west coast, the Tiebuka Bay and the entrance to the Shaliu River on the north coast. Especially since 2004, the shoreline in the Bird Island had the largest retreat distance (5.52 km) and bird habitat expansion was about 97.94 km(2), which provided a better habitat for birds. (2) The length of the Lake Qinghai shoreline gradually extended at a rate of 0.88 km/a from 1973 to 2018. Before 1997, the length of the shoreline showed a relatively steady upward trend. Then, it showed a fluctuating downward trend from 1997 to 2004. After 2004, it showed a sharp in- crease in volatility, and the shoreline tortuosity also showed the same trend. ( 3) The overall shoreline length and tortuosity were not significantly affected by water level and area, but they responded differently to the dynamic changes of Lake Qinghai under different water levels. Especially when the water level was less than 3193.3 m or the area was less than 4249.3 km(2), the tortuosity of the shoreline showed the same trend with the change of water level and area. While the water level was higher than 3193.3 m, the tortuosity of the shoreline had been increasing, and the greater the rate of water level rise, the greater the annual variation of tortuosity. ( 4) The water level decline and land desertification of Lake Qinghai from 1973 to 2004 were the direct causes of lakeshore changes. Human activities and grassland degradation accelerated the change of lake shoreline. After 2004, as the water level of Lake Qinghai rebounded and the area expanded, the coastline gradually receded, especially during 2017-2018.

TI  - Evaluating Multivariable Statistical Methods for Downscaling Nighttime Land Surface Temperature in Urban Areas
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - For research and practice in fields such as the environment and meteorology, nighttime land surface temperature (LST) images at fine resolution provide important basic data. Since only a few satellite sensors can take fine-resolution thermal infrared images at night, such images are rather scarce. Downscaling of coarse-resolution LST images is a potential method for obtaining high-resolution LST images. However, downscaling methods have been mostly proposed for daytime LST images. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of methods that combine multiple explanatory variables and machine learning algorithms for downscaling coarse-resolution nighttime LST images in urban areas. Verification showed that the errors in the downscaling results were acceptable (mean absolute errors within 2 K). The resulting images could depict the spatial pattern of night LST in the study area in great detail. It was demonstrated that visible-near infrared images taken in the daytime could be used for downscaling of nighttime LST images, the rationality of which was deduced. It was also demonstrated that the performance of the spectral explanatory variables in nighttime LST downscaling was not lower than that of the mechanism explanatory variables. This method has high application value in many academic and practical efforts, such as land-atmosphere interface radiation budget studies, suitability assessments of human settlement, and urban environmental planning.

TI  - Spatio-Temporally Weighted Two-Step Method for Retrieving Seismic MBT Anomaly: May 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake Sequence Being a Case
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Referring to the first law of geography and its extension in time domain, this research makes improvements on the two-step method (TSM) presented to retrieve seismic microwave brightness temperature (MBT) anomaly, and a new method named spatio-temporally weighted TSM (STW-TSM) is developed. Temporally weighted background is calculated using nonseismic data according to respective time intervals with the shocking year, and applied to remove long-term trend so as to retrieve basic MBT residuals. Spatially weighted background is calculated referring to Euclidean geospatial distance away from the epicenter, and applied to eliminate local meteorological noise so as to retrieve cleaned MBT residuals. With May 2008 Wenchuan earthquake sequence being a case study, significant seismic MBT anomalies at H and V polarizations, 10 days before and after the May 12 Mw7.9 main shock, were retrieved using STW-TSM at 6.9, 10.7, 18.7, and 36.5 GHz, respectively. This study shows that the newly developed STW-TSM is much more qualified. More significant seismic MBT anomalies at H polarization was retrieved as compared to V polarization. More detailed and localized MBT anomalies was uncovered from high frequency bands at 18.7 and 36.5 GHz, while much remarkable anomalies (but less details) were obtained from low frequency bands at 6.9 and 10.7 GHz. This research is valuable for satellite MBT observation, seismic anomaly analysis, and earthquake precursor study.

TI  - Climatology of Passive Microwave Brightness Temperatures in Tropical Cyclones and their Relations to Storm Intensities as Seen by FY-3B/MWRI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new database, the tropical cyclones passive microwave brightness temperature (TCsBT) database including 6273 overpasses of 503 tropical cyclones (TC) was established from 6-year (2011-2016) Fengyun-3B (FY-3B) Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) Level-1 brightness temperature (TB) data and TC best-track data. An algorithm to estimate the TC intensity is developed using MWRI TB's from the database. The relationship between microwave TB and the maximum sustained surface wind (Vmax) of TCs is derived from the TCsBT database. A high correlation coefficient between MWRI channel TB and Vmax is found at the radial distance 50-100 km near the TC inner core. Brightness temperatures at 10.65, 18.70, 23.8, and 36.5 GHz increase but 89 GHz TB's and polarization corrected TB at 36.5 GHz (PCT36.50) and PCT89 decrease with increasing TC intensity. The TCsBT database is further separated into the 5063 dependent samples (2010-2015) for the development of the TC intensity estimation algorithm and 1210 independent samples (2016) for algorithm verification. The stepwise regression method is used to select the optimal combination of storm intensity estimation variables from 12 candidate variables and four parameters (10.65h, 23.80v, 89.00v and PCT36.50) were selected for multiple regression models development. Among the four predictors, PCT36.50 contributes the most in estimating TC intensity. In addition, the errors are lower for estimating 6-h and 12-h future Vmax than estimating the current Vmax.

TI  - Evolving Instability of the Scar Inlet Ice Shelf based on Sequential Landsat Images Spanning 2005-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the large-scale disintegration of the Larsen B Ice Shelf (LBIS) in 2002, ice flow velocities for its remnants and tributary glaciers began to increase. In this study, we used sequential Landsat images spanning 2005-2018 to produce detailed maps of the ice flow velocities and surface features for the Scar Inlet Ice Shelf (SIIS). Our results indicate that the ice flow velocities for the SIIS and its tributary glaciers (Flask and Leppard Glaciers) have substantially increased since 2005. Surface features, such as rifts and crevasses, have also substantially increased in both scope and scale and are particularly evident in the region between the Leppard Glacier and the Jason Peninsula. Several indicators-including the acceleration of ice flows, the rapid growth of major surface rifts, the heavily enhanced surface crevasses, and the dynamic position of the ice front-point to the evolving instability of the SIIS. These same indicators describe the conditions for the LBIS leading up to its 2002 collapse. To date, however, the SIIS remains intact. The formation of fast ice supporting the ice shelf front, combined with moderate mean summer temperatures, may be preventing or delaying its collapse.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping for metastasis detection in colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE ENFERMEDADES DIGESTIVAS
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: controversy exists on the diagnostic performance of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in colorectal cancer. This study aimed to provide a more precise estimation of its clinical significance.Materials and methods: a systematic search of electronic databases was conducted to retrieve all relevant studies up to August 31st, 2019. Detection rate, sensitivity, and upstaging rate were pooled together, and a subgroup analysis was performed to identify factors that affect diagnostic performance. The prognostic value of upstaging was also explored.Results: sixty-eight studies were eligible and included. The pooled SLN detection rate was 0.93 (95 % CI, 0.91-0.94), with a significant higher rate in colon cancer or in studies including more than 100 patients. The overall sensitivity of the SLN procedure in colorectal cancer was 0.72 ( 95 % CI, 0.67-0.77). The tracers used were found to influence sensitivity. A mean weighted upstaging of 0.22 ( 95 % CI, 0.18-0.25) was identified. True upstaging, defined as micro-metastases, was 14 %. Upstaged patients were associated with worse overall survival (OS) when compared with node-negative patients (HR = 2.60, 95 % CI, 0.16-4.63). In addition, upstaged patients had a lower 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate than node-negative patients.Conclusion: based on the results of the present meta-analysis, the SLN mapping procedure should focus on early stage patients to refine staging, since upstaging appeared to be a prognostic factor for DFS and OS. The SLN procedure can be recommended for colorectal cancer patients in addition to conventional resection.

TI  - Multilevel Feature Fusion-Based CNN for Local Climate Zone Classification From Sentinel-2 Images: Benchmark Results on the So2Sat LCZ42 Dataset
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a unique classification scheme for urban forms and functions, the local climate zone (LCZ) system provides essential general information for any studies related to urban environments, especially on a large scale. Remote sensing data-based classification approaches are the key to large-scale mapping and monitoring of LCZs. The potential of deep learning-based approaches is not yet fully explored, even though advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) continue to push the frontiers for various computer vision tasks. One reason is that published studies are based on different datasets, usually at a regional scale, which makes it impossible to fairly and consistently compare the potential of different CNNs for real-world scenarios. This article is based on the big So2Sat LCZ42 benchmark dataset dedicated to LCZ classification. Using this dataset, we studied a range of CNNs of varying sizes. In addition, we proposed a CNN to classify LCZs from Sentinel-2 images, Sen2LCZ-Net. Using this base network, we propose fusing multilevel features using the extended Sen2LCZ-Net-MF. With this proposed simple network architecture, and the highly competitive benchmark dataset, we obtain results that are better than those obtained by the state-of-the-art CNNs, while requiring less computation with fewer layers and parameters. Large-scale LCZ classification examples of completely unseen areas are presented, demonstrating the potential of our proposed Sen2LCZ-Net-MF as well as the So2Sat LCZ42 dataset. We also intensively investigated the influence of network depth and width, and the effectiveness of the design choices made for Sen2LCZ-Net-MF. This article will provide important baselines for future CNN-based algorithm developments for both LCZ classification and other urban land cover land use classification. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/ChunpingQiu/benchmark-on-So2SatLCZ42-dataset-a-simple-tour.

AB  - In this Letter, we present the automated observation radiometric calibration (AORC) approach for vicarious calibration to determine the surface reflectance for any arbitrary test site in the absence of ground personnel. It has successfully operated at Dunhuang test site for 4 months, with a suite of instruments including an automated test-site radiometer, a precision solar radiometer, and a visible and short-wave infrared hyper-spectral irradiance meter. The predicted top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance are in good agreement with those obtained from the on-board calibration system of Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), the average percent difference less than 3.10% in nine bands except 5.14% in band 5. It enable us to improve the calibration frequency, currently once a year in situ, to 1 similar to 2 times every month and maintain radiometric accuracy on par with manned field campaigns which making it possible to establish long-term trends in sensor performance.

AB  - Monitoring crop phenology is essential for analyzing the impacts of climate change and agronomic management on agricultural production. In this study, we proposed a new framework to monitor the phonological response of winter wheat using time series of Sentinel-1A as well as rainfall and temperature data, and ground phenological observations. The results showed that the radar backscatter coefficient ratio of VH to VV polarization showed the obvious seasonality that was related to vegetation phenology. Furthermore, the results showed that we can extract the phenology of winter wheat from the backscatter. Overall, this study clearly shows the strong response of Sentinel-1A data to winter wheat phenology and the potential for monitoring winter wheat phenology.

TI  - A Comparison of OCO-2 SIF, MODIS GPP, and GOSIF Data from Gross Primary Production (GPP) Estimation and Seasonal Cycles in North America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed products are of great significance to estimating global gross primary production (GPP), which helps to provide insight into climate change and the carbon cycle. Nowadays, there are three types of emerging remotely sensed products that can be used to estimate GPP, namely, MODIS GPP (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer GPP, MYD17A2H), OCO-2 SIF, and GOSIF. In this study, we evaluated the performances of three products for estimating GPP and compared with GPP of eddy covariance(EC) from the perspectives of a single tower (23 flux towers) and vegetation types (evergreen needleleaf forests, deciduous broadleaf forests, open shrublands, grasslands, closed shrublands, mixed forests, permeland wetlands, and croplands) in North America. The results revealed that sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data and MODIS GPP data were highly correlated with the GPP of flux towers (GPP(EC)). GOSIF and OCO-2 SIF products exhibit a higher accuracy in GPP estimation at the a single tower (GOSIF: R-2 = 0.13-0.88, p < 0.001; OCO-2 SIF: R-2 = 0.11-0.99, p < 0.001; MODIS GPP: R-2 = 0.15-0.79, p < 0.001). MODIS GPP demonstrates a high correlation with GPP(EC) in terms of the vegetation type, but it underestimates the GPP by 1.157 to 3.884 gCm(-2)day(-1) for eight vegetation types. The seasonal cycles of GOSIF and MODIS GPP are consistent with that of GPP(EC) for most vegetation types, in spite of an evident advanced seasonal cycle for grasslands and evergreen needleleaf forests. Moreover, the results show that the observation mode of OCO-2 has an evident impact on the accuracy of estimating GPP using OCO-2 SIF products. In general, compared with the other two datasets, the GOSIF dataset exhibits the best performance in estimating GPP, regardless of the extraction range. The long time period of MODIS GPP products can help in the monitoring of the growth trend of vegetation and the change trends of GPP.

TI  - Urbanization and climate change jointly shift land surface phenology in the northern mid-latitude large cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) has been widely used as the "footprint" of urbanization and global climate change. Shifts of ISP have cascading effects on food production, carbon sequestration, water consumption, biodiversity, and public health. Previous studies mainly focused on investigating the effects of urbanization on the spatial patterns of ISP by comparing phenological metrics, e.g. start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS), between urban center and the surrounding rural regions. However, it remains unclear how urbanization-induced land cover conversions and climate change jointly influence the temporal variations of SOS and EOS within the urban ecosystem. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized daily two-band enhanced vegetation index, daily meteorological record, and annual land cover dataset to investigate the respective impacts of urbanization and climate change on temporal shifts of ISP between the post- and the pre-urbanization periods over 196 large cities in the northern mid-latitudes. We found 51% of the cities experienced an advanced SOS with an average of -6.39 +/- 5.82 days after urbanization has occurred, while the remaining 49% of the cities had a delayed SOS with an average of 7.56 +/- 5.63 days. We also found a later EOS at 53% of the cities and an earlier EOS at 47% of the cities with an average of 8.43 +/- 7.59 and - 5.57 +/- 4.99 days between the post- and pre-urbanization periods, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis indicates that climate variables (i.e. temperature, precipitation, and insolation) play dominant roles in regulating the temporal shifts of ISP. Furthermore, the earlier SOS and later EOS were significantly correlated with the amplitude of urbanization (i.e. increase of impervious surface area) in cities after controlling for effects of climate factors. These patterns were generally consistent across eight climate zones. Our findings provide critical information in modeling natural and anthropogenic effects on urban ecosystem, with important benefits for urban sustainability and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Hyperspectral and Panchromatic Image Fusion via Adaptive Tensor and Multi-Scale Retinex Algorithm
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusion of panchromatic image (PANI) and hyperspectral image (HSI) to obtain an output image with high spatial and spectral resolutions has received increasing interests recently. We propose a new image fusion method for HSI and PANI by combining adaptive tensor with a multi-scale Retinex algorithm in this paper. In the proposed method, an adaptive tensor based method is presented to effectively extract the structure information of HSI, and multi-scale Retinex algorithm is introduced to obtain the spatial and structure details of PANI. To integrate spatial structure information, a gradient-based weighted fusion strategy is proposed to combine spatial details of HSI and PANI. The integrated structure details are injected to generate the fused HSI. Experiments using both simulated and real remote sensing data sets demonstrated that the proposed fusion algorithm performs better than the state-of-the-art algorithms in visual inspection and objective assessment.

AB  - Due to the non-linear response of the infrared load device in the low-temperature region, the stripes, appeared in the low-temperature region of the infrared image, will seriously deteriorate the image quality and quantitative retrieval accuracy of the infrared remote sensing image. The existing methods based on the calibration parameters on the infrared remote sensing satellite can't solve the stripe problem caused by the non-linear response. Therefore, the compensation by means of ground to improve the quality of infrared images is particularly urgent. This paper deeply analysed the generation mechanism of satellite infrared camera load inhomogeneity and studied two improved stripe removal algorithms based on Kalman filtering and moment matching in view of the shortcomings of the traditional method in removing stripes. First of all, this paper introduces the advantages of Kalman filtering noise processing and the deficiencies of the algorithm in image processing. Then, a method based on Kalman filtering is proposed to improve the radiation quality of infrared images. Secondly, aiming at the problem of "Banding effect" in traditional moment matching, a one-dimensional moving window was proposed to segment the image to protect the image detail information, and we also propose a method to enhance the radiation quality of moment matched infrared images based on adaptive moving window weighted column average compensation. Through the actual data processing, the improved two methods could effectively eliminate the stripes in the image, improve the target temperature inversion accuracy in a variety of complex scenes, and enhance the visual effect of the image. Moreover, the accuracy of temperature inversion of targets in various complex scenarios is also improved, which will greatly improve the quantitative availability of infrared remote sensing data.

TI  - Direct Estimation of Forest Leaf Area Index based on Spectrally Corrected Airborne LiDAR Pulse Penetration Ratio
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a crucial structural parameter of forest canopies. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) provides an alternative to passive optical sensors in the estimation of LAI from remotely sensed data. However, LiDAR-based LAI estimation typically relies on empirical models, and such methods can only be applied when the field-based LAI data are available. Compared with an empirical model, a physically-based model-e.g., the Beer-Lambert law based light extinction model-is more attractive due to its independent dataset with training. However, two challenges are encountered when applying the physically-based model to estimate LAI from discrete LiDAR data: i.e., deriving the gap fraction and the extinction coefficient from the LiDAR data. We solved the first problem by integrating LiDAR and hyperspectral data to transfer the LiDAR penetration ratio to the forest gap fraction. For the second problem, the extinction coefficient was estimated from tiled (1 km x 1 km) LiDAR data by nonlinearly optimizing the cost function of the angular LiDAR gap fraction and simulated gap fraction from the Beer-Lambert law model. A validation against LAI-2000 measurements showed that the estimates were significantly correlated to the reference LAI with an R-2 of 0.66, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.60 and a relative RMSE of 0.15. We conclude that forest LAI can be directly estimated by the nonlinear optimization method utilizing the Beer-Lambert model and a spectrally corrected LiDAR penetration ratio. The significance of the proposed method is that it can produce reliable remotely sensed forest LAI from discrete LiDAR and spectral data when field-measured LAI are unavailable.

TI  - Hydrological/Hydraulic Modeling-Based Thresholding of Multi SAR Remote Sensing Data for Flood Monitoring in Regions of the Vietnamese Lower Mekong River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing data can be used as an effective alternative to detect surface water and provide useful information regarding operational flood monitoring, in particular for the improvement of rapid flood assessments. However, this application frequently requires standard and simple, yet robust, algorithms. Although thresholding approaches meet these requirements, limitations such as data inequality over large spatial regions and challenges in estimating optimal threshold values remain. Here, we propose a new method for SAR water extraction named Hammock Swing Thresholding (HST). We applied this HST approach to four SAR remote sensing datasets, namely, Sentinel-1, ALOS-2, TerraSAR-X, and RadarSAT-2 for flood inundation mapping for a case study focusing on the Tam Nong district in the Vietnam Mekong delta. A 2D calibrated Hydrologic Engineering Centers River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model was coupled with the HST outputs in order to estimate the optimal thresholds (OTs) where the SAR-based water masks fitted best with HEC-RAS's inundation patterns. Our results showed that water levels extracted from Sentinel-1 data best agreed with the HEC-RAS water extent (88.3%), following by ALOS-2 (85.9%), TerraSAR-X (77.2%). and RadarSAT-2 (72%) at OTs of -15, 68, 21, and 35 decibel (dB), respectively. Generated flood maps indicated changes in the flood extent of the flooding seasons from 2010 and 2014-2016 with variations in spatial extent appearing greater in the TerraSAR-X and RadarSAT-2 higher resolution maps. We recommend the use of OTs in applications of flood monitoring using SAR remote sensing data, such as for an open data cube (ODC).

TI  - Sentinel Node Identification in Melanoma: Current Clinical Impact, New Emerging SPECT Radiotracers and Technological Advancements. An Update of the Last Decade
T2  - CURRENT RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Melanoma is the most lethal skin cancer with a mortality rate of 262 cases per 100.000 cases. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph node draining the tumor. SLN biopsy is a widely accepted procedure in the clinical setting since it provides important prognostic information, which helps patient management, and avoids the side effects of complete lymph node dissection. The rationale of identifying and removing the SLN relies on the low probability of subsequent metastatic nodes in case of a negative histological exam performed in the SLN.Discussion: Recently, new analytical approaches, based on the evaluation of scintigraphic images are also exploring the possibility to predict the metastatic involvement of the SLN. (99)mTc-labeled colloids are still the most commonly used radiotracers but new promising radiotracers, such as (99)m-TcTilmanocept, are now on the market. In the last decades, single photon emission computed tomography-computerized tomography (SPECT/CT) has gained wider diffusion in clinical departments and there is large evidence about its superior diagnostic accuracy over planar lymphoscintigraphy (PL) in the detection of SLN in patients with melanoma. Scientists are also investigating new hybrid techniques combining functional and anatomical images for the depiction of SLN but further evidence about their value is needed.Conclusion: This review examined the predictive and prognostic factors of lymphoscintigraphy for metastatic involvement of SLN, the currently available and emerging radiotracers and the evidence of the additional value of SPECT/CT over PL for the identification of SLN in patients with melanoma. Finally, the review discussed the most recent technical advances in the field.

Though Landsat data have been the most commonly used at medium scale (<100m / pixel), Sentinel 2 satellites provide an opportunity for post-fire damage analysis. MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard of Sentinel 2 satellites acquires data in red-edge wavelengths, and has higher spatial (10/20m vs. 30m) and temporal (16 vs. 5 days) resolution. Thus, the aim of this study is to check whether Sentinel 2 MSI spectral indexes that include red-edge bands allow a better discrimination between burned and unburned areas than conventional spectral indexes based on red, near infrared and/or short wave infrared. A large forest fire (79.5 km(2)) occurred in Sierra de Gata (Spain) in August 2015 acted as study area. Official fire perimeter together to Copernicus Emergency Management Service infounation (ID: EMSR132) provided us a terrain reference. Logistic regression models based on Sentinel 2 MSI spectral indexes (conventional and red-edge based) showed that red-edge spectral indexes outperfouned conventional ones in teens of discriminating burned from unburned areas.

AB  - In the late Joseon Dynasty, many Sangryangmun上梁文, which was designed for imaginary spaces, were created. These creations were not originally intended for practical purposes, so the author's ideas and consciousness orientation are more pronounced. However, the sanctions on Sangryangmun are mainly focused on ‘Shingyuru蜃氣樓’ and ‘Magpie's nest’. It is noteworthy that these Sangryangmun has been continuously created by various writers. So, I discussed the allegory Sangnyangmun of the late Joseon Dynasty, focusing on the ‘Shingiru's Sangnyangmun’ and ‘Nest's Sangnyangmun.’ The Shingiru's Sangnyangmun and the Nest’s Sangnyangmun are already out of the character of the practical text in that it is a Sangnyangmun that is attached to a space where people do not actually live, and clearly reveals the author's consciousness and thoughts. Specifically, in the Shingiru's Sangryangmun, the Neo-Confucian cosmopolitan outlook was visually shaped, while revealing a reflection on the value of vanity and reality. In addition, Nest’s Sangnyangmun discusses the meaning of residence and the reason for living in the world by utilizing various examinations related to magpie houses. In the late Joseon Dynasty, Sangryangmun was not only created for practical purposes, but was also enjoyed as a literary artifact that revealed the worldview and consciousness orientation of writers.Why were so many proverbs created in the late Joseon Dynasty? To suggest one possibility, the test may have influenced the creation of Sangryangmun. In the late Joseon Dynasty, Sangnyangmun was one of the styles that tested educated persons, so any literati with literary talent should have been able to build Sangnyangmun properly. Due to this background, many writers may have practiced creating Sangryangmun by creating an allegorical Sangryangmun or revealing their literary talents.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the works of Vincent van Gogh from the perspective of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Van Gogh created over 2,000 paintings over the period of a decade from 1880 to 1890, a large number of which were landscapes. Van Gogh's landscape paintings are less well known to the public compared to that of the laborers, selfportraits and other portraits. The focus of Van Gogh's work from 1880, when Van Gogh first stepped down the painter's path, were the laborers and the landscape. One interesting fact about van Goth's landscapes paintings are that the majority of his landscapes were not of sceneries that would be traditionally considered “beautiful”. Rather, he painted things like bushes, tree roots, sand dunes, weeds and woody groves. Why did he choose to capture such landscapes on canvas? Van Gogh's landscape paintings should be viewed from the same perspective as Van Gogh's paintings of the poor. Just as Christ looked at the world through eyes of compassion, Van Gogh did the same with nature. This noteworthy characteristic of Van Gogh's landscape paintings is closely linked to his religious background of Dutch Reformed faith. As will be discussed in this paper, the uniqueness of Van Gogh's landscape painting stands on the tradition of Dutch art in the 17th century. More fundamentally, it is to be found in the Christian Gospel, which was the foundation of Dutch art in the 17th century, and Van Gogh's own religious background.

AB  - Land degradation neutrality as a global goal, needs a permanent spatial monitoring. However, the spatial landcover maps produced until now, by the African countries (to supply the international studies/statistics) have been often full with confusion (medium quality) especially in the vegetal classes. In order to provide a more precision, the aim of this work is to produce landcover maps at a national level of Algeria, using a multisource approach (based on MODIS scenes) using DEM data, NDVI layers, supervised classification and high-resolution image for validation from the Algerian optical satellites "Alsat 2".

AB  - The general idea of the study is to emphasize the necessity of Interim Ecological Monitoring application based on remote sensing tools for effective monitoring on water bodies used to supply drinking water to urban areas. The aim of the study is to identify the changes in the water surface of the "Studena dam" for a period of three years (2018-2020) and in different seasons. The investigation is made based on Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 (MSI optical) data for different time intervals. Orthogonalization of Sentinel 2 data has been applied. Correlation between the obtained data from Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 has been defined. The results have been verified by additional data generated by analyzing the inflow and outflow in watershed and alluvial outflow based on officially published information by the Ministry of Environment and Water in Bulgaria (e.g. monthly schedules for water usage from dams with great importance for Republic of Bulgaria, calculations, etc.) and the influence of climate factors (precipitation and temperature). The final results from IEM application based on remote sensing data could be applied to generate tendency for changes in dam water volume in different time periods and gives opportunity for decision-makers to undertake preventive actions or effective actions in case of a water crisis.

AB  - Aim. Selection and analysis of index images suitable for deciphering the vegetation cover in the conditions of inner mountain Dagestan.Methods. The study was carried out on the basis of multi-temporal satellite images of high spatial resolution, obtained by the imaging system of the Sentinel-2 series satellite, using methods of digital processing of geoimages. Processing was carried out using the capabilities of the Google Earth Engine geoservice.Results. Multi-temporal index images were obtained for the territory of inner mountain Dagestan. The time series of seasonal changes in the indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) were analyzed, making it possible to reveal the phenological patterns of vegetation and to map the vegetation cover on this basis. Schemes for decoding vegetation have been created by which areas are distinguished according to the following characteristics: devoid of vegetation, herbaceous vegetation of varying degrees of density or woody (deciduous and coniferous).Conclusion. When studying vegetation cover using index images in a range of natural conditions, it is necessary to take into account the natural features of the territory, as well using additional sources of spatial information including field research methods.

AB  - The article is devoted to systematizing the legal characteristics of objects of the common heritage of mankind; to study the philosophical and historical origins and connections of the concept of the common heritage of mankind with other legal categories and worldview systems; to determine the prospects of application of the new philosophical concept in its legal and worldview aspects. The work is based on a set of approaches united in sociological-legal consciousness, primarily historical, communicative and psychological ones, and on the methodological basis of I. Kant's philosophy. The concept of the common heritage of humanity in the context of trans-historical development of social consciousness as a critical system-making factor of societies of macro-level scales for the first time is investigated in the research. Mankind should return to its social consciousness an intersubjective relation to its planetary natural environment, that is, its inclusion in its multilevel diversity and recognition of its "subjectivity", if not in a legal sense, then in the awareness of its complexity, self-regulatory properties, the need for its constant cognition in feedback mode - this idea should be the main new philosophical concept of protection of the common heritage of mankind.

AB  - Accurate mapping of built-up area and bare soil, having similar spectral characteristics is an important task for urban mapping using remote sensing data. In order to classify both built-up area and bare soil accurately, several indices with Landsat data are proposed in the literature. This study is planned to compare the performance of several indices proposed to accurately differentiate built-up area and bare soil using Sentinel 2 data acquired over Kurukshetra (Haryana) during April 2017. All together nine indices related to built-up area and bare soil identification and proposed in literature were derived with Sentinel 2 data. Different dataset combinations were used for classification in four land cover classes. Support vector machine classifier was used to classify different combination of images used in this study. Comparison of results in terms of area for both built-up area and bare soil using classified images and field visit suggest that a combination of six bands of Sentinel 2 datawith six indiceswas found performingwell in comparison to other combinations and was able to differentiate both built-up area and bare soil accurately.

AB  - Varying inclination angle for each layer can do geomagnetic 3D modeling and Talwani method to build the initial model as forward modeling formulation. In modeling process, random noise distribution is always needed to build synthetic data from observation data. There is two kinds of random noise distribution used in this research. They are uniform distribution and Gaussian distribution. This concept then applied in satellite data of magnetic intensity in Sintang, West Borneo. Sintang is chosen because it is productive in mineralization and of course has significant potential of susceptibility. Based on modeling inversion result, the uniform distribution is better in a separate significant and low anomaly of susceptibility contrast than Gaussian distribution in this research's data.

AB  - Using satellite data to extract forest structure mapping parameters assists forest management. In this research, structural parameters including species, density, canopy, and gaps were extracted from SPOT-7 satellite data over Hyrcanian forests (Iran). A detailed ground inventory was initially conducted, over 12 x 1 ha (100 m x 100 m) plots, in which tree coordinates were plotted, using a differential global positioning system (DGPS), along with data on tree species, diameter-at-breast-height and height, as well as canopy dimensions, and canopy gap shapes, sizes, and positions, for each plot. Then, spectral transformations, vegetation indices, and simple spectral ratios were extracted from SPOT-7 data, and a supervised, pixel-based classification method and a support-vector machine algorithm were used to classify and determine tree species types. In addition, canopy tree borders and gaps were classified, using an object-based method, and tree densities per unit area were determined, using the canopy gravity center. Finally, the original ground data was used to perform an accuracy assessment on the extracted information, with the results showing that forest type could be determined with 95% accuracy and a Kappa coefficient of 0.8. Canopy and gap coverage achieved an overall accuracy of 91% (Kappa coefficient: 0.7), and tree densities per hectare were determined, on average, to be 47 trees fewer than reality. In conclusion, we have shown that forest structural parameters could be extracted, with good accuracy, using a combination of pixel- and object-based methods applied to SPOT-7 imaging.

AB  - Dengue is the most common mosquito-transmitted diseases, leading to millions of serious illnesses and deaths each year. Because the mosquito vectors are sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity, it is possible to map areas currently or imminently at high risk for disease outbreaks using satellite remote sensing. In this paper we propose the development of an operational geospatial system for Dengue and dengue fever early warning; this can be done by bringing together geographic information system (GIS) tools, artificial neural networks (ANN) for efficient pattern recognition, the best available ground-based epidemiological and vector ecology data, and current satellite remote sensing capabilities.We use Vegetation Health Indices (VHI) derived from visible and infrared radiances measured by satellite-mounted Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR) and available weekly at 4-km resolution as one predictor of dengue fever risk in Bangladesh. As a study area, we focus on Bangladesh where dengue fever are serious public health threats. The technology developed will, however, be largely portable to other countries in the world and applicable to other disease threats. A dengue fever early warning system will be a boon to international public health, enabling resources to be focused where they will do the most good for stopping pandemics, and will be an invaluable decision support tool for national security assessment and potential troop deployment in regions susceptible to disease outbreaks.

This study aims to integrate both multispectral and microwave remote sensing imagery acquired by the satellites of Sentinel-1 and -2 of European Space Agency (ESA) to assess the fire severity caused by the recent fires in the outskirts of Sydney in 2018 and 2019-2020. Time-series analysis of the derived indices were examined to quantify the variation of the indices to the damages to the vegetation communities due to fires as well as the recovery. The results will improve our knowledge on how the indices are correlated to biophysical properties of the vegetation.

AB  - Forest and land fires are one of the disasters that occur regularly every year in the dry season. In 2019, it is estimated that the spread of forest and land fires will continue to expand due to the weak el nino potential faced by Indonesia. Monitoring burned area is important to be done quickly and accurately to find out the distribution and extent of the burned area to be followed up by relevant parties. This study aims to monitor burned area in Muaro Jambi, Jambi Province based on remote sensing imagery from optical sensors and radar sensors, namely Landsat 8, Sentinel 2, and Sentinel 1 satellite imagery. The method of identifying the burned area is based on the hotspot location and the different land cover images before and after the fire. Hotspot data used are Terra / Aqua MODIS, SNPP VIIRS, and NOAA 20 with confidence level high, medium, low while the satellite imagery used is Landsat RGB 6 5 4, Sentinel 2 RGB 11 8a 4, and Sentinel 1 RGB VV VH VV / VH. Based on this monitoring, the results of multisensor and multiresolution image show that the burned area continues to increase during the fire period from 30 July (217 Ha) - 5 August 2019 (1027 Ha).

AB  - Urban morphology is one of the important parameters that dictate the land surface temperature in an area. This research analyses the difference in the impact of different urban morphology on surface heat island in the city of Chandigarh, India. Local Climate Zone classification system is employed to classify the urban area by WUDAPT method. This study assesses the thermal behaviour of mapped LCZ's using the land surface temperature retreived from Landsat-8 data. The results show that LST in the city is consistent with the LCZ classes with higher LST observed in built-up LCZ classes. The unique thermal behaviour of the different LCZs provides indispensable information on the urban environment and its climatic conditions. This study provides directions to the urban planners by proposing the most suitable local climate zones to be developed while planning a new area to make it climate-resilient and guiding efficient distribution and design of built masses to maintain their maximum value of micro and local climate adjustment.

AB  - In the last three last decades air pollution level has been increased significantly especially in the northern parts of India with Delhi being the most polluted city. Population growth, energy demand, industrial growth, increased crop burning, increased traffic density and coal burning have affected the air quality of Delhi and surrounding areas upto a great extent. In the present paper, we have used MODIS Terra and Aqua data to study the annual and seasonal variations of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Angstrom Exponent (AE) and also tried to identify the sources of pollution based on AOD and AE. A wide variation in AOD, (range 0.07 to 3.49) and AE, (range 0-1.8) is observed during 2000-2019 over Delhi and surrounding regions. This shows very poor air quality and highly polluted atmospheric. Different aerosol types are found to be season dependent based on the detailed analysis of AOD and AE retrieved from satellite data during the period 2000-2019. The present analysis shows dominance of anthropogenic aerosols (AA) during winter whereas biomass burning (BB) during post monsoon seasons. During pre monsoon season pollutant continental (PC) and mostly dust (MD) were observed for many days as air mass travel from Thar Desert, Middle East and Arabia with the westerly winds. In the recent decade, clean days in Delhi are reduced significantly.

TI  - Precarious gains: Social mobility and volatility in urban slums
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearly one sixth of the global population lives in urban "slums" - areas characterized by inadequate infrastructure and tenure security. This figure continues to grow as developing countries rapidly urbanize. Yet, the implications of these trends for urban poverty and social mobility are not well understood. While some argue slums provide temporary housing for rural migrants as they accumulate savings and eventually move to middle class neighborhoods, others argue slum residents are stuck in poverty traps. Deficits in longitudinal data on slums make it difficult to analyze the extent of social mobility. We iterate between satellite analysis and field knowledge to build an original sample of more than 9000 slum households across more than 200 slums from three Indian cities. To address the limitations inherent in cross-sectional data, we employ multiple methods and triangulate findings across household survey data, neighborhood focus group data, longitudinal satellite data, and in-depth qualitative interviews. While no one analysis is definitive on its own, all of these results point to the same conclusion: slum residents are neither stuck in poverty traps nor are they on a steady trajectory to joining the middle class. Movement out of neighborhoods, particularly to non-slum neighborhoods, is rare. Most households experience upward mobility within their neighborhoods, but the extent of improvement is capped at a low level, and, as opportunities increase, volatility increases in parallel. Plateauing and volatility are features present in low-end, and even more, in high-end slums. Engendering better livelihood opportunities requires reducing downward mobility while addressing the causes of plateauing upward mobility. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Farming in developing countries is majorly dependent on the traditional knowledge of farmers, with unscientific agricultural practices commonly implemented, leading to low productivity and degradation of resources. Moreover, mechanization has not been integral to farming, and thus managing a farm is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Consequently, precision agriculture (PA) offers great opportunities for improvement. Using geographic information and communication technology (Geo-ICTs) principles, PA offers the opportunity for a farmer to apply the right amount of treatment at the right time and at the right location in the farm. However, in order to collect timely high-resolution data, drone-based sensing and image interpretation is required. These high-resolution images can give detailed information about the soil and crop condition, which can be used for farm management purposes. Leaf area index, normalized difference vegetation index, photochemical reflectance index, crop water stress index, and other such vegetation indices can provide important information on crop health. Temporal changes in these indices can give vital information about changes in health and canopy structure of the crop over time, which can be related to its biophysical and biochemical stress. These stresses may have occurred due to insufficient soil nutrient, inappropriate soil moisture, or pest attack. Through UAV-based PA, stressed areas can be identified in real time, and some corrective measures can also be carried out (e.g., fertilizer and pesticide spraying). Moreover, the advantages and different approaches to integrate the UAV data in the crop models are also described.

AB  - Personality-centric politics has been a significant part of discussions on social media's impact on electoral politics. In this study, we quantified personalization in mainstream politics by studying the extent to which parliamentary candidates referred to the key leader of their party as opposed to the party itself in their Twitter political campaigns. We found that the candidates of the incumbent right-wing Hindu nationalist party, the BJP, led by a popular and widely approved leader, Narendra Modi, were significantly more likely to run a leader-centric campaign than the candidates of the main opposition party, the INC. Smaller, state and regionalist parties showed mixed results - while candidates of some parties centralized their discourse significantly in their key leaders, in other parties' campaigns, the party was more prominent than its leader in candidate campaigns. We also found that BJP candidates, rather than uniformly running campaigns coat tailing on their hugely popular leader, were strategic in the extent to which they ran Modi centric campaigns. For BJP candidates, their followers count, the type of constituency and Modi's own approval rating in the region were closely associated with running Moth-centric campaigns. We found no discernible patterns in how INC candidates personalized their social media campaigns.

CL  - Annamacharya Inst Technol & Sci, Rajampet, INDIA
AB  - This research letter considered land use/land cover (LU/LC) changes in Kadapa region from 2001 to 2016 by using GIS (Geographical Information Systems) LANDSAT 7 and 8 images level-1 data of ETM+ sensor were collected for the years 2001 and 2016 to estimate the NDVI values. Based on index values study area is classified into five classes like water bodies, built-up area, barren land, sparse vegetation and dense vegetation. The proposed method performs two-stage classification. From the results it is observed that, increase in barren land of 6.23%, built-up area of 24.74% and decrease of water resources of 2.87%, sparse vegetation of 2.62% and dense vegetation/forest land of 25.47% in the Kadapa region. Finally, the classification algorithm was assessed by the confusion matrix method. As NDVI is used basis for classification process vegetation and water resources classification is 100% and 86% built up and barren lands are classification, i.e., some of built-up areas classified as barren land and barren land as built-up area. Compared to existing classification algorithms based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and False Color Composite (FCC) the proposed NDVI histogram and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) multiple classification gives the best results to estimate the change detection. The work was carried out by using ArcGIS software.

TI  - MicroRNAs as sentinels and protagonists of carotid artery thromboembolism
T2  - CLINICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Stroke is the leading cause of serious disability in the world and a large number of ischemic strokes are due to thromboembolism from unstable carotid artery atherosclerotic plaque. As it is difficult to predict plaque rupture and surgical treatment of asymptomatic disease carries a risk of stroke, carotid disease continues to present major challenges with regard to clinical decision-making and revascularization. There is therefore an imminent need to better understand the molecular mechanisms governing plaque instability and rupture, as this would allow for the development of biomarkers to identify at-risk asymptomatic carotid plaque prior to disease progression and stroke. Further, it would aid in creation of therapeutics to stabilize carotid plaque. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated as key protagonists in various stages of atherosclerotic plaque initiation, development and rupture. Notably, they appear to play a crucial role in carotid artery thromboembolism. As the molecular pathways governing the role of miRNAs are being uncovered, we are learning that their involvement is complex, tissue- and stage-specific, and highly selective. Notably, miRNAs can be packaged and secreted in extracellular vesicles (EVs), where they participate in cell-cell communication. The measurement of EV-encapsulated miRNAs in the circulation may inform disease mechanisms occurring in the plaque itself, and therefore may serve as sentinels o unstable plaque as well as therapeutic targets.

TI  - STUDYING UPWELLING PHASES IN THE KAZAKHSTAN PART OF THE CASPIAN SEA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of upwelling is the rise of cold water masses to the surface of the reservoir and is the subject of study around the world, because this process affects many water parameters. Upwelling increases biological productivity and provides nutrients to marine fauna, partially causes changes in the mass of coastal waters, and the influx of cold water can affect local changes in the climate cycle.In open and closed reservoirs, the process occurs in different ways. The Caspian Sea is a closed reservoir where the upwelling process is observed in the summer. In the article, based on satellite data of sea surface temperature, as well as local data on wind speed and direction, the phases of upwelling in the Kazakh part of the Caspian Sea, which occurred in the period from June 5 to August 22, 2017, are determined. The influence of constant North and North-East winds on the stages of upwelling development is shown, the spatial and temporal scales of the process development are determine.

AB  - An analysis of the CO and CH4 total column (TC) as well as aerosol optical depth (AOD) data in background and urban Eurasian regions for different time-periods and seasons from 1998 to 2018 years is presented. Trend estimates based on long-term spectroscopic datasets of OIAP RAS for Moscow, Zvenigorod (ZSS, Moscow province), Beijing (joint site of OIAP RAS and IAP CAS) and NDACC stations located in Eurasia are compared between themselves and with similar assessments obtained from satellite data. The comparison of satellite and ground-based trend estimates was provided for the days of synchronous measurements only. Analysis results of the satellite observations of AIRS v6 of CO and CH4 TC and MODIS AOD data are confirmed by ground-based trend estimates. Significant decrease of anthropogenic CO in the megacities Moscow (2.9 +/- 0.6%/yr) and Beijing (1.2 +/- 0.2%/yr) for autumn months of 1998-2018 was found according to ground-based spectroscopic observations. In spite of total anthropogenic CO emission decrease (for Europe and China) and the decrease of wild-fires emissions in Central North Eurasia (0-90 degrees E, 42-75 degrees N) in 2008-2018 we found CO TC stabilization or even increasing for summer and autumn months of 2008-2018 in background regions of Northern Eurasia. Decrease of AOD over Central and Southern Europe as well as over China (1-5%/yr) was observed since 2007. Since 2007-2008 an increase in CH4 TC positive trend values over Northern Europe as well as for tropical belt of Eurasia was obtained.

AB  - The signing of the Korea-Japan Treaty has been noted as a first step into the modern international law system. However, those who led the signing of the treaty were the reformists, represented by Park Gyu-su, and the existing bureaucrats, represented by Lee Yoo-won. They represented the ruling cliques’ political line in Joseon in the 19th century, including handling of the farmers' uprising in 1862, the replacement of clan politics, and Daewon-gun’s fall and King Gojong’s direct ruling. Their understanding of the reality did not go beyond the scope of Joseon's traditional political culture and ideas that was developed in pursuit of the ideals of Sarim politics. They united and participated in King Gojong’s directly ruling government sticking to the conservative worldview. Also, King Gojong’s advocacy force concerned about the danger of a war that Daewongun's firm stance toward the rejection of negotiations could lead to; therefore, they asserted that Joseon accept the letter from Japan and carried forward an open-door policy toward Japan. Their first goal was to stabilize the people's livelihood by preventing armed conflict. Thus, they dispatched Sin Heon, who was a military officer and not a diplomat. The Joseon government's response to the signing of the Korea-Japan Treaty was based on the basic principle of maintaining a peaceful relationship along with a strong countermeasure against invasions. In this negotiation situation, Sin Heon, who was the chief negotiator, carried out his duties faithfully based on the Joseon government’s stance. The goal of Joseon's ruling elites who led King Gojong's direct ruling could be achieved by drawing a peaceful conclusion.

TI  - Targeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy Is a Safe Approach for Patients with Pacemakers: A Case Study and Literature Review
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Case reports detailing the effects of targeted intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) on patients with cardiac pacemakers (PMs) are rare. This growing population sub-group requiring IORT and lack of standardized guidelines necessitate more practical published research. An 81-year-old patient with clinical stage II, T1 N0 grade III, triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma and an implanted single-lead chamber PM (VVIR mode, model: Biotronik, type Effecta SR) received targeted intraoperative radiotherapy at the time of wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy. It presents the shortest distance between the outer diameter of the PM and IORT applicator in literature. Target IORT was performed utilizing an Intrabeam device (50 kV, Carl Zeiss Surgical, Oberkochen, Germany). This case elucidates the successful use of targeted IORT for breast-conserving surgery in a patient with a single ipsilateral chamber VVIR mode PM. No device failure or malfunction was reported for the PM before, during, or after the procedure. These findings support the use of targeted IORT for patients diagnosed with early-stage breast carcinomas who have a PM implanted. However, further research is needed to understand the safety of other methods and devices for IORT patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to propose a method for evaluating the vertical accuracy of digital elevation models (DEMs), which is applicable to the quality control process in the production line of the Sub-Directorate of Geography and Cartography of the Agustin Codazi Geographic Institute (Subdireccion de Geografia y Cartografia del Institute Geografico Agustin Codazzi [IGAC] which also fulfills the institutional quality objectives. The proposed method outlines the steps for the following: 1) the definition of acceptance levels based on an uncertainty analysis of the sources of error inherent to DEMs; 2) the determination of the sampling design (method and size) as a function of the terrain characteristics (slope and cover); and 3) the assessment of the vertical accuracy based on different statistical measures for quantifying the error. The effectiveness of the method was tested through its application to a DEM data set generated by the Sub- Directorate of Geography and Cartography of IGAC.

AB  - Several domains such as agriculture, urban sustainability, and meteorology entail processing satellite imagery for modeling and decision-making. In this study, we describe our novel methodology to train deep learning models over collections of satellite imagery. Deep learning models are computationally and resource expensive. As dataset sizes increase, there is a corresponding increase in the CPU, GPU, disk, and network I/O requirements to train models. Our methodology exploits spatial characteristics inherent in satellite data to partition, disperse, and orchestrate model training workloads. Rather than train a single, all-encompassing model we facilitate producing an ensemble of models - each tuned to a particular spatial extent. We support query-based retrieval of targeted portions of satellite imagery including those that satisfy properties relating to cloud occlusion, We validate the suitability of our methodology by supporting deep learning models for multiple spatial analyses. Our approach is agnostic of the underlying deep learning library. Our extensive empirical benchmark demonstrates the suitability of our methodology to not just preserve accuracy, but reduce completion times by 13.9x while reducing data movement costs by 4 orders of magnitude and ensuring frugal resource utilization.

TI  - Soil temperature estimation at different depths, using remotely-sensed data
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil temperatures at different depths down the soil profile are important agro-meteorological indicators which are necessary for ecological modeling and precision agricultural activities. In this paper, using time series of soil temperature (ST) measured at different depths (0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 cm) at agro-meteorological stations in northern China as reference data, ST was estimated from land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from AQUA/TERRA MODIS data, and solar declination (Ds) in univariate and multivariate linear regression models. Results showed that when daytime LST is used as predictor, the coefficient of determination (R-2) values decrease from the 0 cm layer to the 40 cm layer. Additionally, with the use of nighttime LST as predictor, the R-2 values were relatively higher at 5, 10 and 15 cm depths than those at 0, 20 and 40 cm depths. It is further observed that the multiple linear regression models for soil temperature estimation outperform the univariate linear regression models based on the root mean squared errors (RMSEs) and R-2. These results have demonstrated the potential of MODIS data in tandem with the Ds parameter for soil temperature estimation at the upper layers of the soil profile where plant roots grow in. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the synergistic use of LST, NDVI and Ds for soil temperature estimation at different depths of the upper layers of the soil profile, representing a significant contribution to soil remote sensing.

AB  - Autonomous precision landing of unmanned aerial vehicle can be widely used in ocean inspection, mine inspection and other industries. Vision based autonomous precision landing research can be used in global positioning system (GPS) denied area with low cost and high accuracy which has become a hot research spot. Previous vision-based methods cannot cope with complex environmental changes while landing and can not achieve real time in airborne processor. A lightweight detection model named Myolo is designed to detect landmark. Fast contour optimization algorithm is proposed to further enhance location results. Experimental results show that Myolo can achieve 16.1 FPS which is 23 times faster than faster-RCNN and 5 times faster than yolo. After using fast local contour optimization algorithm, Myolo's position accuracy is increased to 4.2 pixel, 12.5% higher than yolo and 50.6% higher than tiny-yolo. Myolo can significantly outperforms state-of-the-art object detection model in terms of both accuracy and speed in complex landing environment.

TI  - Contribution of free satellite time-series images to mapping plant communities in the Mediterranean Natura 2000 site: the example of Biguglia Pond in Corse (France)
T2  - MEDITERRANEAN BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping plant communities, which is essential to assess the conservation status of natural habitats, is currently based mainly on time-consuming field surveys without the use of satellite data. However, free image time-series with high spatial and temporal resolution have been available since 2015. This study assessed the contribution of Sentinel-2 time-series images to mapping the spatial distribution of 18 plant communities within a Natura 2000 site (1978 ha) located on the Mediterranean biogeographical region (Corsica, France). The method was based on random forest modeling of six Sentinel-2 images acquired from 26 February to 24 October 2017, which were calibrated and validated using a field vegetation map. The results showed that the 18 plant communities were modeled correctly, with 72% overall accuracy. The uncertainty map associated with the model indicated areas that required additional field observations.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - This research addresses the use of machine learning for detecting building footprints from dual-polarization multi-temporal SAR data. We assume that in SAR images, built-up areas exhibit very high backscattering values, making them brighter than other land cover classes in both the co- and cross-polarization channels. In addition the building class is considered to be stable in time. In this context, we propose to employ a convolutional neural network that integrates a set of SAR images of different dates and polarizations for delineating the building footprint. The algorithm was tested on Sentinel-1 datasets from eight different test sites located in Iraq. Four of the test sites along with their corresponding annotations (i.e. ground truth) constitute the training dataset, while the other four test sites are used for evaluation. All the datasets were provided in the framework of a humaritan AI4EO UNOSAT challenge launched in 2019 by Phi-Unet. The results evaluated by the F1 score with values of about 0.75 indicate that the proposed method is able to accurately detect the building footprint.

TI  - Ultra-high resolution remote sensing of northern boreal peatland vegetation and land cover
T2  - Suo (Helsinki)
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern boreal peatlands have fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in land cover and vegetation patterns. We produced ultra-high spatial resolution vegetation and land cover maps in three different peatland sites in Finnish Lapland, using drone data, aerial images and lidar data, as well as satellite imagery. Our study was divided into four sub-studies. First, we compared two different vegetation mapping approaches in Kaamanen mire: floristically defined plant communities and pre-defined land cover types. We found out that land cover type mapping has higher classification accuracy but plant communities show the fuzzy pattern of peatland vegetation more realistically. Second, we tested the data and resolution requirements in land cover mapping. According to the results, multiple different datasets at different scales are needed, including spectral and topographic features, and in order to achieve the highest accuracy, <= 0.5 m spatial resolution data should be used. Third, we evaluated how these mires (Kaamanen, Lompolojankka, Halssiaapa) differ structurally and vegetationally, and showed that there are notable differences between mires in how well vegetation patterns can be detected, what vegetation properties should be mapped and what the optimal remote sensing datasets are. Fourth, we assessed the relative benefit of hyperspectral drone data in detecting biomass and leaf-area index patterns in Halssiaapa mire. Hyperspectral data boosted somewhat the accuracy of the different models. Overall, accurate vegetation and land cover maps can be produced with drone and other remote sensing data, and different datasets and approaches should be tested and combined to find out the suitable methods at different study sites.

AB  - This paper presents first results of open ocean surface current retrieval in the satellite line-of-sight (LOS) direction using RADARSAT-2 along-track interferometry (ATI) over the expected track of the Gulf Stream (GS). Results are compared to measurements derived from NASA's Ocean Surface Current Analyses Real-time (OSCAR) dataset, which provides global near-surface ocean current estimates. Results show close spatial correspondence, and a RMS difference of approximately 21 cm/s was observed between the two estimates over the region identified as GS. However, due to its significantly higher spatial resolution, measurements obtained from RADARSAT-2 MODEX ScanSAR showed small scale surface current features that were entirely missed in the OSCAR dataset. This increased the RMS difference over the entire scene to approximately 50 cm/s.

TI  - GEOSPATIAL PLATFORMS AND IMMERSIVE TOOLS FOR SOCIAL COHESION: THE 4D NARRATIVE OF ARCHITECTURE OF AUSTRALIA'S AFGHAN CAMELEERS
T2  - VIRTUAL ARCHAEOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on examining the scope of virtual architectural archaeology in forms of digital geospatial platforms and immersive tools such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) to be used for achieving social cohesion, particularly in a multicultural and multi-ethnic society like Australia's. In the context of the current global and national concern about Muslims and Islam, as well as for the mistrust towards and distance between Muslims and Non-Muslims in Australia, it is imperative to delve deeper into the contribution of early Muslim pioneers, in this case, the Afghan Cameleers, in the social fabric of colonial Australia. Based on the premise that architecture could be a unique and revealing research frame to gain insight into human values, worldview and material culture, the main aim of this paper is to address two key issues using virtual architectural archaeology. Firstly, to demonstrate the application of 4D capturing and component-based modelling with metadata and paradata regarding the past of the lost architectural heritage sites in remote central and western Australia, also counting on assets such as Linked Open Data (LOD) for further dissemination and use. Secondly, to propose a mode to disseminate new knowledge through digital platforms and VR/AR experiences to the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) audiences and schools regarding the Muslims in Australia. Understanding properly them and their contribution to the Australian society would eventually minimise the cultural distance between Muslims and Non-Muslims in Australia. Greater awareness could mitigate the myth of fear and mistrust regarding Muslims and Islam, widely misunderstood for a long time.

TI  - An Intervention Science to Advance Underrepresented Perspectives and Indigenous Self-Determination in Health
T2  - PREVENTION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This concluding article to the Supplemental Issue on Promoting Health Equity through Rigorous, Culturally Informed Intervention Science: Innovations with Indigenous Populations in the United States draws themes and conclusions from the innovative practices implemented by the National Institutes of Health Intervention Research to Improve Native American Health (IRINAH) consortium. The IRINAH work highlights promising practices for advancing the diverse and underrepresented perspectives essential to develop and test culturally appropriate, effective health interventions in American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian settings. Four emergent themes appear through the IRINAH work. First, community-based participatory research (CBPR) has provided projects an intersectional worldview for bridging cultures and informing an ethics of local control. Second, culture is fundamental as a central organizing principle in IRINAH research and intervention implementation. Third, crucial demands for sustainability of interventions in Indigenous intervention science require a rethinking of the intervention development process. Finally, tensions persist in Indigenous health research, even as significant strides are made in the field. These themes collectively inform an ethical and rigorous Indigenous intervention science. Collectively, they suggest a roadmap for advancing Indigenous perspectives and self-determination in health intervention research. IRINAH studies are leading innovation in intervention science by advancing applications of CBPR in intervention science, promoting new directions in small populations health research, and demonstrating value of participatory team science.

TI  - NEW VEGETATION INDICES FOR FULL AND COMPACT POLARIMETRIC SAR DATA: IN PREPARATION FOR THE RADARSAT CONSTELLATION MISSION (RCM)

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Latin American GRSS and ISPRS Remote Sensing Conference (LAGIRS)
CL  - Santiago, CHILE
AB  - In this paper, we present two radar vegetation indices for full-pol and compact-pol SAR data, respectively. Both are derived using the notion of a geodesic distance between observation and well-known scattering models available in the literature. While the ftill-pol version depends on a generalized volume scattering model, the compact-pol version uses the ideal depolariser to model the randomness in the vegetation. We have utilized the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) time-series data from the SAMPVEXI6-MB campaign in the Manitoba region of Canada for comparing and assessing the indices in terms of the change in the biophysical parameters as well, The compact-pol data for comparison is simulated from the full-pol RCM time series. Both the indices show better performance at correlating with biophysical parameters such as Plant Area Index (PAO and Volumetric Water Content (VWC) for wheat and soybean crops, in comparison to the state-of-art Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) of Kim and van Zyl. These indices are timely for the upcoming release of the data from the RCM, which will provide data in both full and compact-pol modes, aimed at better crop monitoring from space.

TI  - Novel Techniques for Built-Up Area Extraction From Polarimetric SAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Built-up (BU) area extraction from remote sensing images is important to monitor and manage urbanization and industrialization. In this letter, we propose two BU area extraction techniques based on the analysis of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data. Both methods exploit the geodesic distance on the unit sphere in the space of Kennaugh matrices. The first method is based on the three dominant scattering types in the scene and compares them with scattering models; if any of them matches with BU type elementary scattering models, then the pixel is said to belong to a BU area. The second method is based on a novel PolSAR BU index (RBUI) composed by considering scattering mechanisms from BU structures. The two proposed techniques are validated on two different urban scenes, one acquired at C-band by RADARSAT-2 and other at L-band by ALOS-2 SAR sensors.

TI  - Mapping Land Cover Change over a 25-Year Period (1993-2018) in Sri Lanka Using Landsat Time-Series
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover change (LULCC) are dynamic over time and space due to human and biophysical factors. Accurate and up-to-date LULCC information is a mandatory part of environmental change analysis and natural resource management. In Sri Lanka, there is a significant temporal gap in the existing LULCC information due to the civil war that took place from 1983 to 2009. In order to fill this gap, this study presents a whole-country LULCC map for Sri Lanka over a 25-year period using Landsat time-series imagery from 1993 to 2018. The LandTrendr change detection algorithm, utilising the normalised burn ratio (NBR) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), was used to develop spectral trajectories over this time period. A land cover change and disturbance map was created with random forest, using 2117 manually interpreted reference pixels, of which 75% were used for training and 25% for validation. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 94.14%. The study found that 890,003.52 hectares (ha) (13.5%) of the land has changed, while 72,266.31 ha (1%) was disturbed (but not permanently changed) over the last 25 years. LULCC was found to concentrate on two distinct periods (2000 to 2004 and 2010 to 2018) when social and economic stability allowed greater land clearing and investment opportunities. In addition, LULCC was found to impact forest reserves and protected areas. This new set of Sri Lanka-wide land cover information describing change and disturbance may provide a reference point for policy makers and other stakeholders to aid in decision making and for planning purposes.

AB  - In today's world, many applications require satellite images, but resolution is the major weakness of these images. Many researchers have initiated to determine the resolution problem by using transform domain methods like Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), SWT&DWT and proposed method which integrates DWT, SWT & Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT) that is implemented to overcome the resolution problem of mentioned images. In all these methods, the low resolution (LR) image is broken down into four sub-band images namely Low-Low (LL), Low-High (LH), High-Low (HL) and High-High (HH). The Bi-Cubic Interpolation factor 2 is used on high-frequency sub-band images for resizing the sub-band images. Resolutions of images are enhanced by applying Inverse Transform. For comparison of transform domain methods, the satellite images- LANDSAT8, LANDSAT7 and LANDSAT5 are used in this paper. Objective of the proposed method is to integrate the features of IWT, DWT and SWT in order to improve the resolution. The results demonstrate the supremacy of the suggested method. The Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Time in seconds (s) provide improved result by using the proposed technique.

TI  - Whose Voice Do We Hear in the Marketplace? Evidence from Consumer Complaining Behavior
T2  - MARKETING SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Consumer voice has increasingly become a major factor in the marketplace through consumer complaints, but little is known about who chooses to complain and how complainants compare with consumers of the product. Any differences in complaint rates across groups can reflect either different propensities to complain or different consumer experiences, making it difficult to assess the degree of self-selection. I utilize a set of law enforcement actions to separate these two explanations by comparing characteristics of complaining consumers to those of victims, and I find much lower complaint rates in heavily minority areas compared with nonminority areas, relative to their respective victimization rates. I find evidence against information-based accounts for why victims from minority areas are less likely to complain and in favor of explanations related to lower levels of trust or general social capital. I then provide a statistical weighting approach to remedy the problem of self-selection and apply it to develop an implied victimization rate using complaints from the Consumer Sentinel database.

AB  - The aim of this study is to compare and analyze the accuracy of freely available global DEMs. Four DEMs generated using optical and SAR satellite imagery - ASTER GDEM, SRTM DEM, ALOS AW3D30, Tandem-X 90m - were analyzed over the territories of four U.S. states (approximately 927000 km(2)) that are characterized by different morphologies and land covers. The accuracy assessment procedure was implemented within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, designed to manage and analyze Geo Big Data. The outcomes highlight a good agreement among the statistical parameters at a global level for each wide area analyzed. The accuracy, as expected, decreases with the increase of the slopes, and ALOS AW3D30 displays the overall best performance, with an accuracy ranging between 2.5 m in flat areas and about 10 m in hilly/mountainous areas.

TI  - Instrument Data Metrics Evaluator for Tradespace Analysis of Earth Observing Constellations
T2  - 2020 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE (AEROCONF 2020)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Aerospace Conference
CL  - Big Sky, MT
AB  - There is currently a trend towards developing and commissioning satellite constellation missions, which has necessitated tradespace studies to design high-performance, low cost and low risk constellations. An open-source software tool called Tradespace Analysis Tool for Constellations (TAT-C) has been developed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, which aims to facilitate pre-phase A mission studies by generating and optimizing the tradespace of the constellations, involving a multitude of possibly coupled parameters such as orbits, satellites, launchers, ground-stations, and instruments. The performance attributes investigated by TAT-C are instrument data metrics, coverage metrics, cost and risk. While previous research has explored optimization of the constellation satellite orbits using metrics associated with coverage (such as maximizing access duration, maximizing the number of revisits over a region), there is relatively less work on exploring the tradespace of instrument parameters and associated data metrics. Previous research has also used relatively rudimentary data-metrics such as imaged pixel resolutions, range, and angles at which observations are made. This paper describes the instrument datametrics evaluator of TAT-C which generates more sophisticated data metrics characteristic of the instrument type. The basic concept and the architecture of the evaluator have been developed to accommodate instruments without assuming specifics about the underlying technology. In this paper, we describe the modeling of the two most common types of Earth Observing instruments, namely passive optical sensors and synthetic aperture radars (SARs). The models allow for evaluation of commonly used data-metrics such as the signal to noise ratio, noise equivalent delta temperature, ground-pixel resolutions, dynamic range, noise-equivalent sigma0, etc. The challenges in making the models generic enough for wide usage, while being able to appropriately mimic characteristics of complex real-world instruments, are described using examples such as the Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor and Operational Land Imager. Lastly, we present results from the instrument data metrics evaluator for three important use cases of mission design with passive-optical sensors and SARs. The first use case explores the tradespace of Sun-Synchronous Orbits from a perspective of data-metrics as opposed to commonly considered coverage metrics. The second use case explores the tradespace of SAR parameters and highlights quantitative trade-offs between instrument parameters influencing the performance, size, and complexity. Such tradespace analysis allows the user to appreciate and consider a fundamental constraint on the SAR antenna size depending on radar frequency. In the last use case, we explore the tradespace of pushbroom vs whiskbroom scanners, and evaluate the conditions under which their performance match.

M3  - Article
AB  - Simulation of distributed space missions (DSMs) for the purpose of phase-A mission design studies and general tradespace analysis is computationally challenging owing to the necessity of evaluating thousands of architecture options. Machine learning and evolutionary optimization methods have enabled intelligent search of the architectural tradespace of DSMs, including spacecraft and instrument design specifications. A critical computational bottleneck in evaluating architectures is the ability to rapidly simulate orbits of many DSMs with varying parameters for global earth observation and compare their coverage-related performance. When design variables include heterogeneous payload types and characteristics, orbital characteristics, areas of interest, and user constraints, the parameter space may be in thousands. In this article, we describe the difficulty of coverage calculations for narrow field of view (FOV) and conical FOV sensors, and propose a novel algorithm, called quick search and correction (QSC), to overcome it. We also propose new temporal evaluation metrics to characterize the coverage performance of DSMs, as well as a uniform random sampling technique for fast evaluation of overall performance of DSMs. Performance of the proposed methods and metrics are verified on an example Landsat-derived DSM, showing similar to 100x improvement in computational speed due to the QSC algorithm and similar to 10-250x due to the sampling technique.

AB  - The utility of aerial imagery (Satellite, Drones) has become an invaluable information source for cross-disciplinary applications, especially for crisis management. Most of the mapping and tracking efforts are manual which is resource-intensive and often lead to delivery delays. Deep Learning methods have boosted the capacity of relief efforts via recognition, detection, and are now being used for non-trivial applications. However the data commonly available is highly imbalanced (similar to other real-life applications) which severely hampers the neural network's capabilities, this reduces robustness and trust. We give an overview on different kinds of techniques being used for handling such extreme settings and present solutions aimed at maximizing performance on minority classes using a diverse set of methods (ranging from architectural tuning to augmentation) which as a combination generalizes for all minority classes. We hope to amplify cross-disciplinary efforts by enhancing model reliability.

T2  - HUMAN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since it was first recognized as a disease entity more than two centuries ago, advanced melanoma has, until recently, followed a very aggressive and almost universally fatal clinical course. However, over the past 50 years crucial ground breaking research has greatly enhanced our understanding of the etiology, risk factors, genomic pathogenesis, immunological interactions, prognostic features and management of melanoma. It is this combined body of work which has culminated in the exciting improvements in patient outcomes for those with advanced melanoma over the last ten years. In this the 50th anniversary of Human Pathology, we highlight the key developments in melanoma over this period. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Radioguided Parathyroid Surgery
T2  - REVISTA ORL
M3  - Article
AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism is the main cause of hypercalcemia in outpatients. It is caused in 85-90 % of cases by a solitary adenoma. Radioguided surgery (RGS) is a minimally invasive surgical technique that uses radiopharmaceutical drugs to facilitate the location and removal of benign or malignant lesions. Radioguided parathyroid surgery (RGPS), as a GOSTT (Guided intraOperative Scintigraphic Tumor Targeting) technique and minimally invasive, requires a diagnostic imaging test to anatomically locate the lesion and establish its functional behavior. The MIBI-99mTc is the tracer of choice, and should always include tomographic studies, especially the SPECT-CT. This radiotracer is used during the RGPS together with intraoperative probes, gammacameras and portable SPECT devices, navigation tools and laparoscopic robotic systems. The RGPS reduces surgical time, hospital costs and patient morbidity with high effectiveness and efficiency.

TI  - Using Conceptual Models to Relate Multiparameter Satellite Data to Subsurface Volcanic Processes in Latin America
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data have been extensively used to identify volcanic behavior. However, the physical subsurface processes causing any individual manifestation of activity can be ambiguous. We propose a classification scheme for the cause of unrest that simultaneously considers three multiparameter satellite observations. The scheme is based on characteristics of the volcanic system (open, closed, and eruptive) and unrest mechanisms (intrusion, evolution, and withdrawal) occurring at shallow depths in the volcanic system. We applied these models to satellite observations acquired at 47 of the most active volcanoes in Latin America. Of the volcanoes studied, 44 had a robust enough dataset for classification and were clustered into 4 groups and 10 subgroups with common behavioral characteristics. By identifying that these volcanoes can be clustered into a number of groupings significantly less than the number of volcanoes, we have demonstrated that commonalities in behavior patterns exist among diverse volcanic systems. Identifying volcanoes with similar characteristics underpins the use of past observations at one volcano to forecast activity at another and diverges from typical volcanic groupings, which are focused on geologic parameters (i.e., composition, volcano type, and tectonic setting). Based on satellite data alone, we have identified preeruptive intrusion prior to 15 eruptions at 12 different volcanoes, magma evolution prior to 18 eruptions at 13 volcanoes, and magma withdrawal at 3 eruptions and 3 volcanoes. Improvements to the spatial and temporal resolution are needed to make these relations robust. This classification scheme provides a framework for future automated clustering of volcanoes.

M3  - Article
AB  - Thanks to their ability to generate ecosystem services, forest ecosystems have a significant social, economic and environmental impact on the development of many regions in the world, especially those located in urban and peri-urban areas. Today, increased forest vulnerability is reflected in an increased number of episodes of severe decline associated mainly with drought. In this context, the Mediterranean area shows high forest vulnerability and a subsequent decline in its natural renewal rate. In this scenario, the aim of this research is to assess the sustainability of a protected pristine deciduous oak forest near Rome via the development of a forest health condition monitoring tool based on the application of multispectral satellite data and the identification of silvicultural models suitable to promoting natural forest renewal. Data and results from research in the case study area, the Natural State Reserve of Castelporziano (Rome), have potential as an important decision making tool in sustainable forest management.

AB  - Thanks to their ability to produce ecosystem services, forest ecosystems have a significant social, economic and environmental impact on the development of many regions in the world, especially when located in urban and peri-urban areas.Today, increased forest vulnerability is being reflected in a larger number of severe decline episodes associated mainly with drought. In this context, the Mediterranean area shows high forest vulnerability and a subsequent decline in its natural renewal rate.In this scenario, the aim of the present research is to assess sustainability of a protected pristine deciduous oak forest near Rome, developing a forest health condition monitoring tool based on the application of multispectral satellite data, and through the identification of silvicultural models appropriate for promoting natural forest renewal.The preliminary results of this research indicate how the exclusion of wildlife through fenced areas significantly favors the natural renewal of the forest, especially when silvicultural actions such as thinning are carried out. It has also been ascertained through the use of multispectral satellite data that there is a widespread decline in the health vegetative state of the deciduous oak surfaces, due to a widespread senescence of the forest. In the addressed study area, the Natural State Reserve of Castelporziano (Rome), data and results from this research can work as an important decision tool for sustainable forest management.

TI  - Igneous Rock Associations 27. Chalcophile and Platinum Group Elements In the Columbia River Basalt Group: A Model for Flood Basalt Lavas
T2  - GEOSCIENCE CANADA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Columbia River Basalt Group is the youngest and best preserved continental Large Igneous Province on Earth. The 210,000 km(3) of basaltic lavas were erupted between 16.6 and 5 Ma in the Pacific Northwest, USA. The peak of the eruptions occurred over a 700,000-year period when nearly 99% of the basalts consisting of the Steens, Imnaha, Picture Gorge, Grande Ronde and Wanapum Basalts were emplaced. In this study we examined the Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) Pt and Pd, and the chalcophile elements Cu and Zn in the Columbia River Basalt Group. The presence of Pt, Pd and Cu in the compositionally primitive Lower Steens, Imnaha and Picture Gorge Basalts suggests that the Columbia River Basalt Group magma was a fertile source for these elements. The PGEs are contained mainly in sulphides in the earliest formations based on their correlation with immiscible sulphides, sulphide minerals and chalcophile elements. Grande Ronde, Wanapum and Saddle Mountains Basalts are depleted in PGEs and chalcophile elements compared to earlier formations. Sulphur was saturated in many flows and much of it probably came from assimilation of cratonic rock from a thinned lithosphere. We propose a model where the presence or absence of PGEs and chalcophile elements results primarily from the interaction between an advancing plume head and the crust/lithosphere that it encountered. The early lavas erupted from a plume that had little interaction with the crust/lithosphere and were fertile. However, as the plume head advanced northward, it assimilated crustal/lithospheric material and PGE and chalcophile elements were depleted from the magma. What little PGE and chalcophile elements remained in the compositionally evolved and depleted Grande Ronde Basalt flows mainly were controlled by substitution in basalt minerals and not available for inclusion in sulphides.

T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Bom Jardim de Goias region, the Transbrasiliano Lineament shows evidence of a fault reactivation along NE-SW structures (main direction) and secondary directions related to subsequent events. To study the structural framework and reactivation inputs toward tectonic events, distinctive features of the northern Parana Basin border were analyzed by integrating gamma spectrometry and radar data, both supported by field research. The remote sensing database obtained by the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) sensor allowed detecting lineaments and morphometric derivatives. Besides, the developed morphogenetic process images attest to the importance of structural control on relief evolution while concentrating lineaments as a function of lithological and geomorphological domains. Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry data processing focused on K-d (Anomalous Potassium) and F-Parameter indices. In this context, the fuzzy logic and Index Overlay Method allowed multivalued integration that indicated hydrothermal products and weathering processes correlated with K-d and F-Parameter anomalies. Thus, the joint interpretation of lineaments, geomorphological domains, and K-d/F-Parameter anomalies allowed differentiating primary geological elements and products from surface dynamics, directly or indirectly related to tectonic reactivation processes.

AB  - The detection and quantification of conflict through remote sensing modalities represents a challenging but crucial aspect of human rights monitoring. In this work we demonstrate how utilizing multi-modal data sources can help build a comprehensive picture of conflict and human displacement, using the Rohingya conflict in the state of Rakhine, Myanmar as a case study.We show that time series analysis of fire detections from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) can reveal anomalous spatial and temporal distributions of fires related to conflict. This work also shows that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter and coherence data can detect the razing and burning of buildings and village, even in cloudy conditions. These techniques may be further developed in the fixture to enable the monitoring and detection of signals originating from types of conflict.

AB  - In order to overcome the disadvantage that traditional multi-channel SAR systems are only sensitive to the radial velocities of moving targets, a variable-boresight mode has been proposed, whose kernel is to detect and estimate the velocity component of the azimuth velocity at two nodes. For purpose of improving the estimation accuracy of the azimuth velocity, we introduce more nodes with different squint angles, so as to obtain more velocity components to carry out the estimation by the least square method. Considering that only few tiny angles can be ignored, while introducing more nodes are likely to bring about nonnegligible squint angles, the previously used signal processing suitable for side-looking mode is modified. Finally, numerical experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) changed the management and delivery of Landsat products to the public in its archive through the implementation of Collections. The Collections process ensures consistent data quality through time and across all the Landsat sensors with a few modifications to the metadata. The consistent data products from Collections are more conducive for applications such as time-series analysis, because the data can be used without a need for sensor-specific geometric or radiometric adjustments. The Collections process also allows for calibration improvements from updated reference sources, model trending, and enhanced algorithms that are grouped together and applied at one time, thus limiting the operational impacts to users. The first collection, Collection-1 was released in 2016, and Collection-2 is expected to be released in 2020. This paper addresses the geometric improvements to the Collection -2 dataset.Geometric improvements in Collection-2 include improvements to the geometric accuracy and interoperability of all Landsat products by implementing the Sentinel 2 Global Reference Image (GRI), improved elevation dataset using NASADEM and other sources of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for terrain correction, improvements to the precision correction process for Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus ( ETM+) and Thematic Mapper (TM) sensors, changes to the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) to Operational Land Imager (OLI) alignment estimates, thermal band detector alignments and focal plane adjustments for ETM+, and improvements to the ETM+ sensor to attitude control system (ACS).

AB  - Through literature research and field investigation, this paper attempts to study the distribution, morphology and the typification of the visual and perceptual stone inscription in Wuyi-Gugok of China. The results are as follows: First, there are 350 stone inscriptions in total from the 1st Gok to 9th Gok in Wuyi-Gugok.Second, according to the analysis of the stone inscription distribution, 74(21.2%) stone inscriptions in the 5th Gok, 67(19.2%) in the 6th Gok, 65(18.6%) in the 1st Gok, 60(17.2%) in the 2nd Gok and 53(15.2%) in the 4th Gok are confirmed. The above five Goks contain 319(91.1%) stone inscriptions, so they have rich cultural landscape.Third, according to the survey, the number of the stone inscriptions existed in the Sugwangseok of the 1st Gok are 41(22.6%), in the Homagan of Cheonyubong of the 6th Gok are 29(8.3%), in the Jesiam of the 4th Gok are 23(6.6%), in the Nyeongam of the 2nd Gok are 22(6.3%), in the Hyangseongam of the 6th Gok are 21(6%), in the Unwa of the 5th Gok are 19(5.4%), in the Bokhoam of the 5th Gok are 18(5.1%), in the Eunbyeongbong of the 5th Gok are 17(4.9%), in the Daejangbong of the 4th Gok are 14(4%), in the Daewangbong of the 1st Gok and the Geumgokam of the 4th Gok are 12(3.4%). Thus, a total of 228 (65.1%) stone inscriptions are concentrated in these 11 sites, which represent the popularity and cultural value of these rocks.Fourth, the stone inscription of Wuyi-Gugok, praising the landform and topographical geological landscape of Mount Wuyi, mainly describe the scenic name of each Gok related to Zhu Xi's Gugok culture, appreciate Zhu Xi's tracks and the stone inscription in the sacred land of Neo-Confucianism culture, and also record the Confucian edification of mencius thoughts, Muigun(武夷君) and the myths and legends related to the site names of Wuyi mountain, which can remind people of the worldview of the celestial paradise where the gods live and the fairyland of the land of peach blossoms. In addition, it indicates that the historical and cultural landscape, which is full of colorful history and myths and legends, including allusions related to Confucian, buddhist and Taoist celebrities and the ancestor ancient things related to traditional culture of China is very diverse.Fifth, the results of the classification, based on the content of the stone inscription in Wuyi-Gugok, are classified as the scenery name inscription, the praise scene inscription, the recording travel inscription, the recording event inscription, the philosophy inscription, the expressing emotion inscription, the religion inscription, the inscription for auspiciousness, the slogan and expressing ambition inscription and the official document notice inscription, among which there are 102(29.1%) praise scene inscriptions, 93(26.6%) scenery name inscriptions and 61(17.4%) recording travel inscriptions. The stone inscriptions of Wuyi-Gugok have the characteristics of the special emphasis on scenery names, landscape praise and commemorative tours.Sixth, the analysis of the intertext between the ｢Figure of Wuyi-Gugok｣ and Wuyi-Gugok rock letters, in the study found that the method of propagation between media was mostly the method of propagation of quotations and maintained intermedia through extension, repetition, extension, and compression.

AB  - Discriminating between vegetation and non-vegetation areas is of crucial importance in the study of mangroves. This will help mangrove monitoring and management since losses and degradation of the mangroves are reported to be substantial in recent years. This study investigates the integration of Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) as a tool to discriminate vegetation covers in the mangrove forest. High resolution remotely sensed images from Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT-6 and SPOT-7) satellite, with 1.5 m spatial resolution over the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) was acquired. A complete ground-truthing was conducted at the preliminary stages of land cover classification. A Moran's I analysis shows a random pattern of ground-truthing; (Kuala Sepetang; p-value = 0.219; Kuala Trong, p-value = 0.163; Sungai Kerang, p-value = 0.159). Since SAVI requires a suitable L-factor to be used to distinguish the vegetation areas, four different L-factors viz. 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 were tested, and the multiple linear regressions, using the stepwise regression method of backward elimination, found that the L-factor 0.75 was significant to be used for MMFR. A correlation analysis conducted between the results of NDVI, SAVI and supervised classification shows a high significant relationship, especially between NDVI and SAVI (0.991) at 99.99% level. This shows that NDVI and SAVI are useful analyses that can be employed to improve the accuracy of classification in the mangroves.

AB  - This thesis sets out to compare Charles Baudelaire and Jang-Hwan Oh, who beautifully portrayed melancholy as an aspect of the aesthetic modernity of metropolises in modern capitalist society. This thesis uses concepts derived from psychoanalytic theorists to analyze melancholy. As a result of comparing the melancholy of Baudelaire and Oh, the following conclusions were drawn. First, in their poems, melancholy manifested as the impossibility of salvation in the Christian worldview was a common theme. Second, in their poems, melancholy caused by poverty was common in modern capitalist society. Next, the differences in their melancholy were as follows. First, Baudelaire characterized melancholy as a decline in Christian ideals in the modern capitalist society, while Oh perceived melancholy as a fall of Confucian ideals in colonial Joseon. Second, while Baudelaire highlighted the art for art’s sake principle as the sublimation of melancholy, Oh focused on revolutionism as a way of overcoming melancholy. In conclusion, the melancholy of Baudelaire and Oh was primarily caused by the mother’s hatred for her son. However, their melancholy was also a form of social melancholy caused by modern capitalism and metropolitanization. History revealed as the absent cause had an influence on their melancholy in the political unconsciousness.

TI  - Combining Multiband Remote Sensing and Hierarchical Distance Sampling to Establish Drivers of Bird Abundance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on habitat preferences is critical for the successful conservation of endangered species. For many species, especially those living in remote areas, we currently lack this information. Time and financial resources to analyze habitat use are limited. We aimed to develop a method to describe habitat preferences based on a combination of bird surveys with remotely sensed fine-scale land cover maps. We created a blended multiband remote sensing product from SPOT 6 and Landsat 8 data with a high spatial resolution. We surveyed populations of three bird species (Yellow-breasted Bunting Emberiza aureola, Ochre-rumped Bunting Emberiza yessoensis, and Black-faced Bunting Emberiza spodocephala) at a study site in the Russian Far East using hierarchical distance sampling, a survey method that allows to correct for varying detection probability. Combining the bird survey data and land cover variables from the remote sensing product allowed us to model population density as a function of environmental variables. We found that even small-scale land cover characteristics were predictable using remote sensing data with sufficient accuracy. The overall classification accuracy with pansharpened SPOT 6 data alone amounted to 71.3%. Higher accuracies were reached via the additional integration of SWIR bands (overall accuracy = 73.21%), especially for complex small-scale land cover types such as shrubby areas. This helped to reach a high accuracy in the habitat models. Abundances of the three studied bird species were closely linked to the proportion of wetland, willow shrubs, and habitat heterogeneity. Habitat requirements and population sizes of species of interest are valuable information for stakeholders and decision-makers to maximize the potential success of habitat management measures.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microglandular adenosis (MGA) is a rare benign proliferative lesion lacking a myoepithelial cell layer; 27% of all reported cases have progressed to invasive carcinoma. Salivary gland-type carcinomas of the breast are also uncommon, representing 2% of all breast cancers. This wide spectrum of neoplasms tends to be triple negative and generally has an excellent prognosis. Given the rarity of salivary gland-type carcinomas of the breast arising from MGA, there are few reports of these cases in literature. As such, there is uncertainty regarding their diagnosis and treatment strategies.PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report the rare case of a 66-year-old woman who presented with a triple negative, invasive carcinoma with salivary gland-type features, arising from MGA. The patient underwent mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by Taxotere and Cyclophosphamide (TC) chemotherapy and 50 Gy in 25 fractions of radiation to her chest wall. We reviewed the available literature on salivary gland-type breast carcinomas arising from MGA.DISCUSSION: Despite the generally unfavourable characteristics associated with carcinoma arising in microglandular adenosis (MGACA), most patients with MGACA have favourable outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present case and reviewed cases are consistent with the literature on MGA, atypical MGA (AMGA), and MGACA. Future study of this rare entity is warranted to establish a consensus surrounding its clinical significance and treatment methods.

CL  - Bogor, INDONESIA
AB  - The impact of forest and land fires on the atmospheric environment can be classified into three components, namely ambient air quality, its contribution to greenhouse gases, and microclimate change. Each component has a different method for assessing and measuring the magnitude of its impact. The aim of the study is to obtain quantitative methods to assess the magnitude of the impact of forest and land fires on the atmospheric environment so that they can be used for the valuation of environmental losses. The magnitude of the impact of the air quality component is measured based on the Air Pollution Index (ISPU) and visibility, the component of the greenhouse gas is assessed by approaching the amount of GHG emissions and / or loss of carbon stocks, while changes in the microclimate by assessing changes in the level of thermal comfort. Gas and particulate emissions values of forest and land fires use the carbon mass balance approach and emission factors. Analysis of air pollution dispersion is conducted use the Gaussian model, with case study is the incidence of land fires in oil palm plantations located in Kayuagung sub-district, Ogan Komering Ilir Regency, South Sumatra Province in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The data used in this study consisted of Landsat 8 satellite imagery, MODIS and VIIRS Hotspots, measurements of vegetation biomass in the field, organic C-peat and climate data during fires. The results of the assessment show that land fires covering 551 ha in 2015, 59 ha in 2016 and 253 ha in 2018 have resulted in changes in the air pollutant standard index in Kayuagung from the medium category (ISPU PM10 = 75) to very unhealthy (ISPU PM10 = 272) in 2015, unhealthy (ISPU CO = 116) in 2016 and very unhealthy (ISPU CO = 205) in 2018. Visibility in an area of about 500-600 meters in the direction of the wind from the fire's location was less than 1 km with PM10 of more than 176 mu g m(-3). The contribution of GHGs to each fire's year is 26.8, 2.8 and 12.3 kilo tons of CO(2)e consist of CO2 and CH4. The results of this study can be used to quantify the magnitude of the land fires impact on the atmospheric environment.

AB  - Indonesia is a country with vast agricultural lands. However, agricultural land production in Indonesia is threatened by climate change and land use change. One of phenomenon from climate change that threatened agricultural land is El Nino. El Nino can cause long-lasting drought. In 2018, Indonesia Ministry of Agriculture predicted that in the middle of 2019, El Nino would occur in Indonesia. Magetan Regency is one of the regencies in East Java Province that has a high level of vulnerability to drought. Magetan Regency ranked 36 in Indonesia as a Drought-Prone Regency. Drought in the agricultural sector is a drought which is one of the direct impacts of the climate change phenomenon. This research aims to identify dry areas in agricultural land using Normalized Difference Drought Index and Landsat 8 Imagery with acquisition month August 2017 (Normal Year) and 2019 (El Nino Year). The results of data processing revealed that the dry areas in 2019 are wider than dry areas in 2017 with extent area of 3350.26 ha in 2017 and 9237.28 ha in 2019.

AB  - In 2015, all United Nations (UN) Member States adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Agenda provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and for the planet, considering our current situation and helping to create a plan. The core of this agenda is a set of seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which represent an urgent call for action by all countries - both developed and developing - in a global partnership. The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Systems Engineering Office (SEO) team has recently developed and released a set of innovative notebooks addressing UN SDGs 6.6.1 (spatial extents of water-related ecosystems), 11.3.1 (ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate), and 15.3.1 (proportion of land that is degraded over total land area). These notebooks empower users by providing features that will assist with streamlining analysis ready data retrieval, processing, and visualization. The main contributions in this paper are: (1) briefly describing the framework of the UN SDG notebooks, (2) enumerating the notebooks' salient features, and (3) discussing current limitations and proposing approaches to overcome these limitations.

AB  - A novel SAR-AIS data association technique is proposed consistent with being used in dense shipping environments, where association of SAR and MS datasets is non-trivial and SAR false alarm rates are typically high. A ship classification model based on transfer learning classifies ship types in SAR imagery. The classification results are subsequently used in the SAR-AIS data association, which uses a rank-ordered assignment technique. The methodology is validated using a Sentinel-1 SAR product and terrestrial-based MS product acquired from the Gulf Coast, USA. Results show optimal data association which is improved using class (i.e. ship type) information.

AB  - Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is an important indicator of vegetation growth status and ecosystems health. NPP can be estimated through remote sensing data, using vegetation indices such as NDVI. However, this index may show systematic differences when using several orbital sensors. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to compare the NDVI. data obtained from different sensors and evaluate the impact over the soybean biomass and NPP estimates. NDVI data were recorded from 4 sensors, one on the field and others 3 orbitals sensors (Landsat 8/OLI Sentinel 2/MSI and Terra/MODIS). Measured data on the field, Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and Dry Matter (DM), were used to modeling the total DM and also NPP. The NDVI data from different sensors showed differences throughout the cycle, but compared to the reference data there was a correlation greater than 0.84. The DM presented a correlation of 0.91 with the field measured MS data while the NPP presented differences of up to 240 gC/m'/month from in relation to the reference data. Therefore, NDVI obtained from multiple sensors can be used to estimate NPP for surface analysis. However, for more consistent evaluations, a function of adjustment between the NDVI sensor data and NDVI reference data is required, so that the NPP estimation be better correlated to the actual data.

AB  - BACKGROUND Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the most important arbovirus vectors in the world.OBJECTIVES This study aimed to investigate and compare the infestation pattern of these species in a neighbourhood of Recife, Brazil, endemic for arboviruses in 2005 (T1) and 2013 (T2). METHODS Infestation, distribution and relative abundance of these sympatric species were recorded by egg collection using a network of 59 sentinel ovitraps (s-ovt) at fixed sampling stations for 12 months in T1 and T2.FINDINGS A permanent occupation pattern was detected which was characterised by the presence of egg-laying females of one or both species with a high ovitrap positivity index (94.3 to 100%) throughout both years analysed. In terms of abundance, the total of eggs collected was lower (p < 0.005) in T2 (146,153) than in T1 (281,103), although ovitraps still displayed a high index of positivity. The spatial distribution showed the presence of both species in 65.1% of the 148 s-ovt assessed, while a smaller number of traps exclusively contained Ae. aegypti (22%) or Ae. albopictus (13.2%) eggs.MAIN CONCLUSIONS Our comparative analysis demonstrated the robustness of the spatial occupation and permanence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus populations in this endemic urban area.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: to analyse the vision of the world that the young school children of a municipality of the northeast region of Piaui, Brazil have based on their reality. Method: qualitative, exploratory, conducted between April and September of 2016, with 10 mothers and 10 adolescents between 12 and 15 years old, from the sixth year of elementary school. The data collection included semi-structured interview; home visit and free observation in the interval between the classes; the analysis of the maps and association tree of ideas of Spink. Results: they need spaces and leisure like playing, cycling and playing football. They feel their parents' absence; many do not live in the same house or work all day. We have seen the school as a space for socialization, but it does not offer activities for this purpose. Conclusion: the need for leisure, play and an ambience for these activities were highlighted and interfere with the promotion of adolescent health.

AB  - Pasture and croplands play an important role in Brazil's economic and political scenarios, once its PIS (Raw Internal Product) is mainly based on what is exported from the rural production, such as meat and soybean, and government, with its regulations, is partresponsible for the establishment and maintaining of the conditions so that the trades can go well. In addition, these two types of land use correspond together to aprox. one third of the country extension. Moreover, frequently lands occupation is subject of discussion concerning its potential use for the reason of conflicts including Brazilian traditional communities, landless people and big farmers. Considering it, mapping pasture and croplands accurately is crucial for the country administration, in both economic and political spheres. Certainly, remote sensing is the very manner to tackle this issue, although this may not be an easy task due to the spectral similarity between these patterns. This work, hence, aims to distinct pasture from croplands in an experimental subset area of Brazilian Cerrado biome, using remote sensing metric images derived from one-year time series of the Landsat 8 products. In order to achieve this goal, we utilized six bands of the OLI sensor and calculated seven metrics, attaining a compiled dataset with 42 layers. We performed an object-based supervised classification with the Random Forest algorithm, considering both spectral and geometrical attributes. Results showed global accuracy of 80%, with Kappa index of 0.6, and the potential time series have in separating targets spectrally similar.

AB  - In the last decades, the Brazilian Cerrado biome has undergone major transformations due to the expansion of the agricultural frontier, The region called MATOPIBA acronym for states Maranhao, Tocantins, Piaui, and Bahia can be considered very attractive for agricultural expansion. The Cerrado predominates in the MATOPIBA region (91% of the area), also having small areas of the Amazon and Caatinga biomes to the northeast and east, respectively, In this work, we will present a study to identify center pivot irrigation systems in the MATOPIBA region using remote sensing images from Landsat-8 satellite. The methodology is based on the use of robust edge detection techniques such as Canny, Circular Hough Transform (CHT) and time series extraction through the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product MOD13Q1 which has two vegetation indices NDVI and EVI. These time series will be used to filter the detected circles, seeking to eliminate the circles that do not correspond to center pivots. Our approach detected 80% of the center pivots mapped by the Brazilian National Water Agency (ANA) used as a knowledge base. The states with better detection were Piaui. and Bahia that showed the accuracy of 90% and 85% respectively, Maranhao obtained 57% and Tocantins 41%.

TI  - A CONTRIBUTION FROM THE AFRICAN CULTURAL PHILOSOPHY TOWARDS A HARMONIOUS COEXISTENCE IN PLURALISTIC SOCIETIES
T2  - PENSAMIENTO
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive review of the African cultural philosophy. The aim of the study is to focus on identifying the elements present in the African ontology and epistemology which may contribute towards the consecution of a harmonious coexistence in the increasing plurality of today society. Based on an understanding of reality in which everything dwells in complementarity, interdependence and mutuality, the African worldview approaches difference and particularity as opportunities for mutual growth and cooperation. The acknowledgement of such an intimate mutual relatedness among all human groups which form a given society is the African key to understand the process towards coexistence. This sheds light on the understanding of social dialogue, the peace-building processes, and the means for the resolution of conflicts.

AB  - The paper discusses the issue of the intellectual historian's attitude to the subject of his research, especially if it takes the form of an intellectual conflict or controversy. It is a critical analysis of the possibility of assuming an objective attitude towards one's own research: without any valuation. Based on Aristotle's remarks on rhetoric, the author shows that the presentation of research results in writing is linked to taking a position towards them and giving them a place and meaning in the context of broader reasoning, which is synonymous with the operation of evaluation. The empirical context of the presented argument is provided by a self-analytical case study: the author's research on Catholic modernism in Poland. Reflecting on it, the author points to another source of the impossibility of objectivity, hidden in the hermeneutic method of research. Gadamer's postulate of writing history again and again for the sake of the changing historical context leads to a strong emphasis of the worldview of researchers themselves in their studies.

AB  - The importance of spatial data is rising as a means to reduce vulnerabilities and risks associated with climate change.Considering the recognition of its importance, many developing countries are struggling with capacity building for spatial data construction. The key objective of this study is to understand the current status and challenges of spatial data construction in Central Asian countries with a focus on enhancing the use of spatial data in Central Asian countries through international cooperation. The target countries are Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. This research used the official data provided on the websites of cartography agencies in Central Asia countries as well as data presented at regional workshops on the integration of statistical and spatial data in Central Asia, which was conducted by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). The collected data are classified into three types: fundamental maps, thematic maps and NSDI (National Spatial Data Infrastructure). Through this classification, analyses of the resolution level and the data-sharing system were conducted. The results show that each country exhibits differences in spatial information capabilities. In the case of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, satellite data produced by the aerospace agency are actively used for land management, focusing on the ecosystem. However, other countries mainly rely on statistical data to manage the land, and it is found that spatial data are not actively utilized. In addition, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have implemented the NSDI over the past years, which facilitates the sharing of spatial data. However, the rest of the countries in Central Asia show limitations in terms of sharing geospatial data, and additionally lack data infrastructure.This paper reveals the differences in national competency when using and managing geospatial data among Central Asian countries. The results of this analysis will contribute to building future policies and actions, acting as a reference for improving the national capacity, relevant infrastructure, and regional-international cooperation.

TI  - Land cover and carbon dynamics in 55 rural settlements in Legal Amazon between 2008 and 2016: implication for climate change policies

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we described the dynamics of land-cover and gross carbon stocks and emissions (C) in 55 settlements in Legal Amazon, located in northern Mato Grosso state, between 2008 and 2016 and discussed their implications for climate change policies. C estimates were based on land-cover changes, obtained with Spot, Sentinel and Landsat image processing and field visits, and secondary data of mean carbon values per vegetation class. The 55 settlements were originally covered by 685,000 ha of native vegetation (103 Tg C). Deforestation by 2016 was over 65%. Most of it (77%) occurred by 2008. Although restoration of consolidated areas (areas deforested before July 2008) is not mandatory, it can generate revenue from carbon credits, environmental reserve quotas, forest management and agroforestry. The deforested area per settlement by 2008 was strongly related to the deforestation per settlement between 2008 and 2016. This suggests that those who deforested a lot until 2008 tend to continue to do so until 2016. The annual deforestation rate between 2008 and 2016 was 12.7 thousand ha/year. If it remains the same, all native vegetation will have been suppressed in less than two decades. In general, the SustainableDevelopment-Project settlements had less deforestation, which indicates that it is possible to associate agrarian reform and economic and social development with the conservation of the Amazon rainforest. However, it is necessary to strengthen policies toward payment for ecosystem services and forest management products (low-impact forest management and non-timber forest products). In order to do so, the integration of federal, state and local governments and market efforts is paramount.

AB  - Today, the Indonesia one map policy has encouraged for producing maps up to scale 1/5.000 - 1/10.000. Therefore, all efforts to accelerate large-scale map production are still needed. One of the challenges is for producing DEM (Digital Elevation Model). DEM data extraction from high-resolution optical satellite imagery is an efficient choice for the production of large-area DEM. This study uses Worldview 3 stereo ready images for DSM (Digital Surface Model) Extraction. Although the DSM data have a high resolution 30cm x 30cm, unfortunately, the DEM extraction techniques from optical images produce DSM (Digital Surface Model) data instead of DTM. While topographic maps generally use DTM data instead of DSM. So, the goal of this study is to use an appropriate procedures method in Open-Source (OS) software towards the generation of Bare-Earth data by filtering DSM. The OS software is SAGA-GIS that it is can be used for any point cloud data. The quality of DTM generated by SAGA-GIS is evaluated by visual interpretation from Worldview 3 orthoimage itself. A good filtering result will remove the non-terrain point. Some independent check point used to evaluate the error in elevation. The error in elevation still less than 2 pixels. Final product is a high resolution DTM which has 30cm x 30cm grid spacing.

AB  - West Java is the third province with the largest area of paddy field. On the province scale, there are five districts with more than 60,000 hectares of the paddy field area. Sukabumi is fifth largest districts with 6.8% of the area covered with paddy field. Although it is not the greatest number, Sukabumi is the largest producer of paddy with more than 6 ton per hectare, especially in 2011. Rice is the primary food for most of Indonesian. Therefore, monitoring the rice planting regarding the phenology, planting area, and productivity is a critical process. Information from the process is very important to address the national issue of food security. This study aims to generate spatial and temporal information on rice phenology. This study uses the excellence of remote sensing technology to cover a big area of paddy field. Sentinel-2 imageries and photos from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) are being applied to generate Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). With NDVI, this study determines the growth stage of paddy by discriminating each stage based on the spectral value. The planting phases that have discovered in the area are land preparation, vegetative, generative, and harvesting. Based on the NDVI value, it is known that the vegetative stage ranges from 0.181 to 0.80. The study concludes that result from Sentinel-2 and UAV can be used to show the distribution of paddy based on different growth stage.

CP  - IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf)
CL  - Florence, ITALY
AB  - Oil spills, caused by accidents or by ships cleaning their tanks, represent big threats for maritime and coastal ecosystems health. A very effective detection of oil spills can be performed using satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, operating regardless of cloud coverage and sunlight and capable of discriminating oil from regular sea surface. However, discriminating between real oil spills and look-alikes (such as natural oils and seepages, often occurring in upwelling sea areas), although well performed by expert SAR image interpreters, poses a great challenge for automatic processes. In addition, a visual check performed by human operators on a great number of images would be too expensive. Therefore, many solutions for automatic detection have been tried in the last few years, using probabilistic models and, more recently, machine learning. This work presents an innovative solution based on image-to-image translation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with an adversarial loss function. The proposed approach has been tested, with very promising results, using Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR data over the Mediterranean Sea and some areas of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea.

This work presents an innovative solution based on imageto-image translation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with an adversarial loss function. The proposed approach has been tested, with very promising results, using Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR data over the Mediterranean Sea and some areas of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea.

TI  - USE OF GEOBIA APPROACH FOR ANALYSING THE LAND USE AND VEGETATION COVER DYNAMICS IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF BROTAS-SP, BRAZIL
T2  - GEOFOCUS-REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE LA INFORMACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the importance and fragility of natural resources, the concern with the disorderly human intervention on the environment has become recurrent, and different approaches for space occupation are being implemented. However, perception and detection of spatial changes are often empirical due to the lack of information. Thus, the best possible information regarding land use and vegetation cover is needed to improve understanding such changes in the Earth's surface and their dynamism. The present work aimed at analysing the anthropogenic changes on land use and vegetation cover between 2001 and 2016 in the municipality of Brotas-SP (Brazil), where there is a recent focus on ecotourism and the conservation of natural resources, especially for evaluating the effectiveness of public policies for municipal development based on sustainable bases. The GEOBIA object-oriented image classification approach was applied to Landsat 7/ETM+ and Landsat 8/OLI images. Land use and vegetation cover maps showed the conversion of pasture areas to agriculture and natural areas, as a function of ecotourism, however, in a fragmented way. The overall accuracy and Kappa index of the classified maps was 90 % and 0.89, respectively, proving the efficiency of this approach in environmental studies.

AB  - The amounts of satellite data available to the public have increased dramatically the last few years, in particular thanks to the public open release of certain key Earth observation missions, stimulating the development of new applications that use large volumes of data. With an armada of new high-volume satellite missions around the corner - both public and commercial - data producers and data users alike now risk becoming overwhelmed by the sheer amounts of data to handle, and new solutions to data structures, access and processing tools are required.Analysis-Ready Data, Data Cubes and cloud-based processing solutions are responses to new situation. Some examples of the former two are outlined briefly in this paper, highlighting some specific efforts by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and the Open Data Cube (ODC) initiative to address these. Some specific efforts relating to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are outlined.

AB  - The paper investigates the different approaches in identifying the buried archaeological properties by using two different technology platforms which are aerial remote sensing and ground-based physical sensing; geophysical techniques. Aerial remote sensing has exhibited great potential for archaeological observation and detection, contrasting to geophysical measurement which it's synonymous with geological investigation in Malaysia. On the other hand, by integrating these two platforms, it shows a high potential response depending on the technique apply. Two different perspectives of technology are examined, namely SPOT multispectral remote sensing satellite imagery and geophysical prospection called electric resistivity. In order to determine co-relationships of two variables; several Vegetation Index (satellite datasets) has been correlated to the resistivity (ground-based values) through regression analysis to show the strong connection between variables. The overall outcomes demonstrated that the data fusion technique and regression analysis applied towards multiple sensing datasets is useful to improve the accuracy (estimation) and minimize the error probability in identifying the buried archaeological remains. This research then will be expanded further to explore the capabilities of geophysical technique with another potential platform in identifying the buried archaeological remain in the Malaysian context.

TI  - From local to regional: Functional diversity in differently managed alpine grasslands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that ecosystem functions are strongly linked to morphological plant traits, like specific leaf area (SLA) and its variability, which serve as a proxy of functional diversity (FD). Functional diversity is rarely studied at regional scales, and its scale dependence is poorly understood. Capturing trait variations at distinct spatial scales and in differently managed grasslands remains challenging, mainly because a limited number of trait measurements are available and field campaigns are time-consuming. Here, we derived alpha- and beta-FD indices based on SLA measured in the field and estimated from optical satellite data by using molecular absorption profiles of leaves in canopies. We inverted the 1-D columnar radiative transfer model PROSAIL using Sentinel-2 reflectance data at canopy level. From the inversion we were able to distinguish different alpine management types based on retrieved SLA. Model uncertainties were mainly related to the different local plant communities, here represented by functional diversity indices and community-weighted means of traits. Thus, successful PROSAIL application was affected by management type. Management categories displaying lower alpha-FD, like mowed and fertilized, delivered the most reliable results. Further, we compared FD (i.e., richness, evenness, divergence) from local to regional scales. Locally, management determines the magnitude of FD, whereas on a regional scale, parcel size and the uniformity of agricultural practices control trait diversity. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying beta-FD from space as it delivers additional information on the impact of management types, differing from locally measured alpha-FD values.

AB  - Due to the high variability of biomes throughout the country, the classification of burned areas is a challenge. We calibrated a random forest classifier to account for all this variability and ensure an accurate classification of burned areas. The classifier was optimized in three steps, generating a version of the burned area product in each step. According to the visual assessment, the final version of the BA product is more accurate than the perimeters created by the Chilean National Forest Corporation, which overestimate large burned areas because it does not consider the inner unburned areas and, it omits some small burned areas. The total burned surface from January to March 2017 was 5,000 km(2) in Chile, 20 % of it belonging to a single burned area in the Maule Region, and with 91 % of the total burned surface distributed in 6 adjacent regions of Central Chile.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, the climate has constantly been changing rapidly, especially global average temperatures that have increased dramatically. Just a few degrees of rising temperature can cause many natural disasters. The purposes of this research is to determine the relationship between land surface temperature and urban built-up areas by applying Landsat-8 satellite data in 2018 in Mueang Buriram district, Buriram province, Thailand. The research was conducted by estimating land surface temperature using a split-window algorithm mutually with an analysis of land use and supervised classification methods. The study results of land surface temperature in each district indicated that Nai Mueang sub- district had the highest average land surface temperature at 33.27 degrees C and that Lak khet sub-district had the lowest average land surface temperature at 28.79 degrees C. The study results of land use in 3 main areas indicated as follows: 1) vegetation areas had an area of 703.40 km(2), representing 084.41% 2) urban built-up areas had an area of 118.28 km(2), representing 14.19% and 3) and water areas had an area of 11.61 km(2), representing 1.40%. The study results of the relationship between land surface temperature and urban built-up areas indicated an excellent level of relationship and the value of correlation r at 0.9719. In addition, land surface temperature was forecasted in advance, when urban built-up areas had increased to 100%. And the results were found that Mueang Buriram district had an increasing land surface temperature of approximately at 35.11 degrees C.

AB  - Intersection of adversarial learning and satellite image processing is an emerging field in remote sensing. In this study, we intend to address synthesis of high resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery using adversarial learning. Guided by the discovery of attention mechanism, we regulate the process of band synthesis through spatio-spectral Laplacian attention. Further, we use Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty norm to improve training and stability of adversarial learning. In this regard, we introduce a new cost function for the discriminator based on spatial attention and domain adaptation loss. We critically analyze the qualitative and quantitative results compared with state-of-the-art methods using widely adopted evaluation metrics. Our experiments on datasets of three different sensors, namely LISS-3, LISS-4, and WorldView-2 show that attention learning performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. Using the proposed method we provide an additional data product in consistent with existing high resolution bands. Furthermore, we synthesize over 4000 high resolution scenes covering various terrains to analyze scientific fidelity. At the end, we demonstrate plausible large scale real world applications of the synthesized band.

M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of land use and cover at different spatial and temporal scales allows us to evaluate changes in landscapes, socioeconomic system and impacts on the natural environment. Land use and land cover changes and socioeconomic activities of the Northern Region of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil were analyzed over a 20-year scale. Using images from the Landsat 5 sensor TM, land use and land cover maps were obtained for 1991, 2001 and 2011, in which agricultural uses, native vegetation and pasture presented a significant difference between the years. We identified two scenarios for the region: the northern portion presents a reduction in agricultural areas and an increase in pasture and native vegetation, while the southern portion presents a constancy of agricultural areas. The predominant agricultural uses and socioeconomic factors determined the major changes in landscape structure. The effects of these changes resulted in a reduction in the area of agricultural uses and expansion of native vegetation and pasture areas.

TI  - A NOVEL APPROACH TO QUANTIFYING THE DEGREE OF ANTHROPOGENIC SURFACE TRANSFORMATION - THE CONCEPT OF 'HEMEROMORPHY'
T2  - ERDKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - The degree of human geomorphological impact was estimated as a ratio of natural geomorphological processes and geomorphological processes triggered or facilitated by humankind. A typical Central European cultural landscape of diverse land use and relief was considered as a pilot area. Based on topography maps and landforms the natural material fluxes were calculated. By overlapping historical maps, modern maps and remotely sensed data, the duration and extent of different land use types were mapped, and were assigned to each landscape unit. Anthropogenic material fluxes were calculated for the land use types identified. Dividing the summarized anthropogenic material fluxes by natural ones, the anthropic geomorphological transformation ratio (r(AG)) was estimated. The value of r(AG) is independent of the efficiency and intensity of processes; it merely expresses the relation of effectiveness between human induced and natural processes. Since the calculated index is based on estimated values and there is, at least theoretically, no upper limit, the term 'hemeromorphy' was introduced and the values were classified in corresponding 'hemeromorphy' categories. For the smallest landscape units with the same degree of 'hemeromorphy' the term 'hemeromorphotop' was applied. This interpretation makes the comparison of landscape units possible according to their anthropogeomorphological transformation, independently of the intensity and quality of their geomorphological processes.

TI  - PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS IN SPIRITUAL CULTURE OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF NORTH AMERICA
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to reveal philosophical ideas in the mythology and folklore of the indigenous peoples of North America. An important question: "Can we assume that the spiritual culture of the American Indians contained philosophical knowledge?" remains relevant today. For example, European philosophy is defined by appeals to philosophers of the past, their texts. The philosophical tradition is characterized by rational argumentation and formulation of philosophical questions that differ from the questions of ordinary language. However, the problem lies in the term "philosophy", which belongs to the so-called " philosophical untranslatability" and has many definitions. The question of whether philosophy is exclusively a phenomenon of European culture is still controversial. In the article, the concept of philosophy is used in a broad sense, which allows the analysis of the intellectual heritage of the culture of the indigenous people of North America for philosophical ideas. Theoretical basis of the study consists of primary sources, which are limited due to the "documentary horizon". It contains myths about the Twins, ritual rhetoric, examples of dream interpretation practices and the practical wisdom of tribal chiefs. The Chronicle of "Vallamolum", or " the Red List", testifies to the special idea of the Indians about history and their own historicity. Analysis of cosmogonical and cosmological ideas reveals the special features of the anthropological ideas of the North American Indians. Combined with the philosophical ideas of the Puritan philosophy of the settlers of New England, this analysis allows us to explore in more detail the processes of acculturation. The study uses critical literature from scholars and leading researchers of the wisdom and philosophy of Native Americans, such as Michael Yellow Bird, J. Baird Callicott, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Dennis H. McPherson, Lewis Henri Morgan, Thomas M. Norton-Smith, J. Douglas Rabb, Paul Radin, Jon Ewbank Manchip White. The views of early American philosophers: R. Williams, W. Penn, R. W. Emerson, on the problem of the relationship between the culture of settlers and the indigenous people of North America are noteworthy. Originality lies in the application of historical and philosophical methodology, identifying the features of philosophizing in the spiritual culture and worldview of the indigenous people of North America. Conclusions. In the conclusions, the obtained results complement the history of the origin and development of philosophical thought of the early American philosophy.

TI  - Pan Maoming's Philosophy and Cosmology: a Historiographical Research on the Sources and Cultural Background
T2  - PHILOSOPHY AND COSMOLOGY-FILOSOFIYA I KOSMOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of the authors' study of the philosophical heritage of the Ancient Chinese philosopher Pan Maoming, who played an essential role in the development of spiritual culture, as well as Philosophy and Science of Ancient Southern China (nowadays, Guangdong Province). The authors carried out historiographical research of currently available ancient and modern sources, which contain data on the life and philosophical ideas of Pan Maoming; reconstructed the Pan Maoming's intellectual biography; revealed the main features of his worldview. The authors reconstructed the social, cultural, and philosophical context of the historical epoch in which Pan Maoming's philosophical and scientific views arose and developed; clarified the philosopher's historical role in the development of local culture in the Southern region of Ancient China.The article contains the author's description and interpretation of the main philosophical ideas of Pan Maoming, the main amid which the authors consider the ethical concept of "peace and emptiness," the concept of "clumsiness"; the idea of "monasticism for the happiness of the people." The authors compared Pan Maoming's philosophical ideas with Lao-tzu's philosophical doctrine and came to the conclusion that Pan Maoming formed his own unique and original elaboration of Taoist philosophy, significantly developed its linguistic (conceptual) apparatus and worldview.The authors paid particular attention to the description and analysis of Pan Maoming's cosmological views, which include the doctrine of "Inner alchemy" (Neidan), the doctrine of "chaos, order and causality." The authors concluded that Pan Maoming's cosmological ideas significantly developed a way of understanding the Universe, the relationship between "inert" and "living" matter, the "world of nature" and the "world of human" in the Taoist philosophical culture.The authors also presented and substantiated their point of view that some philosophical and cosmological ideas of Pan Maoming have not only of historical value but can also be used for developing and enriching the local spiritual culture of Guangdong Province (an intrinsic part of which is the so-called "Pan Maoming's culture") in the form of ethical and educational practices, as well as practices of strengthening cultural unity and identity.

AB  - Soil erosion has been a major threat in land degradation processes around the world. High level of soil erosion in particular area may influence community livelihood where land resource as the main source of family income is being threatened. This study was carried out in Dieng Plateau, Central Java Province, Indonesia, with the aim to seek the level of soil erosion as well as to find out how resilient farm families are in the study area toward land degradation. Soil erosion assessment was performed using RUSLE method with various spatial data such as Landsat images, rainfall, soil erodibility, slope data, and conservation practice, while community resilience assessment was performed by comparing community preparedness to its vulnerability from 67 farm household samples. The results show most of high level of soil erosion occurred in area dominated by steep slope with less vegetation cover. It is also confirmed that soil erosion has accelerated due to deforestation indicated by the increasing area for soil erosion level 61-180 tons/ha/year from 1871 ha in 2007 to 2174 ha in 2017 (+4.07%). While the highest soil erosion level more than 180 tons/ha/year was increased for about 1.45% from 226 ha in 2017 to 34 ha in 2017, it was found as well that community resilience in the study area is classified at low level (0.27-1.01) with score 0.56. In general, the community in the study area is not resilient toward land degradation processes and hence jeopardizes livelihood sustainability.

TI  - Characteristic Analysis of Droughts and Waterlogging Events for Maize Based on a New Comprehensive Index through Coupling of Multisource Data in Midwestern Jilin Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent droughts and waterlogging events are a threat to food security. An understanding of the spatial and temporal variations that occur during such events is essential when conducting a regional and/or global drought and waterlogging assessment. The goal of this study is to define a comprehensive index that considers the continuum system of atmosphere, crops, and soil moisture impacts on droughts and waterlogging events, and to analyze the temporal and spatial distribution of such events in the development of maize. The results show that the proposed comprehensive drought and waterlogging index (CDWI) can bring together the advantages of a single drought and waterlogging index and reasonably describe its range. During the study period, the annual trends of the CDWI decreased at different growth stages from 1982 to 2015, whereas the CDWI did not show significant spatial heterogeneity during any particular stage. Increasing trends of CDWI over 0.019/year were found in the northern part of Midwestern Jilin Province from the emergence to tasseling stages. In addition, decreasing trends were observed in the study area from the tasseling to maturation stages. Slight drought and waterlogging events occurred more frequently than moderate and serious drought and waterlogging events.

AB  - This work focuses on a reservoir with water leaks since its construction, the Beninar reservoir. The purpose of this reservoir was to regulate the Adra River basin, lying between the provinces of Almeria and Granada, and located south of Sierra Nevada Mountains (in the Inner Zones of the Betic Cordilleras, SE Spain). This basin extends over 746 km(2), at an altitude of 2780 m, with a very rough terrain and frequent torrential water flow. Due to the continuous extension of greenhouses in the east and west parts of Almeria, the water demand for agriculture and urban consumption increases day by day. As a consequence, aquifers are being overexploited, causing the current system to not be sustainable for a long time, that is, the storage capacity of the underground media and their possible contributions to an efficient management of resources have not been adequately taken into account. The Beninar dam has always had problems with water leaks. The dam was built even knowing that the land was not the most suitable, due to the frequent earth movements that took place in the town of Beninar, which was submerged beneath the waters of the reservoir. In this work, we process multi-temporal SAR datasets coming from the C-band satellites ERS-1/2, Envisat, and Sentinel-1A/B using MT-InSAR techniques, being able to monitor the deformation behavior of this dam for a long time period of more than 25 years, from 1992 to 2018.

AB  - This paper presents a new concept of modulated metasurface (MTS) antenna for satellite communications. As opposed to using cylindrical surface waves (SW) to excite circular apertures, we employ a quasi-optical beamformer to launch a plane SW. This architecture enables an efficient illumination of rectangular apertures. In addition, the use of anisotropic MTS elements allows us to obtain circularly-polarized beams with excellent characteristics in terms of cross-polarization discrimination. We present the design process of a prototype at K-band and the obtained simulation results, which prove the suitability of this antenna for satellite data links.

AB  - Wetlands are among the most productive natural ecosystems in the world, generally being important biodiversity hotspots. However, the complex nature of these landscapes together with the fragile and dynamic relationships among the organisms inhabiting these regions, make wetland ecosystems especially vulnerable to environmental disturbance, such as climate change. Thus, developing new automated systems which allow the continuous monitoring and mapping of wetland dynamics is crucial for informing decision-making and preserving their natural health. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors deployed on satellite platforms such as SENTINEL-1 are increasingly recognized as essential for wetland monitoring. The high sensitivity of SAR sensors to environmental variation makes them particularly suitable for investigating the hydrological processes occurring within these ecosystems.The main objective of this paper is to propose a rapid polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) change detection tool for monitoring and mapping the flood dynamics and environmental condition of the North Rupununi region, Guyana. By making use of dense Sentinel-1 timeseries data and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we were able to map temporal open water and temporal flooded vegetation areas in a continuous and near-real time basis. The outcomes derived from this study significantly contributed to identify the hydrological mechanisms of the region of study while providing essential and valuable information for rapid response and environmental impact assessment.

AB  - In this article, we explore the role and usefulness of neuro-fuzzy logic in the context of automatically reasoning under uncertainty about complex scenes in remotely sensed data. Specifically, we consider a first order Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). First, we explore the idea of embedding an experts knowledge into ANFIS. Second, we explore the augmentation of this knowledge via optimization relative to training data. The aim is to explore the possibility of transferring then improving domain performance on tedious but important and challenging tasks. This route was selected, versus the popular modern thinking of learning a neural solution from scratch in an attempt to maintain interpretability and explainability of the resultant solution. An additional objective is to observe if the machine learns anything that can be returned to the human to improve their individual performance. To this end, we explore the task of detecting construction sites, an abstract concept that has a large amount of inner class variation. Our experiments show the usefulness of the proposed methodology and it sheds light onto future directions for neuro-fuzzy computing, both with respect to performance, but also with respect to glass box solutions.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The SPecular Array Radiometric Calibration (SPARC) methodology uses convex mirrors to relay an image of the sun to a satellite, airborne sensor, or other Earth Observation platform. The signal created by SPARC can be used to derive absolute, traceable calibration coefficients of Earth remote sensing systems in the solar reflective spectrum. This technology has been incorporated into an automated, on-demand commercial calibration network called FLARE (Field Line-of-site Automated Radiance Exposure). The first station, or node, has been successfully commissioned and tested with several government and commercial satellites. Radiometric performance is being validated against existing calibration factors for Sentinel 2A and diffuse target methodologies. A radiometric uncertainty budget indicates conservative 1-sigma uncertainties that are comparable to or below existing vicarious cal/val methods for the VIS-NIR wavelengths. In addition to radiometric performance, SPARC and FLARE can be utilized for characterization of a sensor's spatial performance. Line and Point Spread Functions, and resulting Modulation Transfer Functions, derived with SPARC mirrors are virtually identical to those measured with traditional diffuse edge targets. Ongoing development of the FLARE network includes improved radiometric calibration, web portal scheduling and data access, and planned expansion of the network to Railroad Valley Playa and Mauna Loa, Hawaii.

AB  - Aquaculture fish cages are usually located remote areas with poor accessibility. Synthetic Aperture Radar ( SAR) is relevant to register and monitor their activity. However, in order to take advantage of the large amount of infonnation this technology produce, it is necessary to develop automated tools of analysis. This work proposes an automated approach through an unsupervised polarimetric classification method using Sentinel 1 IW SLC Dual-Pol (NW + VH) products. An experimental evaluation was applied in Calbuco, an area with intense aquaculture activity in southern Chile. It was possible to demonstrate that this approach allows to improve the capacity of classification of previous experiences (86.49% user's accuracy and 96.97% producer's accuracy). Further studies are required to know the impact of wind speed on the classification as well as the spatial precision of the detection.

T2  - PHYSICA MEDICA-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was to assess the performance of a prototype compact gamma camera (MediPROBE) based on a CdTe semiconductor hybrid pixel detector, for coded aperture imaging. This probe can be adopted for various tasks in nuclear medicine such as preoperative sentinel lymph node localization, breast imaging with Tc-99m radiotracers and thyroid imaging, and in general in radioguided surgery tasks. The hybrid detector is an assembly of a 1-mm thick CdTe semiconductor detector bump-bonded to a photon-counting CMOS readout circuit of the Medipix2 series or energy-sensitive Timepix detector. MediPROBE was equipped with a set of two coded aperture masks with 0.07-mm or 0.08-mm diameter holes. We performed laboratory measurements of field of view, system spatial resolution, and signal-difference-to-noise ratio, by using gamma-emitting radio- active sources (Cd-109, I-125, Am-241,Tc- 99m). The system spatial resolution in the lateral direction was 0.56 mm FWHM (coded aperture mask with holes of 0.08 mm and a 60 keV source) at a source-collimator distance of 50 mm and a field of view of 40 mm by side. Correspondingly, the longitudinal resolution in 3D source localization tasks was about 3 mm. MediPROBE showed a significant improvement in terms of spatial resolution when equipped with the high-resolution coded apertures, with respect to the performance previously reported with 1-2 mm pinhole apertures as well as with respect to adopting a 0.35 mm pinhole aperture.

AB  - The aim of the study is to study approaches to localization of the topic of SDG in higher education in Russia and some tracks for implementation of environmental education for sustainable development (EESD). The objectives were: to formulate a goal setting for each of the approaches; to develop a methodology for the introduction of the SDG ideology into EESD; to implement the personal and collective role of research team members in working on the project; to create effective collaborations and introduce an interdisciplinary approach; to be able to present the results obtained in a visual and analytical form; to expand the professional outlook of environmentalists, to form a worldview based on the development of competencies for sustainable development. The research methodology in formal education was based on the hypothesis that modern environmental education should be based on the triad of SDG clusters, and all didactic units of university programs should be filled with this ideology. The information approach was implemented through the introduction of project laboratory technologies, case studies and youth models. Strategically, the higher education institutions participating in the experiment developed a methodology for tracking higher education for sustainable development and introduced methods for working with the subjects of SDG.

AB  - The article examines the problem of identity realization in the modern information society. The authors analyze the concept of identity in comparison with the concept of self, reveal the features of the manifestation and deformation of identity, and explore ways to generate multiple identities. The study of the concept of identity is based on the worldview principles inherent in different epochs. An attempt is made to give a complete (holographic) picture of identity, and the question is raised about the criteria for distinguishing genuine identity from non-genuine (pseudo-identity). The relationship between the concepts of "I" and self is studied, identification is presented as a process of predication of "I". In the structure of identity, such features as constancy and variability are distinguished. On this basis, the classical and non-classical identities are distinguished and their characteristics are given. It is shown that the breakup of these components into independent parts results in the complete loss of the object's identity, which leads to its disintegration and death. It is shown that in the conditions of fluid reality, identity turns from a stabilizing factor into a situational one, which encourages the subject to constantly choose an identity. The conditions of transformation of identification into a diffuse process that loses the strict unambiguous binding of the subject to something fixed and defined are considered. Due to this, the identity of the subject is "smeared" all over the world. As a result of this process, the subject loses the need to identify itself with anything: it "collapses" into itself. As a result, there is a contradiction of identification: the multiplicity of identities gives the subject a huge choice between them, at the same time due to the diffusion of identity ( its smearing around the world) the selection procedure itself loses its meaning. But if the identity is lost, there are problems with the self, so it turns out to be the end of the existence of the person himself. Therefore, in all the transformations of identities in the modern world, it is important that it is preserved.

The authors regard them from the viewpoint of poetics, i.e. deciphering the artistic codes of the writer and his interpretation of the Soviet and world civilization of the mid-20th century. Attention is paid not only to the scientific novelty of the monograph (associated with the writer's legacy which is still insufficiently explored), unpublished in Platonov's lifetime and often evaluated as marginal and incompatible with the narrative prose of Platonov, but also to the methodology of hermeneutics of the texts of four plays of the late 1930s early 1950s, namely: "The Voice of the Father", "A Magical Being", "A Student of the Lyceum", and "Noah's Ark". The authors of the monograph agree with the conclusion of many researchers that the non-canonical dramatic form of the plays and the use of "formula" rhetoric, plot-related and character signs in the artistic system do not testify to a compromise with the dominant epistemes but to the immersion into the deep meanings of existence with the purpose of cognizing historical reality. In the monograph, the following two aspects seem rather significant: on the one hand, it is a holistic analysis of each text and its genetic and associative multilayer structure, and on the other hand, the paradigm of analysis allowing the author to reveal the semantic and character ties and development of character and thematic motifs and to demonstrate the holisticity of Platonov's evolving artistic system. The method of discovering extratextual allusions (biographical and socio-political) is also productive, as it keeps the interpretation of the plays within the boundaries of the author's intention, and not within philological hypotheses of a researcher. The monograph substantiates one of the reasons of the writer's attempt at creating a piece of drama: not just a method of concealing the author's meanings ("not cryptography" by itself) from social censorship, but penetration into the worldview of the characters with the aim of overcoming the author's personal subjectivity in answers to the intractable problems of existence. The monograph presents the principled dialogical character of Platonov's works: autodialogue, intertextuality, and dialogue with existence.

M3  - Article
AB  - The publication argues the point of view that the information confrontation between the West and Russia in modern conditions pursues the solution of geopolitical problems. Defending the liberal-idealistic model of the world order, the West is actively using modern communication technologies to enhance the moral and psychological impact on the basis of the worldview principles of Russian society - the people's memory of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War. Thus, he is trying to introduce a new model of history based on Western democratic values into the mass consciousness of Russians.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to identifying the field of meanings of a shawl in the Mansi traditional worldview. The research methodology is defined by symbolic approach which is based on the specificity of mythology thinking - expressing abstract concepts and meanings through the images of particular objects. Due to this, special attention is focused on rituals and folklore as spheres of culture in which objects-symbols are most fully revealed.The initial source base of the study is the visual materials of famous domestic Ugric-researcher V.N. Chernetsov's archive, which are deposited in the Museum of Archeology and Ethnography of Siberia, Tomsk State University. These materials have not been introduced for scientific use. The archive materials are presented by photographs and drawings made in 1920-s - 1930-s during the field ethnographic expeditions to the Mansi different groups on the rivers Tagil, Lozva, Konda, Ob and North Sosva. Of particular value are the sketches made by the researcher during the Bear Festival in the village. Ilpi-Paul and Suri-Paul on the Ob in 1936-1937. Other sources are issued field materials of the researcher and publications of folklore.The study showed that a shawl is woven into the symbolic fabric of the traditional Mansi culture with many threads-ties. In the social sphere, it marks the feminine world, separated from the masculine one. Inside the feminine, along with the braids adornments, it divides the girls and the women's domain. This symbolism is largely due to the utilitarian functions of a shawl, although preserved until modern times, although they persist until modern times, but over time are increasingly moving into the ritual sphere. Referring to the photographs of the researcher allowed concluding that in the second half of the 20 century certain ways of wearing a headscarf have moved exclusively into the ritual sphere, which in the first half of the century were recorded in everyday life.In the picture of the world, a headscarf inherited the fabric symbolism, in many respects similar to the symbolism of birch bark. Both materials serve as signs of the border between the worlds, more often between the Middle and Lower. This semantics determined the actualization of the cloth and shawl in the maternity and funeral rites. At the same time, the fabric and the scarf outline the spatio-temporal boundaries of the sacred, separating it from the secular, which is clearly manifested in the Bear Festival. As a result, the fabric and the shawl themselves acquire a sacred status and are endowed with trade magic, which is realized in fishing and hunting. The latest layer in the shawl symbolism is associated with silk: it is thought of as a sign of prosperity and wealth.

AB  - When one considers the wide trends of scholars who have studied Abraham Kuyper(1837-1920), it is not difficult to find that while they focused on specific topics on Kuyper’s thoughts such as politics, art, ethics, common grace, modernism, pluralism, and neo-Calvinism, they have missed to see the broad lens of his theology, that is organic worldview. A common critique of Kuyper is that while he emphasized ‘antithesis’ (an tension between Christian and non-Christian worldviews), Bavinck sought and developed the grace-restoration-nature synthesis. Although it is true that there is a difference between Bavinck and Kuyper, it should be noted that Kuyper shared the same core of the grace-restoration-nature synthesis. This article examines the relationship between grace and nature through organic motif in Kuyper’s calvinistic worldview, and demonstrates that the grace-nature synthesis is permeated through Kuyper’s thought.

AB  - The article analyzes the work of the famous Altai writer Ch. A. Chunizhekov, whose work was a turning point in the history of Altai literature. He began his career in the years 20-30. The twentieth century, however, the period of his creative maturity fell on 1950-1960 – the time of creative take-off, at the beginning of the “golden period” in Altai literature. The object of the study was the lyric works of the writer, the main attention is paid to the influence of the socialist-realistic method on his choice of thematic material. In the lyric works of the writer, the image of Gorny Altai in the mid-20th century becomes central, and his main character is a man, the builder of a new happy future. In the prism of the author’s attention, the lyrical hero, who is understood as part of a single collective, distinguished by his dedicated work for the good of his homeland. Often the central character of the writer’s lyrics is a symbolically generalized image that reflects a social group (mother, agitator) or profession (shepherd, plowman, hunter, tractor driver ...). If the thematic directions of the lyrics were determined by the method of socialist-realistic depiction of reality, then folklore traditions, as well as the experience of both the previous generation of Altai writers, and Russian and other literatures became the means of artistic expression for the writer. He was a brilliant connoisseur of Altai folklore, a collector, literary processed Altai tales. This is evidenced by the song beginning of the writer’s lyrics, and characteristic metaphorical turns, and traditional motifs, and symbolism present in the works of the author. Relying on a rich folklore language, Ch. Chunizhekov created works on new themes and images that meet the requirements of the time. A special place in his lyrics is occupied by the poem “Tuudi”, dedicated to the famous Altai narrator Nikolai Ulagashev. The style and language of this work are similar to the heroic epic, which allows us to talk about the author's stylization. The past in this work, which is characteristic of the socialist realism in literature, is divided into the past and the present, the time that was before the advent of the Soviet Union (perceived as bleak for the common people), and – the arrival of Soviet power, when the era of sunrise and symbolically begins awakening the people from centuries of sleep. His second poem, written two decades after the publication of the first, was built in a similar manner.As a result of the analysis of the writer’s lyrics, it is proved that the ideals of socialist realism are the cornerstone of his worldview, the methods and techniques of which became fundamental in the author’s art world, building both the form and content of his works. The material for study was the lyric works of the writer, in which the worldview of the writer is most strikingly presented, in the center of which is the image of a person, a representative of modern times.

TI  - Impacts of Triple Factors on Flash Flood Vulnerability in Egypt: Urban Growth, Extreme Climate, and Mismanagement
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth, extreme climate, and mismanagement are crucial controlling factors that affect flood vulnerability at wadi catchments. Therefore, this study attempts to understand the impacts of these three factors on the flash flood vulnerability in different climatic regions in Egypt. An integrated approach is presented to evaluate the urban growth from 1984 to 2019 by using Google Images and SENTINEL-2 data, and to develop hazard maps by using a rainfall-runoff-inundation model (RRI). Annual rainfall trend analysis was performed to evaluate the temporal variability trend. The hazard maps that were created were classified into three categories (low, medium, and high) and integrated with the urban growth maps to evaluate the impacts on the flood-vulnerable areas. The results show a significant increase in urban growth resulting in an increase of prone areas for flood hazards over time. However, the degree of this hazard is mainly related to growth directions. Mismanagement affects urban growth directions in both planned and unplanned growth, whether by loss of control over unplanned growth or by deficiencies in approved plans. The rainfall analysis showed that there is no explicit relationship to increases or decreases in the flood vulnerable areas. An urban planning approach is recommended for risk reduction management based on a comprehensive study considering such factors.

AB  - Mapping of seagrass bed can be done by using different characteristics of satellite images data such as Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. However, there has been no research compared to the results from those images in Indonesia. This study aims to analyze and compare spatially the condition of seagrass bed from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery covered Kodingareng Lompo island. Spatially sharpened (Pan-sharpening) Landsat-8 imagery from 30 to 15 meters resolution in four spectral bands (visible and NIR) were used in this case. The results showed the four classes seagrass cover percentage consisted of sparse class (0 - 25%), medium-class (26 - 50%), dense class (51 - 75%), and very dense class (76 - 100%). Classification of seagrass cover class and water column correction (Depth Invariant Index) value differed between the two imageries. Accuracy test of seagrass cover classification from Landsat-8 (88.1%) and Sentinel-2 (89.2%) were both suitable to use since they were higher than the standard value (>85%). Differences in the characteristics of both images cause differences in the results of the seagrass cover classification.

AB  - This article discusses the study of the process of ravine erosion using geoinformation technologies and Earth remote sensing data. Ravine erosion, which develops on the territory of the Verkhneuslonsky municipal region of the Republic of Tatarstan, is considered as a multifactorial process. The possibility of using freely available data to study the factors affecting ravine erosion is evaluated. It is shown that in modern conditions of increased anthropogenic environmental impact, especially in areas heavily divided by ravines, the use of GIS technology is sufficient in order to monitor and quickly respond to negative erosion processes occurring on agricultural lands.

T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper intends to map and monitor Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes and forest degradation derived from Landsat satellite images using remote sensing technologies. For this aim, Sinop province of Turkey was selected as the case study area. LULC changes and forest degradation have been studied using Landsat data sets between the years 1987-2019. 3 Landsat 5 TM imageries were dated 27 July 1987, 06 July 1997 and 16 June 2007 and 2 Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imageries were dated 13 July 2017 and 10 July 2019 were used in order to analyze the data. In this context, Support Vector Machine algorithm which is the most trusted supervised classification method and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were applied to all Landsat data to demonstrate forest and built-up changes in every decade. Seven land use classes were determined. These classes were; Waterbody, agriculture, sand, built-up areas, vegetation, forest and bare soil/rock. Noteworthy changes were observed in the classes of built-up areas and forest from the year of 1987 to 2019. Besides, accuracy assessments were carried out and the kappa statistics for Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 data were calculated 0.94, 0.99, 0.89, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively. Unfortunately, in the case study area, forest degradation will be continued due to the installation of nuclear power plant station in the following years.

TI  - MONITORING SHORELINE CHANGE OF ACIGOL AND BURDUR LA S IN TUR Y OVER 44 YEARS USING REMOTE SENSING AND GIS APPROACHES
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the main aim was to analyze the spatial changes of Burdur and. Acigol Lakes by using Remote Sensing approaches and geographical information system (GIS) applications. Five multi temporal satellite images from Landsat 2, Landsat 5 TM and. Landsat 8 OLI were used to monitor and map the shoreline changes for both lakes. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification was used as an effective way of monitoring the changes between specified time intervals accurately. Object-Based. Image Analysis (OBIA) is the second classification approach that was applied to all data in this study. Besides both classification applications, spectral water indexes including the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) were used for the extraction of the water body area and digitization of these areas in the GIS platform. The results of both SVM and OBIA classifications indicated that Burdur Lake lost 40% of its water body as the total area of Burdur lake was 209 km(2) in 1975 and about 125 km(1) in 2019, while Acigol Lake lost about 70% of its water body, with a total area of about 77 km(1) in 1975 and 24.6 km' in 2019. Spatiotemporal changes of Burdur and. Acigol Lakes based on the applied methods show a significant diminishing trend in surface area between the time period of 1975 and 2019 in this study. The results show that remote sensing applications including water indexes and classification algorithms are effective ways of identifying changes between spatial and specific time intervals.

AB  - Remote-sensing applications are limited by the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. Monitoring the dynamics of Leaf Area Index (LAI) from space is a key attribute to estimate crop types and their phenology over large areas, and in characterising spatial variations within growers' fields. This paper proposes a new method to fuse a time-series of Sentinel-2 and CubeSat imagery into daily RGB-NIR surface reflectance and subsequently LAI datasets at 3 m resolution. The results of this study, which focused on monitoring wheat LAI, show that this method is effective (RMSE of 0.58-0.76) for high spatio-temporal monitoring of field-crops.

TI  - A Comparative Study of Taboo Rendition in 3 Dubbed Versions of 'Deadpool' Movie: A Case Study of Swearwords
T2  - APPLIED LINGUISTICS RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Language, besides being a means of expressing thoughts and ideas, can be used to prevent the dissemination of specific ideas, thoughts and ideologies. One relevant example is the taboo, which is rooted in the worldview and beliefs of different nations in a particular category. In fact, taboo-to-taboo translation can, at times, create linguistic and cultural problems. Since audio-visual products are one of the main channels of transmission of culture-based terms such as taboos, the issue of subtitling and dubbing these products is of great importance. The present research is a comparative corpus-based study which intended to examine the translation of a specific category of taboo words, i.e. swearwords, based on Sharifi and Darchinian's (2009) model. For this purpose, using purposive and availability sampling, three dubbed versions of an American movie namely Deadpool (2016) were selected and compared in terms of the quadratic classification of the aforementioned model. To answer the research questions, frequency and percentage scores as well as Chi-square tests were used. The results of the study indicated that 'taboo to non-taboo' (substitution) is the strategy used most frequently by Iranian audio-visual translators to render western taboos into Persian. Another findling was that 'euphemism', except for QD1, was also a strategy that Persian translators used to mitigate the tabooness of swearwords.

T2  - PERIODICO TCHE QUIMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - It is established that the Aral Sea problem, which is due to the negative impact of human activity over time, has led to environmental degradation in the Aral Sea region and changes in the soil cover. The extent of this ecological problem can be detected using geoinformation technologies and remote sensing methods. In this study, the maximum likelihood classification algorithm was applied in the presentation of Landsat images to detect changes in the soil cover based on multispectral satellite data obtained from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 for 2008 and 2018, respectively. The resulting land-use maps indicate a significant increase in saline land from 18% to 22% during the period under study. These land transformations pose a severe threat to the land resources of the area. Consequently, proper management of the land resources is required to preserve them and to ensure that they continue to play their part in the socio-economic development of the region.

AB  - This study aimed to visualize the distribution of yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacores in Bone Gulf, Indonesia. Yellowfin tuna is among the most important large pelagic fish species cached by local fishermen using pole and line gear. This study is a preliminary process in identifying suitable habitat for yellowfin tuna using Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and water depth parameters. It used oceanographic and fishery data from satellite remote sensing of Geographic Information System (GIS). The SST data was gained from Terra/MODIS. The waters depth data was gained from the ETOPO2 satellite database, whereas some points were later confirmed through the Echo sounder record. The experimental fishing was conducted from May to 2019. The result showed that the yellowfin tuna distributions were relatively higher in 30.0 to 31.0 degrees C SST and 500 to 1,000 m water depth. Both of the parameters analyzed in this study played an important role in the distribution. The numbers represented preferences in defining the optimal habitat of the yellowfin tuna, especially in the study area. This information could be useful to predict the potential fishing zones where yellowfin tuna would be distributed in abundance.

AB  - Sentinel-2 provides a large volume of the multi-spectral multi-resolution dataset. Training deep convolutional architecture with such a dataset is still a challenging task in land cover classification due to the absence of ground truth. Also, the selection of appropriate deep architecture for handling the Sentinel-2 dataset is another challenging task. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to extract the information from various combinations of bands in Sentinel-2 imagery. We use a loss function, proposed in an earlier work, to train our model in an unsupervised manner. Recent advances in deep learning allow for transferring knowledge from one data set to another. Thus, in our study, we aim at analyzing the "transfer learning" capabilities of our proposed network to land cover classification in Sentinel-2 images. Pre-trained weights of a deep neural architecture, which is trained with very high-resolution optical satellite imagery from Aviris is transferred to a network of almost similar architecture for processing Sentinel-2 data. We used Salinas, a publicly available hyper-spectral dataset, to train this architecture in a supervised fashion and, finally, use transfer learning and fine-tuning on the architecture handling Sentinel-2 data for clustering. Experiments show that bands of 60m resolution have a positive combining effect with bands of 20m resolution for segregating waterbody, urban settlement, and tree canopies distinctly.

AB  - This paper discusses the process of selection of suitable sites for built-up area development in the lesser Himalayan terrain of Kumaun region in India. This process involves complex steps and handling multiple physiographic and socio-economic factors in order to achieve land suitability. The proposed approach of this study is to provide a framework for integrating the strengths of geographic information system (GIS) and the pairwise comparison matrix known as analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to obtain the most appropriate spatial solution for decision-makers. Thus, Bhikiyasen Block of district Almora, Kumaun Himalaya (India) was considered for mapping the potential sites for the future built-up area development. For this purpose, Cartosat 1 satellite data was used to generate various thematic layers using ArcGIS software. Seven parameters (slope, road proximity, land use/cover, land value, geological formation, drainage proximity and orientation of slopes) were analysed for site suitability and land evaluation. The thematic maps of these criteria were standardized using pairwise comparison matrix and weight for each criteria was generated based on their importance. These criteria and weights ultimately helped in preparing the final land use planning of the area under study. In this paper, the integrated approach of GIS and AHP is showcased as a major contribution towards the development of effective spatial decision support systems (SDSS). This study also provides a new approach for decision-makers in order to reduce future environmental hazards on hillside development.

TI  - Identification of water-stressed area based on the interrelationship of soil moisture and seasonal rice cultivation
T2  - PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study identifies water-stressed areas based on linkages between NOAH model-based soil moisture and seasonal paddy rice cultivation in the Dwarakeswar-Gandheswari river basin. Soil moisture provides information about crop water stress distribution. A new analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-based index is proposed for water stress evaluation. The spatially distributed paddy rice cultivation is essential from the water resource management point of view. Temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), regional water stress index, standardized water level index, and vegetation health index (VHI) are considered for detecting water-stressed area. Water stress indices, soil moisture, and paddy rice cultivation are considered on a seasonal basis (Boro, Aus, and Aman) for the period 2011-2016. The spatial patterns of TVDI, VHI, and rice cultivation are derived from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager satellite images. Kendall's tau is considered for correlation analysis. Sensitivity analysis is performed for the generation of AHP-based new water-stressed zone map. The results show that the downstream portion of the river basin has low water stress compared to the upstream part. Ultimately, the results are validated using 20 field sample points. This analysis will be helpful for the irrigation water management framework.

AB  - Snow cover and glaciers play an important and significant role in high-altitude areas. Chandra Basin, a subbasin of Chenab Basin, is situated in Lahaul-Spiti district, Himachal Pradesh, Western Himalaya and lying on the monsoon-arid transition region. To study the snow cover variation in Chandra basin from 2001 to 2016 for winter period (November-April), MODIS 8-day Terra (MOD10A2) data product is used. A Python script (Arcpy and Numpy package) is used to estimate the snow cover variation in Chandra Basin during the study period. This analysis shows that maximum average snow cover during 2001-2016 was in March (96.94%) and minimum in November (76.93%). Linear-trend-based analysis of snow cover area indicates that it is shrinking at the rate of 0.12% per year. The total reduction in snow cover area in the study area during 2001-2016 is 2.00%.

AB  - Rainfall data is the main input data for use in hydrological analysis, especially for planning purposes. Rainfall data is usually obtained from observations through rain stations. However, the availability of rainfall recording stations is sometimes very limited and located far from the project location. Water resource projects often face this obstacle. A technique is needed for estimating rainfall data using rain data from remote sensing through weather satellite data information providers. Since rainfall data from satellites is not the real amount of measured rainfall on the land, the rainfall data from the satellite must still be evaluated as to whether it can be directly used to represent the rainfall data of a region. The aim of this study is to evaluate the validity of NOAA CPC daily total precipitation data by comparing it to measured rainfall data and to analyse the lag time using the cross-correlation method. The results showed that the NOAA data has a lag time of +1 day over Lombok Island. The rain estimated by NOAA positively correlated with gauged rainfall on the next day. However, the performance of the NOAA data was very poor and for prediction purposes, the data still need to be calibrated.

TI  - Fracture network mapping using Landsat-8 OLI images of the mining zone of Jbel Tijekht in Moroccan Eastern Anti-Atlas.
T2  - ESTUDIOS GEOLOGICOS-MADRID
M3  - Article
AB  - Jbel Tijekht is one of the most important geological structures of the Ougnat-Ouzina ridge in the Eastern Anti-Atlas. This crescent-shaped massif was affected by a network fractures that is visible at different scales. It is particularly rich in numerous mineralized veins of barite, and is associated with other minerals (e.g. pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena).In order to study fracture systems in the mining zone of Jbel Tijekht, we opted for a combination of remote sensing and field investigation that became an important tool for fracture mapping and mineral exploration. This work presents a methodological approach to detect structural lineaments. For this purpose, various techniques were applied to the Landsat 8 image to improve the visibility of linear structures. After the radiometric and atmospheric corrections, the colors composites and directional filters applied to the Principal component (PC1) allow for the establishment of a lineaments map of Jbel Tijekht. The validation and the correction of lineaments are based on preexisting documents combined with field observations.Statistical analysis of the lineament map allows for identification of at least three directional fracture systems with average NS, NE-SW, and ENE-WSW orientations. NS and NE-SW systems show a high density in the largest part of the study area. These results clearly overlap different tectonic structures and existing veins. It allowed for the establishment of a geological link between lithology, fractures systems and mineralization. The fracture density can be attributed to the last variscan brittle phases, reflecting the rheology of rock units; the high fracture density is observed in competent rocks such as the Tabanit sandstones. These zones constitute a favorable area for mineralization deposits.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the usage of HyMAP airborne hyperspectral and Sentinel-2, ASTER and Landsat-8 OLI spaceborne multispectral data for detailed mapping of mineral resources in the Arctic. The EnMAP Geological Mapper (EnGeoMAP) and Iterative Spectral Mixture Analysis (ISMA) approaches are tested for mapping of mafic-ultramafic rocks in areas covered by abundant lichen. Using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), the output classification results from airborne data are quantitatively compared to the available geological map and to the HyMAP reference data in case of using spaceborne dataset. Results demonstrate the capability of both airborne and spaceborne data to provide large-scale reconnaissance mapping of geologic materials over vast arctic regions where field access is limited. The distributions of three ultramafic units (dunite, peridotite, pyroxenite) and one mafic unit (gabbro) are mapped based on analyzing specific visible and near-infrared and short-wave-infrared spectral features. The extent of peridotite and dunite units mapped using both approaches is consistent with geological map, whereas pyroxenite abundance maps show different patterns in their distribution as compared to the geological map. The results suggest that EnGeoMAP method has a better performance than ISMA method for mapping the dunite unit, whilst ISMA performs better for mapping peridotite and pyroxenite rocks.

AB  - The atmospheric correction of remote sensing data in the reflective domain is today very well controlled under clear sky conditions. However, cirrus clouds represent 2/3 of the global terrestrial cover, making several images unusable. Gao and Li [5] proposed an empirical method of thin cirrus correction. The method shows very good results on dark surfaces but presents bias higher than 0.02 when the surface becomes too reflective and the cirrus too thick. In addition, it only corrects for the upwelling path [7]. Simulations show that the presence of cirrus on the sun-to-ground path has a significant influence on the received signal and must also be corrected. This paper shows that considering the transmission term of the cirrus of the upwelling and downwelling paths improves the results in the red-edge but also the SWIR, with an RMSE divided by 2.

AB  - Many remote sensing applications require high spatial resolution images, but the elevated cost of these images makes some studies unfeasible. Single-image super-resolution algorithms can improve the spatial resolution of a low-resolution image by recovering feature details learned from pairs of low-high resolution images. In this work, several configurations of ESRGAN, a state-of-the-art algorithm for image super-resolution, are tested. We make a comparison between several scenarios, with different modes of upsampling and channels involved. The best results are obtained training a model with RGB-IR channels and using progressive upsampling.

AB  - In the last few years we have been witnessing with stupefaction the intensification of the majority of meteorological phenomena as a direct consequence of the global warming of the planet. The latter, occupies a preponderant place in scientific research, to define with precision its present and future repercussions on human life. For this purpose, a continuous and real-time monitoring of the physical quantities characterizing meteorological phenomena is necessary for their good understanding as well as their early detection and the triggering of alarms during emergency situations. Therefore, in this paper we focus on the development of an intelligent electronic sentinel, which will be able to collect, process environmental data to detect those meteorological phenomena that form in its direct vicinity. In this respect, our electronic sentinel will rely on artificial intelligence to enrich these knowledge bases and ensure the veracity of the phenomena it quantifies by avoiding triggering false alarms.

AB  - A classification method with multi-temporal images of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) combined with Geographic information system, geoinformation data, and field validation, was applied for wetland mapping accuracy and typology. Wetland mapping is vital for management and conservation, particularly under environmental pressures such as wetland drainage and land reclamation. The aim of this study is to develop an accurate mapping of wetlands and open water systems of the Lower Doce River Valley - LDRV (Southeastern Brazil) with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, using multitemporal classification techniques and ground truth validation. Sentinel-1B SAR imagery from 2016 and 2019 was processed with Google Earth Engine (GEE). Monthly median imagery condition for the rainy season was obtained and K-means unsupervised classification was applied. The study yields 4,157 wetlands, 262.27 km(2) with predominant small patches. Fieldwork revealed three main wetlands categories: coastal wetlands, inland wetlands and artificial wetlands. The results have shown an overall accuracy of 81.9% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.71. Wetlands, non-wetlands, and open waters classes present accuracy of 50, 80 and 95%, respectively.

AB  - In this work, spatial and temporal variations of aerosols parameters namely AOD, AI and AE were investigated with spatial resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees over Iraq (28.5 degrees-38.5 degrees N, 38.5 degrees- 48.25 degrees E); data have been retrieved from January 2008 to December 2017 by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were analyzed which can lead to modifications in the microphysics of clouds as well. The highest values for AOD and AI were observed in summer and spring, by contrast, minimum AOD and AI values were found in winter and autumn, while the highest values of AE were recorded in winter and autumn and the lower values were found in summer and spring. Furthermore, the relationships between AOD, AE and live cloud parameters, namely, cloud fraction (CF), water vapor (WV), cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius (CER), and precipitation (PPT) have been investigated by employing spatial correlation maps for their data values. The analysis showed a strong negative correlation between AOD and AE particularly in the western region (Rutba). AOD showed a negative relationship with COT in the whole of Iraq. AOD and CER presented a positive relation along the arid desert region extended from west northern region to the west southern region passing through the western region of Iraq. The correlation between AOD and CF showed a negative correlation (similar to-0.5). The correlation between AOD and WV was positive (similar to 0.7) especially in the stripe joint between the middle and the northern region. The relationship between AOD and PPT showed a negative correlation over whole of Iraq. The correlation results between AE and cloud parameter were opposite to that between AOD and cloud parameter except CER was the same correlation result for both. The correlations between AI and cloud parameters were also investigated. In present study, cluster analysis on 7-day isentropic air mass backward trajectories has been used for the all days of the year employing HYSPLIT model. Cluster analysis determines the air mass source regions, which were reached the different selected cities (Mosul, Baghdad, Rutba, Al-Nukhib, Nasiriyah and Basrah).

T2  - Tropicultura
M3  - Article
AB  - The city of Cap-Haitien in the north of Haiti, with a population that doubles every 20 years, records a rapid built-up expansion associated with the regression of its vegetation cover. Based on the interpretation of Landsat images of 1986, 2003 and 2017, land cover dynamics were evidenced through a mapping approach combined with analysis tools of landscape ecology. Data show that the built-up area in the city of Cap-Haitien increases threefold in three decades mainly at the expense of agricultural areas and degraded vegetation. The area of woody vegetation has been reduced by half in favor of agricultural areas, and degraded vegetation, but also of built-up areas to a lesser extent. Structural dynamics, supported by important population growth in the (peri)urban zone and agricultural development in the rural zone, have been characterized by the creation of anthropogenic patches (built-up, agricultural areas and degraded vegetation) as opposed to the dissection of the woody vegetation. Our results highlight the need to develop urgently a sustainable and adequate urban development plan to reverse these trends.

AB  - Forest fire is one disaster that can paralyze various human activities, both in land and air, which can reach hundreds of hectares and is routine in Indonesia. Mitigation is important to reduce the number of fires and the impact will not damage the ecosystem. Spatio-temporal analysis can be used to know the pattern of an event in a certain period. This makes it possible to identify the factors of events that affected by time and see the changes that occur on the surface of the earth. Data that are used include remote sensing data of rainfall, peatland, palm oil plantation, land cover, hotspot in certain period that is processed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The methods used include extraction of forest fire event parameter, mapping of hotspot and forest fire parameter, spatio-temporal analysis, forest fire mitigation identification. The extraction result obtained influential parameters, such as land cover, land use, rainfall, climate, river, and road. Structural mitigation such as the construction of canals and ditches can anticipate the spread of fires. Canals can also be used as a control factor for hydrology. Meanwhile, non-structural mitigation can be done through policy planning based on hotspot distribution modelling.

AB  - The work is devoted to the study of the effect of phycoerythrin pigment on the seawater optical properties in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. The investigation was carried out in the 79th expedition of the R / V "Akademik Mstislav Keldysh" in January 2020. At some stations, a high content of phycoerythrin was registered in the fluorescence spectra of seawater, the light absorption spectra by suspended particles, and in the remote sensed reflectance spectra of seawater. In particular, the fluorescence of this pigment induced by solar radiation was recorded in ocean color data. The presence of phycoerythrin can lead to uncertainties of the chlorophyll-a concentration estimates from satellite data retrieved with standard algorithms.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - With rapid deforestation and forest degradation ongoing in tropical regions, the maintenance of biodiversity and high biomass/carbon stocks can bring additional benefits to the sustainable management of natural forests along with sustainable timber production. However, the measures for improving the maintenance of biodiversity and high biomass are not well evaluated. For this study, we established vegetation plots in the Anap Sustainable Development Unit (ASDU) in Bintulu, Sarawak, including the Anap-Muput Forest Management Unit (AMFMU), in order to investigate the distribution of above-ground biomass and tree species diversity. Using a Landsat image, we mapped the distribution of above-ground biomass all over the ASDU as of 2009. This distribution of above-ground biomass inside the AMFMU was not well correlated with the time that had elapsed since the last cycle of logging. The topography of the area may in fact be a more important factor. In total, 986 tree species were recorded in 70 plots (covering 8.3 ha in total). The species richness was not obviously different between recently harvested forests and primary forests, demonstrating that it is not severely affected by logging activity. As the above-ground biomass and tree species richness cannot be predicted by the years after harvesting alone, adaptive management with continuous monitoring is necessary to maintain the benefits of sustainable forest management.

AB  - Land conservation decisions often overlook the ecological benefits associated with them. Multiple measures of ecosystem services need to be considered as a framework to evaluate potential areas of interest for conservation. In this research, we developed a conservation prioritization framework that incorporated data measures derived from openly available Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing data and used multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The proposed framework is implemented as an online geospatial conservation prioritization tool (CPT) for the Gulf Coast region of the United States. The CPT is built on a database of 19 measures developed in association with the interests of various stakeholders. Experimental results and feedback from stakeholders on the use of CPT indicate that the approach developed in this project is beneficial for strategizing conservation efforts.

TI  - An updated review on bluetongue virus: epidemiology, pathobiology, and advances in diagnosis and control with special reference to India
T2  - VETERINARY QUARTERLY
M3  - Review
AB  - Bluetongue (BT) is an economically important, non-contagious viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants. BT is caused by BT virus (BTV) and it belongs to the genus Orbivirus and family Reoviridae. BTV is transmitted by Culicoides midges and causes clinical disease in sheep, white-tailed deer, pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep, and subclinical manifestation in cattle, goats and camelids. BT is a World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) listed multispecies disease and causes great socio-economic losses. To date, 28 serotypes of BTV have been reported worldwide and 23 serotypes have been reported from India. Transplacental transmission (TPT) and fetal abnormalities in ruminants had been reported with cell culture adopted live-attenuated vaccine strains of BTV. However, emergence of BTV-8 in Europe during 2006, confirmed TPT of wild-type/field strains of BTV. Diagnosis of BT is more important for control of disease and to ensure BTV-free trade of animals and their products. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, agar gel immunodiffusion assay and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are found to be sensitive and OIE recommended tests for diagnosis of BTV for international trade. Control measures include mass vaccination (most effective method), serological and entomological surveillance, forming restriction zones and sentinel programs. Major hindrances with control of BT in India are the presence of multiple BTV serotypes, high density of ruminant and vector populations. A pentavalent inactivated, adjuvanted vaccine is administered currently in India to control BT. Recombinant vaccines with DIVA strategies are urgently needed to combat this disease. This review is the first to summarise the seroprevalence of BTV in India for 40 years, economic impact and pathobiology.

TI  - SELF-IDENTIFICATION OF PAGANS IN MODERN RUSSIA: THE PHENOMENON OF THE NAMES (according to the materials of field research)
T2  - TOMSKII ZHURNAL LINGVISTICHESKIKH I ANTROPOLOGICHESKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-TOMSK JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of the phenomenon of the name-bearing and the name of naming in the pagan movements of modern Russia. The principles of the choice and appropriation of the sacred name as a means of self-expression and self-identification of new pagans, their distancing from the current, traditionally formed on the basis of the Orthodox culture of the namesake, are explored. It is established that the onomastic space of neo-paganism does not repeat and does not overlap with the ancient pagan nomenclature. Focusing on the traditional pagan onomasticon, modern paganism reflects their own preferences in choosing a name. The choice of anonym and rite of naming are determined by the new conditions of existence and the relations of the spiritual world of modern man. The predominant names are, as a rule, a complex structure, with positive semantics. The axiological markers of the phenomenon of modern paganism are the concepts of goodness, light, glory, ethical categories, reassessment of one's own worldview, and worldview through the prism of a new name. The name, in the respondents' opinion, determines the changes in their lives, helps to broaden their horizons, self-knowledge, improve the quality of life. Acting as a social, cultural and individual marker, the new name is a means of self-identification not only of its individual bearers but of new pagan communities in general. The onomastic space of modern paganism unites the representatives of neo-paganism of any variant, current, sense, allowing to recognize "one's own" and "others" - others that are not related to modern paganism.

TI  - Images of Europeans in the Chinese Woodblock Book <i>Huangqing zhigongtu</i>
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the Chinese historical and ethnographic work of the second half of the 18th century "Illustrated tributaries of the Qing Empire" ("Huangqing zhigongtu"). This book provides rich material for a systematic analysis of the views of the Chinese about European countries during the reign of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Twenty eight images and descriptions of a number of European nations - Russians, Poles, Hungarians, Swedes, the English, the Dutch, etc. - which were found in the book, have been identified, classified, and analyzed. A range of issues and problems related to the content of the descriptions has been established and compared with the illustrations from the book. The article pays particular attention to identifying and explaining the anthropological and socio-cultural stereotypes that shaped the image of Europeans in China. The authors of this paper have found out that due to Catholic missionaries the Chinese compilers of "Huangqing zhigongtu" must have had enough information about Europe in the first part of the Qing period. Nevertheless, they made a large number of mistakes when describing the geographical location of several nations and relations between some of them. They also misunderstood some habits, traditions or anthropological features of their inhabitants. On the other hand, the compilers were more accurate and precise with regard to political and trade activities of the Europeans in China or near its frontier. Studying the "Huangqing zhigongtu" can shed light not only on important factors that formed the general picture of the Chinese worldview, but also contribute to a better understanding of motives that determined the foreign policy of the Qing Empire.

TI  - What controls fire spatial patterns? Predictability of fire characteristics in the Canadian boreal plains ecozone
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Most regulatory and certification agencies in Canada now require forest management plans to include some level of historical fire pattern approximation. As a result, sustainable forest management and enhancements to existing fire management policies and practices require a thorough understanding of the spatial fire patterns created and maintained by fire as well as the environmental conditions when they occur. To date, however, no boreal fire pattern study has examined relationships between the spatial arrangement of fire patterns, including vegetation remnants, and its main environmental top-down and bottom-up controls, based on a large number of fire events across large areas of the Canadian boreal forest. In this study, we leverage a recent, comprehensive, Landsat-derived fire pattern dataset that includes information on fire vegetation remnants for the Canadian boreal plains ecozone, covering 507 fires and 2.5 Mha, to characterize the predictability of six fire pattern metrics. We then compare these metrics to multiple top-down (monthly climate) and bottom-up (topography, fuels, natural barriers, and disturbance history) controls on fire behavior. To do so, we first reduced the fire pattern metrics to three principal components and used a random forest modeling approach to better understand the main environmental explanatory controls. Across this large number of fires, we identified three dimensions of fire patterns: compactness, or the complexity of the perimeter; patchiness, or the spatial heterogeneity in the burned patches; and residualness, or the amount of fire vegetation remnants within the burned patches. We found that patchiness was mostly conditioned by the land cover through variables characterizing the type and connectedness of the fuels; however, summer and spring drought were locally important. Compactness responded to a combination of the disturbance history, land cover, and summer drought. The presence of water resulted in less compact fires. Residualness was a function of the disturbance history, topography, and land cover. Fires in lower elevations presented the most variable patterns, in response to changes in the amount and types of fuel. This research offers an enhanced understanding of the hierarchical interactions between resulting fire patterns and environmental conditions that are critical to supporting management decisions.

CP  - European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD)
CL  - Wurzburg, GERMANY
AB  - In this paper, we investigate how to learn a suitable representation of satellite image time series in an unsupervised manner by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data. Additionally, we aim to disentangle the representation of time series into two representations: a shared representation that captures the common information between the images of a time series and an exclusive representation that contains the specific information of each image of the time series. To address these issues, we propose a model that combines a novel component called cross-domain autoencoders with the variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN) methods. In order to learn disentangled representations of time series, our model learns the multimodal image-to-image translation task. We train our model using satellite image time series provided by the Sentinel-2 mission. Several experiments are carried out to evaluate the obtained representations. We show that these disentangled representations can be very useful to perform multiple tasks such as image classification, image retrieval, image segmentation and change detection.

TI  - Retrieving Land Surface Temperature from Satellite Imagery with a Novel Combined Strategy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter for land cover analysis and for many fields of study, for example, in agriculture, due to its relationship with the state of the crop in the evaluation of natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and geothermal areas, in desertification studies, or in the estimation of several variables of environmental interest such as evapotranspiration. The computation of LST from satellite imagery is possible due to the advances in thermal infrared technology and its implementation in artificial satellites. For example, Landsat 8 incorporates Operational Land Imager(OLI) and Thermal InfraRed Sensor(TIRS)sensors the images from which, in combination with data from other satellite platforms (such as Terra and Aqua) provide all the information needed for the computation of LST. Different methodologies have been developed for the computation of LST from satellite images, such as single-channel and split-window methodologies. In this paper, two existing single-channel methodologies are evaluated through their application to images from Landsat 8, with the aim at determining the optimal atmospheric conditions for their application, instead of searching for the best methodology for all cases. This evaluation results in the development of a new adaptive strategy for the computation of LST consisting of a conditional process that uses the environmental conditions to determine the most suitable computation method.

TI  - Surface velocities and calving flux of the Academy of Sciences Ice Cap, Severnaya Zemlya
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - We have determined the ice-surface velocities of the Academy of Sciences Ice Cap, Severnaya Zemlya, Russian Arctic, during the period November 2016 - November 2017, using intensity offset-tracking of Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar images. We used the average of 54 pairs of weekly velocities (with both images in each pair separated by a12-day period) to estimate the mean annual ice discharge from the ice cap. We got an average ice discharge for 2016-2017 of 1,93 +/- 0,12 Gt a(-1), which is equivalent to -0,35 +/- 0,02 m w.e. a(-1) over the whole area of the ice cap. The difference from an estimate of similar to 1,4 Gt a(-1) for 2003-2009 can be attributed to the initiation of ice-stream flow in Basin BC sometime between 2002 and 2016. Since the front position changes between both periods have been negligible, ice discharge is equivalent to calving flux. We compare our results for calving flux with those of previous studies and analyse the possible drivers of the changes observed along the last three decades. Since these changes do not appear to have responded to environmental changes, we conclude that the observed changes are likely driven by the intrinsic characteristics of the ice cap governing tidewater glacier dynamics.

TI  - Reconstruction of the disturbance history of a temperate coniferous forest through stand-level analysis of airborne LiDAR data
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit information about stand-level Time Since the last stand-replacing Disturbance (TSD) is fundamental for modelling many forest ecosystem processes, but most of the current satellite remote sensing mapping approaches are based on change detection and time series analysis, and can detect only disturbances that have occurred since the start of the optical satellite data record. The spatial legacy of stand-replacing disturbances can however persist on the landscape for several decades to centuries, in the form of distinct horizontal and vertical stand structure features. We propose a new approach to reconstruct the long-term disturbance history of a forest, estimating TSD through stand-level analysis of LiDAR data, which are highly sensitive to the three-dimensional forest canopy structure. The study area is in the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest in north-central Idaho, where airborne LiDAR covering about 52,000 ha and ancillary TSD reference data for a period of more than 140 years were available. The root mean square difference (RSMD) between predicted and reference TSD was 17.5 years with a BIAS of 0.8 years; and on 72.8% of the stands the predicted TSD was less than 10 years apart from the reference TSD (78.2% of the stands when considering only disturbances occurred in the last 100 years). The results demonstrate that airborne LiDAR-derived data have enough explanatory power to reconstruct the long-term, stand-replacing disturbance history of temperate forested areas at regional scales.

AB  - The objective of this article is to evaluate the effectiveness implementation of the weather modification technology (WMT) for mitigating peatland fire disasters in Riau Province, Indonesia. The implementation of this WMT in Indonesia has been relatively new and challenging as this cutting-edge technology may increase the precipitation rates and therefore, it may reduce the risk of peat fire hazards in the huge massive areas. The Riau province has experienced serious peatland fire disasters from the period of 2014 to 2016. The evaluation of WMT in this article was focused on four regions within Riau encompassing Indragiri Hilir regency, Meranti Island, Pelalawan, and Siak. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data were used to calculate the precipitation rates. The method applied to evaluating the effectiveness of WMT was the Target Only Method (TOM). This method calculated the precipitation rates during the WMT period, which is compared to the historical precipitation data in a similar period. The total duration of a 3-year WMT implementation was 380 days, and the results were considered successful as an increase of precipitation rate (PCH) = 2.09 > 1.00. Hence, there was an increase in the average of precipitation rate during WMT period of 2014-2016 in Riau.

AB  - Northrop Grumman (NG) is developing a photonic waveguide-based imaging spectrometer that promises to dramatically reduce instrument size, weight and power and enable image acquisition in modes not possible with current hyperspectral imagers (HSIs). The objective of our current effort is to develop this novel hyperspectral technology for eventual application to the NASA Sustainable Land Imaging (SLI) mission. For more than 40 years the Landsat program has provided the Earth science community with highly accurate global multispectral imagery (MSI) to monitor our planet and ecosystems. Through extensive modeling and simulation NG has demonstrated that a versatile HSI sensor can meet the goals for a sustainable land imager. Our photonic spectrometer represents a step forward for hyperspectral imaging, providing a path to an extremely compact instrument that will provide fully co-registered spectral and spatial data across the instrument's field of view.

AB  - Wetlands are very important ecosystems, since they provide flood protection and pollutant dilution services, and harbor important habitats for birds and other wildlife Monitoring their water surface area is therefore important for understanding a wetland area's hydrological processes and for managing its water resources. The aim of this study were to analyze changes in the area of the perennial water body of the Laguna de Santiaguillo wetland, Durango, over time using GIS and remote sensing techniques, and to analyze whether there is a correlation between the wetland area and environmental variables such as temperature and humidity. The wetland nearly dried up completely in 2000, because during the preceding 10 years there had been almost no rain in the microbasins that provide water to La Laguna. In the last two years the water body has increased to 85.10 km(2). No significant correlation was found between variation in area of the wetland and changes in temperature or humidity. This may be due to management of the water resource, which is carried out by opening floodgates to meet the needs of the agricultural sector during periods of drought.

AB  - Electing a Prime Minister (PM) is a process that occurs every 5 years in India, through conducting an election. Who will win the election is one of the most asked questions on everyone's tongue, as the election is just few months away. The objective of this research is to predict the likelihood of PM Narendra Modi's chances to continue as the Prime Minister of India using Bayesian network approach. The aim of this research is not to develop a new predictive algorithm, but to use the existing approach for making predictions on a real-life scenario. Our Bayesian modeling is based on public responses available on social media, India statistics, and news articles on the key policies undertaken by PM Narendra Modi during his current tenure. We explore using causal and diagnostic reasoning to find new insights on the factors shaping his win or no-win, verdict on his government strength and weakness. Our Bayesian model reveals that the current Prime Minister Modi has 61.4% chances of winning the upcoming 2019 elections.

AB  - This study examine in detail what Lee kwang-soo’s pursuit of “Truth” was focused on “The Death of Lee Cha-Don”. First of all, this text that based on Buddhist world view reveals the ‘truth’ beyond the blind will of life through the death of Lee Cha-Don. The white blood he shedded symbolizes ‘truth’. In other words, this test could be regarded as an effort to suggest the principle of community unity by drawing a figure who pursues the truth of martyrdom. However, the problem, is that Lee Kwang-soo needed more mental power to break through the conditions of reality even though it was a necessary evil. In particular, in the mid-1930s, in the criticism of Lee Kwang-soo, the war as a necessary evil became a good for the future of humanity, and an ascetic attitude to exclude negative values was compulsively required. This study attempted to demonstrate the fact that the above contradiction lies within the text. It was that Lee Cha-don needed an obsessive and ascetic attitude of ‘purity’ on the road to ‘Truth’. In the text, all suffering and trials appear in the form of ‘seduction’ of women, and only by enduring these seduction and maintaining mental ‘purity’ is the way of truth. In particular, the ‘mercy’, which is essential in the Buddhist worldview, does not have a completely positive value due to the fear that it can take the form of seduction. The death of Lee Cha-don also has a strong personality of self-punishment that has not resisted the seduction of Princess. The text also reveals a cracking point that excludes negative values under the value of transcendence and integration. On the surface, Lee Cha-don is an ideal martyr, having nobility and sublime, but the logic that excludes negative others, and it is concluded that Lee-son must be punished. This is a crack in the narrative that deliberately excludes historical facts.

AB  - We estimated the spatio-temporally distributed soil moisture using Sentinel-1A/B SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) sensor images and soil moisture dataassimilation technique in South Korea. Soil moisture data assimilation technique can extract the hydraulic parameters of soils using observed soilmoisture and GA (Genetic Algorithm). The SWAP (Soil Water Atmosphere Plant) model associated with a soil moisture assimilation technique simulatesthe soil moisture using the soil hydraulic parameters and meteorological data as input data. The soil moisture based on Sentinel-1A/B was validatedand evaluated using the pearson correlation and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) analysis between estimated soil moisture and TDR soil moisture.The soil moisture data assimilation technique derived the soil hydraulic parameters using Sentinel-1A/B based soil moisture images, ASOS (AutomatedSynoptic Observing System) weather data and TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission)/GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) rainfall data. Thederived soil hydrological parameters as the input data to SWAP were used to simulate the daily soil moisture values at the spatial domain from 2001to 2018 using the TRMM/GPM satellite rainfall data. Overall, the simulated soil moisture estimates matched well with the TDR measurements andSentinel-1A/B based soil moisture under various land surface conditions (bare soil, crop, forest, and urban).

AB  - High throughput phenotyping, including remote sensing, is enabling new approaches to both breeding and precision farming techniques that improve agricultural efficiency. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely employed to collect remote sensing data for high throughput phenotyping. This approach provides high image resolution and rapid data acquisition. However, using UAVs to collect remote sensing is a labor-intensive process as a pilot is needed for each flight. As a result, UAV based approaches face challenges in scaling data collection to large field experiments conducted across multiple geographically remote field sites. Remote sensing data collected from satellites has continually to improve with current datasets providing sub-meter spatial resolution and re-visit time as frequent as once per day. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of employing high resolution satellite imagery for phenotyping small-plot plant breeding and agronomic trials. Vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery were compared to those extracted from an UAV-based multispectral camera and the yield in a small-plot (approx. 8 sq. m) maize trial. The preliminary result indicates that there is a strong and significant correlation between data derived from satellite and UAV imagery. Satellite based phenotyping of yield trial plots would enable evaluation of new crop varieties across larger numbers of geographically distinct locations, assisting in the development of more resilient and broadly adapted crops.

AB  - The goal of this research was to compare traditional and variable rate technology (VRT) nitrogen (N) fertilization in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The study was developed over two years in two different fields (one field per year). Three different N fertilization approaches applied to the second fertilization were compared by integrating NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data from Sentinel 2 satellites (S2), grain yield, and protein content. In both fields used for the experimentation, the three treatments were defined as follows: 1) a standard rate (Flat-N) derived by anNbalance approach; 2) a variable rate based on S2 NDVI, where the maximum rate was equal to the standard rate (Var-N-low); 3) a variable rate based on S2 NDVI, where the average rate was equal to the standard rate (Var-N-high). An inverse linear relationship between NDVI and N-rates was applied to calculate VRT doses on the assumption that NDVI and other correlated VIs, before the second N fertilization, are directly related to crop N nutritional status. Results show that differences between treatments in terms of NDVI, grain yield, and protein content were very low and generally not significant, suggesting that a low-N management approach, even using simple linear models based on NDVI and VRT, may considerably improve the economic and environmental sustainability of N fertilization in winter wheat. Further experiments are necessary to better explore the proposed approaches and compare them, by example, with the NDVI proportional methods that could be more suitable when the crop growth is mainly influenced by limiting factors other than N nutrition status.

AB  - Fires are one of the main causes of environmental degradation as they have an impact on flora and fauna, can also strongly influence ecological and geomorphological processes and permanently compromise the functionality of the ecosystems and soils on which they impact. The severity of the fire event influences the superficial hydrological response and the consequent loss of soil. Precipitation on the basins recently affected by fires produces an increase in the outflow which commonly transports and deposits large volumes of sediment, both inside and downstream of the burned area. In the years following the fire, the loss of soil is very high and the degradation processes of the soils are much greater than in the pre-event. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential annual loss due to post-fire erosion using remote sensing techniques, RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) methodology and GIS tecniques in nine different event occurred in 2019 in the northern part of the Apulia Region (Southern Italy). Geographic Information System techniques and remote sensing data have been adopted to study the post-fire soil erosion risk. Satellite images are the most appropriate for environmental monitoring as they provide high resolution multispectral optical images, infact are able to monitor the development of vegetation by assessing the water content an changes in chlorophyll levels. This study can be useful to spatial planning authorities as a tool for assessing and monitoring eroded soil in areas affected by fires, representing a useful tool for land management.

T2  - International journal of MCH and AIDS
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyze trends in HIV prevalence and risk factors associated with HIV infection among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Odisha State, India.METHODS: Data were from the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) among pregnant women, a descriptive cross-sectional study using consecutive sampling method and conducted in India. Data and samples were collected from pregnant women attending select antenatal clinics that act as designated sentinel sites in Odisha State, India, during the three months surveillance period and in three surveillance years: 2013, 2015, and 2017. All eligible pregnant women aged between 15 and 49 years, attending the sentinel sites for the first time during the surveillance period, were included. Information on their socio-demographic characteristics and blood samples were also collected.RESULTS: In total, 38,384 eligible pregnant women were included in the survey. Of these, 107 women were HIV positive, with an overall prevalence of 0.28%. HIV prevalence indicated a stabilizing trend between 2013 and 2017. However, pregnant women whose spouses were non-agricultural laborers, truck drivers, or migrants were significantly at higher risk of being infected. Likewise, HIV prevalence significantly increased over the years among pregnant women whose spouses were in the service sector (government or private). District-wise fluctuations in HIV prevalence was observed, with the district of Cuttack recording the highest prevalence among the districts.CONCLUSION AND GLOBAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: Women who are spouses of non-agricultural laborers, truck drivers or migrants need focused interventions, such as creating awareness on HIV and its prevention. Migration, due to poverty and its impact on sexually transmitted diseases among migrants from low and middle-income countries, have been documented globally. Single male migrant specific interventions are recommended to halt the disease progression among pregnant women and general population in Odisha, India.

AB  - The potential of satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors for Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) retrieval in Alpine areas is assessed in this study. X-band HH-polarized SAR backscatter from 2012-2015 images acquired by the COSMO-SkyMed constellation over the South Tyrol province in northern Italy is compared with SWE in-situ measurements and nivo-meteorological station records. The resulting relationship is compared with simulations based on the Dense Media Radiative Transfer - Quasi Mie Scattering (DMRT - QMS) model. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) machine learning techniques are trained and used for SWE retrieval from COSMO-SkyMed data. Good accuracy and small computational cost are observed for both ANN and SVR. The resulting SWE maps agree with snow conditions measured in-situ.

AB  - Data provided by spatial sensors combined with remote sensing techniques and analysis of the optical properties of waters allow the mapping of the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in aquatic bodies. For this, estimation models require data with the lowest possible amount of atmospheric artifacts. In this study we compared the water remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) of the Santo Antonio Hydroelectric Power Plant reservoir in Porto Velho-RO, Brazil, after applying three different atmospheric corrections algorithms in Sentinel-2/MS1 imagery products. The atmospheric corrected reflectances of the MODIS sensor were also used for reference. SSC was calculated with models based on the red and near-infrared (NIR) hands over three distinct regions of the reservoir. Reflectance data showed significant variations for Sentinel-2, hands 4 and 8a, and MODIS, hands RED and IR, when different atmospheric correction algorithms were used. SSC maps and estimates were produced to show sediment load variation as a function of hydrological regime. The analyzes showed that the SSC estimates done with Sentinel-2 / MSI satellite images using GRS (Glint Remove Sentinel) atmospheric correction presented an average difference of 27.3% and were the closest to the in situ measurements. SSC estimates from MODIS products were around 34.6% different from estimates made using the GRS atmospheric correction applied to Sentinel-2 I products.

TI  - COAST OF THE STATE OF PIAUI: PROPOSAL FOR COMPARTMENTATION
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work presents a proposal of compartmentation of the coast of Piaui State, based on the alignment of the coast, the predominance of materials and the typology of coastal forms, as well as the local morphodynamic processes. This compartmentation consists of a spatial reference at the state level, which makes it possible to guide land use and decision making for management purposes, by identifying units which present relative environmental homogeneity, according to their morphological characteristics and the types of processes involved. In order to carry out this research, a review of the literature, field works and observations of images Landsat and Google Earth was made, using techniques of geoprocessing. Considering that this stretch of the coast of Piaui has been classified as part of large compartments that sectorize the Brazilian coast, for a better knowledge of its environmental characteristics and management, this study proposes its classification in three local compartments: Deltaic Coast, Dune Coast and Estuarine Coast.

TI  - Implications of macroalgae blooms to the spatial structure of seagrass seascapes: The case of the <i>Anadyomene</i> spp. (Chlorophyta) bloom in Biscayne Bay, Florida
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Macroalgal blooms are becoming an increasing problem in coastal regions worldwide and have been associated with a widespread decline of seagrass habitats. It is critical to measure macroalgal bloom (MB) impacts at broad spatial scales since seagrass seascape characteristics can influence feedback processes that regulate the resilience of seagrass ecosystems. We assessed the broad-scale spatial impacts of an MB formed by Anadyomene spp. on the seagrass seascapes in Biscayne Bay (Miami, US) using a multi-scale seascape approach. By integrating field and remote sensing data, our multi-scale approach showed significant reductions in seagrass foliage cover and a seascape structure transformation across the bloom extent. The landscape cover and patch extensiveness declined after the MB peak. Other spatial pattern metrics also showed that the seagrass seascape structure got fragmented. We demonstrated that a persistent MB could transform the structure of seagrass seascapes, hindering the resilience of seagrass habitats.

AB  - In this paper we demonstrate, for the first time that, standard Level 2 SRAL altimeter data from Sentinel-3 can be used to estimate Internal Solitary Wave (ISW) amplitudes and surface velocities. A two-layer model is assumed based on the hydrostatic limit. The method is applied to Sentinel-3B data of the Banda Sea, where powerful ISWs emanate from a sill in the Ombai Strait in between Alor and Atauro Islands, one of the major passages of the Indonesian Through Flow. There, mean square slopes (<s(2)>) of surface waves are calculated from the dual-band altimeter on board Sentinel-3, showing strong variations across ISW crests that are easily detected in the SRAL. Sea Level Anomalies, appear to be reliable and consistent with expected sea level elevations owing to the passage of solitons of depression (i.e., with isopycnals displaced downwards). Fifteen cycles of Sentinel-3B data were analyzed in the study region.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in medullary thyroid microcarcinomas
T2  - ENDOCRINE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this prospective study was to analyze accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy with methylene blue dye for intraoperative detection of lateral metastases in clinically N0M0 medullary microcarcinomas with calcitonin <1,000 pg/mL and selection of true-positive patients for one-time therapeutic lateral dissection. In addition to total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection, all patients had bilateral sentinel biopsy of jugulo-carotid regions after methylene blue injection to decide upon necessity for lateral dissection. If sentinels were benign on frozen section, additional nonsentinels were extirpated, with no further lateral dissection. If sentinels were malignant, one-time lateral dissection was performed. 20 patients were included in this study. Hereditary disease form was observed in 3/20 (15%) of patients with RET prom-oncogene mutation C634F; remaining 17/20 (85%) were negative for germline mutations. There were no allergic reactions to methylene blue and identification rate of sentinels was 100%. In total, 2/20 (10%) cN0 patients had lymphonodal metastases, thus were reclassified as pNlb. Remaining 18/20 (90%) were classified pN0 based on standard pathohistology. Frozen section findings on sentinels were 100% match with standard pathohistology, and there were no skip metastases in lateral compartments. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of sentinel biopsy method with methylene dye and frozen section were 100%. Dzodic's sentinel lymph node biopsy method can be used for intraoperative assessment of lateral compartments and optimization of initial surgery of medullary microcarcinomas with calcitonin <1,000 pg/mL. This way, cN0 patients with sentinel metastases can receive one-time lateral dissection, and those without benefit from less extensive surgery.

AB  - Sustainable management in water resources development strategies depends on the knowledge of phenomena of changes in land use in the river basin as a significant tool in understanding the interactions of environment and human activities. Changes that occur within a certain period on the land cover or land use impacts the basin characteristics, which will ultimately affect river basin management. This paper studies the change of land use in the Lombok river basin in Indonesia based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land use/land cover data version 6 from the years of 2001, 2010, and 2016 which were derived using MODIS Terra and Aqua reflectance supervised classification data. Land use data was then classified into fifteen land use categories according to SWAT classification. QGIS and MapWindow software were applied to analyse the features of land use in the study area, and the SWAT simulation model was applied to simulate the impacts of changing land use in the subbasin. The study concludes that areas with occurrences of changes in land use impacted the river runoff in the sub-basin. Analysis of river basin land use, when combined with simulation in water resources management, will contribute to optimal and sustainable river basin planning.

AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) and its diurnal variation are important parameters for several applications. Thermal sensors in polar orbiting and geostationary orbiting satellites can provide LST data at high spatial and temporal resolutions respectively. This study aims to generate high spatiotemporal LST by combining the coarse resolution geostationary satellite data (INSAT 3D) with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product using spatial disaggregation (DisTrad model) and spatiotemporal fusion (STITFM model) techniques. In addition, the ability of these two methods to properly represent the diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) is also examined. It was found that the spatial disaggregation method provided relatively better results than spatiotemporal fusion technique in improving the spatiotemporal resolution of LST.

M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the analysis of Chinese historical or quasi-historical TV-series the article studies the views of the present-day Chinese people of state, nation, human rights and a person's duties towards the society, of the optimal methods of government and persons fit to govern, of China's role and place in the international relations system. The author singles out statism, monarchism, paternalistic expectations, chauvinism as the ideas explicitly or latently underlying this political ideological complex. Due to the considerable growth of modern Chinese women's economic status and independence, the author finds it necessary to pay special attention to the political worldview the historical cinematography presumes female audience to harbor or undertakes to impose upon them. The article shows that a number of political ideas have evolved from traditional to more modern forms because of the changes in the society, namely the view of female rulers has become more favorable; the idea of the civil and military officers' role in the state government has somewhat shifted; the image of a barbarian has acquired the features of the junior, sub-dominant partner in the friendly communication. Yet the author emphasizes the general tendency of Chinese political thought to preserve its direct continuity with the traditional political philosophy of ancient China as formulated in the wake of the Common Era.

AB  - The paper describes a method for constructing and developing algorithms for compressing hyperspectral aerospace images (AI) of hardware implementation for subsequent use in remote sensing Systems (RSS). The developed compression methods based on differential and discrete transformations are proposed as compression algorithms necessary for reducing the amount of transmitted information. The paper considers a method for developing compression algorithms, which is used to develop an adaptive algorithm for compressing hyperspectral AI using programmable devices. Studies have shown that the proposed algorithms have sufficient efficiency for use and can be applied on Board spacecraft when transmitting hyperspectral remote sensing data in conditions of limited buffer memory capacity and communication channel bandwidth.

AB  - Remote sensing provides a much more cost-effective and less time consuming alternative way to monitor land deformation than the traditional methods. In this study, land deformation changes in the Chapai Nawabgonj area of Bangladesh have been mapped using InSAR data acquired by the Sentinel-1 satellite between 2018 and 2019. The deformation rate was compared with two boreholes monitored by the Barind Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA). Significant ground deformation has been found in agreement with the field-level hydraulic head changes in the boreholes in the different time frames in the study area. K-means algorithm was applied to visualize clusters in a map to understand the subsidence rate in the area better. Subsidence was found in the summer, which indicates the decrease in water level, and uplift was found in the winter, which indicates the increase in water level.

AB  - This work constitutes an approach for the estimation of global solar radiation on 4 climatic zones of Senegal. These are the sites at Dakar, Saint Louis, Tambacounda and Ziguinchor. For this study, data from the Helioclim-3 database of the Meteosat-2 satellite are used as model inputs. For the validation process estimated data and meteorological observations were incorporated into the hourly values. The Clear Sky models of Bird & Hulstrom, Lacis & Hansen and Davies & Hay are simulated. They are based on the determination of the transmission coefficients of the various atmospheric constituents. These coefficients require the availability of current meteorological parameters (relative humidity, ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure) and geographical parameters of the site (latitude, longitude and altitude) and also of the solar position. A comparative study of the results obtained by simulation of the three models showed that the Bird & Hulstrom model gives a better estimate of the global component of solar irradiation. The errors between the values of the meteorological observations and those calculated are small for all 4 sites. The mean square errors are small between 10% and 20% and mean relative errors between 0.1% and 12%. The Bird & Hulstrom model was therefore finally chosen for the establishment of global hourly solar radiation over all four zones. The algorithm structure was built using R software.

AB  - This work aims to define the basic parameters for the automatic mapping of the channel between the Lagoa do Peixe and the Atlantic Ocean, which is located in the municipalities of Tavares and Mostardas, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. The automatic mapping is based on an unsupervised classification of Landsat 8 satellite images at the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. The images used were selected to present both channel situations (opened and closed). Three images were selected with acquisition dates that presented the open channel and three that presented the closed channel. Each image was classified using the K-means clustering method, using separately band 6, band 7 (both located at shortwave infrared - SWIR) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Once the number of clusters must be defined a priori by the analyst, as well as the training sample area, these parameters were tested over the dataset and clustering results were compared. All of the generated clusters maps were analyzed over 10 random points, identifying the clustering hits and errors. Due to the absence of reference maps, all the final clustering maps for each date were compared with the composite true color image from the same acquisition date. The NDWI cluster maps showed the best results in separating water and non-water pixels.

AB  - Hail is one of the risks that most frightens farmers and one of the few currently insured climatic-related phenomena. In the last years, a significant increase occurred of adverse events affecting crops, highlighting that ordinary strategies of insurance companies should migrate to a more dynamic management. In this work a prototype of service based on remotely sensed data is presented aimed at supporting evaluation of hail impacts on crops by mapping and qualifying areas damaged by hail. Further, a comparison was done testing effectiveness of approaches based on short term (i.e. with reference to images acquired immediately after the event) and long term (i.e. with reference to images acquired close to crop harvest) analysis. Investigation was solicited by the Reale Mutua insurance company and focused on a strong hailstorm occurred on 6th July 2019 in the Vercelli province (Piemonte - NW Italy). The analysis was based on Copernicus Sentinel-2 level 2A imagery. A times series made of 29 NDVI maps was generated for the growing season 2019 (from March to October) and analyzed at pixel level looking for NDVI trend anomalies possibly related to crop damages. Phenological behavior of damaged crops (NDVI local temporal profile) was compared with those of unharmed fields to verify and assess the impact of the phenomenon. Results showed evident anomalies along the local NDVI temporal profile of damaged cropped pixels, permitting a fine mapping of the affected areas. Surprisingly, short and long term approaches led to different conclusions: some areas, appearing significantly damaged immediately after the event, showed a vegetative recover with the proceeding of the growing season (temporary damages). Differently, some others showed that damages detected after the events never turned into a better situation (permanent damages). This new information could drive to considered a revision of the ordinary insurance procedures that are currently used by companies to certify and quantify damages of crops after adverse events. It can therefore said that, the high temporal resolution of the Copernicus Sentinel 2 mission can significantly contribute to improve evaluating procedures in the insurance sector by introducing temporal variables.

T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the study is due, on the one hand, to the insufficient knowledge of the semiotics of the Yakut epos olonkho, and on the other, the need to implement a new paradigm of modern science, which involves the convergence of scientific knowledge. It is noted that the fundamental categories in the worldview are the modes of space and time, which in total lead to another mode of being - a chronotope. The subject of this article is the codes of cosmological mythology in the texts of the epic olonkho from the perspective of a peculiar spatio-temporal organization of the epic world of olonkho. The purpose of the study is to decode the elements of mythology, as a result of which "compressed" messages about scientific knowledge that indicate the existence of a single source of typology of culture are found. Particular attention is paid to the variety of codes, the rules for their emergence, taking into account the national characteristics of language and thinking. A systematic approach to the subject of study, structural-semiotic analysis, methods of review and description are used in the study. The novelty of the study is in an attempt to partially solve the problem of the disunity of two types of cultures (folklore and fundamental laws of nature) in the context of a general typology of culture. This study indicates the prospects for further consideration and definition of the elements of a peculiar symbolic-semiotic system of space-time organization in the texts of the Yakut epos olonkho.

AB  - In general, a visual interpretation technique is adopted for mapping of Land Use / Land Cover (LULC) using temporal satellite data. Although highly accurate, the process is tedious, time consuming and requires a significant amount of domain knowledge. This limitation introduces a scope for partial automation to reduce manual effort involved in interpretation, while maintaining baseline accuracy. The research explores a novel multi-class training approach using a Deep Learning (DL) model to generate major LULC classes. Five spectral bands, namely Blue, Green, Red, Near-Infrared (NIR) and Short wave Infrared (SWIR) from the Sentinel-2A satellite, covering Mandya, Karnataka, India was used to train the model. An existing LULC map of the region was used as an input for automatically generating labeled training samples and a modified SegNet was implemented for classification. Four major LULC classes of interest - water bodies, forest lands, croplands, built-up were classified with an average F1 score of 0.84. The trained model applied to other regions has shown encouraging results which makes this an effective method to explore the generation of LULC maps.

TI  - Feasibility of preoperative tattooing of percutaneously biopsied axillary lymph node: an experimental pilot study
T2  - PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn the last three decades, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been replaced by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in all clinically node-negative patients. However, when SLNB alone is performed in clinically node-positive patients who are rendered node-negative by neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the procedure has a high false-negative rate and other complementary procedures have been described to improve its reliability. Preoperative tattooing of the suspicious lymph node with India ink at the time of biopsy, in addition to sentinel lymph node biopsy, is a reasonable alternative. The objective of our study is to determine, in clinically node-positive patients, the feasibility of tattooing suspicious axillary lymph node at the time of percutaneous needle biopsy and its retrieval at the time of surgery.MethodsA prospective experimental study will be conducted divided into two phases-phases I and II. In phase I, 10 patients committed to undergo upfront surgery (without neoadjuvant chemotherapy) will have a suspicious lymph node tattooed by injecting India ink at the time of core needle biopsy. All patients will undergo a SLNB, during which the axilla will be inspected to determine if the tattooed lymph node can be visualized. Routine microscopic examination will follow, and concordance between the sentinel and tattooed node will also be established. In phase II, the process will be repeated for 30 patients who undergo surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The analysis will be performed in Stata version 12.DiscussionThere is a need to identify and test the techniques for the down-staged axilla in post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients, which are not only practical and limit the number of invasive procedures necessary but are representative of the new axillary status and help limit the extent of axillary surgery without negatively impacting outcomes. We propose that, for the patient undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a biopsy-proven disease in the axilla, this could be achieved by India ink which allows marking, identification, and retrieval of the biopsied lymph node. Retrieval of this previously biopsied lymph node along with sentinel nodes, if found to be representative of the status of the remainder of the axilla, could potentially eliminate the need for routine axillary lymph node dissection and thus limit morbidity.Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03939598.

AB  - High-resolution satellite imagery was often used to study the spatial patterns and temporal changes by analyzing Land Use-Land Cover (LULC) changes using rapid urbanization, thereby increasing the impervious areas has an increasing effect on runoff in urban areas. The objective was to estimate the effects of temporal change based LULC on rainfall runoff. A LULC classified map of the year 1995 derived from the Landsat TM satellite image was used as input for a Runoff model with the precipitation data. A similar procedure is carried out with a LULC classified map of the year 2005 as an input into the model, along with similar precipitation data and calibration parameters. The comparison of the outcomes shows an increase in runoff volume and peak discharge between the times because of LULC.

AB  - Understanding how urban forest land cover responds to climate change requires knowledge of land-surface interaction processes, which control the degree to which interannual variability and mean trends in climatic variables affect the surface energy budget and by this forest vegetation. Urban forest represents unique areas for the detection of climatic change and the assessment of climate-related impacts. Effects of climate extremes and anthropogenic changes on urban/periurban forest systems in Romania can have both short-term and long-term implications for standing biomass, tree health and species composition. This paper used time series of normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) as well as leaf area index ( LAI) as a measurement indicators of forest dynamics at metropolitan scale in order to assess impacts of climate changes on forest ecosystem phenology in metropolitan area of Bucharest. Use of satellite remote sensing to monitor the forest changes due to climatic stressors is an excellent example of the value of multispectral, multiresolution and multitemporal observations. Fusion technique was applied to time series satellite imagery data (Landsat TM/ETM/OLI, Sentinel 2 and MODIS Terra/Aqua satellite data) for urban/periurban forest ecosystem of Bucharest metropolitan area in Romania over 2000-2019 period. Also, this paper addresses a number of issues related to changes in land surface temperature (LST), and analyses correlations between NDVI/EVI time series and climatic variables under different scenarios for summer heat waves, windstorms and heavy precipitation.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is dedicated to the political ideas of the 13th century Paris clergy, notably the ideas of clerics who studied in different years at the university of Paris. This period is reasonably associated with the rapid development of scholasticism and rationalism. The Sorbonne played a significant role in this process. Being in the center of discussions and conflicts, the university was gradually reconsidering some well-established political ideas. The most famous thinker of the 13th century who for some time was a part of this community was Thomas Aquinas whose works are still eagerly studied. However, the texts of many of his contemporaries are often deprived of well deserved attention. In particular, this concerns sermons and related sources. The aim of this study is to partially fill this gap and to broaden our perception of the worldview of the 13th century university clergy and of the then society in general.

TI  - ABOUT EFFECT OF WEEDS ON SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE PROPERTIES OF WINTER WHEAT CANOPY
T2  - Sel'skokhozyaistvennaya Biologiya
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the poorly studied factors affecting the spectral reflectivity of crops and, consequently, the success of detection of their condition based on remote sensing data is crop weedness. On the basis of field survey data, the effect of weed infestation on winter wheat spectral reflectivity at different stages of vegetation was analyzed using the example of individual fields in the Tula region with chernozems, grey forest, and alluvial arable soils. Under field conditions, crop weedness, spectral reflectance of crops, weeds, winter wheat leaves and soil was determined using FieldSpec HandHeld 2 (TM) field spectro-radiometer (ASD, Inc., USA) was assessed several times during the growing season, and the crop surface was photographed. The decoding of the photos showed that the projective weed coverage on the crop surface is low enough at the beginning and middle of the wheat growing season, but increases significantly since the beginning of leaves yellowing. At the same time, the projective coverage of weeds in the field with chernozems was minimal at the beginning and middle of the growing season, and maximal - by the end of the growing season. Projective coverage of weeds on fields with grey forest and alluvial arable soils did not differ statistically, but on alluvial soils it increased significantly by the end of wheat vegetation. Using the spectral mixing model, the contribution of weeds infestation to the integral reflection of light by crops in the visible and near infrared bands of the electromagnetic waves was estimated. It has been found that despite the rather high weedness of winter wheat canopy in the spring-summer growing season, its projective coverage on the surface of the crop canopy is small. The magnitude of the projective cover of weeds on the surface of crop canopy weakly depends on soil conditions, and is more determined by other factors (history of fields use, crop rotation, etc.). The effect of weed vegetation on the spectral reflectivity of crops changes over time. It is minimal at the peak of the growing season, accounting for several percent for all wavelengths of the visible and near IR range. At the beginning of the post-winter vegetation period, the contribution of weed vegetation to the spectral reflectance of crops can reach 1020 %, and at the end of the vegetation season, weed vegetation can predetermine the spectral appearance of crops at most wavelengths of the considered range. The greatest contribution is observed in all cases in the near IR (710-730 nm) and in the green (520-560 nm) spectral region, but at certain times there are local maxima of the contribution and in the blue spectral region of electromagnetic waves (400-420 nm). The data obtained open up the possibility for the development of new vegetation indices for remote monitoring of crops, which will be less affected by weedness than those traditionally used (for example, NDVI). Conversely, on the basis of the data obtained, special vegetation indices can be proposed for the remote detection of the weedness of winter wheat canopy.

TI  - ESTIMATING IN-SEASON ACTUAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION OVER A LARGE-SCALE IRRIGATION SCHEME IN RESOURCE-LIMITED CONDITIONS
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE BULGARE DES SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable and readily available data on actual evapotranspiration (ETa) over large-scale areas throughout the crop growing season are critical for improved agricultural irrigation and water resource management. On-site data collection is costly, labour-intensive, and very challenging in resource-limited conditions. Thus, open-source satellite-based approaches might be adopted as cost-effective alternatives. In this study, the performance of a cost-effective and open source satellite-based approach for estimating ETa over a large-scale (1200 ha) irrigation system, the Kou Valley Irrigation Scheme (KVIS), in Burkina Faso was assessed. ETa values over the critical irrigation period during the 2014 dry season (January-April) were estimated using the Python module for Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model (PySEBAL). Then, they were compared against the Water Productivity Open-access (FAO-WaPOR), and United States Geological Survey-Famine Early Warning Systems Network Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (USGS-FEWS NET's SSEBop) ETa over the same period at different temporal scales. Overall, ETa values were satisfactorily estimated throughout the crop growth season across the Kou Valley irrigation scheme using PySEBAL. They spatially varied depending on the soil type and crop, with daily values ranging from 4.09 mm day(-1) to 7.7 mm day(-1), for a seasonal average of 619 mm. The finer spatial resolution (30 m) of PySEBAL outputs allowed better estimations compared to the FAO-WaPOR and SSEBop-based approaches. Our findings help ascertain the use of the PySEBAL model in semi-arid environment in Burkina Faso, and could serve as a basis for developing strategies for improved irrigation water management in countries experiencing similar conditions such as Burkina Faso.

TI  - An Intelligent Gas Pipeline Route Alignment System
T2  - APPLICATIONS OF GEOMATICS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Geomatics in Civil Engineering (ICGCE)
CL  - Roorkee, INDIA
AB  - Pipeline is one of the premier means of transportation for petroleum products. Optimizing the cost, time of construction and environmental considerations for pipeline route, depends on the determination of optimal route for pipeline alignment. In this paper, an intelligent system capable of identifying optimal (based on cost, engineering criteria, and environmental issues) land corridor for alignment of natural gas pipeline from source to destination within onshore has been proposed. Accessing results by analyzing large datasets is achieved through spatialmulti-criteria decisionmaking strategy. Apreliminary implementation of the proposed system is being done to identify land corridor for alignment of gas pipeline from Shahdol (Latitude 23 18' 07 '' N and Longitude 81 21' 24 '' E inMadhya Pradesh, India) to Phulpur (Latitude 25 33' 03 '' N and Longitude 82 05' 18 '' E in Uttar Pradesh, India). Slope, crossings (road networks, rail tracks, rivers etc.), forests, vegetation and costs have been considered as criteria for identification of optimal land corridor. For implementation and analysis of the proposed work, Landsat 8 images, having spatial resolution 30 m, are used for analysis purpose. The study also made use of state boundary, road network, river network, elevation, and land cover type data. Data layers for analysis have been created using distance criteria. Finally, different layers of criteria have been merged using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) algorithm to de ne two cost layers the Cost Distance Layer and Cost Direction Layer. Finally, depending on guiding criteria, the least cost path from source to destination station has been identified as the optimal land corridor for alignment of gas pipeline. To make the system more intelligent is the future scope of this work.

TI  - Continuing the MODIS Dark Target Aerosol Time Series with VIIRS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For reflected sunlight observed from space at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, particles suspended in Earth's atmosphere provide contrast with vegetation or dark water at the surface. This is the physical motivation for the Dark Target (DT) aerosol retrieval algorithm developed for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). To extend the data record of aerosol optical depth (AOD) beyond the expected 20-year lifespan of the MODIS sensors, DT must be adapted for other sensors. A version of the DT AOD retrieval for the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi-National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) is now mature enough to be released as a standard data product, and includes some upgraded features from the MODIS version. Differences between MODIS Aqua and VIIRS SNPP lead to some inevitable disagreement between their respective AOD measurements, but the offset between the VIIRS SNPP and MODIS Aqua records is smaller than the offset between those of MODIS Aqua and MODIS Terra. The VIIRS SNPP retrieval shows good agreement with ground-based measurements. For most purposes, DT for VIIRS SNPP is consistent enough and in close enough agreement with MODIS to continue the record of satellite AOD. The reasons for the offset from MODIS Aqua, and its spatial and temporal variability, are investigated in this study.

TI  - Satellite-Based Fire Progression Mapping: A Comprehensive Assessment for Large Fires in Northern California
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based active fire (AF) products provide opportunities for constructing continuous fire progression maps, a critical dataset needed for improved fire behavior modeling and fire management. This study aims to investigate the geospatial interpolation techniques in mapping the daily fire progression and assess the accuracy of the derived maps from multisensor AF products. We focused on 42 large wildfires greater than 5000 acres in Northern California from 2017 to 2018, where the USDA Forest Service National Infrared Operations (NIROPS) daily fire perimeters were available for the comparison. The standard AF products from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS), and the combined products were used as inputs. We found that the estimated fire progression areas generated by the natural neighbor method with the combined MODIS and VIIRS AF input layers performed the best, with R-2 of 0.7 +/- 0.31 and RMSE of 1.25 +/- 1.21 (10(3) acres) at a daily time scale; the accuracy was higher when assessed at a two-day rolling window, e.g., R-2 of 0.83 +/- 0.20 and RMSE of 0.74 +/- 0.94 (10(3) acres). A relatively higher spatial accuracy was found using the 375 m VIIRS AF product as inputs, with a kappa score of 0.55 and an overall accuracy score of 0.59, when interpolated with the natural neighbor method. Furthermore, the locational pixel-based comparison showed 61% matched to a single day and an additional 25% explained within +/- 1 day of the estimation, revealing greater confidence in fire progression estimation at a two-day moving time interval. This study demonstrated the efficacy and potential improvements of daily fire progression mapping at local and regional scales.

AB  - Project: Data Assimilation for Improved Characterization of Fluxes across Compartmental Interfaces - Model simulations of water and energy fluxes in the subsurface-landsurface-atmosphere system (SLAS) are important ingredients to climate and weather prediction, flood forecasting, water resources management, agriculture, and water quality control. Due to the immense scale complexity of terrestrial systems already the estimation of its state - which is a prerequisite of any prediction - is often insufficient despite the wealth of observations available nowadays from in-situ and remote sensing.Data assimilation optimally exploits observations for the estimation of system state evolution, but different philosophies and methods exist in the geoscientific disciplines of meteorology, surface, vadose-zone and groundwater hydrology concerning the structure of SLAS models and its use in data assimilation.In order to improve predictions for terrestrial systems we believe that a unified data assimilation framework is essential including simulation platforms that treat the SLAS in an integrated fashion and avoid compartmentalization of the terrestrial system. The development of such a data assimilation framework is the prime objective of the Research Unit.Homepage of project see: http://for2131.de/All simulations were conducted on the JUQUEEN and JUWELS supercomputers at Julich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) at Forschungszentrum Julich.

TI  - Multicenter study comparing oncologic outcomes after lymph node assessment via a sentinel lymph node algorithm versus comprehensive pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy in patients with serous and clear cell endometrial carcinoma
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To compare survival after nodal assessment using a sentinel lymph node (SLN) algorithm versus comprehensive pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy (LND) in serous or clear cell endometrial carcinoma, and to compare survival in node-negative cases.Methods: Three-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival were compared between one institution that used comprehensive LND to the renal veins and a second institution that used an SLN algorithm with ultra-staging with inverse-probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) derived from propensity scores to adjust for covariate imbalance between cohorts.Results: 214 patients were identified (118 SLN cohort, 96 LND cohort). Adjuvant therapy differed between the cohorts; 84% and 40% in the SLN and LND cohorts, respectively, received chemotherapy +/- radiation therapy. The IPTW-adjusted 3-year RFS rates were 69% and 80%, respectively. The IPTW-adjusted 3-year OS rates were 88% and 77%, respectively. The IPTW-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the association of surgical approach (SLN vs LND) with progression and death was 1.46 (95% CI: 0.70-3.04) and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.19-1.02), respectively. In the 168 node-negative cases, the IPTW-adjusted 3-year RFS rates were 73% and 91%, respectively. The IPTW-adjusted 3-year OS rates were 88% and 86%, respectively. In this subgroup, IPTW-adjusted HR for the association of surgical approach (SLN vs LND) with progression and death was 3.12 (95% CI: 1.02-9.57) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.24-1.95), respectively.Conclusion: OS was not compromised with the SLN algorithm. SLN may be associated with a decreased RFS but similar OS in node-negative cases despite the majority receiving chemotherapy. This may be due to differences in surveillance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Marine Heatwave Tracker
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - The code base in this release of the Marine Heatwave Tracker software provides all of the tools necessary to download, process, and visualise marine heatwaves (MHWs) globally. This web application may be set up to show the occurrence of MHWs around the world in near-real-time (roughly a one-two day delay) with the use of a cron job that runs a bash script calling 'MHW_daily.R'. The Tracker also show the historic records for the entire planet going back to January 1st, 1982. There are several other data layers offered in the Tracker. Please see the 'How do I use this?' section on the app for further details (http://www.marineheatwaves.org/tracker.html). A MHW is generally defined as when the temperature in a given location is in the top 10% of temperatures ever recorded during that time of year for at least 5 straight days. For example, if the coastal waters off Durban in South Africa are roughly 22degreesC on any given April 1st, if temperatures in excess of perhaps 28degreesC are recorded there in 2019 over March 28th to April 10th, this could be flagged as a MHW. This is a definition for MHWs first put forward by Hobday et al. 2016. {"references": ["Hobday, A. J., Alexander, L. V., Perkins, S. E., Smale, D. A., Straub, S. C., Oliver, E. C., ... & Holbrook, N.

AB  - Wetlands, particularly in developing countries, are common hotspots of insect-borne diseases that are a constant threat to public health, such as malaria. To help identify and characterize potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes, we utilize freely available satellite image data and software in combination with a mosquito trap system. Multispectral time-series analysis of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 5-8 satellite images of Lake Schmiechen (Swabian Alb, southern Germany), used here as a pilot and analog site for other lake and wetland areas potentially populated by malaria vector mosquitoes, reveals non-seasonal periods of flooding and drying and concomitant changes in the distribution of open shallow water. Water distribution maps are derived from spectral indices commonly used for wetland mapping (e.g., the NDWI2) and should be ground-truthed. In combination with the identification and counting of mosquitoes and the integration of other environmental parameters on-site, this approach provides a powerful tool to remotely monitor relatively small bodies and narrow networks of open shallow water that may provide habitats for mosquitoes. Combined remote sensing and on-site monitoring of potential malaria vector habitats can be implemented at low cost and with little effort in regions worldwide where the disease is established or emerging, and can be used to create or refine risk maps on small to large scales. The present approach can, moreover, complement public health programs and humanitarian efforts to fight insect-borne diseases.

TI  - Does cumulative exposure to traumatic stressors predict treatment outcome of community-implemented exposure-based therapy for PTSD?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is associated with high levels of functional impairments such as difficulties in academic or occupational performance and in social relationships. With an increasing number of traumatic event types experienced (trauma load), PTSD risk increases in a dose-dependent manner. Accordingly, high rates of PTSD can impair the reconstruction process in post-conflict societies. In order to meet these high needs for mental health services in societies with little access to professional care, task shifting approaches and community-based interventions have been suggested. Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) has been developed as a short and pragmatic exposure-based PTSD treatment that can be easily trained to lay personnel. Yet, it remains unclear whether NET can be effectively provided by trained lay counsellors even at high levels of trauma load.Objective: To investigate whether trauma load influences the treatment effectiveness of NET provided by trained and supervised local lay counsellors.Method: Linear mixed models were calculated to investigate the influence of trauma load on treatment effectiveness in a sample of N = 323 rebel war survivors from Northern Uganda with PTSD.Results: We found a strong reduction of PTSD symptoms following NET, which was not influenced by trauma load. However, individuals with higher levels of trauma load reported higher PTSD symptoms before therapy as well as 4 and 10 months following treatment completion compared to individuals with lower trauma load.Conclusions: Treatment with NET by lay counsellors is effective independent of trauma load. However, individuals with higher trauma load have a higher probability to show residual symptoms, which might require additional time, sessions or treatment modules.

TI  - The value of monitoring wildlife roadkill
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The number of wildlife-vehicle collisions has an obvious value in estimating the direct effects of roads on wildlife, i.e. mortality due to vehicle collisions. Given the nature of the data-species identification and location-there is, however, much wider ecological knowledge that can be gained by monitoring wildlife roadkill. Here, we review the added value and opportunities provided by these data, through a series of case studies where such data have been instrumental in contributing to the advancement of knowledge in species distributions, population dynamics, and animal behaviour, as well as informing us about health of the species and of the environment. We propose that consistently, systematically, and extensively monitoring roadkill facilitates five critical areas of ecological study: (1) monitoring of roadkill numbers, (2) monitoring of population trends, (3) mapping of native and invasive species distributions, (4) animal behaviour, and (5) monitoring of contaminants and disease. The collection of such data also offers a valuable opportunity for members of the public to be directly involved in scientific data collection and research (citizen science). Through continuing to monitor wildlife roadkill, we can expand our knowledge across a wide range of ecological research areas, as well as facilitating investigations that aim to reduce both the direct and indirect effects of roads on wildlife populations.

TI  - A Spatially Transferable Drought Hazard and Drought Risk Modeling Approach Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought adversely affects vegetation conditions and agricultural production and consequently the food security and livelihood situation of the often most vulnerable communities. In spite of recent advances in modeling drought risk and impact, coherent and explicit information on drought hazard, vulnerability and risk is still lacking over wider areas. In this study, a spatially explicit drought hazard, vulnerability, and risk modeling framework was investigated for agricultural land, grassland and shrubland areas. The developed drought hazard model operates on a higher spatial resolution than most available drought models while also being scalable to other regions. Initially, a logistic regression model was developed to predict drought hazard for rangelands and croplands in the USA. The drought hazard model was cross-verified for the USA using the United States Drought Monitor (USDM). The comparison of the model with the USDM showed a good spatiotemporal agreement, using visual interpretation. Subsequently, the explicit and accurate USA model was transferred and calibrated for South Africa and Zimbabwe, where drought vulnerability and drought risk were assessed in combination with drought hazard. The drought hazard model used time series crop yields data from the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) and biophysical predictors from satellite remote sensing (SPI, NDVI, NDII, LST, albedo). A McFadden's Pseudo R-2 value of 0.17 for the South African model indicated a good model fit. The plausibility of the drought hazard model results in southern Africa was evaluated by using regional climate patterns, published drought reports and a visual comparison to a global drought risk model and food security classification data. Drought risk and vulnerability were assessed for southern Africa and could also be spatially explicit mapped showing, for example, lower drought vulnerability and risk over irrigated areas. The innovative aspect of the presented drought hazard model is that it can be applied to other countries at a global scale, since it only uses globally available data sets and therefore can be easily modified to account for country-specific characteristics. At the same time, it can capture regional drought conditions through a higher resolution than other existing global drought hazard models. This model addressed the gap between global drought models, that cannot spatially and temporally explicitly capture regional drought effects, and sub-regional drought models that may be spatially explicit but not spatially transferable. Since we used globally available and spatially consistent data sets (both as predictors and response variables), the approach of this study can potentially be used globally to enhance existing modelling routines, drought intervention strategies and preparedness measures.

M3  - Article
AB  - We are publishing two short pieces by Otto Neurath, a key figures in the Vienna Circle of logical empiricists, but also a social scientist close to the milieu of Austro-Marxism: ???Bourgeois Marxism. A Review Essay on Karl Mannheim, Ideologie und Utopie??? (Der Kampf, 1930) and ???Worldview and Marxism??? (Der Kampf, 1931). The translations are preceded by the editor???s/translator???s introduction. Neither piece seems to have been pre-viously translated. The critique of Mannheim will be of particular interest to sociologists as it represents a trenchant response to Ideology and Utopia. For Neurath, Mannheim appropriates Marxist ideas for ???bourgeois sociology??? and metaphysics. The second piece presents a brief non-technical account of the logical empiricist interpretation of Marxism from which Neurath???s critique is launched.

AB  - Eelgrass acts as a natural habitat for a wide range of species and maintains many important ecosystem functions. However, many researchers along the U.S. west coast have noticed a recent decline in eelgrass populations and have begun researching the possible causes for this decline. One of those causes, eelgrass wasting disease, has been drawing the attention of researchers from multiple fields and universities, including the University of Central Florida. Funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), we utilize GIS and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for remote sensing data collection and analysis that demonstrated important findings. This drone mapping fieldwork will be conducted annually to compare spatio-temporal changes in certain measured environmental factors, such as eelgrass abundance and related environmental factors. For the benefit of future GIS research into eelgrass, other research institutes in collaboration were taught proper drone flight protocols as well as GIS processing.

We applied a change detection method that exploits temporal NDVI dynamics associated with charcoal production. This forest degradation temporal sequence exposes the magnitude and the spatial and temporal dynamics of charcoal production, which is the main forest degradation driver in sub-Saharan Africa. The annual area under charcoal production has been steadily increasing since 2008 and reached 11 673 ha in 2018. The total forest degraded extent in the study area during the 10-year study period covered 79 630 ha, which represents 68% of the available mopane woodlands in 2008. Only 5% of the available mopane woodlands area remain undisturbed in the study area. Total gross carbon emissions associated charcoal production during this 10-year period were estimated in 1.13 Mt. These results mark forest degradation from charcoal production as the main driver of forest cover change in southern Mozambique. They also denote that, while charcoal production may be relatively localized in space, its implications for forest cover change and carbon emissions in a sub-Saharan African context are relevant at larger geographical scales. This study represents a proof of concept of the feasibility of medium resolution Earth observation data to monitor forest degradation from charcoal production in the context of the growing urban energy demand. It also highlights the potential opportunities to improve REDD+ monitoring, reporting and verification efforts in sub-Saharan Africa as a first step toward designing effective management and policy interventions.

AB  - Similarly to other scientific domains, Deep Learning (DL) holds great promises to fulfil the challenging needs of Remote Sensing (RS) applications. However, the increase in volume, variety and complexity of acquisitions that are carried out on a daily basis by Earth Observation (EO) missions generates new processing and storage challenges within operational processing pipelines. The aim of this work is to show that High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems can speed up the training time of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Particular attention is put on the monitoring of the classification accuracy that usually degrades when using large batch sizes. The experimental results of this work show that the training of the model scales up to a batch size of 8,000, obtaining classification performances in terms of accuracy in line with those using smaller batch sizes.

AB  - Remote sensing technology has long been applied in many fields of studies, especially in structural geology and mineral exploration, where remote sensing is useful for lineaments and structural feature extraction. In this study, Landsat ETM-7 satellite data have been used and band-8 is proved to be the most suitable band in automatic delineation. The automatic lineament extraction process has been carried out with LINE module of "PCI Geomatica" based on automatic detection algorithms. The lineaments analysis is conducted through the study of geospatial information incorporating the length, density, and direction of lineaments in order to acquire knowledge about the characteristics and proprieties of the geological structures. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the result of the automatic lineament extraction method and therefore to investigate its ability to give real results in comparison with the fault map.

AB  - A different top-dressing fertilization gradient was applied to four separate study areas across a wheat field in Cordoba, Argentina. Sentinel-2 derived vegetation indexes were computed to assess nitrogen monitoring capacities. The vegetation indexes using the red edge wavelength region showed a high capacity to sense nitrogen status with high urea inputs (300 kg/ha). VIs using the visible part of the spectrum did not report accurate values for fertilization monitoring. The higher revisit time and red-edge hands of Sentinel-2 showed to be an advantage, revealing the potentialities to coordinate a remote sensing fertilization monitor platform in the region with further studies.

TI  - DIDACTIZATION OF THE RUSSIAN GERMANS' LITERATURE: A LESSON DEVOTED TO VICTOR KLEIN'S POEM "JUNGENGESPRACH"
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the urgent problems of studying national literatures is the need for didactization of literary works. Such a problem is faced by the literature of Russian Germans. In order for Russian-German literature to become a subject of study at school lessons, as well as at universities, it is important not only to organize the process, but also to didacticize it, i.e. to create the necessary methods support materials of the lessons.The reader is offered a plan-summary of the work of the author - Russian German Victor Klein. The purpose of the study is to consider the content and structure of Victor Klein's poem "Jungengesprach" in the aspect of didactization. The aim of the lesson is to stimulate a holistic analysis of the poem "Jungengesprach" in the context of the artistic originality of Victor Klein's poetry.The target audience of the lesson: students of the Institute of Ethnocultural Education (Moscow), for whom the author of the article wrote a curriculum in the literature of Russian Germans, and students of philological faculties, studying German. The equipment and materials used comprise the works by Victor Klein, memoires about him, illustrative material for the lesson (portraits of Victor Klein and his contemporaries, covers of his books), a projector, a geographical map of the Soviet Union, handouts (cards), and audio recordings of the memoires about Victor Klein.The methods tools include elements of discussion, a form of a "round table", elements of a conference, communication in "small polemical groups", basket method, expressive reading, melodic recitation, graphic schemes, and an experiment with an archreader.Since the German language is simultaneously one of the languages of world significance and one of the languages of the peoples of Russia, the literature of Russian Germans is an educational material that is indicative for the study of both Germanic and the ethnic worldview and culture of one of the minorities of Russia. The lesson based on Victor Klein's poem "Jungengesprach" is aimed at creating an individual pattern of perception of this work in each reader: how many readers, so many poems of "Jungengesprach". The emphasis during the lesson is on the formation of the students' worldview as a three-dimensional, polyocular picture, including ethnic diversity.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Retrieval from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 over Rural Areas: Assessment of Different Retrieval Algorithms and Emissivity Models and Toolbox Implementation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an important parameter for many scientific disciplines since it affects the interaction between the land and the atmosphere. Many LST retrieval algorithms based on remotely sensed images have been introduced so far, where the Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) is one of the main factors affecting the accuracy of the LST estimation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of LST retrieval methods using different LSE models and data of old and current Landsat missions. Mono Window Algorithm (MWA), Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) method, Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) and Split Window Algorithm (SWA) were assessed as LST retrieval methods processing data of Landsat missions (Landsat 5, 7 and 8) over rural pixels. Considering the LSE models introduced in the literature, different Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-based LSE models were investigated in this study. Specifically, three LSE models were considered for the LST estimation from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and seven Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and six for Landsat 8. For the accurate evaluation of the estimated LST, in-situ LST data were obtained from the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) stations. In total, forty-five daytime Landsat images; fifteen images for each Landsat mission, acquired in the Spring-Summer-Autumn period in the mid-latitude region in the Northern Hemisphere were acquired over five SURFRAD rural sites. After determining the best LSE model for the study case, firstly, the LST retrieval accuracy was evaluated considering the sensor type: when using Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+, and 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data separately, RTE, MWA, and MWA presented the best results, respectively. Then, the performance was evaluated independently of the sensor types. In this case, all LST methods provided satisfying results, with MWA having a slightly better accuracy with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) equals to 2.39 K and a lower bias error. In addition, the spatio-temporal and seasonal analyses indicated that RTE and SCA presented similar results regardless of the season, while MWA differed from RTE and SCA for all seasons, especially in summer. To efficiently perform this work, an ArcGIS toolbox, including all the methods and models analyzed here, was implemented and provided as a user facility for the LST retrieval from Landsat data.

TI  - Breast cancer hormone receptor negativity, triple-negative type, mastectomy and not receiving adjuvant radiotherapy were associated with axillary recurrence after sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be avoided in selected patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). However, regional lymph node recurrence may occur after SLN biopsy (SLNB). This study aimed to identify the risk factors for axillary recurrence to ensure safe axillary surgery.Methods: Between June 2004 and December 2017, a total of 1056 women underwent SLNB without ALND. Patient data were prospectively entered into the breast cancer database at Kawaguchi Municipal Medical Center. From October 2012, we did not perform ALND in patients with (a) 1 or 2 positive SLNs, (b) positive SLNs that were unmatted or did not show gross extra nodal extension, (c) a clinical tumor size <= 5 cm, and in (d) those who received adjuvant endocrine therapy or chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Subsequently, appropriate adjuvant systemic and/or radiation treatment was administered.Results: Of the 1056 patients included, 996 had negative SLNs, 49 had positive SLNs, and 11 had undetectable SLNs. The identification rate for SLNs was 99.0%, and the median number of removed SLNs was 2. During the median 6.9- year follow-up period, 10 patients (1.0%) showed axillary recurrence without SLNs metastasis. Hormone receptor negativity (p < 0.01), triple-negative type (0.047), mastectomy (<0.01) and not receiving adjuvant radiotherapy (<0.01) were significantly related to axillary recurrence.Conclusion: ALND can be safely avoided in selected patients with early breast cancer. Patients with hormone receptor-negative tumors, especially triple-negative breast cancer, patients who underwent mastectomy without ALND or those who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy should be followed up carefully.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy of primary apocrine sweat gland carcinoma of the axilla: A case report and review of the literature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Primary apocrine sweat gland carcinoma (PASGC) is a rare subtype of sweat gland carcinoma, mostly occurring in the apocrine-dense regions such as the axilla, areola, and scalp.PRESENTATION OF CASE: An 83-year-old woman developed a red elevating mass on her left axilla, without palpable axillary lymph nodes. Excision biopsy revealed that the tumor was PASGC. Additional wide resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) were performed without any adjuvant therapy. One year after the surgical procedure, the patient did not show any evidence of recurrence and axillary surgical complications.DISCUSSION: As PASGC arising in the axilla can progress aggressively, differential diagnosis is essential. Previous reports have shown the usefulness of SLNB, but the axillary management for patients with clinically node negative PASGC has not been established because of its rarity. Especially in axillary cases, to identify the true sentinel lymph nodes is sometimes considered inaccurate because the lymphatic flow is complicated in the axilla.CONCLUSION: Although SLNB in sweat gland carcinoma has believed safety and been performed, this is the first axillary PASGC case that was performed SLNB. Careful follow-up is needed. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of BS Publishing Group Ltd.

TI  - The use of sentinel 2A imageries to improve mangrove inventarization at coremap CTI monitoring areas
T2  - 3RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM MARINE AND FISHERIES (ISMF) 2020
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd International Symposium on Marine and Fisheries (ISMF)
CL  - South Sulawesi, INDONESIA
AB  - In 2014, the project preparation for Coral Reef Management (Coremap) CTI claim that mangrove at Selayar was approximately 676.7 hectares distributed at 15 villages. Tambolongan at Bontosikuyu district was the largest area of about 132 hectares. These values extracted using Landsat imageries based on visual and composite image classification. Since Sentinel 2A launched in 2015, the use of this satellite imagery has spread widely in ecosystem monitoring due to its higher spatial, spectral and temporal resolution and mostly because it is free to access. Nevertheless, field sampling is still needed to crosscheck the final result. Since 2015 three mangrove locations at Selayar island monitored annually. By 2018, two new locations at Pasi island added. In 2019 three sites added at two different islands, so now a total nine mangrove station covering the whole Selayar islands. Nine species of mangroves were found by the end of 2019 monitoring, which are Avicennia alba, A. officinalis, A. marina, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata, R. stylosa, Cerios tagal, and Sonneratia alba. Spectral image characterization by using 12 bands of Sentinel 2A shows that most of these mangroves had peak reflectances at 783 and 865 nanometer, and the highest reflectance are lower than 0.45. These findings may contribute to better spatial identifications for mangrove monitoring and also the consequences to the revision of previous information extracted from Landsat imageries.

Thus, deep learning (DL) techniques have gained popularity among the remote sensing community. Agriculture is one of the domains where DL can improve the current state-of-the-art. In this paper, we focus on the task of crop type classification, a key task in the process of assessing the agricultural market and yield. To this purpose, we introduce a new dataset, based on publicly available data (images from satellite Sentinel-2 and annotations from Land Parcel Identification System), to be used for further research in this field.

TI  - The Relicts of Hunting and Fishing in the Folk Tradition of the Kalmyks and Peoples of the Cross-Border Cultures (Article 1)
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The research topic is connected with the problem of cultural and social adaptation of man in nature and society. Within the framework of these problems, a circle of questions is drawn up associated with the relationship between man and nature, the degree of its dependence on nature, economic activities and lifestyle, popular knowledge about nature and the animal world, worldview and spiritual culture. The fairy-tale epic folklore of the Turkic-Mongolian peoples is plentiful and rich in ethnographic details of the description of hunting, which allows you to reconstruct the hunting structure, its philosophical, ideological aspects, to trace historical development and transformation. The analysis showed that the relics of the hunting structure are quite abundant in the folk tradition of the peoples of Central Asia, reflecting the ancient era of the settlement of the ancestors of the Turkic-Mongolian and Tungus-Manchu peoples in Southern Siberia in the neighborhood of the Ugric-Samoyed tribes; hunting themes have a decisive role in the archaic epos, and ancient characters stand out in fairy-tale and fairy-tale prose the foot hunter Jovgn Mergen, the hunter Erhiy-Mergen, whose image is associated with the solar myth. The ancient hunting life, hunting ideas are expressed in archaic fairy-tale-epic motifs and plots. The archaic motif of "deer and deer hunting", preserved in the Kalmyk folk tradition, is evidence of the specificity of hunting among the ancestors of the Kalmyks Oirats who used to live in the expanses of Central Asia and Southern Siberia. In the Oirat folklore, there are survivals of clan relations associated with hunting and the rite of initiation, which existed before social phenomena and institutions, the socialization of men in "male unions". The study revealed that hunting played a significant role in the life of a nomad, which was both an entertainment of the nobility, and a way to train soldiers, as well as a means of obtaining additional food. The methods and types of hunting for the Kalmyks were identified: individual and collective hunting, foot and horse hunting, hunting with hunting birds. The hunt by the Mongolian peoples retained the most archaic features until the beginning of the 20th century and contained elements of an ancient ideology, which is a well-developed public institution with a developed system of social relations. Folk materials, on the one hand, reflect the real scenes of hunting life, and on the other, ancient mythological views related to taboos and totemistic cults, veneration of animals, beliefs in spirits, rituals and rituals aimed at successful hunting. The reflection of the hunting structure and fishing in folklore is an archaic layer, preserved in the form of relict phenomena.

TI  - EXISTENTIAL SENTENCES AS A CHARACTERISTIC SYNTACTIC FEATURE OF I. A. BUNIN'S POETIC TEXTS
T2  - IZVESTIYA URALSKOGO FEDERALNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-GUMANITARNYE NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, existential sentences are examined as a syntactic dominant of I. A. Bunin's lyrical poetry. The interest in the originality of the syntax of Nobel laureate's literary texts is due to the lack of research on this issue, linguists' focus on the aesthetic salience of the vocabulary, its expressive properties and combination potential, as well as stylistic figures and tropes. Meanwhile, it is the writer's selection of specific syntactic structures for the implementation of the idea, the representation of key ideas and concepts that reflect his personality and the peculiarities of his perception of the surrounding world.The author refers to Bunin's poems from 1886-1917 and 1918-1953 published in Bunin's collected works in 9 volumes.In the writer's poetic oeuvre, existential sentences are regularly used. Despite the traditional structure that underlies them and is represented by three meanings ('the object of being', 'being', and 'area of being'), the richness of the lexical content of each of the main components stands out. As a result, existential sentences become a universal form used to represent completely different situations in the author's individual worldview: the existence of natural objects in space, meteorological phenomena, events, time periods, artifacts, etc.; physical states of the surrounding world; psychological states of the subject.Acting as a semantic core of a poetic text, existential sentences do not have a fixed place in it, and are used as a lyrical beginning, an interposed element, or an ending in its structure. In each position, their use is conceptually significant.It is established that the peculiarity of existential sentences in Bunin's lyrical poetry is their syntactic unconditionality (attachment to three registers of speech, i.e. reproductive, informative, and generative) and polyfunctionality (performing the pictorial, characterising and concluding, and generalising functions).

AB  - Coastal zone is a central attraction for coastal engineers, scientists and coastal community due to economic and developmental activities of the coast. Kerala has 593 km of coastline. More than 50% of the coast is occupied with artificial structures such as ripraps, groins, seawall, ports and fishing harbours. These coastal protection structures and developmental activities played a major role in altering the shoreline position significantly. Therefore, periodical analysis and monitoring of shoreline change is the primary requirement for effective planning and management of the coast. This paper provides the primary requirement of shoreline change rate for the past 26 years using geo-spatial technology and field investigation for proper management of the coast. Landsat 5 and 7, Resourcesat 1 and 2 and Cartosat-1 data set were used as primary data source. Long-term shoreline change rate (1990-2016) was calculated using weighted linear regression statistical method. The morphological study was carried out to substantiate the shoreline change pattern. For detailed investigation, the study area was divided into five sediment sub-cells. The analysis revealed that the maximum erosion of 54% was noticed in sediment sub-cells II, followed by IV (52%) and III (43%) respectively. The result also indicated that the accretion/erosion pattern of shoreline change on either side of breakwaters was varying from place to place. The effectiveness of the coastal protective seawall was very minimal. This indicates that proper planning of any artificial structures is the basic requirement for effective management of the coast. The overall shoreline change status of Kerala coast indicates that 45% of the coast is eroding and 34% of the coast is in stable condition. Only 21% of the coast is of accreting nature. The field survey was carried out to validate the analysed results for entire coast, specifically along the coastal structures. The study demonstrates that the combined effect of satellite data and field investigation can be a reliable approach for shoreline change analysis for these complex environments.

AB  - Herbaceous biomass is an important indicator of rangeland quantity. Grasslands cover vast areas in South Africa. It supports livestock production which is crucial for livelihoods and biodiversity conservation including ecotourism and conservation purposes. Grasslands, especially the mountainous ones, are threatened by the number of factors including global environmental changes. Latter changes include climate change, overgrazing, a proliferation of invasive species, unmanaged fires, and other land-use changes. There is a need to continuously monitor grasslands and remote sensing is an ideal, particularly in mountainous areas. The objective of the study was to test and compare the applicability of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data acquired before and after fire occurrence in estimating biomass in the Golden Gate Highland National Park (GGHNP). Random forest model was used to predict biomass using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 reflectance data. Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 reflectance data explained over 80% of biomass variation in the mountainous areas. The results indicate that both Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 provide useful information for grass biomass estimation in mountainous environments.

TI  - CHRISTIAN CLERGY IN THE UKRAINIAN NATIONAL REVIVAL OF THE SECOND HALF OF THE XIXth - THE FIRST THIRD OF THE XXth CENTURY: MODERN HISTORIOGRAPHY
T2  - SKHIDNOIEVROPEISKYI ISTORYCHNYI VISNYK-EAST EUROPEAN HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the research - to represent and analyze the latest studies on the history of cultural, educational, social and national organizing activities of the clergy during the period of the Ukrainian national and cultural revival of the second half of the XIXth - the first third of the XXth century. First of all, attention is paid to the coverage of the content of scientific works dedicated to the elucidation of the Orthodox, Greek-Catholic and Protestant clergy's contribution to the rise of the Ukrainian national movement and spiritual, religious revival. The study is based on a civilizational and socio-cultural methodology, a systematic scientific and conceptual approach to a historiographical analysis, the tools of which made it possible to achieve the priorities of scientificity and objectivity in the coverage of the historiographical facts, historicism and continuity in the formation of a historiographical narrative, interdisciplinarity and integration of historiographical conclusions. The scientific provisions are based on the principles of a confessional neutrality and worldview pluralism. The research methodology is inspired by the interpretation objectives of the historians' scientific achievements in analyzing the interactions of religious, ecclesiastical and cultural educational activities of the clergy of different denominations, clarification of their contribution to the spiritual revival of the Ukrainians. The scientific. novelty of the presented study consists in the actualization, systematization and analysis of the latest historical researches, which deal with the cultural, educational activities of the clergy during the period of the Ukrainian national revival. To systematize the relevant historiographical narrative the thematic metaphorical concept of "Department of Historiography" has been introduced; the heuristic potential of modern historical studies for confessionally neutral and scientific interpretation of the place and role of the clerical factor in the Ukrainian national history has been considered. The Conclusions. In modern historiography the idea is traced that the religious, ecclesiastical and cultural educational activities of the clergy played an important role in the development and rise of the Ukrainian national movement during the second half of the XIXth - the first third of the XXth century. The process analysis of knowledge accumulation on the history of the clergy illustrates the following: historians focus on the study of cultural, educational, social work of the Orthodox, the Greek-Catholic and the Protestant clew. It is on the basis of this principle that the historians are united into three so-called 'Departments of Historiography". The historians consider the social mission of the Orthodox priests in a dualistic way, noting both their commitment to the Russian hierarchy as well as the national aspirations of some Orthodox priests to fight for the autocephaly of the Ukrainian Orthodoxy. The historians analyze the activities of the Greek-Catholic priests in the context of their orientation to an active sociopolitical activity, emphasizing the Ukrainian priorities of their ecclesiastical and national identity. Instead, the historians elucidate the initiatives of the Protestants in the context of the new socio-economic realities of the imperial em (ethics of capitalism), emphasizing the significant contribution of the Protestant pastors to the development of interreligious relations in Ukraine during the period under analysis.A positive feature of a modern historiography is the erosion of the Soviet atheistic historiographical paradigms and historians' refusal from the one-sided reception of the historical process. The fact is also important that the vast majority of historians, who specialized in religion and church, did not mechanically change their atheistic approach to a confessional one, but they still adhere to a rationalist research paradigm, forming scientific postulates on the priorities of scientificity objectivity mid a confessional neutrality.

AB  - The important growth of industrial, transport, and agriculture activities, has not led only to the air quality and climate changes issues, but also to the increase of the potential natural disasters. The emission of harmful gases, particularly: the Vertical Column Density (VCD) of CO, SO2 and NOx, is one of the major factors causing the aforementioned environmental problems. Our research aims to contribute finding solution to this hazardous phenomenon, by using remote sensing (RS) techniques to monitor air quality which may help decision makers. However, RS data is not easy to manage, because of their huge amount, high complexity, variety, and velocity, Thus, our manuscript explains the different aspects of the used satellite data. Furthermore, this article has proven that RS data could be regarded as big data. Accordingly, we have adopted the Hadoop big data architecture and explained how to process efficiently RS environmental data.

T2  - GULLY EROSION STUDIES FROM INDIA AND SURROUNDING REGIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Land degradation and gully erosion are the very common and acute geo-environmental problems at the western part of West Bengal. The Akarsa watershed, which is a part of the Dwarakeswar river basin and also a part of Chotanagpur plateau, is highly vulnerable to land degradation. Here, rill and gully erosions are key functions of the land degradation process. In this chapter, delineation of potential land degradation zone (PLDZ) has been mapped by using remote sensing data and geographical information system (GIS) based on multi-influencing factor (MIF) technique for Akarsa watershed in West Bengal. It has been accomplished by integrating and analyzing different thematic maps. The degraded areas were delineated using visual interpretation techniques. Rankings and weights were assigned to each influencing factor for calculating statistically by the multi-influencing factor (MIF) technique. Finally, delineation of the potential land degradation zone (PLDZ) map is executed and classified into five degradation zones, viz., very low 13.74% (47.54 km(2)), low 27.52% (95.21 km(2)), moderate 38.15% (132.55 km(2)), high 16.18% (56.25 km(2)), and very high 4.41% (15.24 km(2)). Then, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is applied for validation of the methodology used in this work. The result of AUC (area under the curve) is very good indicating an accuracy of (0.828) 82%. The outcome of this PLDZ can be helpful in land conservation planning and strategy formulation for management in the Akarsa watershed.

AB  - Peatland is the region that is composed of accumulated layers of decayed vegetations and organic matters. It has an important role in regulating the hydrology cycle and maintaining global climate stability. Therefore protecting peatland from human intervention is imperative and the availability of accurate delineation map of peatland and non peatland is substantial and indispensable. Landsat 8 OLI and MODIS are proven to be beneficial for terrestrial analysis including peatland. For detecting peatland, the use of spectral bands to generate indexes that sensitive to the detection of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) that related to peat water table, biomass vegetation and surface energy budget is the key. Therefore, several spectral-derived Landsat 8 OLI and MODIS products alongside with and DEM data were utilized. For classification, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods namely Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Cat Boosting (CatB) were ML method that used alongside with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) of DL to delineate peatland distribution. The best result of the delineation was achieved by CatB algorithm with 75.52 % accuracy based on testing data and 82.61% based on validation data of field survey that held in Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI), South Sumatera Province.

AB  - This study mainly aims to determine the extent of the flash flood that occurred in the Seyhan River Basin located in the Mediterranean Part of Turkey. In this region, flash floods primarily affect the agricultural fields. For the study, 20/12/2019 and 27/12/2019 dated freely available Sentinel-2 (Level-2) multispectral data were used to generate flood inundation extents of the selected test region. Object-based random forest classification was applied to determine dry and wet regions in the study area. Pre-flood maps were used to delineate the permanent water surface. The accuracy assessment of each scene was performed using randomly selected validation points. The overall accuracy of flood inundation mapping was found above 90% for both images. The results show that flash floods affect mainly agricultural fields in the region.

AB  - This study mainly has two significant aims; (1) investigating the efficiency of using freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to analyze flood events in Meric River Basin and (2) determining the flood extent occurred in January, 2019. Flood events in Meric River Basin are caused by both the overflow of Meric River and heavy rain. Sentinel-1 (C band) data acquired in interferometric wide swath (IW) mode and Sentinel 2 MSI images were used for the analysis. Firstly, Sentinel-1 scenes were preprocessed. Then, normalized difference water index was derived from Sentinel-2 MSI images. The thresholding technique has been performed for mapping flood inundation areas. The results yield that microwave remote sensing data with the support of optical data have a great potential for flood inundation mapping and monitoring for decision-makers and effective disaster management strategies.

CP  - Conference on MOEMS and Miniaturized Systems XIX
CL  - San Francisco, CA
AB  - This paper presents a 2D MEMS mirror for smart headlights, combing high-Q vacuum package with AR (Anti Reflecting)-coating, piezoelectric driving and Lissajous scanning. While the vacuum package protects the MEMS device and the AR-coating suppresses parasite reflections from the glass lid, the AlN-based piezoelectric actuators are robust against shock and vibration in harsh environment, comparing to fragile capacitive finger structures. This gimbal-less MEMS mirror with a large circular aperture (diameter = 5.5 mm) utilizes Lissajous scanning possessing two perpendicular torsion modes with frequencies of f(x) = 2.26 kHz, f(y) = 2.30 kHz fulfilling high light density and large total optical scanning angles of 55 degrees, 30 degrees at +/- 40 V-AC. A 2D projection of 50 degrees x 20 degrees was realized, where the angle loss comparing to the 1D testing arose from pincushion distortion, whose effect was severely reduced by the redesign run. Due to the great long-term stability of AlN and protection of vacuum packages, the MEMS mirror also shows a good reliability. This paper will describe and discuss the design, fabrication and characterization results of this MEMS mirror.

AB  - Drought is an event that almost occurs every year in several regions of Indonesia. Drought events are often associated with the El Nino phenomenon, namely the lack of rainfall over a certain period of time in a reasonably long time. In 2015, Indonesia experienced drought in several parts of Indonesia, one of which was Bantimurung District in Maros Regency, South Sulawesi Province. This study aimed to map the level of drought in Bantimurung District. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) based meteorological and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used to determine the spatial-temporal distribution of drought. Then, the NDVI values of weak (2014) and very strong (2015) El Nino year were correlated with SPI. The results show that Bantimurung District experienced drought in 2015 with near normal (July-September) to moderately dry (October-November) drought levels. In 2014, the drought was not so severe compared to 2015 because the level of drought was near normal and moderately wet. In 2014, the moderately wet area was located in the east district including Leang-leang and Kalabbirang villages. In 2015, villages Minasa Baji, Mattoangin, Alangtae, Baruga, Tukamasea, Mangeloreng, west of Kalabbirang and Leang Leang were located in western of the district have moderately dry drought level.

CP  - 21st IFAC World Congress on Automatic Control - Meeting Societal Challenges
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - This paper deals with the modeling of soil moisture retrieval from multispectral and infrared (IR) images using convolutional neural network (CNN). Since it is difficult to measure the soil moisture level of large fields, it is essential to retrieve soil moisture level from remotely sensed data. Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is considered as sensing platform in order to acquire data with high spatial resolution at anytime by non-experts. With considerations both on the availability of sensors for the platform and the information needed to overcome the effects of the canopies covering soil, IR and multispectral images are selected to be used for soil moisture retrieval. In order to prevent information loss by the calculation of parameters from measurements and enhance the applicabiliy for online operations, CNN is applied for the construction of soil moisture retrieval model to use the sensor measurement images directly as input data. Training and testing are conducted for the proposed CNN-based soil moisture retrieval model using the data from actual quadrotor flight over an agricultural field. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Intelligent devices using ICT technology have been introduced in the field of construction machinery to improve productivity and stability. Among the intelligent devices, Machine Guidance is a device that provides real-time posture, location, and work range to drivers by installing various sensors, controllers, and satellite navigation systems on construction machines. Conversely, the efficiency of equipment that requires location information, such as machine guidance, will be greatly reduced in buildings, and tunnels in the GPS blind spots.Thus, the other high-precision positioning technologies are required in the GPS blind spot zone. In this study, we will develop a relative position measurement system that provides precise location information such as construction machinery and robots in a local area where the GPS reception is difficult. A relative position measurement system tracks a marker in the form of a sphere installed on a vehicle by using the image base tracking technology, and measures the distance and direction information to the marker to calculate a position.

AB  - This study warns the crisis of the music and its thoughts that Christians face today and discusses the aesthetics and the role of music which should be taken seriously. The writer of this article sought to reveal the inevitable relationship between music and theology by tracking the origins of human musical senses and creative abilities to study the biblical nature of musical beauty based on the Reformed theological perspectives. Hence, this study applies God and his work to the musical beauty and the thoughts of the believers toward music. It then presents the roles of music which can help the reformed church and theology in Korea as well as the religious life of the believers by establishing the authenticity of theological study of music. Specifically, this study argues that the beauty and essential qualities of music can be used as a tool that helps the unity of the believers, peda- gogical role with the biblical texts, the personal prayer life for spirituality, the cultural missionary work of the church, the doctrinal study of theolo- gians and pastors, and the process of experiencing and sanctifying grace in their life. For this, the first chapter of this study provides a biblical frame for the foundation of music aesthetics to summarize the principles of universal music aesthetics, and the following chapters illuminate the six roles of music in Christianity as the “songs of the believer.”

AB  - In order to examine how the intellectual society of Joseon dynasty recognized and evaluated Wang An-shi, the important politcial and literary man in the Northern Song dynasty, we studied A total of 274 related articles in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (≪朝鮮王朝實錄≫). Through this, we could see that the intellectual society of Joseon dynasty under the influence of the worldview of Neo-Confucianism generally expressed negative views about Wang An-shi, but there were also flexible attitudes that tried to evaluate him with a balanced gaze. In addition, we could also confirm the dual aspect of still evaluating him as one of the greatest master of literary style. This study can not only provide an opportunity to examine more closely how the literati of Joseon dynasty recognized and accepted traditional Chinese literati, but also provide a foundation for examining the formation and development of knowledge society and knowledge groups in East Asia.

AB  - Satellite images are used in various fields because they can observe periodic information in a wide area. However, because an optical satellite image represents reflected energy that is reaching the sensor by being reflected from the sunlight to the surface, it is impossible to acquire the surface reflectance in the area where a cloud is present. Therefore, to effectively use satellite images, it is critical to understand the presence of clouds in the images. In this manuscript, cloud detection methods using image segmentation based on deep learning technology were applied and evaluated for Landsat 8 and PlanetScope satellite images. The training dataset was constructed using the clouds’ information in the Landsat 8 satellite imagery, followed by the training of a deep learning model via the training dataset. The deep learning model was fine-tuned using PlanetScope satellite images in the pretrained deep learning model. The experiment confirmed that a deep learning model can effectively detect the cloud region in the Landsat 8 and PlanetScope satellite images.

AB  - This paper examines the processes involved in the translation of Western medical texts into classical Chinese and their impact on 19th-century Joseon. This paper explains how East Asia’s traditional knowledge system contextualized and appropriated foreign thought. In the traditional sense, medicine is intricately connected to philosophy, in terms of being based on an understanding of human nature with the human body and life. In both the East and the West, pre-modern medicine was considered a complex and multilayered system of knowledge that was not limited to the principles and theories of science. Pre-modern medicine featured a study at the level of a worldview because focused on the relations between man and nature.The translation of Western medical texts into literary Chinese by Western missionaries, since the 1850s in Shanghai, China, sparked a lively debate among East Asian intellectuals that demanded changes in the traditional understanding of man, life, and the inner workings of the mind. Choi Han-gi, a 19th-century Joseon scholar who accepted the translated texts about Western medicine and transformed the knowledge from an East Asian perspective, is also one of the significant figures of the period. Choi adopted Western science with incredible depth and scope of understanding that was grounded in his pre-existing East Asian worldview. The intellectual trajectory of this unique scholar will provide a useful perspective for illuminating how the Western knowledge system was adopted and appropriated within the framework of the East Asian traditional medical thought by Joseon scholars.

AB  - Satellite-borne remote sensing images are considered as one of the most important data sources for lithological mapping due to their extensive geographical coverage at an efficient cost. Integration of optical along with microwave satellite datasets, are leading to increase the lithological mapping accuracy. In this study, Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) was applied, using data from the freely available European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel 1 SAR data and Sentinel 2 optical imagery, that were fused With a digital elevation model (DEM) of 13m spatial resolution, generated from two single look complex (SLC) sentinel 1 (C band) interferometry, in conjunction with slope and two geomorphic indices, Terrain Ruggedness (TRI) and Terrain Position Index (TPI) for mapping lithology in the southern of the Palaeozoic massif of Skhour Rehamna in Morocco. The statistical results of the fusion of Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 datasets have shown the highest accuracies, showing an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.80% and a kappa coefficient of and 0.89 compared to the layer stack of Sentinel 2 image bands with the first three Minimum noise fraction (MNF) and the Principal components bands (PC1, PC2 and PC6) that showed an OA of 91.50% and a kappa coefficient of and 0.87. With the achievable results in this study, the technique is useful in discriminating general rock type that outcrop in semi-arid regions.

TI  - Air temperature in Barcelona metropolitan region from MODIS satellite and GIS data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The metropolitan region of Barcelona (BMR) is one of the most densely populated areas in the Mediterranean countries. The estimation of air temperature at a short scale from satellite measurements would contribute to a better understanding of the varied and complex spatial distribution of temperatures in BMR. This estimation would be a first step to study several patterns of the thermometric regime affecting population life quality and health. Taking advantage of MODIS data, air temperature measurements at 48 thermometric stations along the year 2015, together with their geographic and topographic data, multiple regression analyses have permitted to obtain fine spatial distributions (pixels of 1 km(2)) of minimum, mean and maximum daily air temperatures. Previous to the multiple regression, Pearson coefficients and principal component analysis offer a first overview of the relevance of the variables on the empiric temperatures. The most relevant variables on the multiple regression process at annual and seasonal scale are land surface temperatures, latitude, longitude and calendar day. At a monthly scale, altitude (maximum temperature) and continentality (cold months for minimum and hot months for maximum temperatures) are also relevant. The best fits between empiric temperatures and those derived from the multiple regression processes have square regression coefficients within the range (0.92-0.96) for the annual case, (0.70-0.92) at seasonal scale and (0.52-0.87) at monthly scale. The root mean square error varies from 1.5 to 2.0 degrees C (annual case), from 1.3 to 2.0 degrees C (seasonal scale) and from 1.2 to 2.1 degrees C (monthly scale). In agreement with these regression coefficients and mean square errors, the obtained spatial distribution of temperatures is of notable quality. As an outstanding application, the detection of several urban heat islands on different conurbations within BMR along the Mediterranean coast becomes possible.

AB  - Bathymetry is information on the depth of the sea that can describe the hydrographic conditions of the seabed. Satellite derived bathymetry has several methods that can be applied to the batimetric extraction process using optical satellite images. One of the satellite images that can be used is SPOT 7. The image is the latest generation of SPOT which has 4 multispectral channels with a spatial resolution of 6 meters so that it can be extracted to obtain information on shallow water bathymetry. The bathymetry extraction method uses the Van Hengel and Spitzer methods, 1991. The VS method is the principal component analysis method of three bands with respect to the rotation transformation factor. The purpose of this study is to extract SPOT 7 satellite image data to produce relative bathymetry information in shallow seas using the VS algorithm. The location of the study was carried out on Karimunjawa Island, Jepara Regency, Central Java. The data used is SPOT 7 imagery that was acquired May 18, 2017. The extraction algorithm is used the VS 1991 method. The results show that from SPOT 7 images produce depth index values ranging from 0.0985 to 0.6378.

TI  - Phenomenology as a Primordial Science and New "Metaphysics of metaphysics". The Systematic Genealogy of Heidegger's Philosophical Beginnings
T2  - BOLLETTINO FILOSOFICO
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay reconstructs the inner consistency and posthumously reconstructable and manageable systematicity of Heidegger's independent phenomenological beginnings immediately after World War I. Heidegger shares with Husserl the understanding of phenomenology as a primordial science, he specifies this from the logical orientation on the "question of objectivity" and in the "formal display", which goes back to nominalism. Against this philosophical background Heidegger contradicts the reduction of philosophy on the one hand to scientism and historicism, and on the other hand to worldview. The primary-scientific-philosophical claim rather remains valid, where in first attempts the categories of existence are outlined in a phenomenology of the living world reference of existence, where the counterpoint of "ruin" and "ethos" is sketched as an interpretation of residence, and where ideological and religious approaches to the world are examined phenomenologically. It is the thesis of the treatise that Heidegger thereby already sets the impulse that goes beyond the 'fundamental ontology' in Being and Time and aims at a "metaphysics of metaphysics" in the Kantian sense.

AB  - The objective of this work was to identify flood zones in the city of Santiago de Cali Colombia, through historical information and RADAR images. During the process Sentinel 1 images pre and post event were used, and reports of hydrometeorological phenomena (1986-2018) were revisited. The method used corresponds to the framework named methodological complementarity and was carried out with the documentary review, fieldwork and the digital treatment of data based on supervised dassification. The results of documentary review and fieldwork indicate the occurrence of 766 events associated with floods that have affected 186 neighborhoods in a period of 32 years. In addition to this, digital image processing identified 2082, 25 hectares of flood- plains, with overall reliability of 89 percent. Kappa index of 0.76 percent. It is important to note that the majority of water plates were located in areas adjacent to the Cauca, Cali and Interceptor Sur and Oriental channels.

M3  - Article
AB  - Society is a human construction; a system of meaning is established in this built world, as well as an order with reference to it. The sociality of man is also an expression of his desire and tendency towards the construction of nomos. His relationship with society is interactive in the sense that it is a stage in a long story. Mankind becomes effective in the formation of the world with the meaning codes and knowledge stocks they have internalized in the world in which they exist. Religion is the most fundamental element of their attempt to establish and maintain this world. Religion functions as a reference for meaning, especially in marginal periods, just as it did in ordinary times. The marginal situation experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic today faces the desire to be explained and interpreted in line with the human tendency of finding an explanation of events that are the source of pain and suffering. Although it is essentially a philosophical debate, in essence, it has been the subject of sociology since leading sociologists and for the first time discussed by Max Weber on social ground. In this study, the question of theodicy in the phenomenological approaches of Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann and the place and function of marginal situations in the human search for meaning are questioned. In this context, the findings obtained through the documentation method are evaluated on the basis of the primary claim of the study. As a result, it is determined that individuals and groups do not establish a world based only on felicific events, and marginal experiences such as death, epidemic, pain, and suffering also function as a source of meaning.Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann specifically place the issue of meaning, which is the crossroads of the sociology of religion and sociology of knowledge, at the center of their theories. Both the efforts to understand today's epidemic experience and the explanation suggestion of approaches of the theorists in understanding these efforts in sociology shape the problem of this study. Thus, in this study, the issue of meaning in times of crisis has been problematized to test the assertion that "human life does not produce meaning based on events that are only sources of happiness, and marginal experiences are also sources of meaning". According to Berger and Luckmann, the main function of religion is to make sense of the experiences of daily life. Focusing on the notion of order as well as threats to it, this attempt to make sense is collective, not individual; the product it produces is "thin and fragile" and therefore "must be rebuilt continuously. Berger focuses on the function of religion in the context of legitimizing suffering, and according to him, "religion does what a worldview does; justifying the shocking experiences." Luckmann, on the other hand, focuses on the concept of world view in internalizing the meaning world of the given society and explaining its experiences with it.Since there is no religious institutional monopoly in modern societies, the individuals have to make their own choice of meaning in pluralism. The meaning crisis, which is especially on the agenda in major events, especially in the current epidemic experience, has a distinctive form for the religious field. The way people make sense of their marginal experiences is shaped by reference to a community of meanings. The existence of a purely individual meaning-world is being questioned. The link between the crisis of meaning and theodicy, the search for an explanation that will be the source of the power to endure the suffering of everyday life, and the demands for its enabler nature are remarkable. The interpretations that define today's society as a risk society also define a ground for understanding the issue of theodicy through the risk argument. A meaningful world means a home for Berger; meaningful, orderly, and safe. "The history of humanity is a history of suffering," says Berger, pointing to the power of nature's suffering, including the epidemic, to shape the story, as it is today. In the final analysis, as seen in Berger and Luckmann's theories, the current COVID-19 outbreak represents an experience in which people seek an explanation and want to make sense of it; this endless effort seems indispensable in the context of the human feeling at home.

AB  - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a measure of vegetation productivity and health. Many previous studies have established its utility in understanding the changes that happen to vegetated regions. Temperature and precipitation are closely associated with the vegetation quantity and quality in a place. Natural variability in climate along with human interactions have profound influence on this. Sustaining the natural ecosystem of a region requires understanding these interactions. Remote sensing systems provide valuable measurements to study changes in the various environmental factors and provide a means for observing regions that are not easily reachable using ground-based techniques alone. The state of Kerala is witnessing big changes in its climate pattern in the recent times. Disastrous phenomena like recurring floods and hazards like landslides are posing threats to plants and trees along with human lives and livelihoods. In addition to these climate-based changes, we are also witnessing modifications to our natural ecosystem due to man-made constructions and such activities. Both the natural and man-made modifications may have far reaching consequences for the environment as a whole and plant life specifically. The current study investigates the spatial and temporal variability of NDVI over Kerala. Estimation of NDVI is performed using the NIR and visible hands of Landsat-8 satellite. This study analyses the observed variability in NDVI using remote sensing observations without looking into the undeflying causes and mechanisms that might have led to it.

TI  - METAMODERNISM MAN IN THE WORLDVIEW DIMENSION OF NEW CULTURAL PARADIGM
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The research is based on the comprehension of the anthropological tendencies of the metamodernism, which presupposes the consistent solution of the following tasks: a) explication of the content of postpostmodernism in modern philosophical literature; b) identification of the ideological basis of metamodernism anthropology; c) characteristics of the problem field of metamodernism anthropology and the state of man in the modern era. Theoretical basis. Anthropology of the metamodernism for the first time defines socio-cultural context through the hesitative state between the values of modernism and their rejection by the postmodernism, which makes it possible to formulate the peculiarity of the time as a desire to reconstruct a Holistic Man, impartial to the dominant worldview attitudes of a social nature. Anthropology of the metamodernism is presented as the individualization of the socio-cultural space in the form of human self-reconstruction at all anthropological levels. An era without an unambiguously expressed moral guideline is based on the ethics of all-acceptance, the only justification of which is the existence of a universal right to beingness. Digitalization as a process of digital transformation of society creates conditions for the value realization of the free choice of metamodernism man, through which a Holistic Man is accomplished. Originality. It is substantiated that metamodernism as a descriptive position of the modern cultural dominant of the digitalized era is characterized by a state of hesitation between the values of modernism and postmodernism. The anthropology of the metamodernism manifests itself in the form of the reconstruction of the holistic man and the self-reconstruction of the inner man. The peculiarities of the human metamodernism are recognized as the mutual complete determinability of the individual and the mass. Conclusions. Metamodernism is the formulation of the problem of a man in a new perspective: what to be and how to survive between the extremes of semantic poles, without losing dignity and unique intrinsic value. Proceeding from this, the fate of a metamodernism man is determined in pursuit of the endlessly receding horizons of the anthropology of incompleteness, which is carried out through post-irony, naive sincerity, optimistic openness to the world.

TI  - Artifactual Displacement of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (ADDCIS) (Toothpaste Effect) A Mimicker of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Needle tract displacement is a recognized mimicker of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Artifactual displacement of ductal carcinoma in situ (ADDCIS) unassociated with needle tracts may occur secondary to mechanical compression of breast specimens but has not been systematically studied. We identified 16 cases of ADDCIS unassociated with needle tract changes; the majority (75%) were internal referrals to the breast pathology service to rule out IDC, 19% were received as external diagnostic consultations to rule out IDC, and 6% were routine second review cases originally diagnosed as IDC at an outside hospital. The majority (62.5%) of ADDCIS occurred in lumpectomies, whereas 25% occurred in mastectomies and 12.5% in core biopsies. ADDCIS foci ranged from <1 to 5 mm; however, all ADDCIS spanning >4 mm demonstrated a linear pattern of displacement. In all cases, ADDCIS involved mammary stroma in a nonlobular distribution; in half, ADDCIS extended between benign lobules. Immunohistochemistry revealed no myoepithelial cells around the ADDCIS (n=7), adding to the concern for IDC. However, in contrast to most IDC, ADDCIS lacked stromal reaction and showed degenerative, smudged chromatin. None of the 9 patients with significant follow-up (mean, 7 y) developed metastasis. All received further local therapy for DCIS (5 radiation, 4 completion mastectomy); 1 received adjuvant systemic therapy (hormone therapy for contralateral IDC). In conclusion, ADDCIS mimics IDC, particularly given its permeative pattern and absence of myoepithelial cells. ADDCIS is most common in lumpectomies but can occur in mastectomies or core biopsies. Diagnostic clues include smudged nuclear chromatin, lack of stromal response, and linear pattern of displacement in larger lesions. The benign follow-up without systemic therapy supports our view that ADDCIS does not represent true IDC.

TI  - Moral Aspect of Young People's Subjective Competitiveness
T2  - ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES-FACTS TRENDS FORECAST
M3  - Article
AB  - The issues of competitiveness and competitive relationships are usually considered from an economic point of view, bypassing socio-cultural aspects. The paper presents a sociological analysis of young people's competitive and moral orientations. The consideration of the emphasized problem field allows us to determine the connotation of competitive relationships, from positive ("ethical" competition) to negative ("aggressive", "predatory" competition). The authors assess the format of competitive relationships set up by the younger generation considering themselves competitive, and those young people who reject their own involvement in competition in any form. A new scientific result, the understanding of competitiveness as a subjective phenomenon is obtained. The author's system of empirical indicators for evaluating subjective competitiveness is also an element of scientific novelty. The presented material is aimed at achieving a specific goal to determine the relationship between the young people's subjective competitiveness and their desire to adhere to stable value standards and high moral principles in behavior. The following tasks are solved within the framework of the research: the key characteristics of competition as a socio-cultural phenomenon are identified; young people's attitude to competitiveness is studied; the relationship between competitive orientations, individual responsibility for their own actions, locus of control, trust and respect for others, readiness to help others is revealed. The empirical basis of the sociological research was the data from a questionnaire survey of young people in the Tyumen Oblast (2017, 3403 people, including 1087 high school students; 1360 students; 956 working young people under 30). It is found that the respondents not considering themselves competitive characterize competitive interaction with more negative ratings than young people who are actually involved in competition. Young people with low competitive orientations demonstrate a lack of active life position, they are not ready to create their own business and take responsibility for their lives. The highest percentage of competitive respondents is found among working youth. The author analyzes the world outlook, the general culture of high school students, students and working youth, the relationship between their competencies and competitiveness. Worldview attitudes, values, and moral guidelines are identified as the key determinants shaping young people's competitiveness. It is concluded that competitive youth tend to adhere to high moral principles.

TI  - Flood Detection and Susceptibility Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Remote Sensing Data and a Machine Learning Approach: Hybrid Intelligence of Bagging Ensemble Based on K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping flood-prone areas is a key activity in flood disaster management. In this paper, we propose a new flood susceptibility mapping technique. We employ new ensemble models based on bagging as a meta-classifier and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) coarse, cosine, cubic, and weighted base classifiers to spatially forecast flooding in the Haraz watershed in northern Iran. We identified flood-prone areas using data from Sentinel-1 sensor. We then selected 10 conditioning factors to spatially predict floods and assess their predictive power using the Relief Attribute Evaluation (RFAE) method. Model validation was performed using two statistical error indices and the area under the curve (AUC). Our results show that the Bagging-Cubic-KNN ensemble model outperformed other ensemble models. It decreased the overfitting and variance problems in the training dataset and enhanced the prediction accuracy of the Cubic-KNN model (AUC=0.660). We therefore recommend that the Bagging-Cubic-KNN model be more widely applied for the sustainable management of flood-prone areas.

TI  - Oil palm mapping over Peninsular Malaysia using Google Earth Engine and machine learning algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm plays a pivotal role in the ecosystem, environment, economy and without proper monitoring, uncontrolled oil palm activities could contribute to deforestation that can cause high negative impacts on the environment and therefore, proper management and monitoring of the oil palm industry are necessary. Mapping the distribution of oil palm is crucial in order to manage and plan the sustainable operations of oil palm plantations. Remote sensing provides a means to detect and map oil palm from space effectively. Recent advances in cloud computing and big data allow rapid mapping to be performed over large a geographical scale. In this study, 30 m Landsat 8 data were processed using a cloud computing platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE) in order to classify oil palm land cover using non-parametric machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest (RF) for the first time over Peninsular Malaysia. The hyperparameters were tuned, and the overall accuracy produced by the SVM, CART and RF were 93.16%, 80.08% and 86.50% respectively. Overall, the SVM classified the 7 classes (water, built-up, bare soil, forest, oil palm, other vegetation and paddy) the best. However, RF extracted oil palm information better than the SVM. The algorithms were compared and the McNemar's test showed significant values for comparisons between SVM and CART and RF and CART. On the other hand, the performance of SVM and RF are considered equally effective. Despite the challenges in implementing machine learning optimisation using GEE over a large area, this paper shows the efficiency of GEE as a cloud-based free platform to perform bioresource distributions mapping such as oil palm over a large area in Peninsular Malaysia.

AB  - Bangladesh is predominately an agriculture based country where an extensive part of its population is primarily employed in its agriculture sector. However, uncertain crop yields and inefficient farming infrastructure causes adverse effect in food security. Habiganj is selected as the study area because of its vulnerability to floods and drought due to its unique terrain. This paper presents a combination of agricultural mapping and monitoring of Habiganj with crop growth and yield prediction. Multi-spectral band images of Habiganj from Landsat-8 are processed and remote sensing indices, correlating to crop growth and yield are extracted. With options of K-means and Mask R-CNN methods, the change over the years is evaluated for crop growth estimation in both Python and Matlab. Then using two type machine learning algorithms crop yield of Habiganj is predicted from its existing parameters and for better accuracy future values of its datasets are predicted by using two type of time series analysis model. Such analytical reports and prediction allows monitoring crop growth dynamic and identifying early signs of reduction in crop productivity. Furthermore, comparative studies are concluded between two platforms, algorithms and time series analysis to determine the most suited environment and model for this research purpose.

TI  - Parenting behaviors, marital discord and the mental health of young females: a cross-sectional study from Saudi Arabia
T2  - ANNALS OF SAUDI MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Divorce is considered a sentinel event influencing the economic, psychosocial and physical health of the family as a whole. Research shows a negative impact of parental marital discord (PMD) on the psychological health and social well-being of children. Only one study from Saudi Arabia has assessed educational and social attainment among young females, and the children were school girls aged 12-16 years.OBJECTIVES: Explore the relationship between parental marital discord and depression, anxiety, stress, social support and self-esteem of the female child. We also studied the parenting behaviors and their association with the psychosocial health of adolescents.DESIGN: Cross-sectional questionnaire.SETTINGS: Women's university in Saudi Arabia.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: REDCap was used for collecting data through email invitations sent to all students at the university. Data on family structure, parental relationship, self-esteem and psycho-social health was collected.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem and social support of the adolescent. Parenting behaviors of both parents were also assessed.SAMPLE SIZE: 296.RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of participants was 20.5 (2.4) years (median 20.0, IQR 19-22). The frequency of PMD was 24.6% (73/296). Overall, 38% of the students had extra severe anxiety, 26.5% had extra severe depression and 20.5% had extra severe stress on the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). The mean self-esteem score was 20.8 (5.5) and social support score was 57 (19.7). Both parents demonstrated low care and high protection trait on the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI). Among those with PMD, mean (SD) age at discord was 11.4 (6.7) years. Mean (SD) duration of parental marriage was 20.9 (10.7) years and 35% of daughters received no financial help from the father. There was a significant association between PMD and depression, anxiety, stress and poor social support. PMD was associated with low paternal care and high protection trait.CONCLUSIONS: The study showed an alarming burden of mental health problems including depression, anxiety and stress among young Saudi females. Marital discord is prevalent in Saudi Arabia and is significantly related to poor psychosocial health in the child. Parents undergoing marital discord should be educated about healthy parenting styles and their children should be provided with counselling and coping strategies to maintain their emotional and psychological well-being.LIMITATIONS: Online survey could lead to volunteer bias. Only females are included in the study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spontaneous rupture of benign uterine fibroids is extremely rare and has been associated with fibroid degeneration. It can cause acute intraperitoneal bleeding requiring immediate surgical intervention.CASE: A previously healthy 50-year-old, Caucasian, nullipara presented with syncope, hemodynamic instability, and an acute abdomen. Noncontrast computed tomography images showed a positive sentinel clot sign in the pelvis as well as a large uterine fibroid with internal hyperdense clot suggesting acute rupture. Urgent laparotomy and hysterectomy confirmed a ruptured, actively bleeding, uterine fibroid with final pathological diagnosis of a benign leiomyoma.CONCLUSION: Prompt diagnosis and emergency surgical intervention were necessary to control acute hemorrhage from a ruptured uterine fibroid. Noncontrast computed tomography is an important adjunct to contrast-enhanced computed tomography and was vital for diagnosis in this case.

AB  - Modeled thin-cloud components using the RTM-based algorithm may include the reflectance of ground targets. If the components are then used in cloud removal, the ground reflectance can be adversely affected. Thus, we revised the modeled components and developed a thin-cloud removal algorithm. With Landsat-8 data acquired on 29 March 2014, the spatial correlation coefficient between Landsat-8 Band-9 and revised cloud components was the highest. The revision of the modeled components was quantitatively satisfactory. The spatial correlation coefficients for Bands 1-4 between the cloud-removed and cloud-free reference images ranged from 0.687 to 0.797. In addition, the algorithm had the smallest impact on the cloud-free pixels. Overall, this algorithm outperformed the original RTM-based algorithm. Therefore, we have achieved the objective to remove thin clouds but to preserve ground features.

AB  - A detailed distribution map of different vegetation classes is of great importance for us to analyze the global ecosystem. Compared with traditional remote sensing data, hyperspectral remote sensing (HRS) data have hundreds of spectral bands and continuous spectral curves, showing great potential in sophisticated vegetation classification. And the AHSI (Advance Hyper-Spectral Imager) on-board GF-5 satellite has addressed the problem of lacking in satellite HRS data. According to the characteristics of AHSI data, we propose a modified sophisticated vegetation classification method by constructing and optimizing a vegetation feature set (FBS). This method takes the band quality, vegetation biochemical parameters, and neighborhood pixels' spectral angle distance into consideration. The results show that our method can obtain better classification results than traditional methods with higher overall accuracy and less salt and pepper noise, indicating that it is feasible to distinguish different kinds of vegetation using the AHSI/GF-5 data.

AB  - The black soil zone in the northeast of China is one of the three largest black soil zones in the world, and the most important cultivated area for growing food crops in China Remote sensing can obtain regional soil information of large area more rapidly with less labor and money. One of the key issues of soil investigation is the extraction of bare soil. Hyperspectral remote sensing data have more spectral bands and nearly continuous spectral curve, indicating more detailed information of the soil properties than traditional multispectral images. By using hyperspectral data, we can obtain reliable bare soil information. This study aims to compare different bare soil extraction methods for black soil zone and analyze their feasibilities to be applied to AHSI/GF-5 data. Baoqing County in Heilongjiang Province is chosen as our study area. To perform a comprehensive and complete comparison of bare soil extraction methods, we compare 8 classical target detection algorithms and analyze the impacts of spectral dimension reduction and the spatial filter on the extraction results. The results show that it is feasible to extract bare soil information in the black soil zone based on AHSI/GF-5 hyperspectral data. MF and CEM can get the best extraction results with NPSAD and MNF through human-computer interaction parameter adjustment, while MTMF can also obtain a good extraction result without human interference.

TI  - The Space-Time Variation of Phase Imbalance for GF-3 Azimuth Multichannel Mode
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Azimuth multichannel (AMC) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an advanced technology that can prevent the minimum antenna area constraint and provide high-resolution and wide-swath SAR images. The calibration of phase imbalance is an important topic in the AMC SAR signal processing since it has a significant impact on the image quality. For one SAR image, the phase imbalance is usually considered as a constant. However, because of the attitude errors, antenna position errors, target elevation, target motion, and phase mismatch of the antenna pattern, the actual phase imbalance is time-varying in azimuth and space-varying in range. Although the space-time variation of phase imbalances is too tiny to make a little effect on the product quality, it is still meaning to study the variation. On the one hand, it is possible to quickly estimate the phase imbalance of the whole observing operation and eliminate the influences of target motion, on the phase imbalance. On the other hand, some parameters, such as motion, can be retrieved by the phase imbalance. This article first establishes the signal models between phase imbalances and attitude errors, antennal position errors, and target elevation. Then, the signal model is verified by some simulations based on the parameters of Gaofen-3 (GF-3). In addition, the phase imbalance of the real data acquired by GF-3 is processed. Finally, based on the procession results of GF-3 real data, this article makes some discussions and points out the direction for the future work.

TI  - GF-3 Polarimetric Data Quality Assessment Based on Automatic Extraction of Distributed Targets
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the needs of continuous data quality assessment for massive Gaofen-3 (GF-3) polarimetric data, an automatic and efficient quality evaluation method is urgently needed. In this article, an automated polarimetric SAR data quality assessment method is conducted using a classic convolution neural network (VGG-16). The method is first pretrained, performance-tested, and robustness-tested on Radarsat-2 fully polarimetric data, then trained by selected SAR scenes of GF-3 for being applied on GF-3 data. The network is supposed to fulfill the work of automatically and accurately selecting those distributed targets satisfying quality evaluation under various scenes. A PolSAR data assessment method based on these distributed targets proposed by the authors in previous work is then applied to give the evaluation results. Experiments on GF-3 data and the comparison to prior works and corner reflectors on polarimetric distortion assessment results verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method. The polarization data quality of GF-3 at different beams is also obtained. The technique and strategy in this article are practical and contributing to the long-term quality assessment of PolSAR data.

TI  - Grid-Based Model for Estimating Evapotranspiration Rates of Heterogeneous Land Surface
T2  - JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The complementary relationship areal evapotranspiration (CRAE) model estimates actual evapotranspiration (ET) based on potential and wet environment evapotranspiration rates. The existing CRAE-based models that calculate ET using point-based climatic inputs often adopt an interpolation method to produce spatially continuous ET grids at a regional scale. However, the effect of land surface heterogeneity on the ET estimation process is not well captured by these approaches. In the present study, the authors have developed a grid-based CRAE model (PY-CRAE) that accounts for the spatial heterogeneity in the land surface processes for estimating ET at a 4 km scale. The developed PY-CRAE model was applied for the entire state of Nebraska with monthly averaged climatic input data sets during the period 2000-2014. The performance of the PY-CRAE model along with the point-based CRAE model (WREVAP-CRAE) and a moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS)-ET data products were assessed against water balance-based ET values. The results indicate that the PY-CRAE model performance was superior when compared to WREVAP-CRAE and MODIS-ET models with mean absolute error and root-mean-square error values of 40.94 and 49.15 mm/year, respectively.

TI  - HRSiam: High-Resolution Siamese Network, Towards Space-borne Satellite Video Tracking
T2  - Code Ocean
M3  - Software
AB  - Tracking moving objects from space-borne satellite videos is a new and challenging task. The main difficulty stems from the extremely small size of the target of interest. First, because the target usually occupies only a few pixels, it is hard to obtain discriminative appearance features. Second, the small object can easily suffer from occlusion and illumination variation, making the features of objects less distinguishable from features in surrounding regions. Current state-of-the-art tracking approaches mainly consider high-level deep features of a single frame with low spatial resolution, and hardly benefit from inter-frame motion information inherent in videos. Thus, they fail to accurately locate such small objects and handle challenging scenarios in satellite videos. In this paper, we successfully design a lightweight parallel network with a high spatial resolution to locate the small objects in satellite videos. This architecture guarantees real-time and precise localization when applied to the Siamese Trackers. Moreover, a pixel-level refining model based on online moving object detection and adaptive fusion is proposed to enhance the tracking robustness in satellite videos. It models the video sequence in time to detect the moving targets in pixels and has ability to take full advantage of tracking and detecting. We conduct quantitative experiments on real satellite video datasets, and the results show the proposed HIGH- RESOLUTION SIAMESE NETWORK (HRSiam) achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance while running at over 30 FPS Copyright: MIT license Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA)

TI  - Ukrainian Society in 2014-2020: Problems of Decommunization Politics
T2  - UKRAINSKYI ISTORYCHNYI ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to analyze the key areas, public reception and consequences of decommunization politics, which has gained new impetus after Euromaidan. The methodological basis is an interdisciplinary approach. It includes a political component, as well as taking into account the fact that decommunization implies a worldview and cultural transformation of Ukrainian society. The principle of historicism, multifactoriality and comprehensive approach is used. The scientific novelty lies in the attempt to conceptualize the events of 2014-2020 related to the implementation of decommunization politics. Conclusion. The impetus for the politics of decommunization was the lack of a fully formed national historical narrative and the desire to form such a narrative. Cognitively, the object of decommunization is the history of Ukraine in the twentieth century, with special emphasis on the Soviet period and the national liberation struggle. Spatially, such an object is the public / symbolic space of cities and villages of Ukraine and its information and cultural space, where communication on the themes of the historical past takes place. A fundamental element of the politics of memory in Ukraine in 2014-2020 is the condemnation of the crimes of the communist regime, which in the conditions of the Russian-Ukrainian war is gradually becoming conventional. The most powerful instrument of decommunization was the legislative one - the adoption and implementation of four laws of April 9, 2015. The adoption of laws on decommunization, together with the use of an institutional tool - the activities of the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory, stimulated the process of separation from the communist / totalitarian past, from its symbolism and toponymy. Condemnation of the crimes of the communist government and the (completely unrealized) lustration procedure are the basic foundations of postcolonial discourse and elements of the roadmap for the formation of the Ukrainian political nation. Contrary to the claims of some critics of the politics of decommunization, the recognition of the ruling regime as criminal does not mean that there was nothing positive in the country subordinate to it, or that the "independence fighter" cannot a priori commit a crime. Sociological survey data show that the attitude of Ukrainian society to decommunization and its practical implementation is ambiguous and has a clear regional specificity.

TI  - Using Sentinel-2 Data to Predict Nitrogen Uptake in Maize Crop
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize nitrogen uptake map can give growers a good opportunity in order to have valuable information regarding the efficiency of nitrogen usage in their field. The spectral information of Sentinel-2 satellite data can be used for estimating maize nitrogen uptake. In this article, Sentinel-2 data as an efficient tool were used to assess the usage of vegetation indices over three years (2017-2019), in three different locations and growing conditions to compute crop nitrogen uptake. These types of data can be used for developing an array of precision agriculture applications. Three different farms located in various climate conditions have opted for this research. For each farm, ten reference points in each year were selected to estimate a maize nitrogen uptake predictive model and use for evaluation procedure (30% of field data was for accuracy assessment and the rest of them for model prediction). At peak greenness (peak biomass) date, eight spectral vegetation indices were used for determining maize nitrogen uptake. Among these vegetation indices, simple ratio red-edge had the highest performance. It could be confirmed from the highest R-2 and the lowest root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values (R-2 = 0.91 and RMSE = 11.34 kg/ha). Implementing this model in three different sites under various conditions proved the most top performance and accuracy of it. As a result, using near-infrared and red-edge bands in vegetation indices would be the better predictor formaize nitrogen uptake.

AB  - The spatial resolution of panchromatic (PAN) and thermal infrared (TIR) band is 15 m and 100 m respectively in Landsat-8 satellite dataset. The current research proposes an Intensity transformation based fusion method (ITFM) of PAN and TIR imagery. The proposed fusion method introduces unscented spatial filtering of input TIR and PAN images and component based fusion to downscale coarse resolution thermal data. The proposed algorithm has been examined with three thermal image downscaling methods, i.e., DisTrad, TsHARP and Local model. The relative comparison of fusion algorithms results has shown that the proposed ITFM fusion method has outperformed the other conventional methods. The proposed ITFM fusion method has merged edge details from PAN band and earth surface thermal information from TIR band precisely.

AB  - In geoscience and remote sensing necessitate thermal imagery having high-resolution for various applications like estimation of the Land surface temperature (LST) analysis, thermal comfort, urban energy resources, forest fire, assessment of evapotranspiration, drought prediction, etc. We need accurate and sharp thermal images to explore surface temperature related phenomenon on frequent basis. The present physical and technological constraints have not allowed us to dig up remote sensing thermal data at high temporal and spatial resolution simultaneously. Hence, it is obligatory to construct a dynamic relation between low- and high-resolution satellite data to acquire enhanced thermal images. The present study evaluates three downscaling algorithms in our study area, namely, disaggregation of radiometric surface temperature (DisTrad), sharpening thermal imagery (TsHARP), and local model using seasonal Landsat 8 and MODIS data thermal imagery. The aggregated Landsat 8 LST of 1000 m resolution has been downscaled to 400, 300, 200, and 100 m using DisTrad, TsHARP, and the local model and compared with original Landsat 8 and resampled LST of matching level. The results have shown that LST downscaling technique performance varies over climate, surface feature and earth surface moisture conditions. The models have not performed well in surface having highest and lowestwater content i.e. water bodies and arid sandy areas. Alternatively, regression-based downscaling accuracy is higher for NDVI > 0.3. For example, the accuracy of all algorithms is higher for the growing seasons (February and October) unlike the harvesting season (April). The root means square error of the downscaled LST increases from 400 to 100 m spatial resolution in all seasons. The downscaling algorithms gave realistic results of MODIS satellite thermal band to a spatial resolution of 200 m. The present study is an attempt to rationalize coarse resolution thermal image by using the association between earth facade vegetation indices and land surface temperature. The study aims to develop a robust LST downscaling algorithm for MODIS data at LANDSAT resolution. The downscaling methods successfully operate over a heterogeneous landscape and reduced thermal mixture effect to monitor the daily basis long-term environmental phenomena.

AB  - The satellite derived data is essential to remotely access the material surface temperature (MST) on Earth's facade. The present study aims to predict MST at higher resolutions from MODIS satellite low resolution (1000 m) data. The vegetation proportion (VP) based regression models has been used in the case study of Jaipur city, India. Three fundamental VP parameters [Soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and fractional vegetation cover (fc)] has been analyzed by the linear and polynomial regression model connecting MST and VP. The MST prediction results showed that linear regression model achieved better accuracy as compared to polynomial models. The NDVI has shown the highest correlation coefficient (R-2) and outperformed other VP, in all the seasons. The input data within pixel changeability coefficient (Cv) of (15% to 25%) had shown higher accuracy in MST prediction. The regression models were able to predict MST up to 200 m resolution from 1000 m spatial resolution data. The outcome of this research would facilitate the prediction of MST for numerous Earth surface materials. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The satellite's derived thermal data has been immensely supportive to remotely access the temperature of Earth's surface materials. The downscaling techniques have been used to predict material surface temperature (MST) at higher spatial resolutions. In this research, three MODIS satellite downscaling models named (Resolution adjusted regression downscaling (RAd), Kriging Regression (KR), and Regression Tree (RegTree)) have been developed and verified for urban and rural materials of Jaipur district, India. The Kriging regression downscaling model (KR) produced least RMSE (0.61 degrees C) followed by RAd (0.75 degrees C) and RegTree (0.82 degrees C) models at 100 m resolution. The KR model downscaled MODIS MST data at 100 m spatial resolution, showed error below (1 degrees C), for more than 60% of materials and less than (2 degrees C) error for 75% of the materials. KR based algorithm was most suitable for both rural and mixed landscape areas due to the reconstruction of residuals at each scale. The regression based material surface temperature (MST) downscaling techniques were precisely dependent on the Earth's surface material characteristics, particularly in urban landscape. The KR methodology would facilitate the prediction of MST for numerous Earth surface materials for lands surface and environmental related applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Open source MODIS satellite offers near-infrared (NIR) data at four times higher spatial resolution (250 m) than compared to thermal infrared (TIR) data (1000 m), respectively. In this study, MODIS Terra satellites material surface temperature (MST) images have been enhanced to the spatial resolution of 250 m, by utilizing the Kriging regression (KR) technique. The applicability of enhanced MST image has been evaluated for agricultural drought analysis and soil moisture mapping. The downscaling results of Terra MODIS MST by KR have shown that the enhanced MST images contain more detailed and precise information of Earths surface features. The difference in temperature variance (mu*) and standard deviation (sigma*) of enhanced MST image been almost insignificant i.e., less than (0.03), which, suggests excellent working of the KR downscaling model. The Correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.92, and Q-index of 0.84, respectively, signifies a good level of agreement between enhanced and original MST images. The enhanced drought and soil moisture maps at 250 m spatial resolution have revealed a higher intra-pixel variation compared to initial image of 1000 m spatial resolution. This methodology will be useful for regional level management of agricultural practices through thermal properties surface materials. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a small object, represented by approximately ten pixels in an image, change detection method based on multitask Siamese network for multi-temporal SAR images. In our proposed method, not only change detection task but also object classification task is introduced to the network. The classification task is expected to enhance the performance of change detection by providing semantic information of changes and to focus attention of the network towards the target small object class. We tested the proposed method for a real-world application of car parking lot monitoring with 1-meter resolution TerraSAR-X images. Experimental results show that the f-measure of change class is improved by more than 7% over conventional methods based on post-classification, PCA+K-means and Siamese network. Furthermore, car-to-car type change is detected by the proposed method with 25% higher accuracy over the method without the classification task.

M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and site-specific information on tillage practice is vital to understand the impacts of crop management on water quality, soil conservation, and soil carbon sequestration. Remote sensing is a cost-effective technique for surveillance and rapid assessment of tillage practice over large areas. A new empirical approach for accurately predicting tillage class using discriminant analysis (DA) on historical multi-temporal Landsat-TM 5 imagery has been developed. Ground truth data were obtained from the USDA-NRCS at 48 locations (20 conventional till [CT] and 28 conservation tillage or no-till [NT]). Classification accuracies were obtained for the DA models using reflectance values of Landsat-5 TM bands and Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI) values. The performance of the DA models was compared with Logistic Regression (LR) models. On the basis of classification accuracy and kappa (kappa) value, our results showed that the DA models performed better in tillage classification than the LR models. However, using NDTI values, both the DA and LR models performed similarly in tillage class discrimination. Model performance improved when a subset of locations rather than years was used. The results indicated broad-scale mapping of tillage practices is feasible using historical Landsat-5 TM imagery and DA-based classification.

AB  - The article examines communicative tactics and presentations of opinions, evaluations and worldview imperatives when socially significant relevant media topics are discussed in the Russian Internet space. The Internet as a network resource for organising mass communication on websites creates unique conditions both for interactive interpersonal communication between representatives of different communities of Russian society and for interactive communication between actors of media discourse and a mass audience. Such communication of respondents of electronic media publications has its own specific features of linguistic expression and argumentative-rhetorical objectification. Of particular interest are the means, methods and techniques for updating axiological and regulatory meanings in a discussion of media topoi characterised as extraordinary, i.e. political scandals, armed conflicts (internal or threatening the country's security), terrorist attacks, natural disasters, technological and environmental disasters, international sanctions, etc. The authors also analyse the linguistic dominants in interpreting the oppositions of "own - alien", "ours - not ours", the polarity of opinions and evaluations in the tonality of solidarity/distancing, support/discrediting, accusations of legitimacy/illegality, etc. In addition, the authors refine the definition of methods, techniques and forms for presenting direct or veiled evaluations, itemise the nomenclature of multilevel linguistic means of its expression, disclose the pragmatic potential of individual linguistic units and the actualisation of expression, affectability, social and subjective modality, including those with a precedent status, and confirm the role of evaluations as text-producing categories. The work involved the descriptive and analytical method as well as the methods of continuous sampling, contextual analysis and structural-componental analysis. The use of the descriptive-analytical method, which includes observation, comparison, generalisation and interpretation of the facts obtained, allowed us to have a clear idea of the linguistic topic under study, develop a description sequence as well as organise and arrange the linguistic material. Due to contextual analysis, we were able to highlight the shades of meaning in the semantic structure of multilevel pejorative linguistic means, and structural-componental analysis made it possible to consider the components of a frequency creative invective. The analysis of the actual material based on the continuous sampling method also showed that the invective tools used in the interactive discussion by the respondents are the dominant method for meaning-making, actualising the estimated meaning, strengthening the expressiveness and polarity of opinions both in general and at the level of the communicants' comment fragment.

TI  - Study of aerosol optical depth using satellite data (MODIS Aqua) over Indian Territory and its relation to particulate matter concentration
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Air quality all over India has been deteriorated significantly over the last few decades, posing a significant risk to health-related issues like asthma and cardiorespiratory illness. Ground-based monitoring of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) in India is limited to few particular sites only; hence, health-related studies are restricted to regional scale only. Thus, the major aim of the present study is to estimate the local PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentration from the aerosol optical depth (AOD) level. AOD levels are determined from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Earth Observing System Aqua satellites. Moreover, the annual, seasonal, and diurnal trend of AOD over India was also studied. Single and multiple linear regression models for estimating the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were also conducted. Multiple regression analyses were performed considering MODIS-based AOD with meteorological parameters like temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and precipitation. The results indicated that both the PM2.5 and PM10 had a weak correlation with MODIS-based AOD for simple linear regression model, whereas the regression coefficients improved significantly for multiple linear regression analyses. Thus, the proposed multiple linear regression models can be used in the estimation of PM2.5 and PM10 concentration in different parts of the country using MODIS image without ground monitoring. Therefore, the predicted results can help to perform the air pollution-related health impact studies all over the country.

TI  - DESIGNING THE SOVIET IDENTITY (THROUGH THE EXAMPLE OF ELYOR ISHMUKHAMEDOV'S FILMS <i>TENDERNESS</i> AND <i>LOVERS</i>)
T2  - NAUKA TELEVIDENIYA-THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TELEVISION
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies the Soviet identity, which fell into a crisis in the context of globalization and ethnic localization, gradually intensifying after the collapse of the USSR. In response to the decay of the Soviet mentality, it is necessary to understand how to overcome the split in society and make the process of cultural transformation under modernization conditions less painful for people. One of the mechanisms of forming the cultural identity of peoples is an appeal to the positive experience in common history. Simply copying the previous forms and means of forming cultural identity is impossible, since socio-economic foundations change; therefore, the problem needs a different solution. Exploring the Soviet past, one can understand which ideological values contributed to the consolidation of society in order to use this experience in construction of Russian civilizational identity.The purpose of the article is to study the films by Elyor Ishmukhamedov Tenderness (1966) and Lovers (1969) as "texts" that construct Soviet identity by dint of the recognition and acceptance of the ideal life model by the society. Since humans transform themselves and the world around them through an imitation, the main research questions are as follows: what social interaction features can be identified in these films? What is the appeal of the Soviet discourse and how is it transmitted in such seemingly "non-ideological" films?Ishmukhamedov's films were studied as a semiotic system, in which the main myths and archetypes were revealed that had a manipulative and mobilizing influence on the viewer, thereby creating an image of a Soviet person which is attractive to the masses. The everyday life captured in these films symbolizes the stability and reliability of living in the USSR and Central Asia in the 1960s.After analyzing the figurative system of the Soviet-time everyday life in Ishmukhamedov's films, the author finds out that identity is a system consisting of ethnic, cultural, age, natural, social, professional, mental, artifact identities, as well as the identity of the genus and small groups, which set the models and patterns of behavior for a Soviet person, which patterns were accepted and copied by the people.

TI  - Satellite-based estimation of hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels during heavy winter pollution episodes in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the developing countries such as China, most well-developed areas have suffered severe haze pollution, which was associated with increased premature morbidity and mortality and attracted widespread public concerns. Since ground-based PM2.5 monitoring has limited temporal and spatial coverage, satellite aerosol remote sensing data has been increasingly applied to map large-scale PM2.5 characteristics through advanced spatial statistical models. Although most existing research has taken advantage of the polar orbiting satellite instruments, a major limitation of the polar orbiting platform is its limited sampling frequency (e.g., 1-2 times/day), which is insufficient for capturing the PM2.5 variability during short but intense heavy haze episodes. As the first attempt, we quantitatively investigated the feasibility of using the aerosol optical depth (AOD) data retrieved by the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) to estimate hourly PM2.5 concentrations during winter haze episodes in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). We developed a three-stage spatial statistical model, using GOCI AOD and fine mode fraction, as well as corresponding monitoring PM2.5 concentrations, meteorological and land use data on a 6-km modeling grid with complete coverage in time and space. The 10-fold cross-validation R-2 was 0.72 with a regression slope of 1.01 between observed and predicted hourly PM2.5 concentrations. After gap filling, the R-2 value for the three-stage model was 0.68. We further analyzed two representative large regional episodes, i.e., a "multi-process diffusion episode" during December 21-26, 2015 and a "Chinese New Year episode" during February 7-8, 2016. We concluded that AOD retrieved by geostationary satellites could serve as a new valuable data source for analyzing the heavy air pollution episodes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - Support of the economic growth of Ukrainian agriculture requires the development and effective use of innovative technologies. In particular, satellite analysis makes it possible to monitor the state of agricultural land by monitoring their qualitative and quantitative indicators of natural and climatic characteristics. Satellite monitoring of agricultural land use in Ukraine has been developed within the World Bank program "Supporting Transparent Land Governance in Ukraine" in collaboration with EOS Data Analytics and Space Research Institute National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and State Space Agency of Ukraine. Based on the developed technology, classification maps of the land cover were built based on three data sets: ground data along roads, farmers' data, and satellite data (time series of "Sentinel-2" optical data and Sentinel-1 radar data). To create classification maps, the Random Forest algorithm was used, which is implemented on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. An accuracy assessment was carried out, and crop compared areas throughout Ukraine were obtained. According to the results of the experiment, a comparison of the classification obtained from two separate training data sets (ground data collected along roads and data of farmers) is given. As a result, a validated crop map was obtained. The map is presented on the official web-portal of the State Geocadastre of Ukraine. The main results of the analysis of the agricultural lands of Ukraine, as well as, the results of comparisons with statistical data, are presented.

AB  - Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and one of the most important wetlands in the world. Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) was the first C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) with the resolution up to 1m. With its polarimetric imaging capability, 2 scenes of GF-3 PolSAR data (two adjacent scenes) were used to extract open water in Poyang Lake. After pre-processing, the polarization characteristic for different land covers in the study area were analyzed. Then these 2 scenes of GF-3 data were mosaiced together. The H/A/alpha-Wishart classification method was used to classify the water body out for the GF-3 data. Meanwhile, the object-oriented (OO) segmentation method was used to segment the double/volume/surface component images from Freeman-Durden polarimetric decomposition. Then the Random Forest (RF) classification method was used to classify the image to extract open water. Comparing the results from these two classification methods, we can find the advantages of the combination of the OO segmentation and RF classification method in the spatial continuity of classification results over the H/A/alpha-Wishart classification method.

AB  - Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and one of the most important wetlands in the world. Wetland biomass is a key index to weigh the healthiness of wetland ecosystem. Polarimetric information can significantly improve wetland vegetation biomass inversion. In this study, 4 scenes of RADARSAT-2 PolSAR data in year 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016 were used to estimate the above-ground-biomass (AGB) for the Poyang Lake Wetland. For this purpose, polarimetric decomposition components and a simplified Water-Cloud Model (WCM) were used. The parameters of the simplified WCM were retrieved using the field measurements and the polarimetric decomposition components. Finally, the relationship between the estimated AGB and measured AGB was assessed and the vegetation biomass distribution in year 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016 were also mapped.

TI  - Spatial pattern and seasonal dynamics of the photosynthesis activity across Australian rainfed croplands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Early detection of crop water and heat stress for effective crop management requires continuous and accurate monitoring of cropland photosynthesis activity. Satellite measurements can complement the restrictive coverage afforded by in-situ measurements and have the potential to facilitate the monitoring of cropland photosynthesis over a large spatial scale in a cost-effective manner. Traditionally, space-based monitoring of cropland photosynthetic activity, especially Light-use efficiency (LUE), has relied on empirical relationships between satellite spectral reflectance and ground climate and vegetation conditions. Space-borne retrievals of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), an independent measurement, has shown to provide a more direct estimation of photosynthetic activity than traditional methods, and may further allow the inference of LUE.This study has empirically explored the possibility of remotely monitoring large-scale LUE by calculating the ratio of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) normalized SIF to the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). We applied this calculation to demonstrate the spatial patterns and seasonal dynamics of LUE and its related measurements in response to land surface temperature (LST) across Australian rainfed croplands from 2007 to 2016. LST was used to provide an integrated measure of vegetation water and heat stress at the canopy level.Our results showed that LUE tends to be higher in the geographical middle zones than in either the warmer northern or the cooler southern regions. Temporally, we found that there was a seasonal asymmetry of LUE and its related measurements in response to LST change throughout the winter crop-growing season. Statistical tests revealed that the optimum LST range for satellite-based LUE was 16.6-17.6 degrees C during August. The more LST exceeded this optimum, the more sensitive LUE was found to be. Pixels in August with optimum LST across the ten-year sampling period (Augusts of 2007-2016) were distributed in the southern-middle to middle zones of the Australian rainfed croplands.Our results provide new opportunities for large-scale cropland heat and drought stress detection under a future warmer and drier climate and can also support remote analyses of crop photosynthetic activity over large spatial scales.

AB  - Seasonal rainfall is the dominant driver of grain yield in Australia where grain crops are grown in rainfed, broadacre farming systems. Effective monitoring of within-farm scale management and crop response is of great importance to grain growers in Australia. Landsat data have the potential to bridge the gap between broadacre cropping and precision agriculture. However, the images acquired by different Landsat sensors are subject to the conditions of the sensors and their onboard satellite platforms. This study empirically combined the time series of images from both Landsat 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI to detect the changes in winter wheat phenology at a typical farm paddock in Western Australia. Results showed that: 1) the combined method for incorporating Landsat 7 and 8 imagery improves the data frequency, in terms of higher temporal resolution and less missing values; 2) phenological detections based on the combined dataset are more realistic than those based on either of the two series of data separately. This study provides a better understanding of the usefulness of Landsat imagery for identifying and mapping crop phenology at within-farm scale.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of norovirus associated with acute gastroenteritis in Taizhou, China: A retrospective study
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Norovirus (NoV) is recognized as a leading global cause of viral acute gastroenteritis (AGE). To better understand the prevalence and genotypic patterns of NoV infection in Southeast China, we conducted a retrospective study of diarrheal syndrome surveillance of NoV and analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of AGE cases and phylogenetic evolution of NoV strains.Methods: 1464 AGE patients in two diarrhea surveillance sentinel hospitals were sampled during 2016 and 2017. NoV Positive samples were genotyped by ORF1/ORF2 overlapping regional gene sequencing. Sequences analyses of the NoV genotypes were confirmed by online NoV Genotyping Tool and the phylogenetic analysis was constructed by MEGA 7.0.Results: 139 (9.49%) of the AGE specimens were NoV positive. The GII strain was the main geno-group in NoV infected patients. At least 12 NoV genotypes and seven recombinant strains were detected. Major NoV genotypic transformations were GII.Pe/GII.4, GII.P17/GII.17 and GII.Pe/GII.17 in 2016 to GII.P16/GII.2, GII.P17/GII.17 and GII.Pe/GII.4 in 2017. Phylogenetic analysis showed that GII.P16/GII.2 recombinant strains clustered with those detected in the USA, Russia and Japan in 2016.Conclusion: We characterized the molecular epidemiology of NoV infection in AGE patients during 2016-2017. The main three NoV GII genotypes circulating in the population of Taizhou were GII.P17/GII.17, GII.Pe/GII.4 and GII.P16/GII.2.The GII.P16/GII.2 genotype has become the predominant strain since first quarter 2017. Monitoring of the NoV genotypic shift is important for the prevention and control of AGE. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - An introduced pasture grass (Andropogon gayanus - gamba grass) is spreading through the tropical savannas of northern Australia, with detrimental ecosystem consequences including increased fire intensity. In order to monitor and manage the spread of gamba grass, a scalable solution for mapping its distribution over large areas is required. Recent developments in machine learning have proven useful for distinguishing vegetation types in satellite imagery in an automated manner. In this study, we collected field data for supervised learning of very high-resolution (0.3 m) WorldView-3 satellite imagery and tuned the hyperparameters of an extreme gradient boosting classifier to produce a viable solution for detecting the probability of gamba grass presence. To evaluate the performance of WorldView-3 imagery in discriminating gamba grass, we tested the utility of predictors derived from: 1) spectral bands; 2) textural features; 3) spectral indices; and 4) all predictors combined. Our results suggest that gamba grass presence can be mapped from space with an accuracy of up to 91% under optimal environmental conditions.

AB  - An accurate model of yield prediction will benefit many aspects of managing growth and harvest of sugarcane crops. In this study Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series were used to automatically detect harvest dates of sugarcane fields in the Far North Queensland of Australia. Harvest date information was further used in combination with weather, soil and elevation data to predict sugarcane yield at different time steps over three consecutive growing seasons using machine learning. Our results suggest that harvest dates could be identified with detection rates of 87% and 91% using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, respectively. Similarly, sugarcane yield could be predicted using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in conjunction with other geographical attributes with accuracy of 65% as early as 180 days after the previous harvest.

AB  - Determining the essence of any substance requires the construction of its definition. It is necessary to find a generic concept to construct a definition, and it includes the scope of the definition concept. However, there are such concepts to be the most general of their kind, and therefore generic concepts cannot be found for them. These concepts are meant to be three most general philosophical categories: God, man, and the world. We call these three categories as permanent metaphysical structures. Consequently, human always seeks to outline the objects of his interest in his mind. If a definition is not possible, then they are replaced by explications or quasi-definitions.

TI  - The competency-based medical education evolution of Canadian emergency medicine specialist training
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Canadian specialist emergency medicine (EM) residency training is undergoing the most significant transformation in its history. This article describes the rationale, process, and redesign of EM competency-based medical education. The rationale for this evolution in residency education includes 1) improved public trust by increasing transparency of the quality and rigour of residency education, 2) improved fiscal accountability to government and institutions regarding specialist EM training, 3) improved assessment systems to replace poor functioning end-of-rotation assessment reports and overemphasis on high-stakes, end-of-training examinations, and 4) and tailored learning for residents to address individualized needs. A working group with geographic and stakeholder representation convened over a 2-year period. A consensus process for decision-making was used. Four key design features of the new residency education design include 1) specialty EM-specific outcomes to be achieved in residency; 2) designation of four progressive stages of training, linked to required learning experiences and entrustable professional activities to be achieved at each stage; 3) tailored learning that provides residency programs and learner flexibility to adapt to local resources and learner needs; and 4) programmatic assessment that emphasizes systematic, longitudinal assessments from multiple sources, and sampling sentinel abilities. Required future study includes a program evaluation of this complex education intervention to ensure that intended outcomes are achieved and unintended outcomes are identified.

TI  - Probabilistic Mapping of August 2018 Flood of Kerala, India, Using Space-Borne Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging provides an all-weather sensing technique that is suitable for near-real-time mapping of disasters such as floods. In this article, we use SAR data acquired by Sentinel-1A/B satellites to investigate a flood event that affected the Indian state of Kerala in August 2018. We apply a Bayesian approach to generate probabilistic flood maps, which contain for each pixel its probability to be flooded rather than binary flood information. We find that the extent of the flooded area begins to increase throughout Kerala after August 8, with the highest values on August 9 and August 21. We observe no apparent correlation between the spatial distributions of the flooded areas and the rainfall amounts at the district level of the study area. Instead, larger flooded areas are in the districts of Alappuzha and Kottayam, located in the downstream floodplain of the Idduki dam, which released a significant volume of water on August 16. The lack of apparent correlation is likely due to two reasons: first, there is often some delay between the rainfall event and the flooding, especially for rather large catchments where flood waves need some time to reach floodplains from higher elevations. Second, rainfall is more abundant at overhead catchments (hills and mountains), whereas flood occurs further downstream in the floodplains. Further comparison of our SAR-based flood maps with optical data and flood maps produced by moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer highlights the advantages of our data and approach for rapid response purposes and future flood forecasting.

TI  - Persistent loss of biologically-rich tropical forests in the Indian Eastern Himalaya
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Using fine-resolution satellite imagery from multiple satellite data products, we assessed the change in forest cover of a state-managed Reserve Forest (RF) located in India's Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hot-spot. 4.6% of forest cover was lost from Papum RF between 2013 and 2017 at the rate of 8.2 km(2) year(-1). Three species of hornbills: Great Hornbill Buceros bicornis Linnaeus, 1758, Wreathed Hornbill Rhyticeros undulatus (Shaw, 1811) and Oriental Pied Hornbill Anthracoceros albirostris (Shaw, 1808), that are functionally important are found here with nesting habitat in the areas affected by illegal logging. Therefore, we assessed the habitat loss within a 1 km radius around 29 nest trees. From 2011 to 2019, forest cover declined from 38.55 km(2) to 21.94 km(2) around these hornbill nest trees. Illegal logging is the main driver that is depleting forest cover within this important bird area. Our results highlight the ongoing threats to biologically-rich forests and the need for urgent measures to halt this loss. We suggest that this study has practical implications for the monitoring and governance of state-managed forests in Arunachal Pradesh.

TI  - NEWEST GEODYNAMICS RECONSTRUCTION OF THE MIDDLE DNIEPER REGION AND ITS MANIFESTATIONS IN THE RELIEF
T2  - VISNYK OF TARAS SHEVCHENKO NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF KYIV-GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on a comprehensive structural-morphometric analysis, Earth remote sensing data and GIS analysis, the evolution of the paleorelief of the right bank of the Middle Dnieper in the recent period is reconstructed. Based on the stepwise morphostructural-neotectonic analysis, morphodynamic and evolutionary trends in the landscape relief of this region are traced. Three morphostructures (Kyiv, Obukhiv, Kanevskaya-Trakhtemirovsky blocks) were identified and characterized. Quantitative indicators of the relief were determined during each stage, and the total oscillation amplitudes were analyzed both over short time intervals and for the entire Neogene-Quaternary period. On the whole, the amplitude of fluctuations in the elevations of the relief of the Middle Dnieper in the Neogene-Quaternary period in the northern part was 100 m, in the southern - 135 m. The differentiated nature of neotectonic movements and the change in their activity over time were reconstructed. It was confirmed that the northern regions of the region had an active upward dynamics of movements in the Neogene era, and the southern ones in the Quaternary.The modern stage marks the opposite phenomenon - the north-eastern regions rise again and the south-western ones fall.The obtained data can serve as a basis for analyzing the influence of tectonic movements on the activation of dangerous geological processes within the Middle Dnieper and forecasting their development in the future.

AB  - Introduction: the article is devoted to the consideration of the genre strategy of poem in the in creativity of N. Ishutkin. Subjects of analysis are the methods and forms of representation of the author ' s consciousness in his "little poem". The problems actualized in the work fit into the complex of studies of modern Finno-Ugric literary criticism.Objective: to analyze the architectonics, the problem-thematic focus of the "little poem" by N. Ishutkin, as well as the means of structuring of the artistic image, which are due to the peculiarities of the author ' s worldview, his aesthetic conception of the world and man.Research materials: the "little poems" by N. Ishutkin "The Sacred Tree", "Unfortunate Russia", "Post-War Children".Results and novelty of the research: the "little poems" by N. Ishutkin for the first time becomes the object of scientific reflection and are introduced into the context of Finno-Ugric literary criticism. As a result of the scrupulous analysis of empirical material, the author comes to the conclusion that in the "little poems" N. Ishutkin refers to the comprehension of different stages of the country's history and the artistic expression of the image of a person of a certain sociocultural environment. The author perceives reality syncretically: he is interested in the relationship between man and the world, an individual and society in the whole variety of their manifestations. The "little poem" by N. Ishutkin is characterized by the laconicism of the plot, fragmentariness of its development, the eclecticism of poetry, explicit recreation of events and facts of reality.

AB  - A new empirical formula is established to retrieve Total Precipitable Water(TPW) over South China Sea by using multi-channel infrared data of Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager(AGRI). The new formula has a better result compared with other split-window statistical retrieval technique. The preliminary verification results show that the retrieval results is good correlated with AIRS L2 V6 TPW products with root mean square error of 0.6 cm and with mean relative error of 4.7%. Finally, 227 sets of bank-based sounding data are used to verify the retrieval results for the whole year from March 2018 to April 2019. The determination coefficient is 0.7063 and the root mean square error is 0.63 cm. The results show that the proposed statistical retrieval formula is suitable for multi-channel infrared data of FY-4A/AGRI to retrieve the TPW over the South China Sea.

TI  - Comparing Pixel-Based Random Forest and the Object-Based Support Vector Machine Approaches to Map the Quasi-Circular Vegetation Patches Using Individual Seasonal Fused GF-1 Imagery
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal effect on land cover classification has been widely recognized. It is important to use the imagery acquired at key points of vegetation phenological development to obtain a higher classification accuracy for land cover. This study compared the effect of seasons on landscape classification and the quasi-circular vegetation patches (QVPs) detection from four fused Gaofen 1 images acquired in the different seasons by using the pixel-based random forest (RF) and object-based support vector machine (SVM) methods over the Yellow River Delta, China. The results from this study demonstrated that the seasonal effect on classifying landscapes and detecting the QVPs is significant, especially for the pixel-based RF method. The object-based SVM method was more appropriate for classifying landscape from the non-growing season images, while the pixel-based RF approach was more suitable for classifying the growing-season images. The spring data (April imagery; overall accuracy = 99.8%) and the winter data (February imagery; F measure = 65.9%) yielded the best results for landscape classification and QVP detection, respectively, by using the object-based SVM approach. Therefore, in practice, we recommend the use of February to April imagery with the object-based SVM approach to map the QVPs in the future.

TI  - Mapping Plastic Greenhouses Using Spectral Metrics Derived From GaoFen-2 Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic greenhouses are an important hallmark of agricultural progress. To meet the growing demand for vegetable and food, the amount of plastic greenhouses has increased significantly over the past few decades. Remote sensing is considered as a promising data source for taking inventory and monitoring plastic greenhouses for managing modern agriculture. However, a systematic catalog of number and spatial distribution of plastic greenhouses is mostly inexistent. This is primarily due to the complex land surface characteristics and seasonal changes, which make automated classification based on EO data challenging. Current approaches generally suffer from the susceptibility of approaches toward thresholds and changes in the phenological stage. Besides, they often require an extensive training of models, however, often the necessary amount of training data is inexistent. To address these issues, we suggest an adaptable and universal plastic greenhouse mapping method based on very high spatial resolution optical satellite data (GaoFen-2 image) with a three-step procedure. A plastic greenhouse gathering area (100 km(2)) is selected for the development of the initial method. We receive a very competitive mapping accuracy 97.34% and the likelihood of plastic greenhouses being mapped correctly reaches to 95.20%. Subsequently, we transfer it to a much larger area (2025 km(2)) featuring a different phenological stage and different surrounding patterns. The stable mapping accuracy proves the validity of our approach.

TI  - Evaluation of Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index on Drought Monitoring Over Eurasia
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored the applicability of Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) data for drought monitoring in Eurasia from April to September during 2005 - 2014. TVDI was calculated based on the vegetation index/temperature trapezoid eigenspace (VITT) in this study. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index in three time scales (SPEI-01, SPEI-03, SPEI-06) and the Essential Climate Variable surface soil moisture product (ECV-SM) was used to evaluate the performance of TVDI over Eurasia, and to assess the sensitivity of TVDI to different land-cover types. The records of drought events from Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) were also used to validate TVDI. The results indicated that TVDI negatively responded to SPEIs about 77.43 & x0025;, 72.01 & x0025;, and 75.95 & x0025; of lands respectively, of which 29.84 & x0025;, 33.93 & x0025;, and 25.59 & x0025; were subjected significant relationships (p & x003C;0.05). A negative correlation between TVDI and SPEIs was detected in most land-cover types, except for evergreen broadleaf forest and deciduous needleaf forest. Similarly, TVDI was also negative correlated with ECV-SM. About 66 & x0025; of the study areas show negative correlation and 33 & x0025; of them were statistically significant. There is a highly negative correlation between TVDI and ECV-SM in most types of land cover. Moreover, TVDI could not reflect drought condition correctly when TVDI & x003C;0.40; it could only reflect long-time excessive drought condition when TVDI & x003E;0.86. A comparison of TVDI with drought records demonstrated that the TVDI could capture drought events in study area.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TAIBAH UNIVERSITY FOR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of remotely sensed data allowed the successful characterization of the hydrothermal alteration zones of the Abu-Gaharish area in the Central Eastern Desert of Egypt using image transformation techniques. The integration of several evidential maps highlighted the plausible areas with high concentrations of argillic and phyllic, key hydrothermal minerals that reflect the intensity of hydrothermal effects and the probable sites of ore bodies. The excellent prospective zone identified in the map occupies around 1.39% of the study area. Kaolinite-smectite minerals with correlation scores of around 0.97 were consistent with areas of hydrothermal alteration and mining activities; however, propylitic minerals were confined to basic metavolcanics and serpentinites. The resulting predictive map was assessed using existing mining data with significant consistency; therefore, ?eld veri?cation is essential. The overall results showed that remotely sensed data represent a valuable mapping tool for geological and mineral resources reconnaissance in the arid regions

CP  - 5th International Conference on Energy Equipment Science and Engineering (ICEESE)
CL  - Harbin, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Estimating net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) on regional and global scales is important for the carbon cycle and the greenhouse effect. The eddy covariance technique provides long-term continuous monitoring of site-specific NEE at the tower footprint scale. Remote sensing technology can continuously and systematically monitor multiple information of terrestrial ecosystem at regional scale, and it becomes an important tool to extend NEE to large scale combining with flux data. In present study, according to TG model, we established several new NEE models (using linear regress method based on single variable or multiple variables) that are suitable for Dayekou Guantan forest station with Moderate-resolution Imaging Sepctroradiometer (MODIS) products. Variables include enhanced vegetation index (EVI), land surface water index (LSWI) and land surface temperature (LST, including daytime LST and nighttime LST'). Compared with models based on single variable, models based on EVI, LSWI and LST have the best effect. Results showed that this method had good precision (2008) (R-2 and RMSE reached 0.8014 and 0.7364, respectively) and generally captured the expected seasonal patterns of NEE. We validated the model using independent flux (2009), which demonstrated this method performed well for estimating NEE (R2 and RMSE reached 0.8618 and 0.5538, respectively). In addition, during the whole process, variables had obvious seasonal dynamical characteristics and closely related to NEE seasonal dynamics. However, uncertainty still existed in this method. In future research, more influencing factors should be selected to simulate NEE more accurately and extend the scope of research to a larger extent.

TI  - Revealing the Correlation between Population Density and the Spatial Distribution of Urban Public Service Facilities with Mobile Phone Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Some studies have confirmed the association between urban public services and population density; however, other studies using census data, for example, have arrived at the opposite conclusion. Mobile signaling data provide new technological tools to investigate the subject. Based on the data of 20 million 2G mobile phone users in downtown Shanghai and the land use data of urban public service facilities, this study explores the spatiotemporal correlation between population density and public service facilities' locations in downtown Shanghai and its variation laws. The correlation between individual population density at day vs. night and urban public service facilities distribution was also examined from a dynamic perspective. The results show a correlation between service facilities' locations and urban population density at different times of the day. As a result, the average population density observed over a long period of time (day-time periodicity or longer) with census data or remote sensing data does not directly correlation with the distribution of public service facilities despite its correlation with public service facilities distribution. Among them, there is a significant spatial correlation between public service facilities and daytime population density and a significant spatial correlation between non-public service facilities and night-time population density. The spatial and temporal changes in the relationship between urban population density and service facilities is due to changing crowd behavior; however, the density of specific types of behavior is the real factor that affects the layout of urban public service facilities. The results show that mobile signaling data and land use data of service facilities are of great value for studying the spatiotemporal correlations between urban population density and service facilities.

AB  - The causes of contemporary environmental and ecological crisis are multiple and complex. This crisis cannot be resolved by science or technology alone. We need not only knowledge, economic, and technology, but also worldviews, ethos, and practices to reconnect humans, other species, and nature. A sustainable ecology relies on ideals and ways of life which include value, belief, worldview, ethical commitment, and pattern of life. The Enlightenment tradition prioritizes human sovereignty over non-human world and invokes individualism, materialism, and consumerism, which objectify, materialize, and instrumentalize the non-human world; detach human being from transcendental constraint on human desire; and seduce human being into short-term self-interested pursuit. They are the main determinants of modern way of living and the major causes of contemporary environmental and ecological crisis.Religious worldviews define the status of human in the world and the human-nature relation. Religious ethos can be biocentric and ecocentric ethics rather than self-centered ethics or materialistic worldview. Furthermore religion grounds its ethics on transcendental or sacred base and incorporates its ethical norms in the practice of everyday life, communal living, and even every spheres of human activities.Nevertheless, there are diverse religions and various models of environmental education. There are difference, even disputes, between science and religion in some aspects. In a situation of diversity there needs to be an open and inclusive public sphere and procedure of engaged mutual understanding for reaching a consensus or temporary mutual agreement concerning environmental education.

AB  - The capital city of Dhaka has only 7% traffic roads (compared to 25% urban standard) in presence of approximately 8 million computers a day with in 306 sq km area. The senario of Dhaka traffic is unique which poses complex new challanges in terms of automated traffic detection. To solve the problem using advances in AI-based technology and ICT solutions, we are calling for splutions to automatic Dhaka traffic detection problems on optical images. This new AI-Based Dhaka Traffic Detection Challenge aims at accessing the ability of state-of-the-art methods to detect and recognize traffic vehicles. This solution is encountered in mordern cities where multile cultures live and communicate together, where users see various scripts and languages in a way that prevents using much a priori knowledge. Alos, at the same time, the academics and researches from region who are experts in AI or interested in exploring possibilities could be brought to a networking community throug this campaign. Working together on a common problem statement can create the right synergies needed to build AI-based community in South-East Asia.

AB  - This paper focused on the aspect of chronophotography which deals with transformability of reality. I argue that we need to consider the transformational aspect of reality as much as its indexicality, which is an exact display of reality. By using chronophotography as photographic technology, Marey tried to find the objective truths of the mechanical world. As such, he used photography as a scientific tool. Some of Rene Descartes’s ideas can help explain the double sidedness of present reality in chronophotography. As for its indexicality, I compare Descartes’s mechanistic worldview to Marey’s physiological aim to see how these are similar. Secondly, for the transformability of chronophotography, I refer to Descartes’s description about how alphabets represent the various qualities of reality. It is one of the main grounds that supports my argument that chronophotography does not show reality precisely. Consider that the technical mechanism of chronophotography was adopted in cinema, such analysis can give a clue that indirectly demonstrates the ambivalence of cinema in which the reproduction of reality and the transformation of reality conflict and coexist at the same time.

TI  - Discriminating Land Use and Land Cover Classes in Brazil Based on the Annual PROBA-V 100 m Time Series
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil, with more than 8 million km(2), presents six different biomes, ranging from natural grasslands (Pampa biome) to tropical rainfall forests (Amazonia biome), with different land-use types (mostly pasturelands and croplands) and pressures (mainly in the Cerrado biome). The objective of this article is to present a new method to discriminate the most representative land use and land cover (LULC) classes of Brazil, based on the PROBA-V images. The images were converted into vegetation, soil, and shade fraction images by applying the linear spectral mixing model. Then, the pixel-based, highest proportion, annual mosaics of the fraction images, and their corresponding standard deviation images were derived and classified using the random forest algorithm. The following LULC classes were considered: forestlands, shrublands, grasslands, croplands, pasturelands, water bodies, and others. An agreement analysis was conducted with two available LULC maps derived from the Landsat satellite, the MapBiomas, and the Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring-Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC) projects. Forestlands (412 million ha) and pasturelands (242 million ha) were the two most representative LULC classes; and croplands accounted for 30 million ha. The results presented an overall agreement of 69% and 58% with the MapBiomas and FROM-GLC projects, respectively. The proposed method is a good alternative to support operational projects of LULC map production that are important for planning biodiversity conservation or environmentally sustainable land occupation.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The vast majority of prior work on satellite image super-resolution (SR) assumes the availability of paired training data, and then uses low-resolution (LR) images artificially generated by simple blurring and/or down-sampling. These methods often fail to produce convincing results in real-world data since the actual degradation is much more complex than manually designed. This paper presents a deep learning framework to model the degradation process of microsatellite image. To this end, we first introduce remote sensing dataset consisting of WorldView (0.4m) and PlanetScope (3m) satellite images. They are aligned to the same coordinate, but are collected at different days/times. Using such data, we design Degradation Network (DegNet), generating realistic micro-satellite images from its high-resolution (HR) counterpart. A degradation loss using an optimal transport distance is proposed which makes the empirical distribution, i.e., histogram of outputs to be similar to that of real microsatellite images. It faithfully reflects the degradation characteristic of micro-satellite while preserving the content of an input. Finally, a SR network is trained with the generated LR-HR pairs. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method greatly improves the SR performance on real-world data.

AB  - In this study, I examined the image and meaning of the underworld through the myths of Korea, the legends of Baekdusan, and various folktales and classical novels. I tried to measure the cosmological worldview and social symbols together.In Korean creation myth, it is said that the earth was originally mixed with the sky. The underground world in the myth is the original divine space paired with the heaven world. The fact that the eyes of the blue creatures rising from the earth became the sun and moon shows the vitality of the underground world.The underground power is expressed in the mythical legend of the Baekdusan region as a negative that causes great disaster. The black dragon and the god of hell represent the dark powers of the underground, and are described as objects to be defeated.The negative aspects of the underground world are well reflected in folktales and novels about underground thieves. Underground forces are the ugly beings that shake human order and are subject to extermination. The underground system in these works is highly related to criminal groups such as mafia and drug organizations.However, the underground world in folktales and novels was not the only object of downfall and denial. There are works that think of the underground world as a space in parallel with the ground world, or as a place with extraordinary vitality beyond the earthly world.The feature-length novel <Samhanseupyu[三韓拾遺]> shows a relativistic and dynamic perception of the underworld. The basement, which belongs to the basement, is considered to have a fundamental existence and possess a law comparable to that of heaven. It is not subject to removal. It is an object to be in harmony with the world of God and the human world.Underground awareness derived from this study provides useful implications for cultural content storytelling. As the intrinsic sacred space, the nature of the demon as the inevitable coexistence with the underworld will be a good basis for storytelling with a Korean identity.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing technique can simultaneously obtain water quality information from several reservoirs in large areas. This technique can overcome the limitations of the conventional point sampling method and identify the spatial distribution of water quality. This study developed a regression model that can be applied to three reservoirs used for drinking water using Landsat 8 imagery data and chlorophyll-a concentration. The regression model was determined based on the correlation coefficient of the band higher than 0.5, the coefficient of determination(R2) was 0.61 and RMSE was 4.09 ㎎/㎥. The regression model was applied to three reservoirs to generate a chlorophyll-a distribution map, and the changes in algal biomass were identified at different times. This study shows that satellite remote sensing can provide a useful tool for investigating the spatial and temporal variability of chlorophyll-a for inland reservoirs.

AB  - The Superman in the TV series, famous for The Man of $600 Million, has already become a classic. This is because the characters appearing in the blockbuster of Hollywood, represented by ‘Iron Man’, come in so realistically. This also appeared in reality, and AlphaGo made human’s Go ability weak. New technologies represented by AI are surpassing human capabilities day by day. This is why the end-of-the-century worldview shown in the films <Terminator> and <The Matrix> is not felt at all as fiction. In addition, when we face the insistence of trans-humanists to overcome human limitations by actively accepting technologies to fight death, we realize that it is the time when understanding and preparation for post-humans is required soon after, beyond humans.However, post-human is a preliminary discourse about the era of extreme science and technology, which is still unfinished but somewhat predictable. This paper attempts to approach the posthuman perspective through the narrative of the Sinseon and the Yiin, which is very similar to the shape of a transhuman. I think it is possible to discuss the aspect of humans converging to the ‘singularity’ through the development of science and technology in contrast with the aspects of the characters who have converted to Shinseon and Yiin through Taoist training methods. This is because these are the classic examples of “posthumans” beyond human existence. In addition, the perspectives of the people of the day on the Sinseon and the Yiin were both the object of envy and admiration, and at the same time, they had two sides with unethical discord. This was a vigilant gaze on which direction Sinseon and Yiin should act in the direction of good and evil, as subjects with abilities that are difficult to control beyond ordinary. Perhaps the answer to the post-human and trans-human that will come before us has already been latent in the actions of the classic post-human, Sinseon and Yiin, as the old future.

AB  - Measurement of the parameters of the upper layer of the ocean is one of the tasks of oceanology, on the solution of which the progress of a number of areas of ocean research depends on. So, the data of field measurements are used for verifying and calibrating the processing algorithms of remote meters, oceanographic models, in various research problems and in synoptic/climatic monitoring of the ocean. A continuous increasing in the volume of remote sensing data, an increasing in the complexity of their processing algorithms, and improvement of ocean modeling methods form new requirements for the quality and quantity of experimental measurements. In this paper a small-sized drifter is considered. It is equipped with the necessary measuring channels and software, as an element of the system for measuring the spatio-temporal characteristics of the surface layer of the ocean, namely, the stream vector and the angular spectrum of sea waves. Its structural scheme, the general view, the description of the mechanical part, as well as the scheme for performing the experimental work, all of them are presented in the paper.

AB  - This article presents a projection algorithm based on the representation of radar samples as area elements, rather than point elements as traditionally done in previous works. Each area element in the geographic grid (geogrid) is associated with a set of samples in the radar grid that intersect completely or partially the area element according to the topography and the radar geometry. Accurate geocoding with adaptive multi-looking is achieved by successively assigning the weighted average of the radar samples to the corresponding geogrid elements. Analogously, the slant-range projection of geocoded data is improved by projecting the geogrid pixels onto the radar grid according to their projected area. When our slant-range projection approach is used within previously-published radiometric terrain correction (RTC) algorithms, the processing time is significantly reduced, performing 4.2 to 6.5 times faster over multi-looked data and up to 16.7 over single-look data. We demonstrate the strength of the area projection algorithm for RTC and geocoding using UAVSAR and Sentinel-1 data, and evaluate the results in the context of the upcoming NISAR mission.

AB  - The article deals with the question of the nature of relationship and the specifics of interpenetration of Western European and Russian intellectual cultures and traditions. A particular role is given to the reception in Rus' (Russia) of the scholastic heritage: the style of thinking, the scientific, political and religious worldview. A special attention is focused on the figures of Raymund Lullius and Thomas a Kempis. It is also emphasized that for the Russian reader the purely rationalistic and completely spiritual aspects of Western scholasticism were equally acceptable. Of interest were the problems discussed in it, both of mystical life and of the philosophical interpretation of history. In addition, attention is drawn to the fact that the scholastic tradition influenced the development of Russian literature (N.V. Gogol, A.K. Tolstoy, M.A. Bulgakov), as well as the formation of Russian philosophical vocabulary.

M3  - Article
AB  - Radiation resistant camera system was constructed for monitoring deuterium plasma discharges in the Large Helical Device (LHD). This system has contributed to safe operation during two experimental campaigns without serious problems due to radiation (neutrons and gamma-rays). The cameras steadily functioned even in the plasma discharge with the maximum neutron emission rate in FY 2017, though some bright specks temporarily appeared on the images. The cameras have been installed in shield boxes which consist of lead boxes covered with 10% borated polyethylene blocks in all directions. For optimizing the design of the shield box, the radiation flux distribution was calculated by MCNP-6 code, which reveals the reduction of the radiation flux and the change of the energy spectra in the shield box. Thanks to the optimization, significant extension of the lifetime of the cameras has been realized. Investigation of the influence of the radiation on the CCD image sensor shows that the number of bright specks generally increases with the radiation flux to the camera, which also indicates that some bright specks disappear by the self-annealing process on the image sensor. This phenomenon also highly contributes to the further extension of the lifetime of the radiation resistant cameras. (C) 2020 The Japan Society of Plasma Science and Nuclear Fusion Research.

AB  - Traditionally spiral slick structure is interpreted as a manifestation of marine eddy, which length scale is taken equal to the scale of spiral. This approach is based on the assumption that wind has no effect on the kinematics of forming slick bands which, according to our estimation, is incorrect in real sea conditions. This can lead to misinterpretation of remote sensing data in the field of definition of the characteristics of marine eddies, particularly, in radar images. The system of equations for the description of kinematics of a Lagrangian particle (element of surface active substance) in stationary fields of axisymmetric eddy with non-zero radial velocity component and homogeneous wind was obtained. It was shown that the center of the spiral is not collocated with the center of the eddy, and the distance between them can achieve the scale of eddy core. It was shown that the displacement of the spiral center is quasi perpendicular to the wind direction in case of small radial velocity component compared to the tangential one. It was shown analytically that there is a threshold wind velocity which corresponds to the breakdown of the spiral structure. Simulation based on the discrete-time approximation of particle trajectories, as well as radar observation of marine eddies, demonstrates the possibility of appearance of a "focus" and a "saddle" in the characteristic shape of slick bands. The perspectives of correct retrieval of length scales and character velocities of observed sub mesoscale marine eddies are discussed.

TI  - The MODIS TEBs calibration and look-up table delivery process for Collections 6 and 6.1
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - MODIS is a cross-track, whisk-broom scanning imaging radiometer with a double-sided scan mirror that collects data in 36 spectral bands. Sixteen of the 36 MODIS spectral bands are Thermal Emissive Bands (TEBs) whose spectral wavelengths range from 3.5 mu m to 14.4 mu m. The TEB detectors are calibrated on a scan-by-scan basis using a quadratic calibration algorithm by observing both the MODIS on-board blackbody (BB) and a background space view reference. Blackbody warm-up/cool-down (WUCD) events are performed quarterly to track on-orbit changes associated with the TEB detectors' non-linearity. Following each WUCD, the calibration coefficients in the quadratic algorithm, and their associated contributions to the total uncertainty, are updated and delivered through separate look-up tables (LUTs) when all update criteria are met. Afterwards, the LUTs are incorporated into the Level 1B (L1B) product. Since the Terra MODIS mission began, a steady increase in electronic cross-talk has been observed for TEBs 27-30. Starting from Collection 6.1, an algorithm has been applied using correction coefficients derived from regularly-scheduled lunar observations, with the correction LUT update dependent on its impact on the current L1B product. The MODIS Characterization Support Team (MCST) has established a comprehensive set of procedures to assure timely and accurate LUT updates, and maintain the quality and accuracy of the L1B and science products. This paper provides an overview of the current calibration and LUT delivery process for the MODIS TEBs in Collections 6 and 6.1.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Establishing the calibration consistency between satellite measurements is an essential step in the implementation of a long-term global monitoring plan, which often leads to sensor calibration improvements. The Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is a polar-orbiting Earth remote sensing instrument built with a strong Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) heritage. The center wavelengths of all VIIRS thermal emissive bands (TEBs) match well with those of MODIS with the exception of VIIRS TEB M15 (10.7 mu m). Previous work from the MODIS Characterization Support Team (MCST) at the NASA/GSFC used specific Earth surface targets to track the long-term consistency, stability, and relative bias between the two MODIS instruments onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Using similar methodologies, this paper evaluates the TEB calibration consistency between the MODIS instruments and S-NPP VIIRS over Dome Concordia (Dome-C). The Dome-C site is uniformly snow-covered and the atmospheric effects are small in the surrounding area. Near-surface air temperature measurements from an Automatic Weather Station (AWS) are used as a reference to track each sensor's calibration stability and determine the relative bias between the MODIS and VIIRS instruments. The results of this study provide a quantitative assessment of the S-NPP VIIRS TEB mission-long performance.

TI  - Monitoring of maize lodging using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lodging is a common phenomenon in maize production, which seriously affects its yield, quality, and mechanical harvesting capacity. With good penetrating power, satellite radar can monitor crop growth even under cloudy weather conditions. In this study, a method based on the change in plant height before and after lodging in maize is proposed to calculate the lodging angle and monitor the lodging degree by using dual-polarization Sentinel-1A data. The results show that the optimal sensitive polarization combinations of maize plant height before and after lodging are VH/VV and VV, respectively. The lodging angle is calculated using the plant height inversion results before and after lodging. The overall accuracy of classifying lodging grade of maize is 67%. The proposed model based on lodging angle could effectively mapped the maize lodging range on a regional scale and classify the lodging grades. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

M3  - Review
AB  - Over the course of nearly 19 years of conflict, Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) guidelines and their implementation have evolved to incorporate the latest advances in trauma research, casualty care, and transport, playing a large role in generating the lowest incidence of preventable deaths in the history of modern warfare. During the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, the adoption and implementation of TCCC principles by conventional forces have been extrapolated to have been responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,000 US Servicemembers. As the intensity and nature of the military conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq change, and a growing potential for a near peer conflict rises, it remains important that the lessons of TCCC continue to be instilled in our formations in garrison, before deployment, and while in theater. This article reviews the use of TCCC principles by an assault helicopter battalion, in combination with a variety of other factors, in the successful management of a mass casualty event during Operation Freedom's Sentinel 2019 in Afghanistan.

AB  - Hilly regions are characterized by high spatio-temporal variations in climatic characteristic such as rainfall due to variations in the topography. Uttarakhand State is very susceptible to flooding and cloudburst occasions like one happened at Kedarnath area in June 2013. Estimation of rainfall over a hilly region is a challenging task due to scarcity of rain gauge network. Due to the existing gaps and uncertainty in the rainfall data, these regions are susceptible to disasters such as cloudburst and flash floods. Proper understanding of the precipitation patterns of these regions is required so that disaster mitigation plans can be made and implemented accordingly. Remotely sensed and improved, high-resolution rainfall data derived from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite can be used as an alternative to the rain gauge observed rainfall data. However, a proper validation of the satellite-derived products is necessary before using it for various applications. This study aims to compare monthly and monsoon seasons precipitation derived product from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) with the observed rain gauge analysis from January 1998 to December 2012. Statistical investigation was done for computing relationship of the TMPA product with the rain gauge station data. Statistical indices showing good agreements with the rain gauge data on monthly as well as monsoon seasons time scales. It was observed that the TRMM 3B43 rainfall estimates were much closer to the rain gauge data, with minimal biases. It is suggested to develop satellite precipitation retrieval algorithms by combining the topographical and local climatic factors into consideration.

T2  - HIMALAYAN WEATHER AND CLIMATE AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Temporal and spatial climate variability acts as the major driving force which induces changes in glacier response. However, variation in the glacier behavior could also be introduced due to the influence of non-climatic factors. Therefore, in order to assess the influence of these climatic and non-climatic factors on the response of 15 major glaciers of the Suru basin, western Himalayas, Jammu and Kashmir, a multiparametric study has been carried out involving estimation of dimensional (area and length changes) parameters, snowline altitude (SLA)/accumulation area ratio (AAR) and non-climatic factors (debris cover and topographic). Satellite data from the Landsat series sensors (MSS/TM/ETM+/OLI) during the period 1977-2016 along with the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) Global Digital Elevation Model version-3 (GDEM v-3) constitute the primary datasets used. Results indicate towards an overall negative health of the glaciers with 6.25 +/- 0.0012% loss in glacier area and increase in the average retreat rate from 16 +/- 3.4 (1977) to 23 +/- 3.4 m/y (2016). This glacier degeneration was accompanied by a debris cover increase of similar to 80% and mean snow line altitude (SLA) upshift of 116 +/- 17 m over the span of 39 years. The observed glacier changes exhibit strong correlation with long-term temperature variability (average r(2) = 0.481 +/- 0.06; maximum r2 = 0.925), however, sensitivity to precipitation trends (average r2 = 0.143 +/- 0.07) is not found to be significant. Besides, disparity in glacier response can be partly explained by the spatial variability in meteorological parameters, with glaciers of the Ladakh Range (LR) shrinking (area loss: 9%) and accumulating more debris cover (debris increase: 116%) as compared to those in the Greater Himalayan Range (GHR) (6% and 78%, respectively). However, SLA rise was more pronounced in the GHR glaciers (average of 141 +/- 97 m). The differential behavior of glaciers in both the ranges can be attributed partly to the impact of the non-climatic factors such as glacier size, length, maximum elevation and mean slope.

TI  - Implications of demographic changes and land transformations on surface water quality of rural and urban subbasins of Upper Bhima River basin, Maharashtra, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - For sustainable development in a river basin, it is crucial to understand population growth-land use/land cover (LU/LC) transformations-water quality nexus. This study investigates the effects of demographic changes and LU/LC transformations on surface water quality of rural (Ghod) and urban (Mula-Mutha) subbasins of Upper Bhima River basin. Population data (1981-2011) and LU/LC data {October 2002 [Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data] and October/November 2009 (Indian Remote Sensing 1C Linear Imaging Self Scanner III data]} were analysed using statistical, remote sensing and geographic information system techniques to study demographic and LU/LC changes, respectively. Further, overall indices of pollution (OIPs) developed specifically for rural subbasin (OIPr: Hardness CaCO3 and Total Dissolved Solids), urban subbasin (OIPu: Biological Oxygen Demand, Chlorides, Coliform Total, Colour, Dissolved Oxygen%, pH and Turbidity) and single OIP considering all parameters (OIPa) were used for spatio-temporal water quality assessment of pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods. Results revealed that from 1981 to 2011, population increase was higher in urban subbasin than in rural subbasin. Subsequently, from 2002 to 2009 mainly increase in built-up lands (3.82%) and agricultural lands (15.35%) in urban and rural subbasins respectively, affected their water quality. From 2002 to 2009, the highest increase in OIPr and OIPu was observed at Kashti (3.37-6.52 due to fertilizers) and Bundgarden Bridge (3.03-7.83 due to municipal and industrial wastes) stations of rural and urban subbasins, respectively. With significant increase in OIPa of 2.74-6.70, Bundgarden Bridge station affected by urbanization had the most polluted water quality.

TI  - On Approaches to Constructing a New Public Administration System of Developing Rural Territories of the Russian Federation
T2  - ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES-FACTS TRENDS FORECAST
M3  - Article
AB  - The main focus of the article is one of the most pressing issues to date: how a public administration system of socio-economic development of Russian rural territories corresponding to modern realities can be created? The authors have analyzed the main challenges and trends in the transformation of the management object. The first important trend is the formation of an active mobile social group of dachniki (summer residents) breaking the stereotypes about the extinction of the Russian village by their desire to buy real estate in rural areas. And furthermore, they have a request for environmental friendliness and aesthetics of the place of residence. They are joined by enterprising businessmen who are trying to become the leaders of a new resurgent village. However, the unattractiveness of rural areas for business has been revealed due to the lack of access to the main factors of production. All this is happening against the background of outdated rural engineering and social infrastructure, which requires high maintenance costs. However, the world does not stand still and the transition of humanity from an industrial to an information society is characterized by a change in the technological basis, a creative person becomes the main productive force. Today, all spheres of human activity are being digitalized, accessibility borders are being erased, and the time factor is being eliminated. Thus, rural areas should be integrated into these global processes. This, accordingly, requires fundamentally new approaches to the transformation of the subject of management and control actions. The authors propose a new approach for rural areas' sustainable development through a range of measures: introducing strategic planning and project approach, development of local and territorial public self-government, development of the local mixed economy, cooperation development, introduction of modern technologies, removal of legislative restrictions, introduction of PSEDA (Priority Social and Economic Development Area) mode, effective public administration.

We used the measurements of temperature and salinity for the period 1913-2012 and the observations data from MODIS-Aqua/Terra instruments regularly passing over the Sea of Azov, and the simulation results of three-dimensional hydrodynamic Princeton Ocean Model supplemented by mathematical procedures. The possibility of the operative recovery of salinity values is based on regression statistics on the bio-optical characteristics index34 = R-RS(531)/R-RS(488) and b(bp)(555). They are obtained from remote sensing observations and indicate the total absorption of light and its scattering by suspended particles in top layer of water.

M3  - Article
AB  - This work considers the dynamics of vegetation indices and surface temperature of postfire areas of different ages in larch forests of the permafrost zone of Siberia obtained using long-term Terra/MODIS satellite imagery. Landsat/ETM and OLI satellite images were preliminarily classified to analyze the degree of pyrogenic disturbance in the sample of postfire sites. An increase in the average temperature of the underlying surface of the postpyrogenic areas by 3.9-4.6 degrees C was recorded, depending on the degree of disturbance of the litter, which is 15-30% of the average background values. Compared with background values, the deviation (decrease) in the next postfire year was 22% for the NDVI and 72% for the NBR index. Recovery of the NDVI to background values required 7-10 years after the fire. The recovery period for the surface temperature and the NBR index are significantly higher, that is, 15 years and more. Moreover, for 15-20 years after the fire, the temperature anomalies of the underlying surface remain significant.

TI  - US-Japan Trade Relations Amid the Globalization Crisis
T2  - MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Relations between Japan and the United States have shown significant changes in recent years. Although the main attention has been focused on the strategic and military aspects of these relations, mutual trade and investment, related policies and regulation attract more of the attention of the political elites of the two countries.The tensions between the two countries on this issue have a long history. However, they greatly intensified since President D. Trump moved into the White House. The 2019 trade negotiations and the conclusion of a limited trade agreement between the two countries did not result in a comprehensive settlement of conflicting approaches and stands on specific issues. The rising confrontation between the United States and China amid the spread of novel coronavirus epidemic in early 2020 alleviated tensions over Japan-US trade issues by temporarily removing them from the focus of attention of the US presidential administration. Nevertheless, soon they will again become hot issues in the agenda of bilateral relations in the larger context of the US trade policy.In Japan, fears are growing that long-term shifts in the worldview and attitudes of the American political elite pose new threats and create new difficulties for realizing Japan's interests. Of greatest concern is the erosion in the mind of the US elites of the established commitment to further liberalize global and regional international trade and investment through multilateral agreements and institutions.Trump administration's policy versus main trade partners has shifted towards working out and revising bilateral agreements designed to make American foreign trade more manageable and balanced, and it well may represent part of a long-term change and continue irrespective of the outcome of the US presidential election.The changes that have occurred in Japan-US relations regarding mutual economic ties confirm the general tendency of the international trade and investment system to become more fragmented, shifting from multilateral global and regional platforms to ad hoc agreements with clearly defined national goals and priorities.A possible change of political leadership in both countries will not change these processes, which reflect both the characteristic features of the world perception by national elites and the objective interests of influential business groups. At the same time, trade and investment policy is increasingly affected by non-economic factors, mostly"national security"considerations.This increases the role of diplomatic maneuvering and other levers and forms of influence in regulating trade and investment flows, and business environment for national and multinational companies.

TI  - Estimation of Daily Actual Evapotranspiration Using Vegetation Coefficient Method for Clear and Cloudy Sky Conditions
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration (AET) can be studied and estimated using remote-sensing-based methods at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Reflectance and Land surface temperature are essential in these methods. However optical and thermal sensors fail to provide these data under overcast conditions and this creates gap in the AET product. Besides, there is a necessity of the AET method that requires less data and estimates AET with better accuracy. In this regard, AET was estimated for all-sky conditions using the vegetation coefficient (VI-Kv) method utilizing microwave, thermal, and optical data. Essential reference evapotranspiration (ET0) under cloudy conditions was estimated using LST-based Penman-Monteith temperature (PMT) and Hargreaves-Samani equations. Furthermore, LST predicted using the microwave polarization difference index (PLST) and LST of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud product (MLST) were evaluated with in-situ air temperature (Ta) under cloudy sky conditions. Results revealed that the PLST correlated better with Ta than MLST with correlation coefficient (r) values of 0.71 and 0.81 for day and night times, respectively. Hence, PLST-based solar radiation (Rs) estimation yielded better accuracy with observed Rs with r and root mean square error values of 0.864 and 0.07 for Berambadi station under cloudy conditions, respectively. PMT-based ET0 values corresponded well with the observed ET0 under cloudy sky condition during this study. In addition, AET estimated using the VI-Kv method was compared with the simple two-source energy balance (TSEB) method under clear sky conditions. It was found that the improved VI-Kv method performed better than the TSEB method and could also fairly estimate AET even under cloudy sky conditions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Conceptualization of the definition of space as a semantic unit of language consciousness.Materials & Methods. A structural-ontological approach is used in the work, the methodology of which has been tested and applied in order to analyze the subject matter area of psychology, psycholinguistics and other social sciences, as well as in interdisciplinary studies of complex systems. Mathematical representations of space as a set of parallel series of events (Alexandrov) were used as the initial theoretical basis of the structural-ontological analysis. In this case, understanding of an event was considered in the context of the definition adopted in computer science - a change in the object properties registered by the observer.Results. The negative nature of space realizes itself in the subject-object structure, the components interaction of which is characterized by a change - a key property of the system under study. Observer's registration of changes is accompanied by spatial focusing (situational concretization of the field of changes) and relating of its results with the field of potentially distinguishable changes (subjective knowledge about "changing world"). The indicated correlation performs the function of space identification in terms of recognizing its properties and their subjective significance, depending on the features of the observer`s motivational sphere. As a result, the correction of the actual affective dynamics of the observer is carried out, which structures the current perception of space according to principle of the semantic fractal. Fractalization is a formation of such a subjective perception of space, which supposes the establishment of semantic accordance between the situational field of changes, on the one hand, and the worldview, as well as the motivational characteristics of the observer, on the other.Conclusions. Performed structural-ontological analysis of the system formed by the interaction of the perceptual function of the psyche and the semantic field of the language made it possible to conceptualize the space as a field of changes potentially distinguishable by the observer, structurally organized according to the principle of the semantic fractal. The compositional features of the fractalization process consist in fact that the semantic fractal of space is relevant to the product of the difference between the situational field of changes and the field of potentially distinguishable changes, adjusted by the current configuration of the observer's value-needs hierarchy and reduced by his actual affective dynamics.

TI  - Gold Nanobipyramids as Second Near Infrared Optical Coherence Tomography Contrast Agents for <i>in Vivo</i> Multiplexing Studies
T2  - NANO LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing contrast-enhanced optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques is important for specific imaging of tissue lesions, molecular imaging, cell-tracking, and highly sensitive microangiography and lymphangiography. Multiplexed OCT imaging in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window is highly desirable since it allows simultaneous imaging and tracking of multiple biological events in high resolution with deeper tissue penetration in vivo. Here we demonstrate that gold nanobipyramids can function as OCT multiplexing contrast agents, allowing high-resolution imaging of two separate lymphatic flows occurring simultaneously from different drainage basins into the same lymph node in a live mouse. Contrast-enhanced multiplexed lymphangiography of a melanoma tumor in vivo shows that the peritumoral lymph flow upstream of the tumor is unidirectional, and tumor is accessible to such flow. Whereas the lymphatic drainage coming out from the tumor is multidirectional. We also demonstrate real-time tracking of the contrast agents draining from a melanoma tumor specifically to the sentinel lymph node of the tumor and the three-dimensional distribution of the contrast agents in the lymph node.

AB  - This article presents a monitoring of land cover/use by satellite images over an 11-year period (2006-2016), over a study site located in southwestern France near Toulouse. Time series of optical data are acquired by Spot and Landsat, which deliver images in multispectral mode with high spatial resolution (10-30 m). The detection of the different types of land cover/use (crops, grasslands, water, urban and wood) is produced every year. It is based on national reference geographical data and a random forest algorithm. The classifications arc characterized by a high level of performance, with an average kappa of 0,83 (OA - 0.85). The performance by land cover/use type is related to their representativeness, dates and number of acquisitions, and the resolution of satellite images. The results allow analyzing the evolution of the three main crops (wheat, sunflower and corn).

AB  - Earth observation systems are providing a growing amount of high resolution and multi-spectral data including agricultural crop yield predictions, local weather forecasts, wild fire tracking, and water quality monitoring. With the advent of multiple elements and sophisticated processing and modeling, there are also increasing avenues for introduction of errors. It is important to quantify and characterize these errors in the remotely sensed data as it gets increasingly used to inform vital decisions. Here, a data value-chain approach is presented for conceptualizing introduction and propagation of errors in remote sensing data acquisition, processing, and decisions. A detailed case of calibration errors and their propagation to higher level data products is then discussed. An NDVI analysis is used as an example, and it is shown (for the selected region), that a 3% error in reflectance ratio of red and NIR bands translates into a difference of 60 % for category 5 NDVI classification (representing high vegetation). This amplification of errors along the data value chain is caused by nonlinear operators such as the application of quotients to differences of reflectance values as well as the use of classifiers based on fixed color thresholding.

TI  - Comparison between sentinel lymph node hybrid scintigraphy and blue dye technique in breast cancer patients: An institutional experience
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - To compare the detection efficacy of radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy (LS) versus patent blue dye (PBD) technique for hidden sentinel lymph node (SLN) in breast cancer patients and to determine which modality is better for SLN detection. One hundred and thirty-four early stage breast cancer female patients with clinically negative axilla who underwent post technetium-99m nanocolloid injection single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) for negative SLN on planar imaging were studied prospectively between 2015 and 2017. Following SPECT-CT, patients underwent peroperative gamma probe count detection GP-CD and PBD technique. Visually, blue stained +/- hot nodes were surgically removed and subjected to histopathological analysis. The detection rate by individual method was calculated. Kappa statistics were applied to calculate overall agreement between radioisotope and PBD techniques for diagnostic value assessment. One hundred and thirty-four patients underwent SPECT-CT LS and PBD injection. Mean age: 47 +/- 7.6 years (range: 26-82 years). Forty-nine (36.6%) had T1 and 85 (63.4%) T2. SPECT-CT LS detected SLN in 105/134 cases (success rate: 78.4%), later GP-CD localized "hot nodes"in additional 20 cases (success rate: 93.3%). The PBD successfully localized SLN in 131/134 (97.8%) cases. Three cases remained negative on both radioisotope and PBD localization, which on subsequent nodal dissection had metastatic disease. All SLNs detected on SPECT-CT showed blue dye uptake. In 112 cases, more than one SLN was surgically removed. Frozen section analysis of excised SLNs showed metastasis in 31%. Overall moderate agreement (k = 0.56) was calculated. No statistically significant difference was seen between isotope detection and PBD. Radionuclide sentinel mapping has good detection rate particularly combined with peroperative GP-CD. The PBD has added value to reduce false-negative rate of SLN mapping and can substitute radionuclide imaging with negative results.

TI  - Diachronic analysis of changes in forest cover structure derived from digital thematic maps from Landsat satellite imagery using landscape metrics
T2  - CYBERGEO-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Cote d'Ivoire, the political-military crisis from 2002 to 2011 caused an intensification of human pressure on certain protected areas. This increased pressure has led to significant deforestation in the Mont Peko national Park. However, the impact of disturbances on the forest cover structure of this park is little known. The purpose of this study was to document the impact of the crisis on the fragmentation of the forest cover of Mont Peko national Park in order to contribute to its rehabilitation. Thus, the structural dynamics of the landscape were analyzed using metrics of landscape ecology derived from four thematic digital maps from Landsat satellite imagery, throughout the periods before, during and after the crisis. Analysis of landscape spatial transformation processes between 1988 and 2016 showed a growing trend in forest cover fragmentation. Statistics on selected landscape metrics were produced to quantify the structural changes resulting from this fragmentation. Analysis of landscape metrics showed a significant increase in the level of fragmentation of forest cover during and after the period of crisis. The overall structural dynamics of the landscape of the Mont Peko national Park during the periods studied reveals a fragmentation of the forest at the expense of the creation of cocoa plantations. There is therefore an urgent need to strengthen the supervisory capacity of managers in order to eradicate the scourge of cocoa cultivation in the Mont Peko national Park.

TI  - VALUE ANALYSIS OF COMMUNICATION IN THE MYTHOLOGICAL SPACE OF A MULTIPOLAR WORLD
T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the present study is determined by the importance of mythologization in modern global processes the formation of a multipolar world presents an example of. Each of the forming "poles" requires a mythological basis comprising and establishing its specific historical mission and worldview uniqueness. The deployment of previous narratives and the creation of new ones spreading in the media space and applying for mythological quality presents an important argument in favor of the "pole". The axiological approach to the study of myths in modern media involves referring to value analysis as a method of studying journalism. The study is based on the world-systems methodology that includes cross-cultural analysis. A study of relevant political mythology is carried out on the example of media coverage of the help provided by Russia to Italy in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. To obtain empirical data, the procedure of content analysis of media texts was used. The analysis of the state of media was performed on the empirical basis of materials provided by the InoSMI information and analytical portal and other leading Russian media. The following points are substantiated in the article: mythogenesis occurs in current political practice that can result in two mutually exclusive outcomes: further development of the myth of European solidarity, the cultural and historical community - the continuation of the historical myth, or its destruction - the realization of the operational myth. The analyzed texts demonstrate an apparent polarization of the forming mythological concepts fixating the images of Russia as an assistant selflessly helping those in need and a political actor seeking to realize their geopolitical interests at the expense of Italy. The semantic cluster groups of "Gratitude", "Independence", "Cultural interaction and solidarity", "Safety", and "Welfare" were identified based on mythological concepts. Materials of the present article present practical value to political functionaries and journalism theorists.

TI  - Feasibility of sentinel lymph node detection by near-infrared endoscopy in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity: a pilot study
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Near-Infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging is a novel technique for intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification. It has demonstrated promising results in several surgical specialties. The study aims to evaluate the feasibility of identifying the SLN by indocyanine green (ICG) enhanced NIR endoscopy in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (OCSCC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven patients with (cT1-3 NO) OCSCC were included. We injected 1-1.25 ml of ICG (5 mg/ml) at four to five points around the primary. After the elevation of a platysma flap and posterior retraction of the sterno-cleidomastoid muscle, fluorescence images were taken via IMAGE1 STM NIR/ICG system to define the SLN(s). We sampled fluorescence marked SLN(s) stratified to lymph node levels, followed by level-specified elective neck dissection.RESULTS: The detection of at least one unilateral or bilateral SLN (range 1-5) was possible in every case. The fluorescence signal occurred. on average, 5.0 +/- 2.2 minutes after injection. A total of 22 SLN could be identified, Among 331 histologically examined lymph nodes we could detect one micrometastasis, which was correctly defined as SLN (1/22). There were no false-negative findings. No adverse reactions to ICG occurred.CONCLUSIONS: Our first results are indicating the concept of SLN concerning OCSCC after the application of real-time NIR fluorescence endoscopy. However, this has to be verified by more extended studies.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of study: Mexico's large irrigation areas demand non-structural actions to improve the irrigation service, such as monitoring crop phenology; however, its application has been limited by the large volumes of field information generated, diversity of crop management and climatic variability. The objective of this study was to generate and validate a methodology to monitor corn (Zea mays L.) phenology from the historical relationship of the vegetation indexes (VIs), EVI and NDVI, with the phenological development (PD) of corn grown in large irrigation zones.Area of study: Irrigation District (ID) 075 "Valle del Fuerte", northern Sinaloa, Mexico.Material and methods: We used a database of 20 years of climate, field crop growth and crop phenology data, and Landsat satellite images. A methodology was proposed on a large scale supported with GIS and remote sensing data series.Main results: The methodology was validated in 19 plots with an acceptable correlation between observed PD and estimated PD for the two VIs, with slightly better values for EVI than for NDVI. NDVI and EVI models agreed with experimental PD observations in 92.1% of the farms used to validate the methodology, in 2.5% only the NDVI model coincided with the real, in 3.1% only the EVI model coincided, and in 2.3% both models disagreed with observation, generated a stage out of phase with respect to the real phenological stage.Research highlights: is possible to generalize the methodology applied to large irrigation zones with remote sensing data and GIS.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive high-latitude regions, such as northern deltaic ecosystems, are challenging to access due to remoteness and cold conditions during extended periods of the year. The hydro-ecological state of shallow water ecosystems can be influenced by anthropogenic activities (e.g., flow regulation, water abstraction) and climate variability/change. Therefore, they need to be monitored to provide baseline and impact data. In this paper, we capitalize on the water - vegetation interaction to evaluate relative water level variations on wetlands of one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world between the years 2012 and 2016 by exploiting RADARSAT-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and its differential interferometric configuration (D-InSAR). The influence of different terrain models on the topographic phase correction is also evaluated. Results revealed complex hydrodynamics in the water bodies studied and inferences of environmental processes taking place that modify local landforms and influence water level fluctuations. Comparison between D-InSAR derived water displacements and those measured at specific hydrometric stations indicates overall reliable results. The analysis proposed can be extended to study dynamics of deltaic lakes and wetlands in other areas of the globe.

AB  - By the year 2050, two-thirds of the world population will live in urban areas. Therefore the quality of life in cities has become the object of numerous research papers. One of the basic elements of satisfying the quality of life is the accessibility of urban green spaces (UGS). In this paper accessibility of UGS for the city of Sisak (Croatia) has been analysed. Based on the fact that Sisak is traditionally an industrial type of town, the optimal distribution of UGS has the potential to ease the negative effects of urbanization and industrialization. Accessibility analysis was performed according to guidelines of ANGst (Accessible Natural Greenspace Standard) methodology. The research is conducted at a multiscale level (based on GIS analysis). The primary spatial database of UGS for the city of Sisak was created using the supervised classification method of Sentinel-2A images and vectorization of high-resolution digital orthophoto (DOP). Accessibility zones were generated using the Network Analyst extension. Results show that the basic ANGst standard of UGS accessibility is not satisfactory throughout the city. To get more detailed results we suggest using the very high-resolution satellite imagery or aerial photogrammetry.

TI  - Spatial and temporal analysis of changes in the glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Antarctic Peninsula shows considerable spatial variability concerning its glaciological characteristics. It has also been subjected to severe climate changes, with reported glaciological consequences. However, such changes did not occur uniformly across the region. The present study aimed to characterize the glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula geomorphologically and identify the spatial patterns of changes in their frontal position, generating an inventory of these features that will be part of the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space project. The study comprised the period between 1991 and 2015. We used ASTER imagery and ASTER GDEM and RAMP DEM digital elevation models to map the limits of glacial drainage basins. Landsat TM and ETM + data and the Antarctic Digital Database were used in areas not covered by ASTER images. We applied a supervised classification method to the satellite images to generate a mask of ice-free areas. The inventory of glaciers resulted in the delimitation of 1906 drainage basins between latitudes 61 degrees S and 73 S, corresponding to an area of 476,507.83 km(2). Ice-free areas occupied 5363.38 km(2) (1% of the total). Between 2001 and 2015,1339.68 km(2) of ice was lost, corresponding to 1093 glaciers, while the area covered by glacier advance was estimated in 91.34 km(2), corresponding to 255 glaciers, and 240 oscillating glaciers (gaining and losing ice mass). Thirty-nine percent of glaciers showed a slight retreat, 21% marked retreat, and 9% advanced during the period studied. The 16 ice shelves comprised an area of 137,677.16 km(2), from which only 128,436.08 km(2) remained until 2015. Eleven ice shelves experienced retreat during the period studied. We identified spatiotemporal variability patterns of the glaciers using statistical analysis by implementing empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), in which the first two EOFs represented approximately 87% of the space-time variability pattern of the glaciers. The glaciers classified as outlet glaciers (61%) were identified as the most sensitive to change, especially regarding frontal retreat. The glacial catchments classified as calving and floating were the most sensitive considering any change both in advance and retreat of their frontal area.

AB  - This work presents a novel methodology to extract and analyse multi-temporal polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) information from a stack of co-registered images. The method is based on the analysis of PolSAR changes between every image with respect to the rest of images in the stack.The changes are organized in a matrix form to encode the polarimetric evolution of a target. The change matrix is then used to visually understand a target evolution and its SAR response based on the evolution of scattering mechanisms due to the target physical evolution. Additionally, we design and test an image classification algorithm in a supervised learning fashion by using typical change matrices as training data.The methodology is tested exploiting C-band quad-pol RADARSAT-2 data with special interest on agricultural fields such as rice in Seville, South-West of Spain and in the Indian Head in Canada as part of the Agrisar 2009 campaign.

AB  - This manuscript presents the analysis and a methodology for monitoring asparagus crops from remote sensing observations in a tropical region, where the meteorological conditions change considerably between production cycles. We use data provided by the Sentinel-1 satellite and temperature from a ground station to show how particularly the VH polarisation can be used for crop monitoring in order to visualise the canopy formation, the growth rate and canopy biomass, revealing high dependencies on temperature. We also present a multi-output machine learning regression algorithm trained on a rich spatio-temporal dataset in which each output estimates the number of asparagus stems that are present in each of the pre-defined crop phenological stages. We present the results of two separate scenarios: Using a single SAR image plus temperature as input for the algorithm and using multitemporal SAR data. Results show that the methodology presented is able to retrieve each individual monitored variable when using temperature as predictor with coefficients of determination (R-2) above 0.85. Further research is currently investigating the added value of multitemporal SAR data to complement the predictions and potentially replace the temperature feature.

AB  - The present work aims to establish of Visual Interpretation Criterias of the land-use and land-cover (LULC) classes of the Brazilian biomes. The process relies on the efforts of experts from each biome, Ph.D. and Master's students, and undergraduate students in research. Due to the particularities, the criterias were elaborated individually for each biome. The classes correspond to MapBiomas collection 04 legend. In each LULC class, the user has the following information: class definition, patterns (e.g., color, texture, roughness), and historical Landsat images (RGB 564) from the dry and rainy periods, as well as high-resolution images and field photos of the class. These visual interpretation criterias was used to generate data of samples for MapBiomas mapping validation. With the help of Visual Interpretation Criterias, experienced and inexperienced interpreters were able to produce high-quality sample data without visual inspection. This initiative, a pioneer in Brazil, is a tool to support future interpretations of Brazilian biomes. The results can be found on Lapig website.

TI  - Air quality in cities of the extreme south of Brazil
T2  - Ecotoxicology and Environmental Contamination
M3  - Article
AB  - The region comprised of cities located in the extreme south of Brazil has numerous potential sources of pollution, such as industries, mining and agricultural activities. Despite this, they do not have detailed scientific information regarding air quality. The present study aimed to evaluate air quality in nine municipalities in the extreme south of Brazil, based on the monitoring of six pollutants (O-3, NO2, SO2, PM2.5, PMio and CO) present in Brazilian environmental legislation and the relationship of these pollutants with meteorological parameters. Information on air pollutants and meteorological parameters was collected from satellite data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts "Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service", extracted using The Wealther Channel (IBM, USA) during the period ranged from April 25, 2020 to July 4, 2020 in Rio Grande, Pelotas, Bage, Candiota, Hulha Negra, Pedras Alias, Acegua and Herval. The concentration of pollutants was below Brazilian limits, with the exception of a single episode in the municipality of Rio Grande. Temperature was the meteorological parameter most correlated with air pollutants, except for SO2, but in general, all pollutants correlated (positive or negative) with at least one atmospheric parameter. Finally, the composition of air pollutants in each municipality seems to be related to its local economic activity. We encourage the continuity of studies in the region aiming at a complete temporal analysis that encompasses all seasons.

TI  - Remote Sensing Roman and Byzantine Eastern Frontier Zone in Landscape: Case Studies from Syria and Turkey
T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR ARCHAEOLOGY AND CULTURAL LANDSCAPES: BEST PRACTICES AND PERSPECTIVES ACROSS EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Euphrates and the Tigris valleys in greater Mesopotamia provide a treasure trove for archaeologists studying the Roman and Byzantine eras. There existed some parts of the eastern frontier zone of the Roman and Byzantine empires, remains of which are in modern Syria and Turkey. This was also the stage where some of the first steps in archaeological remote sensing were taken in aerial archaeology in the Near East in the beginning of the twentieth century. It also became an arena in which the Finnish project SYGIS and the Finnish-Swedish Archaeological Project in Mesopotamia (FSAPM) applied satellite imagery, cartographic data, historical sources and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in archaeological prospecting, surveying and mapping. Declassified CORONA satellite photographs from the 1960s were used in prospecting and environmental studies. Landsat-7 ETM, QuickBird and GeoEye images were also purchased. The spatial resolution of the images provided means to trace Roman sites and roads. SPOT images were acquired as well, and they revealed settlements and agricultural fields in the neighbourhood of the Euphrates valley. Landscape models were produced fusing satellite imagery with DEM (digital elevation model) data, either from the SRTM mission or ASTER imagery to visualize and study the contexts in different types of environments and landscapes. Contrasts appeared between dry mountainous areas and flat irrigated agricultural areas in the river valley of Syria to hilly agricultural areas in mainly rain-fed eastern Turkey. In a multiperiod survey in Syria concentrating on nomadic and settled cultures, it was realized that the area comprised plenty of Roman and Byzantine remains that we integrated into the survey and studied in the context of the region. This Roman Limes area provided sites that reflected the network and military strategy. Visibility and viewshed analyses were able to be carried out with DEM data from X-SAR shuttle mission and ASTER-DEM data. They provided military aspects for defending the eastern frontier zone. In Turkey the landscape modelling provided means to understand the hilly and fertile landscape and positions of fortified Roman/Byzantine towns on hills in the Parthian/Persian frontier.

TI  - First Comparisons of Surface Temperature Estimations between ECOSTRESS, ASTER and Landsat 8 over Italian Volcanic and Geothermal Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ECO System Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) is a new space mission developed by NASA-JPL which launched on July 2018. It includes a multispectral thermal infrared radiometer that measures the radiances in five spectral channels between 8 and 12 mu m. The primary goal of the mission is to study how plants use water by measuring their temperature from the vantage point of the International Space Station. However, as ECOSTRESS retrieves the surface temperature, the data can be used to measure other heat-related phenomena, such as heat waves, volcanic eruptions, and fires. We have cross-compared the temperatures obtained by ECOSTRESS, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance radiometer (ASTER) and the Landsat 8 Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) in areas where thermal anomalies are present. The use of ECOSTRESS for temperature analysis as well as ASTER and Landsat 8 offers the possibility of expanding the availability of satellite thermal data with very high spatial and temporal resolutions. The Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm was used to retrieve surface temperatures from the ECOSTRESS and ASTER data, while the single-channel algorithm was used to retrieve surface temperatures from the Landsat 8 data. Atmospheric effects in the data were removed using the moderate resolution atmospheric transmission (MODTRAN) radiative transfer model driven with vertical atmospheric profiles collected by the University of Wyoming. The test sites used in this study are the active Italian volcanoes and the Parco delle Biancane geothermal area (Italy). In order to test and quantify the difference between the temperatures retrieved by the three spaceborne sensors, a set of coincident imagery was acquired and used for cross comparison. Preliminary statistical analyses show a very good agreement in terms of correlation and mean values among sensors over the test areas.

TI  - Cultural and Educational Practices in the Museum Environment: Transmission of Cultural Heritage
T2  - CHANGING SOCIETIES & PERSONALITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the age of digitalisation and globalisation, one of the essential tasks addressed at the level of cultural policy, having relevance for all generations, consists in the preservation of cultural heritage. Cultural and educational practices, integrated in the preschool-, school- and higher education environments and aimed at the formation of the worldview and identity of the younger generation, are considered by the authors as effective and relevant mechanisms for transmitting the memory of values, meanings, places, cultural artefacts, etc. Therefore, it seems advisable for the organisers of multi-level projects to address the potential of the museum as a cultural institute. Today, museums are oriented towards a wide variety of visitors, including professionals and creative audiences of all ages, in the presented activities and services. The transmission of cultural memory in the museum environment is implemented not only in traditional ways, but also through contemporary information and media technologies. The introduction of the younger generation to cultural heritage provides them with an opportunity to experience significant values and meanings of the cultural space and time of the city, region, or country at the personal level.

TI  - Patterns of axillary staging and management in clinically node positive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy: Results of a survey amongst breast cancer specialists
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Various options for axillary staging after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) are available for breast cancer patients with a clinically positive axillary node (cN+). This survey assessed current practices amongst breast cancer specialists.Materials and methods: A survey was performed amongst members of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and two UK-based Associations: the Association of Breast Surgery and the British Association of Surgical Oncology. The survey included 3 parts: 1. general information, 2, diagnostic work-up and 3. axillary staging after NST.Results: A total of 310 responses were collected: parts 1, 2 and 3 were fully completed by 282 (91%), 270 (87.1%) and 225 (72.6%) respondents respectively. After NST, 153/267 (57.3%) respondents currently perform ALND routinely and 114 (42.7%) respondents perform less invasive restaging of the axilla with possible omission of ALND. In the latter group, 85% does and 15% does not use nodal response seen on imaging to guide the axillary restaging procedure. Regarding respondents that do use imaging: 95% would perform a less invasive staging procedure in case of complete nodal response on imaging (63% sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), excision of a previously marked positive node with SLNB (21%) and without SLNB (11%)). In case of no nodal response on imaging 77% would perform ALND.Conclusion: Current axillary staging and management practices in cN + patients after NST vary widely. To determine optimal axillary staging and management in terms of quality of life and oncologic safety, breast specialists are encouraged to include patients in clinical trials prospective registries.

AB  - Water Hyacinth is an aquatic macrophyte and highly invasive species, indigenous to Amazonia, Brazil and tropical South America. It was first introduced to India in 1896 and has now become and environmental and social nuisance throughout the country in community ponds, freshwater lakes, irrigation channels, rivers and most other surface waterbodies. Considering the adverse impact the infesting weed has, a constant monitoring is needed to aid policy makers involved in remedial measures. Due to the synoptic coverage provided by satellite imaging and other remote sensing practices, it is convenient to find a solution using this type of data. This paper looks at the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel1 to detect water hyacinth at an early stage of its life-cycle. While SAR has been used prominently to monitor wetlands, the technique is yet to be fully exploited for monitoring water hyacinth and we seek to fill this knowledge gap. We compare different change detection methodologies based on dual polarimetric data. We also demonstrate how Sentinel-1 can be used to monitor this type of aquatic weeds in our study areas, which is Vembanad Lake in Kuttanad, Kerala.

AB  - Air quality is an important parameter related to the human health. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is an important variable that indicates column integrated particulate matter in the air and used for air quality assessment. Thus in the current study AOD derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at a spatial resolution of 3 km have been used as an indicator of air quality. Results indicate that the AOD concentration has decreased by 35% during the lockdown period in the month of April 2020 as compared to the years 2016 to 2019 in the same month. This indicates that the air quality was improved during the lockdown amid COVID-19 over the Haryana state. The same was conformed from the reduction of Particulate Matter (PM2.5) concentration by 68% during the lockdown period as compared to the year 2019 for NCR region of Haryana.

AB  - Paddy residue burning is common across Indo-Gagantic plane i.e. Punjab and Haryana states of India. Rice-Wheat cropping system is intensively followed across the Punjab and Haryana. Every year, Rice is cultivated from May to Oct.followed by the Wheat from Nov. to April. Most of the farmers burn the leftover plant debris after Rice harvesting and clear the fields for the next cropping season. The burning of crop residues releases several particles and gases into the atmosphere which causes huge air-pollution. There is an urgent need to monitor such man-made burning to avoid/minimize the air-water pollution. Satellites such as MODIS and VIIRS provide active fire events data daily. We have attempted to analyze the data provided by VIIRS over Punjab and Haryana. This paper attempts to answer a few research questions such as 1. How are the state and zone-wise trend in active fire events cropping seasons of 2017, 2018, and 2019, 2. When is the peak burning period across Punjab and Haryana during 2017, 2018 and 2019 and 3. What is the district-wise percent change in burning across Punjab and Haryana. Our analysis shows that overall burning reduces by 22% in Punjab compared to both 2017 and 2018 and 49% and 61% in Haryana. Malwa region of Punjab and His sar division of Haryana was more prone to burning. We have observed that 26 Oct. to 8 Nov. is a peak time of burning in Punjab, however, maximum burning observed during 26 Oct. to 1 Nov. in Haryana. Maximum number of fire incidences were reported from Fatehabad, Sirsa, Jind and Kaithal, Karnal in Haryana. In Punjab, reports poured in from Sangrur, Bathinda, Ferozpur, and Patiala. This trend analysis of time and location can help administrators to optimize the on-ground human and machine resources.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the size distribution and mass characteristics of ambient atmosphere in the source region of biomass burning (Punjab). The enhanced level of particulate matter (PM) concentrations were interpreted through measurements of number and mass concentration. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) fire count data and HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model) used to decipher the extent of burning activities and origin of air-masses, respectively. Significant diurnal variabilities were observed in the PM1 (PM with aerodynamic diameter <= 1 mu m) and PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m) number and mass concentrations. Higher number (N-0.(3-2.5): 1.34 +/- 0.20 x 10(4) #/cm(3)) and mass concentration (PM2.5: 286 +/- 39 mu g/m(3), n = 5) during nighttime compared to daytime (N-2.5: 0.74 +/- 0.22 x 10(4) #/cm(3); PM2.5: 224 +/- 59 mu g/m(3), n = 3) indicates impact of meteorological conditions (low wind speed and shallower boundary layer height) and biomass (plausibly paddy) burning activity. Although possibility of multiple sources and their varying strength (poor correlation between organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC)) can't be neglected, however, biomass burning appeared to be the dominant source (good correlation (R-2 = 0.4) between water-soluble potassium (K+) and PM) of ambient PM. Further, near similar number and mass size distribution of ambient and bio-fuels derived aerosols along with similar K+/PM and OC/EC ratio compared to that for paddy-residue burning imply that bio-fuel burning in the household kitchen could be the dominant contributor to enhanced PM concentration at sampling location in upwind IGP during the study period.

AB  - A general problem faced by many Indian cities is the criss-crossing of major roads through the centre of the city. The present study focuses on one such city in Punjab, Sultanpur Lodhi. Sultanpur Lodhi is a religious centre in Punjab of Sikhs attracting large number of tourists throughout the year. Due to the location of Gurudwaras in congested city and crossing of major road connecting Firozpur to Jallandhar through the city, the traffic becomes a huge problem. During festive seasons, the traffic diverts to the internal roads causing chaotic conditions. The present study focuses on the master plan development of the area with special regard to the proposed ring road to ease the traffic volumes. Geospatial technology using highresolution satellite data has been used to prepare the master plan of Sultanpur Lodhi, which includes a 12 km long proposed ring road with a right of way of 150 feet.

AB  - Surface temperature is depending upon type of surface if surface is hard or made from concrete or harder matter than the temperature will be more, so it is important to study surface temperature of an urban area, with increasing urban area temperature in the central part of the city cause more air temperature, and if humidity is present, then it creates very uncomfort situation to live without any cooling system. So, the study of urban heat is mandatory to know about these types of situations in city and identify area are being in this situation [1]. This heat zone in a city center which will present in both seasons summer and winter. This situation is only uncomfort to humans in the area of earth below 32 degrees of latitude and not in other part of world. Landsat 8 provides this facility to investigate the surface temperature using its thermal band [2]. Data collected from the thermal band is easily possible to convert into surface temperature in degree [3]. So, in this study, only year 2017 images are investigated by developing the surface temperature model in GIS. The results will show that the temperature is distributed over the surface. So, the hot area is very hot in summer. So, changing land use also have a direct connection with surface temperature if the more urban area will increase the more the surface temperature rise will increase in city [3]. If there is too much urbanization distance to increase more surface temperature. So, this study becomes important in this aspect [4].

AB  - The SCATSAT-1 satellite data can be used for various applications in the field of agriculture. The main aim of the study is to investigate the water cloud model (WCM) for backscattering simulation by using the field-measured soil moisture in order to validate the SCATSAT-1 measured backscattering. WCM requires various input datasets for simulation of backscattering such as vegetation parametersAand B and soil parametersCand D, which can be estimated by Non-linear least square fitting method by using with experimental dataset. The results showed that the simulated WCMvalues arewell correlatedwith the backscattering ofSCATSAT-1 satellite data. However, it can be further improved when each parameter of WCM is generated by using the ground-based measurements. In this study, some progress has been made toward backscattering simulations using the SCATSAT-1; however, it can be further refined with the advancement in the retrieval algorithms and sensor sensitivity.

AB  - Nowadays various types of satellite data are available which have different spectral bands. These spectral bands have special characteristics to interact with particular targets. Therefore, it is also important to use these bands efficiently. The prime objective of this paper is to identify the various land cover classes namely bare soil, moist soil, urban, tall vegetation, short vegetation, pasture, water with sentinel-2 data. The task takes up a challenging edge because various classes among the aforementioned list have characteristic similarities making it cumbersome to classify them effectively with different bands of sentinel-2 data. The classes like urban and bare soil, short vegetation and pasture, tall vegetation and short vegetation, moist soil and bare soil have similarities in their respective characteristics in different bands of the sentinel-2 and are often referred as mixed classes. For this purpose, 10 bands of sentinel-2 were used and results were compared with commonly used techniques like support vector machine. It is observed that the proposed statistical based decision tree algorithm with 10 bands of sentinel-2 has good capability to segregate pastures and moist soil as well as other classes with good accuracy.

AB  - The Adis of Arunachal Pradesh consider everything coming from nature as sacred and living. As opposed to the Christian theological teachings that regard humans as the conqueror of everything else on earth, in the Adi worldview, human beings do not occupy the center stage. Instead, the Adis believe in the intrinsic worth of all beings - both human and nonhuman, which exist on earth, as reflected in the Adi philosophy of 'Donyi-Polo.'This paper attempts to study select poems from Mamang Dai's book of poems Midsummer Survival Lyrics (2014) in the light of the philosophy of Donyi Polo. It also attempts to link this Adi worldview to the ecosophy of Arne Naess popularly known as 'Deep Ecology.'

TI  - Raptor Zonal Statistics: Fully Distributed Zonal Statistics of Big Raster plus Vector Data
T2  - 2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Recent advancements in remote sensing technology have resulted in petahytes of data in raster format. This data is often processed in combination with high resolution vector data that represents, for example, city boundaries. One of the common operations that combine big raster and vector data is the zonal statistics which computes some statistics for each polygon in the vector dataset. This paper proposes a novel distributed system to solve the zonal statistics problem which can scale to petahytes of raster and vector data. The proposed method does not require any preprocessing or indexing which makes it perfect for ad-hoc queries that scientists usually want to run. We devise a theoretical cost model that proves the efficiency of our algorithm over the baseline method. Furthermore, we run an extensive experimental evaluation on large scale satellite data with up-to a trillion pixels, and big vector data with up-to hundreds of millions of edges, and we show that our method can perfectly scale to big data with up-to two orders of magnitude performance gain over Rasdaman and Google Earth Engine.

TI  - Automatic tree species classification from Sentinel-2 images using deficient inventory data
T2  - 2020 17TH BIENNIAL BALTIC ELECTRONICS CONFERENCE (BEC)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 17th Biennial Baltic Electronics Conference (BEC)
CL  - Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, ESTONIA
AB  - The paper presents a novel tree species classification approach based on an automated analysis of Sentinel-2 images, where deficient inventory data from an analysis area are available for reference. The procedure proposed involves clustering of one or several multispectral images of the area of interest taken in different seasons, with the subsequent assignment of a particular tree species class to each cluster by using sparse and imprecise inventory data. The analysis is performed only within the forest areas separated using the forest mask obtained from LiDAR scanning data. Classification results are tested against the ground truth prepared manually from remote sensing images or taken from the same kind of imprecise inventory data. An analysis of a sample area in Latvia for which the sparse inventory data was available was performed. Several clustering algorithms were compared, and it is shown that recently proposed Dynland clustering algorithm has advantages over the traditional k-means clustering. Identification of the most important 4 species was targeted, and it is shown that considerable classification accuracy, with a kappa coefficient up to 0.9 can be achieved in this case by the approach proposed. The proposed approach can be used within automatic workflows for estimation of forest microstand parameters from remote sensing data.

AB  - Along with field and satellite data, the calculation of fluxes using integral parameterizations can become a source of information about incoming shortwave radiation fluxes on the sea surface. In this work, we used the results of applying the SAIL parametrization created at the IO RAS, based on measurements of incoming shortwave radiation fluxes to the surface of the Atlantic Ocean and the corresponding meteorological parameters. The main task of such parameterizations is to construct climatology of shortwave radiation fluxes according to VOS data. In the course of the work, the new cloud climatology CLAAS ed.2 was used as input to calculate the average daily fields of the incoming shortwave radiation fluxes to the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. As reference data, we used a satellite database of shortwave radiation fluxes for the Atlantic Ocean - SARAH ed. 2. In conclusion, it can be noted that the SAIL parameterization works very well for a total cloud score of up to 4 octa. Further development of the SAIL parameterization is possible by separately taking into account the direct and diffuse flux of incoming shortwave radiation, since as part of the growth of possible cloud regimes, it is very important to know when the flux prevails over the diffuse and when vice versa.

AB  - Estonia is known for its large floodplains that are annually covered by water. A methodology based on Sentinel-1 and -2 imagery was developed for operational monitoring of floodplains in Estonia. Filed campaign for validation/calibration of flood extent estimation methodology was performed using UAV in March 2019 over the Soomaa floodplain. Sensitivity analysis of Sentinel1 data indicated greatest backscattering (sigma(0)) difference between land and water for polarizations VH (IW mode) and HV (EW mode) at incidence angle 39-47 degrees. For water mapping, incidence angel normalization was applied using linear relationship between backscattering (sigma(0)) and local incidence angle established from our dataset. Water was mapped from Sentinel-2 data using MNDWI index. Flooded area mapped from Sentinel-1 was compared with corresponding flooded area mapped from Sentinel-2. The kappa coefficient between these maps was 0.86 indicating good coincidence. Established methodology was tested to map floods at Keila test site for springs in 2018 and 2019. Difference in flood extent and duration at Keila test site in 2018 and 2019 was 6.8 km(2) and 9 days.

AB  - The article presents an analysis of the statements and views of thinkers related to the intellectual movement "Conservative Revolution" in the Weimar Republic of the 1920-1930s regarding the image of Soviet Russia. The works of Oswald Spengler, Arthur Meller van den Brook and National Bolshevik Ernst Nikisch are briefly analyzed. Based on the analysis of sources and historiographic material, the author comes to the conclusion about the "oriental orientation" of the young conservative German intellectuals. The paper analyzes the presence of phylogenetic relationships between the ideas of Russian Eurasians about "Bolshevism as Asian socialism" and the views of German young conservatives and national Bolsheviks on the archaic and irrational nature of the Russian revolution. Particular importance is given to the analysis of the role of F. M. Dostoevsky in shaping the worldview of "conservative revolutionaries" and his image as a moral landmark.

AB  - Traditional remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) methods are generally based on images from a specific single source. As different sources and huge volumes of remote sensing images have been easily available nowadays, RSIR is facing the challenge of retrieving remote sensing images with different spectral and spatial information from different sources. Benefited from compelling image feature extraction ability of deep neural networks and efficient computing power and effective retrieval ability of hashing, deep hashing networks has become prevalent for image retrieval researches. In this paper, a deep hashing network based on split channels is proposed for hybrid source RSIR called split-channels triplet deep hashing networks(SCTDHNs). It takes skillfully splitting channels as input, and is mainly composed of a hybrid source deep hashing subnetwork for cross source images retrieval and single-source deep hashing sub-network for a multi-spectral image retrieval, and each of them achieves high retrieval performance. Furthermore, a novel trick for loss function is proposed, called increased intervals between dissimilar pairs during training stage that dramatically improves the retrieval performance. Extensive experiments implement on dual-source remote sensing data set demonstrate that proposed method yields better performance than existing state-of-art hybrid source retrieval methods as far as is known.

M3  - Article
AB  - Abandoned drained peatlands pose the greatest danger in terms of peat fires. This is especially true of abandoned, unrestored peat milling fields, the maximum areas of which are located in Moscow Oblast. The most effective way to reduce the fire hazard and improve the ecological condition of such lands in the absence of economic reasons for their use is rewetting and peatland restoration. It is necessary to prioritize objects for rewetting and to monitor the effectiveness of measures taken. Such objects can be of considerable size, difficult to pass and not amenable to ground mapping. Fires and rewetting contribute to rapid changes in vegetation cover. Their monitoring requires remote sensing data and, above all, multispectral satellite data. The large number of objects, their spatial distribution and the need for multi-year observations require a combination of data from different satellites. We present the experience of monitoring more than 73 thousand hectares of peatlands in Moscow Oblast rewetted in 2010-2013 after the fires of 2010. Current results show a reduction in the areas of open peat and dry grass vegetation, insignificant changes in the areas occupied by coniferous trees and progressive expansion of the area occupied by deciduous trees and shrubs, as well as an increase of hydrophilic communities and open water after rewetting and subsequent maintenance of the area. The developed and tested methodology makes it possible to assess the effectiveness of peatland rewetting to reduce the risk of peat fires, as well as to identify areas requiring additional measures. The proposed algorithm ensures reliable allocation in semi-automatic mode of 6 classes of vegetation/land cover, different in fire hazard and basic environmental characteristics that determine the fluxes of greenhouse gases, biodiversity and other ecosystem functions.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA SCIENCE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Data Science (ICCIDS)
CL  - NorthCap Univ, Gurugram, INDIA
AB  - The performance of affine invariant feature detector-Hessain Affine on Terra SAR-X images decreases in the presence of speckle noise due to false feature point detections and matches. The owing inherent characteristics of Terra SAR-X images like broad dynamic range and the multiplicative nature of speckle noise, the gradient magnitude is strengthened on homogeneous regions. Hence the false feature point detections on high contrast regions are not suppressed. In order to make feature detection robust towards the speckle noise, the use of improved version of Grunwald-Letnikov (G-L) fractional differential operator in the development of feature detection is investigated. This paved the way for a new affine invariant fractional order feature detector. This detector allows a stable and fine feature point selection without fine tuning parameters of the Hessian Affine feature detector. The algorithm proposed is tested on TerraSAR-X (TSX) images with different look angles. The results show that the proposed Fractional Affine algorithm improves the feature matching performance compared to Hessian Affine algorithm in terms of number of true correspondences and registration accuracy.

AB  - Conventional integer order differential operators suffer from poor feature detection accuracy and noise immunity, which leads to image misalignment. A new affine-based fractional order feature detection algorithm is proposed to detect syntactic and semantic structures from the backscattered signal of a TerraSAR-X band stripmap image. To further improve the alignment accuracy, we propose to adapt a view synthesis approach in the standard pipeline of feature-based image alignment. Experiments were performed to test the effectiveness and robustness of the view synthesis approach using a fractional order feature detector. The evaluation results showed that the proposed method achieves high precision and robust alignment of look-angle-varied TerraSAR-X images. The affine features detected using the fractional order operator are more stable and have strong capacity to reduce sturdy speckle noise.

AB  - Effective and efficient control of the agrarian obligations imposed by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the high-level decision making for national and global food security, requires systematic and timely monitoring of the agricultural land. In this study we focus on rice paddy monitoring in South Korea to ultimately deliver food security related information. Food security monitoring demands knowledge at large scales to allow for decision making at the highest level. In this work, we monitor the growth of rice using the TIMESAT solution on a time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), extracting useful metrics with reference to the phenological phases of the crop, but also biomass and yield indicators. TIMESAT requires user provided parameters to define the start and the end of season to then compute the relevant metrics. In order to automate this procedure, the vegetation indices Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI) are used to develop a data based parameter tuning for TIMESAT.

AB  - Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is a hybrid imaging technology which combines the best of optical (contrast) and ultrasound (resolution) imaging. PA imaging uses intrinsic contrast agents in the body like blood (hemoglobin), melanin, etc. But the contrast from the intrinsic contrast agents might not be sufficient for different applications. So, external contrast agents are needed for improving the contrast of PA images. Organic dyes, inorganic dyes, and nanomaterials can be used as photoacoustic contrast agents. The major issue with using external contrast agent is that they often need FDA approval to be used for in-vivo studies. Availability of FDA approved contrast agents for PA imaging is very limited. In this work, we present the feasibility of using food and food-based dyes as photoacoustic contrast agents. We use commonly used foods like coffee, tea, chocolate and food colorants as contrast agents. We use alpinion's E-CUBE dual mode ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging system with mobile Nd:YAG laser pumped by OPO laser to demonstrate the efficiency of the contrast agents. The contrast agents were compared with methylene blue. Out of the many different agents we tested, coffee, chocolate and few other dyes proved as efficient photoacoustic contrast agents. We performed photoacoustic spectroscopy to identify at which wavelength the dye performed best. We also tested the contrast agents for imaging sentinel lymph nodes in rats and the results are very similar to methylene blue. This will enable the transition of photoacoustic imaging to the clinics more easily.

TI  - A Pre-Suicidal State: Causes and Possible Development Scenarios. A Philosophical Analysis
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of a psychic deviation known as a pre-suicidal state. The perception of this phenomenon in contemporary sources, including philosophical, psychological, and medical ones, has been thoroughly analysed. Two main interpretations of the pre-suicidal state have been identified: sociological and psychological. Notwithstanding all the differences between the two, both interpretations characterise this state through a set of external causes and empirical indicators. One of the reasons of such an interpretation of the term, which implies a certain way of the understanding of the pre-suicidal state itself, is the lack of a thorough philosophical explanation of the state in question. As a result, there is no systematic uniform approach to the characteristics of the pre-suicidal state, which causes problems in identifying its time frames as well as the particular behaviour traits of a person with suicidal tendencies. For solving these problems, it might be instrumental to resort to the techniques existentialist philosophy elaborated in the 19th and 20th cc. These techniques may enable one to reveal the nature of the pre-suicidal state, i.e., to explain why a person should feel a desire to eradicate oneself. The research is based on one of the key points of the existentialist paradigm: the person's understanding of self is shaped by three main factors: freedom, choice, and death. Death is a prerequisite for a person's experience of choice, while choice is a prerequisite for a person's experience of freedom. Therefore, death is the last possibility expected. The pre-suicidal state occurs when death is excluded from the variety of possibilities and is substituted by experiencing certain life circumstances. A person's assessment of death also undergoes a change in the process: instead of the most tragic event possible it becomes the most desirable. Thus, a person's pathologisation takes place as self is now understood not through the expectation of death but through the expectation of some tragic life circumstances. The author draws the following conclusions. The pre-suicidal state is caused not only by the combination of external circumstances and psychic peculiarities of the suicidal person (which are mainly held responsible in contemporary literature), but also by the change in the person's understanding of self. In the pre-suicidal state, one's understanding of self is no longer shaped by the expectation of death as the terminal and most tragic possibility but by the expectation of certain life circumstances which are now seen as the terminal and most tragic ones. Therefore, not only the reassessment of external circumstances is instrumental in overcoming the pre-suicidal state. This reassessment should be complemented by the procedure of restricting the volume of the concepts determining the pre-suicidal state, which results in fragmenting and weakening of the tragic worldview initially caused by external circumstances. Consequently, death is to regain its normal place in the person's understanding of self as the terminal and most tragic possibility.

T2  - IZVESTIYA URALSKOGO FEDERALNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-GUMANITARNYE NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the spiritual life of modern society actualise the controversy of new writers with the fundamental ideas of Russian classical literature. The purpose of this article is to analyse the influence of certain aspects of Dostoevsky's worldview and creative work on the poetics and issues considered in Yury Vasilievich Buida's stories Lethe, Kazan Railway Station, and The Law of the Jungle. The authors aim to identify the similarities and differences in the depiction of the world and man, typological convergences at the level of motifs and plots, key symbols characteristic of Dostoevsky, and their new interpretation. The authors establish that the philosophical problem of the relationship between man and God, fundamental for Dostoevsky's worldview and the question of the significance of Christian and ethical categories in society are important for the author's concept of Buida's works. The modern writer portrays lost people guided by primitive instincts, abiding in a peculiar space of material and spiritual poverty, but in their own way looking for God. However, to a larger extent than Dostoevsky's characters, Buida's characters are characterised by the acceptance of life due to their subconscious striving for light and good. The revealed images and motifs, typologically similar to the corresponding elements of Dostoevsky's poetics, are aimed at complicating the cultural and historical context of the Jungle collection in order to clarify the social issues of boundary time and the basic concept of the book by Buida. The images of the garden, stairs, axe, stone, which have a pronounced allusive character, turn out to be connected with the existential model of the universe proposed by the modern prose writer. The motif complex of Lethe, Kazan Railway Station, The Law of the Jungle, which reveals the author's references to classical texts, contributes to the expression of the philosophical idea of the loss of spirituality and sometimes the unconscious existence of modern man.

AB  - In this work, we focus on exploring very high spatial resolution (1-3 m) satellite imagery for capturing crop yield variability at field scale. In-field yields of soybean and corn were collected in Iowa, USA, and were correlated with multi-spectral satellite data acquired by WorldView-3 (at 1.25 m) and PlanetScope (Dove-Classic) (at 3 m). Results show that the most important spectral bands explaining corn and soybean yield variability are green/yellow, red edge and NIR. High temporal frequency of Planet data allowed identification of best suitable date for yield assessment: PlanetScope's spectral bands at 3 m explained 10% to 75% of in-field corn and soybean yield variability.

TI  - Lymphoscintigraphy for Sentinel Node Mapping in Head and Neck Cancer
T2  - SEMINARS IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - The aim of this comprehensive review is to describe and analyze the role of the sentinel node mapping in head and neck cancers. For this purpose, head and neck neoplasms have been categorized in cutaneous malignancies and neoplasms of the upper aerodigestive tract. A concise description of lymphatic drainage will be the "prelude" for each section, as well as the description of the injection techniques, when specific. Concisely, the attention has been focused on detection rate of the sentinel node by lymphoscintigraphy for each cancer, and for those patients in which the sentinel lymph node has been identified, true positives rates, false-negative rates, and overall accuracy has been pointed out. Overall, in cutaneous neoplasms of the head and neck, the detection rate is higher than 90%, however the false-negative rate is still an issue, in particular in melanoma, inducing the need for newer developments. In fact, new tracers and techniques are already available, while prospective multicenter trials exploring the outcome impact are needed in the near future. For the upper aerodigestive tract and in particular oral cavity and oropharynx, sentinel lymph node identification by lymphoscintigraphy allows avoiding unnecessary neck dissection and/or node irradiation. Even in this case, the main limit remains the risk of false-negative rates. While, for patients affected by laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers the data seem very limited and, although the feasibility has been demonstrated, performances of this lymphoscintigraphy still need to be confirmed by multicenter studies.

AB  - The formation results of statistical model for characteristics of atmospheric internal waves and their signatures based on satellite data and upper-air observations are presented. We consider some physical parameters of wave processes and geometric features of their cloud manifestations. The model formation is based on the determination of distribution laws that describe fluctuations in the characteristic values of atmospheric internal waves and their signatures. We use two-parameter families of absolutely continuous distributions. The observation episode description of atmospheric internal waves is based on the use of MODIS satellite data and the results of upper-air sounding by a network of ground-based weather stations. We consider the Pacific coast of the Russian Federation as the region under study. Promising areas for using the formation results of statistical model are discussed.

AB  - Advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and optical sensors of various types provide new opportunities for collecting and processing a remote sensing data of a new quality. Applying UAVs to acquire high-resolution imagery makes it possible to produce a digital elevation model (DEM) of high quality and resolution. New quality of an available DEMs allows to analyze small details of the land surface and to retrieve valuable information about hidden archaeological content.Our study addresses to creating and analysing of DEM of large-scale and high-resolution for detecting the traces of hidden ancient artefacts at archaeological sites. The survey for acquiring an imagery for this study has been carried out at Taman Peninsula (Russia) as a part of Russian State Historical Museum expedition aimed at studying of the Bosporan Kingdom (VI-I century BC).We presents the developed techniques for UAV imagery processing which provides improved accuracy of photogrammetric 3D measurements comparing with standard photogrammetric image processing by commercial software. These approaches have been developed for interpretation of terrain models for predicting possible spatial distribution of archaeological artefacts.The proposed techniques allows creating large-scaled digital terrain models of the archaeological sites which can serve for more reliable archaeological prediction and accurate geo-positioning of possible findings. It has showed that the developed techniques provide accurate high quality DEM and serve as useful tool for archaeological sites analyses and predictions.

AB  - The article is dealing with the turbulent life of German writer, essayist and satirist Oskar Panizza (1853-1921), also with his attacks against the law and authorities, because of which he was sentenced to one-year imprisonment. Balancing on the boundary line between reality and illusion, ingeniousness and insanity, this charismatic author spent a life full of contradictions: he began to work as a neurologist, but shortly afterwards he became a writer -finally, he ended his life odyssey as a patient in a sanatorium. Following the ideas of Max Stirner; Panizza subscribed to illusionism as a valid weltanschauung: hallucination is real, the reality is chimerical. The article aims to show that we do not have a case of a mentally disordered person, instead, of an author who was questioning the boundaries between normality and abnormality, anticipating the subsequent criticism of normative assumptions of the institutionalized psychiatry.

TI  - ZEOLITE-BEARING ROCKS FROM ELUVIAL DEBRIS OF SHCHUCHINSKIJ SYNCLINORIUM (POLAR URAL, RUSSIA): NEW PETROGRAPHICAL AND MINERALOGICAL DATA
T2  - ACTA GEODYNAMICA ET GEOMATERIALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The territory of the Polar Urals is characterized by significant forecast resources of natural zeolites. In case of their successful development, the resources of the zeolite deposits can provide a positive impact on the development of a number of industries in the adjacent regions of the Urals and Western Siberia. At the same time, the available data about the zeolite-bearing rocks of the Polar Urals present in published research paper and materials of geological funds is rather contradictory. The results of research performed by different scientific groups often contain opposed conclusions on the mineralogical composition, the content of the commercial component in the ore, as well as on the ore reserves calculation and the potential of commercial exploitation for the same mineral occurrences. In many respects, this situation can be explained by the complexity of the geological and geomorphological conditions of the territory under consideration, the remoteness of the promising mineral occurrences from large scientific and industrial centers, and the variety of ore occurrences. This work presents the study results of lithological-petrographic features and the material composition of the eluvial debris of the Middle-Late (Givetian-Frasnian) Devonian zeolite-bearing rocks of the volcanogenic-sedimentary origin within the Naunpe area of the Polar Urals. The main objective of the proposed research was to evaluate the economic feasibility of their development and possible directions for commercial exploitation of this type of ores. Research methods included petrographic study of samples of zeolite-bearing rocks in thin sections, SEM-EDS, determination of the total mineral composition by XRD and the chemical composition by XRF. Within the Naunpe area, the outcrops of zeolite-bearing rocks on the surface are represented by blankets and debris of small lumpy-gravel eluvial deposits with indistinct outlines. Macroscopically, zeolitebearing eluvial deposits are represented by reddish or pinkish in color, massive and relatively homogenous rocks. The ore occurrences are well interpreted based on the remote sensing data. According to the results of petrographic, lithological, and mineralogical studies, three main rock types were distinguished among the eluvial debris deposits: zeolite-bearing crystallo-lithoclastic tuffs of the mafic, intermediate, and felsic composition, and also tuffoargillites, and siliceous rocks. Crystallo-lithoclastic tuffs and tuffoargillites contain Ca-zeolites, represented mainly by laumontite (13.8-18.9 %), which fill small open spaces between crystallites and lithoclasts. Volcanic glass fragments and feldspars from tuffoargillites are replaced partially or completely by zeolites. The content of zeolites in these rocks is even lower (less than 10 %). The characteristic features of the studied zeolite-bearing rocks from the ores of the known deposits of the Polar and Subpolar Urals have higher contents of Fe2O3, CaO H Na2O and lower content of K2O. The obtained results show that the studied rocks are quite complex, diverse, and polygenetic, as well as their formation is a result of several stages of post-volcanic authigenic mineral formation. The rather low content of zeolite minerals in these rocks and high variability of the material composition decrease the industrial potential of that eluvial debris deposits as an object of mineral raw material base. At this, they can be considered as prospecting indicator for prospecting the areas with a similar geological structure.

T2  - BJGP open
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Australia, melanoma is managed in primary and secondary care settings. An individual concerned about a suspicious lesion typically presents first to their GP.AIM: To identify factors influencing GPs' decisions to diagnose, treat, or refer patients with suspected melanoma.DESIGN & SETTING: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 23 GPs working in general practice or skin cancer clinics in Australia.METHOD: The semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded, de-identified, and professionally transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.RESULTS: Considerable variation existed in GPs' self-reported confidence and involvement in melanoma management. Multiple factors were identified as influencing GPs' decisions to diagnose, treat, or refer patients with suspected or confirmed melanoma. Health system level factors included the overlapping roles of GPs and specialists, and access to and/or availability of specialists. Practice level factors included opportunities for formal and informal training, and having a GP with a special interest in skin cancer within their practice. GP and patient level factors included the GP's clinical interests, the clinical features (for example, site and size) and histopathology of the suspected melanoma, eligibility for possible sentinel lymph node biopsy, and patient preferences. For some GPs, concerns over misdiagnosis and the option of referring patients at any stage in the melanoma management continuum appeared to affect their interest and confidence in melanoma management.CONCLUSION: GP involvement in melanoma patient care can extend well beyond cancer screening, prevention and supportive care roles to include provision of definitive melanoma patient management. GPs with an interest in being involved in melanoma management should be encouraged and supported to develop the skills needed to manage these patients, and to refer when appropriate.

AB  - In Alaska, wildfire map products have traditionally been generated from lower spatial and spectral resolution Landsat imagery such as LANDFIRE Program's Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) resulting in products that do not accurately assess fire fuel types for local sites. In this study we demonstrate the efficacy of AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data for mapping Interior Alaska's vegetation and fuel type. Based on an evaluation of field plot data collected by the project team in 2019, the new vegetation map derived from AVIRIS-NG at Viereck IV level resulted in a 73% classification accuracy compared to the 32% accuracy of the LANDFIRE's product EVT derived from Landsat 8. Not only did our product more accurately classify fire fuels, it was also able to identify 20 dominant vegetation classes (percent cover >1%) while the EVT product only identified eight dominant classes within the study area.

TI  - "Little America": The (Post-)Socialist Realism of the Indigenous North
T2  - NOVOE LITERATURNOE OBOZRENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The author studies Russian-language prose of the northern indigenous minorities (Evenks, Nenets, Khanty) as a postcolonial phenomenon. The period studied is from the late 1970s to the mid-late 1990s, before and after the creators of local varieties of socialist realism experienced a radical reassessment of values, finding themselves at the intersection of opposing values: the recently exposed communism and the ideology of a small paradise lost in the process of modernization. In the 1990s, Siberian ethnic writers - the children and grandchildren of shamans, fishermen, and hunters - began to "speak the truth" about deportations, destroyed natural resources, and the merciless extermination of entire languages and cultures. At the same time, the stage had long been set for this change in woridview within the confines of soft, "village" socialist realism, which allowed for relative ambiguity in interpreting Soviet reality. Next, the author traces how from the late 1980s on, artists of the North themselves embraced postcolonial categories and global ecological knowledge, while the creation of their postcolonial image also spread to other countries.

AB  - The high, uncontrolled, pace of urban development in the modern world inevitably leads to a decrease in the quality, representativeness and eco-sustainability of the recreational territories of populated areas. Renovation of the urbanized landscape is required, based on the preservation of the existing natural-territorial complexes of the city and on the principles of increasing the ecological and aesthetic characteristics of the natural-landscape elements of common areas. One of the possible ways to solve this problem can be the organization of systems of recreational and theme parks of the city. Given the prospects for the development of art of arbor sculpture, the theme park, which includes various architectural and art objects from tree and shrub species, would become one of the visited recreational spaces of the city, as well as contribute to the improvement of the ecological situation in the city and laid the foundations of an ecological worldview as an important component of culture human environment. The article discusses the US Arborsculpture Theme Park; Arborsculpture park in Australia, and in China, design features and principles for organizing Arborsculpture theme parks were defined. The results of the study can be applied in the formation of the Arborsculpture theme park in Russia.

M3  - Article
AB  - The authors concern an actual problem - the importance of physical culture in the pedagogical process of the university as a positive image of the worldview of the students of the third millennium. The idea of interrelation between the sphere of values and meaning and the sphere of human existence and periodic physical activity during the higher education is carried out. It is stated that physical culture promotes initiative, responsibility, critical thinking and purposefulness of students. The worldview is considered from the point of view of human personality subjectivity that can influence the sphere of being and its perception. It is emphasized that the qualities acquired by a student in physical culture classes are one of the main in the course of socialization in the formation of a holistic worldview, the ability to adapt to changing conditions of life. It is pointed out that the formation of worldview within the framework of physical culture classes is possible only with a positive moral coloring of the perception of the need for exercise and maintenance of an appropriate level of their own health.

AB  - Segmentation is a fundamental problem in imageprocessing and a common operation in Remote Sensing, which has been widely used especially in Geographic Object-Based mage Analysis (GEOBIA). In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) theory, The method relies on two levels of information: (1) that comes from an unsupervised classification with Fuzzy C-Means algorithm; (2) the 8-connected neighbourhood of a pixel. The algorithm was tested on a WorldView-2 multispectral image, with 2m of spatial resolution, Results were evaluated using 6 quality measures, and their performance was compared with other image segmentation algorithms that are usually applied by the Remote Sensing community. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieved superior overall performance when compared others, despite some over-segmentation.

T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Results of a long-term comprehensive study of the natural environment of Northeastern Cisbaikalia are presented. Some theoretical and practical issues of a cartographic study of topological-level geosystems are considered in terms of Academician V.B. Sochava's theory of geosystems. We compiled the map of geosystems of the North-Baikal and Upper-Angara depressions displaying the ecological-dynamical interrelations of facies. The geosystems of the depressions of Northeastern Cisbaikalia are characterized by a relatively weak degree of anthropogenic disturbance thereby easing the selection of the natural boundaries of geosystems. Vegetation cover was the main component of the analysis of diversity of geosystems and dynamical processes occurring in them. The investigations are based on data obtained in the process of field work and complemented by archival material; remote sensing data were also used. The main unit of mapping is represented by groups of facies, with the number of which in the map legend totaling 101 without considering the derived units. The secondary communities have an anthropogenic origin; however, the degree of disturbance of such communities is low, and the nature of restoration processes allows their full recovery to be predicted. A unified approach is suggested for identifying the classification divisions of different hierarchical levels for different types of landscapes, which permits comparisons of different territories from a variety of geosystems of a similar level. The content of the mountain tundra geom class was updated. The rejection of the use of subdivisions of tree stands in the classification schemes according to the type of limited, reduced and optimal development is considered. The groups of facies are subdivided according to soil thawing cycles and belonging to the types of factor-dynamical series. Emphasis is placed on the prospects and the need for large-scale investigations into geosystems for the purpose of assessing the environmental potential, predicting environmental changes and optimizing the economic activities.

AB  - Formulation of the problem. The Tatarbunars'kyi District is located in the southwestern part of Odessa region and reflects the main features of the landscape-economic structure of the region: water, agricultural, resort and environmental areas. On the other hand, the form of land use is characterized by widespread plowing of land with degradation and erosion of soil cover.Land structure and use patterns have a complex negative impact on ecological and economic processes and cannot ensure the sustainable development of the region, in particular it is antagonistic to the unique transitional wetland ecosystems of international importance located within the area.To solve the issues of balanced environmental management and zoning of the landscape and economic structure of the region, Earth remote sensing (ERS) data can be used - spectrozonal satellite imagery and geographic information systems (GIS), which can simultaneously cover the research area as a whole, carry out regular monitoring and significantly reduce costs by expensive expeditionary work. Using space monitoring data allows you to get a large array of characteristics of the state of the territorial complexes of the region.Purpose of the work is: assessment of the ecological state of the landscape economic structure and development of recommendations for the protection of natural and territorial complexes of the Tatarbunar 'skyi District of Odessa region based on the use of GIS and remote sensing data.Methods. Landsat8 satellite images with OLI and TIRS sensors, digital terrain models (SRTM) with a spatial resolution of 30 m were used as initial data. The spatial distribution of the population was carried out on the basis of OpenStreetMap data using automatic interpolation using the IDW method. Spatial analysis and data processing were carried out in the QGIS v3.4.6 software package. To quantify the vegetation cover, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI was calculated. Waterlog distribution was estimated using a modified normalized differential moisture index (NDMI). The analysis of the structure of land use and anthropogenic load was carried out on the basis of ranking of territorial objects into homogeneous groups to calculate geoecological coefficients.Results. The article discusses the possibilities of using Earth remote sensing data for a functional assessment of land changes as a result of anthropogenic activities, primarily arable land, analyzes the ecological and economic equilibrium of the region based on geoecological coefficients, identifies areas that are primarily exposed to environmental risks, exogenous processes and the impact anthropogenic factors. Measures are proposed to increase the environmental sustainability of agrolandscapes and the landscape-anthropogenic structure of the region's lands. A detailed hydrological and morphometric analysis of the catchment basin was carried out. Karachaus within the boundaries of the District. For the catchment estuary, remediation and nature conservation measures based on GIS are proposed and designed.

AB  - This paper presents an approach for large-scale precise mapping of agricultural fields based on the analysis of Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) acquired by ESA Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite constellation. The approach has been developed in the framework of the ESA SEOM - Scientific Exploitation of Operational Missions - S2-4Sci Land and Water project. The goal is to design a flexible and automatic processing chain able to perform mapping in massive data. Here we focus on precision agriculture products generation at country level. In particular, the Country of study is Italy and the application goal is precision agriculture of single crop fields. To achieve this goal, two macro challenges are considered: (i) download and pre-processing of S2 SITS, and (ii) multi-temporal (MT) fine characterization of agricultural fields. Both challenges are addressed in an automatic way by exploiting and/or updating state-of-the-art methodologies. Promising results have been obtained over years 2017 and 2018 for Italy.

AB  - Radio-frequency interference (RFI) has had a detrimental effect on L-band passive observatories such as SMOS, Aquarius and SMAP. A better knowledge of the characteristics of RFI signals might help mitigate this issue by leading to additional and better focused RFI detection algorithms and it might help identify RFI emitters on the ground. In this study we present approaches to retrieve some of the features of the RFI signals using SMAP data and we present some statistical considerations about the temporal and spectral characteristics of RFI sources.

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamics of forest landscapes in South Senegal: case of Velingara department
T2  - PHYSIO-GEO
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest landscapes located of southern Senegal, particularly in the department of Velingara, are increasingly subject to deforestation. As a result, there is a strong tendency to "savanise" them, hence the Senegalese authorities' major concern to take the problem in charge. In such a situation, the study of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the vegetation cover becomes relevant for a sustainable management of the forest resources. This is the purpose of this study which aims to analyze the evolution of the forest landscapes of the department of Velingara and the factors of their dynamics. The methodology adopted is based on the exploitation of Landsat satellite imagery acquired in 1987, 2003 and 2018, and on field work. The results indicate a "savanization" linked to a significant deforestation and a growth of agricultural areas in the north and center of the department. This evolution is all the more marked according to an east-west gradient. Between 1987 and 2003, the forest lost 93642 ha of its area (17 %), against a progression of the savannah (+59717 ha) and cultivation areas (+ 26380 ha) associated with the zones of habitat and bare grounds. The period 2003-2018 is marked by the regression of the forest and the savannah; 34149 and 6108 ha respectively, to the benefit of a significant increase in agricultural area (+35055 ha) and the habitats (+10466 ha). This dynamic results from the combination of several factors: clearing for agricultural needs, bush fires, population increase, uncontrolled logging, changes in rainfall conditions, among others.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Social and Behavioural Sciences
CL  - Orenburg State Univ, Orenburg, RUSSIA
AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of euphemism phenomenon in terms of cognitive linguistics. Primary focus is on euphemization processes considered in light of interaction betweenlanguage and conceptual semantics. The considering necessity of euphemism phenomenon in cognitive context is caused both by the relevance of linguo-cognitive approach to the language study in general, and by the necessity to explain the formation process of a new - language semantics and to explain changes in the existing - conceptual one during formation and functioning processes of euphemistic units.The proposed study perspective allows us to expand the traditional euphemisms' understanding (as words synonymous substitutions) by understanding their role in the conceptual content changing of certain negative value parameters of concepts and the value worldview as a whole. From this perspective euphemia is an example for the conceptual content conditionality by the language semantics in general process of linguo-cognitive interaction. The formation process of a new euphemistic unit in language can be viewed as a renaming process based on refocusing (changing in the attention focus) from one features of the nomination object to another. In our opinion this will allow to explain not only the essence of the naming process itself using a different name and its (name's) choice, but also explaining further changing processes in semantic (language) and conceptual content. The refocusing process can be considered within a framework of conceptual integration and derivation theory. (C) 2020 Published by European Publisher.

TI  - Flooded wetlands mapping from Sentinel-2 imagery with spectral water index: a case study of Kampinos National Park in central Poland
T2  - GEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood monitoring of wetlands and floodplains is a new issue in remote sensing, as compared to the mapping of open water bodies. The method based on spectral water indices, calculated on the basis of green, red and shortwave infrared bands, is one of the most popular methods for the recognition of a water body in multispectral images. The recently introduced Sentinel-2 satellite can provide multispectral images with high spatial resolution. This new data set is potentially of great importance for flood mapping, due to its free access and the frequent revisit capabilities. In this study, three popular water indices (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, Normalized Difference Pond Index and Normalized Difference Turbidity Index) were used. The efficiency of the proposed method was tested experimentally using the Sentinel-2 image for the Kampinos National Park in Poland. The experiment compared four extraction algorithms including three based on individual water indicators and one on a combination of them. The results showed that the 10-metre false colour composite produced significantly improved the recognition of flooding in wetland areas by comparison with single spectral water indices. In this way, flooded wetlands were mapped based on the Sentinel-2 data set for the years 2017-2018.

AB  - A folk-tale narrative with its unique composition and deep-laid semantics is an important phenomenon of modern life. It supplements a rational worldview and preserves its priorities, despite the changes that take place in the technical, informational, communicational and other areas of human activity. The folk-tale model of the world is a binary entity characterized by interconnected oppositions. For this reason the structure of the folk-tale and its holistic perception is largely determined by the category of opposition. The article describes a model for representing the category of opposition in Celtic folklore. The author identifies general and specific types of oppositions and describes the language means expressing them. The proposed methodology for the analysis of the language means makes it possible to go beyond the traditional structural description. It gives an insight into a linguistic opposition as a contextually conditioned or a potential phenomenon. Moreover, the oppositional method can be extrapolated to the study of texts which belong to other genres of literature. Such research contributes to the understanding of British ethnic mentality. Establishing what is seen as the opposite in the texts of traditional folk culture helps to identify cultural meanings in language units.

AB  - Physiological activities of two new sweet persimmon cultivars [Arumnuri (AN) and Hongchu (HC)], which were bred for dispersion at harvest time, were compared with old cultivars [Buyu (FY, Japanese Fuyu), Seochonjosaeng (NW, Japanese Nishimurawase), and Sangseojosaeng (UW, Japanese Uenishiwase)]. Ethanol extracts were prepared from each sweet persimmon pulp, and subsequently evaluated for total phenol content (TPC), soluble tannin content (SPC), antioxidant activity, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity, and tyrosinase inhibition activity (TIA). TPC, SPC, and antioxidant activity of AN were relatively higher than other cultivars. ADH activities of all cultivars were similar, whereas TIA was highest in FY. These results support the hypothesis that the new persimmon cultivar AN can be propagated to produce crops with good antioxidant and ADH activities, as compared to the old traditional persimmon cultivars.

TI  - Monitoring of the Surface Ocean Environment Under A Passing Typhoon Using A Wave Glider
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A wave glider was launched in the south of Jeju, Korea and Typhoon Talim (September 9-18, 2017) passed through the East China Sea (ECS) at the same time. It is used to monitor the effect of Typhoon Talim, which had a low pressure center of 940 hPa and a maximum wind speed of 47 m/ s. It made its closest approach to the typhoon around September 16-17. During this time, the atmospheric pressure dropped to 995 hPa, the wind speed was 25 m/s, and the significant wave height was 9.1 m. Satellite images showed two hot spots. One was an upwelling event in the southern part of the ECS and the other was a horizontal movement of the water column in the middle of the ECS. When the typhoon was approaching, the wave glider measured the lowest sea surface temperature and salinity, whereas the chlorophyll levels and turbidity increased, which could not be explained by local observations. However, satellite data could compare the trends before and after the typhoon's approach, where the data indicated that the vertical mixing and upwelling events near the typhoon's center were responsible for the low temperature and high chlorophyll levels in the surface layer.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawling is a phenomenon of fast unrestricted growth due to domestic use and industrialization. The urban sprawling may lead to haphazard and unplanned development in urban localities. In this work, high resolution data of Digital globe is used to study urban sprawl detection and analysis. To analyze the urban sprawling in Uran Taluka of Raigad district for Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) area, the satellite data of 0.6 m and 0.5 m resolution captured by QuickBird and World view-2 satellite is experimented. The study area is governed by Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust authorities. For object based land use change detection, the unsupervised classification algorithm is used. In this study, it is concluded that, the urban area is decreased by 6.585% from year 2006 to 2014, and overall vegetation and green cover area is decreased by 4.81% from year 2006 to year 2010 & increased by 0.25% from year 2010 to 2014. The results of this research work are also validated by doing accuracy assessment with supervised classification of the same area.

AB  - This study analyzed the relationship between spatial characteristics and heat waves in the distribution area of the elderly population in Changwon, Gyeongsangnam-do. For analysis, the Statistics Census data, the Ministry of Environment land cover, Landsat 8 surface temperature, and the Meteorological Agency's heat wave days data were used. The spatial characteristics of the distribution of the elderly population was classified into 5 types through K-mean cluster analysis considering the land use types. The characteristics of the elderly population by spatial type were higher in the urbanized type(cluster-3), but the proportion of the elderly population was higher in the agricultural and forest area types(cluster-1, cluster-2). In the characteristics of the surface temperature and the heat wave days, the surface temperature was the highest in the urban area, but heat wave days were the highest in the rural area. As a result of analyzing the heat wave characteristics according to the spatial type of the distribution area of elderly population, cluster-2 with the largest area in agricultural areas was highest at 15.95 days, and cluster-3 with a large area in urbanized types was the lowest at 9.41 days and 9.18 days. In other words, the elderly population living in rural areas is more exposed to heat waves than the elderly population living in urban areas, and the damage is expected to increase. The results of this study could be used as basic data to prepare various policy measures for effective management and prevention of vulnerable areas in summer.

M3  - Article
AB  - As the key component of available freshwater resources, lakes play an important role in all aspects of life and human activities. Influenced by global climate change and human intervention, lakes have been undergoing rapid changes. Thus it is necessary to conduct lasting and accurate investigation of spatial and temporal variations of these lakes, serving better for water resources management and protection, and early warning of future climate change risks. The emergence and development of remote sensing technology provides great opportunity for large-scale and near real-time monitoring of lake dynamics, which overcomes the limitations of field-based investigation of lakes. In this paper, the existing remote sensing technologies and methods of lake monitoring are reviewed, and the progress of remote sensing research in the aspects of lake area extraction, lake level reconstruction, lake water volume/storage variation estimation, etc., are summarizes. This review focuses on the new methods and new technologies employed in recent years. The application prospect of multi-source remote sensing data fusion and cloud computing platform in continuous change monitoring of surface water bodies is also mentioned. Finally, in view of the promising development of remote sensing technology, the application potential and prospective of remote sensing monitoring of lake dynamics in the future are discussed briefly.

TI  - A Novel Marine Oil Spillage Identification Scheme Based on Convolution Neural Network Feature Extraction From Fully Polarimetric SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine oil spill pollution has caused serious impacts on marine ecological environments, ecological resources and marine economy. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), especially polarmetric SAR (PolSAR), has been proven to be a powerful and efficient tool for marine oil spill detection. In general, traditional oil spill detection methods mainly rely on artificially-extracted polarization characteristics, and the detection accuracy is limited by the quality of feature extraction. Recently proposed Convolutional neural network (CNN) is capable of mining spatial feature from large data set automatically. Inspired by these, in this paper we proposed a novel oil spill identification method based on multi-layer deep feature extraction by CNN. Firstly, PolSAR data are converted into a 9-channel data block to feed the CNN. Then, a 5-layer CNN architecture is built to extract two high-level features from the original data automatically. The features are fused after dimension reduction via principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, support vector machine method with radial basis function kernel (RBF-SVM) is utilized for classification. Three sets of RADARSAT-2 fully polarimetric SAR data were used in this study to validate the proposed method. The obtained results reveal that the proposed method provides competitive results in overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficient. Moreover, this method can improve the accuracy of oil spill detection, reduce the false alarm rate, and effectively distinguish an oil spill from a biogenic slick.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of neck stabilization exercise with PNF for neck alignment, neck disability index, and sitting balance in adults with forward-head posture. Methods: Forty participants were randomly assigned to two groups. Patients in the neck stabilization exercise group (NSG, n = 20) and the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation neck pattern exercise group (PNFG, n = 20) were studied 30 minutes a day three times a week for four weeks. Outcomes were measured using cranial vertical angle (CVA), the Korean version of the neck disability index (KNDI), anterior limit of stability (ALOS), and posterior limit of stability (PLOS) before and after the intervention period. Results: There were significant effects in the CVA and the KNDI of both groups pre- and post-intervention. There were significant effects in ALOS and PLOS in the PNFG pre- and post-intervention compared with the NSG. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that PNF with neck exercise could be beneficial to the static balance of adults with forward-head posture.

TI  - Multi-source remote sensing image classification based on two-channel densely connected convolutional networks
T2  - MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image classification exploiting multiple sensors is a very challenging problem: The traditional methods based on the mediumor low-resolution remote sensing images always provide low accuracy and poor automation level because the potential of multi-source remote sensing data are not fully utilized and the low-level features are not effectively organized. The recent method based on deep learning can efficiently improve the classification accuracy, but as the depth of deep neural network increases, the network is prone to be overfitting. In order to address these problems, a novel Two-channel Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (TDCC) is proposed to automatically classify the ground surfaces based on deep learning and multi-source remote sensing data. The main contributions of this paper includes the following aspects: First, the multi-source remote sensing data consisting of hyperspectral image (HSI) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) are pre-processed and re-sampled, and then the hyperspectral data and LiDAR data are input into the feature extraction channel, respectively. Secondly, two-channel densely connected convolutional networks for feature extraction were proposed to automatically extract the spatial-spectral feature of HSI and LiDAR. Thirdly, a feature fusion network is designed to fuse the hyperspectral image features and LiDAR features. The fused features were classified and the output result is the category of the corresponding pixel. The experiments were conducted on popular dataset, the results demonstrate that the competitive performance of the TDCC with respect to classification performance compared with other state-of-the-art classification methods in terms of the OA, AA and Kappa, and it is more suitable for the classification of complex ground surfaces.

AB  - Nietzsche as a critic of Judeo-Christian values, declared ‘Gott ist tot’ in the fin-de-siecle. His statement implied a massive fall of the predominant and central values in the history of Western thought. In other words, its implication has greatly diverged into two aspects: values beyond the sensible are not able to be considered as important as the previous times, and the enormous power of God does not have considerable impact on human life anymore. Nietzsche’s criticism of Judeo-Christian values dealt with two sections: the morality of Christianity on the basis of original sin in the Book of Genesis (the Old Testament) and the concept of the abstract God which abominates natural things in the actual world. In this regard, we can make a conjecture on his inclination towards anti-Judaism. Nietzsche, however, did not agreed to the tremendous enthusiasm of nationalism originated from ‘anti-Semitism’ since it was mainly focused not on monotheistic features of the Abrahamic religions but on rampant racism grounded on pseudo-scientific assumptions such as eugenics, phrenology and anthropological conjectures in the nineteenth century. Therefore, Nietzsche could not be determined to be anti-Semitic because he strongly criticized the concept and cultural heritage of a monotheistic God originating from the Jewish nation, rather than Semitic people themselves. According to the view of Assmann’s ‘mnemohistory’, ‘normative inversion’ of the Semite means a thorough rejection against the cosmotheistic worldview of the Egyptian. Nietzsches’s criticism clearly targeted at not the Jewish people but their religio-philosophical beliefs and values resulting from what they rejected. Consequently, I think he does not approve of anti-Semitism since he has no racial bias on the Jewish people themselves. In a central line of the argumentation in Nietzsche’s work Anti-Christ, Beyond Good and Evil, and Also spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche must be not an anti-Semite, but a fierce critic opposed to the values of Judaeo-Christianity in the religio-cultural milieu.

AB  - Ship detection in coastal regions accompanied by machine learning could be effective in economic and martial issues. However, conventional researches on ship detection mainly focused on modifying the training model itself instead of obtaining qualified training data. In order to ameliorate the training data in the aspect of quality and quantity, this research aims to directly obtain training data from AIS information. From discrete MS information, interpolation on SAR acquisition time was conducted, followed by adjusting the Doppler frequency shift caused by each vessel's velocity. Training data was constructed from the adjusted position using internal location of AIS sensor on each type of vessel. Extracted training data by the proposed algorithm from Sentinel-1 images was tested with CNN model. As the detection performance of the extracted training data exceeded that from visual interpretation, this study concluded that qualified training data could be extracted from the proposed algorithm.

TI  - Intelligent Object Recognition of Urban Water Bodies Based on Deep Learning for Multi-Source and Multi-Temporal High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution remote sensing image (HSRRSI) data provide rich texture, geometric structure, and spatial distribution information for surface water bodies. The rich detail information provides better representation of the internal components of each object category and better reflects the relationships between adjacent objects. In this context, recognition methods such as geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) have improved significantly. However, these methods focus mainly on bottom-up classifications from visual features to semantic categories, but ignore top-down feedback which can optimize recognition results. In recent years, deep learning has been applied in the field of remote sensing measurements because of its powerful feature extraction ability. A special convolutional neural network (CNN) based region proposal generation and object detection integrated framework has greatly improved the performance of object detection for HSRRSI, which provides a new method for water body recognition based on remote sensing data. This study uses the excellent "self-learning ability" of deep learning to construct a modified structure of the Mask R-CNN method which integrates bottom-up and top-down processes for water recognition. Compared with traditional methods, our method is completely data-driven without prior knowledge, and it can be regarded as a novel technical procedure for water body recognition in practical engineering application. Experimental results indicate that the method produces accurate recognition results for multi-source and multi-temporal water bodies, and can effectively avoid confusion with shadows and other ground features.

AB  - This article was written to compare modern Western superhero stories with Joseon-era hero novels, and to explore the possibility of hero novels as Korean superhero stories, as well as to explore new ways to educate classical novels. This article focused on a series of Superman series, the origin and symbol of Westem superhero stories, and used other works such as Avengers> to compare and analyze our hero novels. Among the hero novels, early hero novels such as Hong Gil-dongjeon, mid-stage "Sodae Seongjeon" and heyday "Yoo Chung-ryeoljeon" were selected as the main subjects of comparison. To this end, we looked at the concept and aspect of the term "worldview" mentioned in the superhero story, and compared it with the hero novel according to this concept. In particular, the superhero story focused on the story of Superman, the founder and symbolic character of the story. The story, which became famous in 1978 for the movie Superman, has continued to seek changes in the narrative structure for more than 40 years until recently, and the worldview has expanded accordingly. The process of changing the structure and structure of the story has shown an interesting aspect that is quite similar but fundamentally different compared to our hero novels. In other words, "Superman" and hero novels have a very similar composition, but the existence of red-river motifs, the existence of direct-bom motifs, and family nature can be seen as factors that distinguish the entire work. This was also the reason why the hero novel's main character could not be named as a superhero. We also discussed that our hero novels have a good chance of becoming Korean superhero stories.

AB  - The field of laser remote sensing and laser detection is becoming a research hot spot. Filter wheel is an important part in the process of remote sensing. The purpose of filter wheel is to choose the proper band wavelength of light to realize the specific functions. The paper made a design scheme of a type of filter wheel component and then did structural analysis under different and strict load cases. These various load cases were used to prove that if the component could be safe during the launching time of the rocket. For the initial design scheme, the situation was not good. After that, the paper made an improved design by using special flexible supports, which had flexible links and support glue. At last, structural analysis was made. The result of analysis showed that the improvement was effective and successful.

AB  - Spatio-temporal fusion is a promising way to deal with the tradeoff between the temporal resolution and spatial resolution of the remote sensing images This paper presents a novel remote sensing image spatio-temporal fusion model to expand the application of spatio-temporal fusion with insufficient data, based on a generative adversarial network to handle one prior image pair cases (OPGAN). Considering the huge spatial resolution gap between the high-spatial, low-temporal (HSLT) resolution Landsat imagery and the corresponding low-spatial, high-temporal (LSHT) resolution MODIS imagery, the proposed OPGAN simultaneously trains a generator and a discriminator in a min-max game to reconstruct the high-spatial-high-temporal (HSHT) resolution Landsat images, significantly improving the accuracy of change prediction with the help of the temporal changes and sensor differences. Experimental results on three representative Landsat-MODIS datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed OPGAN method.

AB  - In recent years, Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) has evolved in the various fields of computer vision and performed state of the art in image classification task including feature extraction in high-resolution satellite imagery. During the training process, DCNN is required to achieve the highest accuracy but framework should be optimized with the help of hyperparameters (knobs) to reach that accuracy. In this study, we investigated the effect of various hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, and other additional factors like test ratio w.r.t different variants of gradient optimizer algorithms, which can help to give the direction for the searching of better hyperparameter setting so that DCNN could achieve better classification accuracy with less computation time. Herein, we used SAT4 and SAT6 datasets to train the ALEXNET framework.

TI  - Monitoring water transparency of a hypertrophic lake (the Albufera of Valencia) using multitemporal Sentinel-2 satellite images
T2  - LIMNETICA

CP  - 19th Congress of the Iberian-Association-of-Limnology (AIL)

AB  - The Albufera of Valencia has been a hypertrophic lake since the 1970s. Extensive efforts to revert the system to a clear water state, such as wastewater treatment and green filters construction, have not yielded the desired results; Albufera is still qualified as "bad" according to the Spanish Water Framework Directive implementation. Currently, the lake requires constant monitoring, and water transparency, measured by Secchi disc depth (SDD), is a key parameter for evaluating water quality. Remote sensing offers substantial advantages over traditional monitoring methods such as SDD because it allows the quality of the surface waters to be continuously monitored. This work aimed to calibrate and validate an algorithm for SDD retrieval from Sentinel-2 (S2) (A and B) satellites with multispectral instrument (MSI) sensors (13 bands) from 404 nm to 2200 nm, spatial resolutions of 10, 20 and 60 m and a temporal frequency of 5 days (revisit at the equator)-values previously unattainable from open access images. The study was carried out with images from 2016 and 2017; only 40 of the 81 images of the Albufera captured by the S2 satellites could be used, mainly due to the presence of clouds. Once the images were downloaded, they were processed using SNAP 5 software. Images were then atmospherically corrected using the Sen2Cor tool, and the lake's SDD was estimated using the developed algorithm. The estimated SDD data were validated against field samples; a total of 20 sampling campaigns were carried out to measure the SDD, and 114 samples were taken. Chlorophyll a concentrations from each sample point were also measured to allow for better data interpretation; hydrological, precipitation and wind data were also collected. The algorithm model's calibration showed its robustness with an R-2 of 0.673 using 79 samples. Validation of the algorithm's accuracy using 35 samples produced a low root mean squared error of 0.06 m, indicating a perfect fit between the predicted and observed data. Interpretation of thematic maps showed that SDD temporal variations follow an annual bimodal pattern where the increase of SDD is determined by a significant increase in water renewal. The retrieval algorithm to estimate the SDD from S2 satellite images is accurate and appropriate to use within a protocol whose main purpose is to monitor the ecological status of the Albufera of Valencia.

TI  - Remote sensing of cyanobacterial blooms in a hypertrophic lagoon (Albufera of Valencia, Eastern Iberian Peninsula) using multitemporal Sentinel-2 images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophy in Albufera of Valencia (Eastern Iberian Peninsula) is a quite old problem since after the intense eutrophication processes throughout the 1960s. The system shifted to a turbid stable state consolidated by the virtual disappearance of macrophytes by the early 1970s. The lagoon has been studied extensively since the 1980s, but efforts to revert the system to a dear state have not yielded the expected results because cultural eutrophication due to the growth of population in its area of influence and the effects of climate change, decreasing rainfall and increasing evaporation. This has driven to an increase in water retention times in the lagoon in recent years, resulting in a phytoplanktonic shift towards potentially toxic cyanobacteria species, often forming blooms. Cyanobacterial blooms severely affect water quality for human use, ranging from recreation and fishing to drinking water resources, as indicated in the surveillance protocol of World Health Organization (WHO). The current state of the lake requires constant monitoring and remote sensing is an optimal tool for the continuous monitoring of the whole water mass. This work is included in the ESAQS project (Ecological Status of AQuatic systems with Sentinel satellites), to establish a protocol for regular and frequent monitoring of the ecological status of reservoirs, lakes and lagoons. Algorithms are developed using the images provided by the Sentinel-2 (A and B), provided with a spatial resolution of 10 m and a temporal frequency of 5 days. In this work we demonstrate that using this new earth observation satellite is possible to develop a consistent and suitable algorithm to estimate the phycocyanin concentration [PC) and establish a protocol for regular and frequent monitoring. Calibrating (R-2 = 0.841; n = 21; p < 0.001) and validating (R-2 = 0.775: n = 55; p < 0.001; RMSE% = 40) the algorithm with field data are also demonstrated. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The experimental study of algorithms for radar data interferometric processing effectiveness is complicated by the fact that a quantitative result can be obtained only after the completion of the entire processing procedure, so it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of its first stages. A method of experimental evaluation of the accuracy of the results of interferometric processing by various algorithms of phase unwrapping with such combination of image and reference data, which does not require the use of the ambiguity height parameter, is proposed. The results of the method implementation for ALOS PALSAR data in relation to areas with hilly and low-mountain terrain are presented. Estimates of the vertical accuracy of ALOS PALSAR interferometric data for Region Growing and Minimal Cost Flow phase unwrapping algorithms implemented in the SARscape software package are obtained.

AB  - The article is devoted the coherence maps utilization for the phase noise filtration using the Goldstein filter for interferometric synthesized aperture radar (InSAR) images. For the ALOS PALSAR data (FBS imaging mode), four coherence estimation techniques (classical, difference slope compensation, Fourier slope compensation, and "peak-Fourier") were researched as the Goldstein filter parameter. The filtered interferograms were compared with the reference ground control points reprojected into the radar coordinate system. It is shown that the coherence estimation method affects the quality of the phase noise suppression.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the spiritual search of one of the most original Czech artists of the 20th century. The first part of the text presents a general outline of the author's views on the matters of God, Satan, Catholicism, the Church, Nature, Occultism, and Mysticism. The radical changes in Vachal's worldview and the aporias of his concepts are emphasized. An important thread in this part of the text is to show the spiritual connections between Vachal's beliefs and fears on the one hand and criticism of contemporary civilization on the other. In the second part of the article, the author's attention was focused on one year of the artist's life. The art and literary works produced in 1920 were created with unusual intensity and in great moral tension resulting from the fact that he had started an extramarital relationship, but this did not diminish their quality. Apart from introducing the reader to these extraordinary works, the second part of the article examines in detail Vachal's attitude as a critic of 'modern' man: thoughtless and destructive towards nature, cruel towards animals. It also presents the artist's countercultural project related to the idea of the Book as a literary labyrinth that should be traversed slowly with humility and effort, in spite of the endless rush of modern culture.

AB  - The implementation of the Paragonorte Settlement caused environmental degradation due to deforestation, in order to reverse this situation, it is necessary to adapt it to the Forest Code established by Law 12.651 / 2012. One of the instruments created by this law is the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR), whose purpose is to integrate environmental information. In this context, geotechnologies allow the generation of cartographic products to support the elaboration of the CAR, such as the land use and occupation map. This work aimed to generate maps of land use, with the perspective of subsidizing environmental planning, in the Paragonorte Settlement Project in the municipality of ParagominasPA. To prepare this map, digital processing techniques were applied to CBERS-4 satellite images and supervised classification. In validating the generated map, it was found that the Kappa index is 0.8990. The classes of use and occupation identified were: exposed soil, water, urban area, pasture, dirty pasture, regeneration, forest and secondary forest. Of the verified classes, the predominant ones are forest and secondary forest that together represent 49.64% of the coverage, while the land use classes that are quite representative are those destined to pastures, which correspond to 23.01% of the coverage. The information from the map generated in this work can be used in the preparation of the CAR and to support the implementation of public policies aimed at environmental planning.

AB  - Spatial variability represents a challenge for viticulture. Variable-rate fertilization is a promising technology to manage different vigor and yield zones within the. In this study, on-the-go variable rate fertilization system was implemented and tested, based on commercial spectral sensors. GreenSeeker Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) sensor was mounted in front of a tractor and connected to the electronic control unit of a variable rate spreader. Fertilizer rate was based on threshold values of NDVI, calibrated previously in ten sampling points by a GreenSeeker handheld sensor. The sampling points were selected according to the agronomist expertise on vineyard variability. A couple of GreenSeeker sensors carried by tractor and connected to the fertilizer electronic control unit were used for fertilizer dosage definition. Fertilizer application was evaluated comparing the amount of fertilizer distributed in the sample points with the prescribed dose. Results showed good accuracy of distribution compared with the prescribed amount of fertilizer. Similarly, the fertilizer distribution showed a significant correlation (R-2 = 0.65, p-value < 0.01) with the Leaf Area Index collected in the sampling points. The effects of variable rate fertilizer application on vine vigor were preliminary assessed measuring vine shoot length the day when fertilizer was applied and 14 days after fertilizer application. Linear regression for vine shoots growth rate based on applied fertilizer showed an R-2 of 0.6, suggesting a positive effect of the on-the-go variable rate fertilizer application on vines growth. Fertilization effects on field variability were then assessed considering three variability coefficients of NDVI (sigma, Gini, and CV). The comparison between variability coefficients of the years before and after the fertilizer application showed a reduction of 37%, 43%, and 40% for sigma, Gini, and CV, respectively. The results highlight the potential of proximal spectral sensors for on-the-go variable rate fertilization and reduction of in-field variability in vineyards.

TI  - Comparing vineyard imagery acquired from Sentinel-2 and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform
T2  - OENO ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The recent availability of Sentinel-2 satellites has led to an increasing interest in their use in viticulture. The ann of this short communication is to determine performance and limitation of a Sentinel-2 vegetation index in precision viticulture applications, in terms of correlation and variability assessment, compared to the same vegetation index derived from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used as reference vegetation index.Methods and Results: UAV and Sentinel-2 vegetation indices were acquired for 30 vineyard blocks located in the south of France without inter-row grass. From the UAV imagery, the vegetation index was calculated using both a mixed pixels approach (both vine and inter-row) and from pure vine-only pixels. In addition, the vine projected area data were extracted using a support vector machine algorithm for vineyard segmentation. The vegetation index was obtained from Sentinel-2 imagery obtained at approximately the same time as the UAV imagery. The Sentinel-2 images used a mixed pixel approach as pixel size is greater than the row width. The correlation between these three layers and the Sentinel-2 derived vegetation indices were calculated, considering spatial autocorrelation correction for the significance test. The Gini coefficient was used to estimate variability detected by each sensor at the within-field scale. The effects of block border and dimension on correlations were estimated.Conclusions: The comparison between Sentinel-2 and UAV vegetation index showed an increase in correlation when border pixels were removed. Block dimensions did not affect the significance of correlation unless blocks were < 0.5 ha. Below this threshold, the correlation was non-significant in most cases. Sentinel-2 acquired data were strongly correlated with UAV-acquired data at both the field (R-2 = 0.87) and sub-field scale (R-2 = 0.84). In teens of variability detected, Sentinel-2 proved to be able to detect the same amount of variability as the UAV mixed pixel vegetation index.Significance and impact of the study: This study showed at which field conditions the Sentinel-2 vegetation index can be used instead of UAV-acquired images when high spatial resolution (vine-specific) management is not needed and the vineyard is characterised by no inter-row grass. This type of information may help growers to choose the most appropriate information sources to detect variability according to their vineyard characteristics.

AB  - Sea ice plays a major role in our planet's climate. It' acts as a reflector of solar energy, mainly in spring and summer. Sea ice covered with fresh snow can reflect 75-90% of solar energy, the open sea reflects just 5-15%. Sea ice acts as an insulator in autumn and winter. This insulating effect limits the amount of both heat and moisture the ocean loses to the atmosphere. The declining sea ice disrupts the climate, societies and fauna of Polar areas, but encourages the econcmic and industrial development. The relevance of this study is related to current trends in the use of remote sensing in solving problems of a different nature in environmental monitoring. The sea ice was analyzed and mapped according to the European Space Agency data (ESA), acquired by sensors of Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Sentinel- 2MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument), Sentinel- 3 and GIS. The subject of the study is to demonstrate the dynamics, during the summer season from 2015 to 2019, around the coastline of Livingston Island, New Shetland Islands in Antarctica and Longyearbyen in the Arctic. Changes in environmental objects are indicated by radar images through different processing approaches. The results clearly show that sea ice melting can be best recorded by using SAR data through the C-band. The results obtained are data in the form of thematic maps showing the spatial reflectance of sea ice and its dynamics over time.

AB  - Introduction: the article deals with the plots relating to thing content of everyday culture of the Khanty and Mansi people, as well as beliefs and customs, regulating death (utilization) of some things of artificial environment from the perspective of the life cycle phases of material culture identified by H. Eggers. The paper studies the signs characterizing the exclusion of things from the world of everyday life, as well as the features of their utilization.Objective: to study the traditional ideas of the Ob Ugrians associated with the death of things of the real world in their synchronization with the age of a person.Research materials: published materials on the ethnography of the Ob Ugrians of the XVIII-XIX centuries, collections of folklore, language data, as well as oral reports of informants.Results and novelty of the research: the article is the first experience in understanding of the material culture of the Khanty and Mansi people from the point of view of the unity of its elements with the age periodization of people. The cultural-historical mode of existence of a thing is revealed, which made it possible to obtain a more complete, holistic view of the spheres of functioning of tings of the material world in the traditional culture of the indigenous peoples of the North. Ethnographic material is structured in the logic of a person's life cycle based on a circular time model and elements of funeral rituals. The study opens the prospect of a more complete disclosure of the spiritual culture of the Ob Ugrians, as well as the basic principles of their worldview, including at the local level. The main provisions of the article can be used in the creation of general works on regional ethnography, in the development of special courses on the problems of rheology, semiotics, etc.

AB  - Surface waters are a fundamental resource. They fulfil key function in global biogeochemical cycles and are core to our water, food and energy security. The rapidly increasing rate of data collection from different Earth observation (EO) missions suitable for observing water bodies has promoted satellite remote sensing (RS) as a more widely recognised source of information on a number of indicators of water quality and ecosystem condition at local and global scales. In parallel, advances in optical sensors support new and more detailed characterisation of the Earth surface and could lead to innovative EO-based products. Nonetheless, RS of water colour of inland and coastal systems, especially in larger scales and over long-term time series, faces unique challenges. This study provides an overview of the challenges and solutions of developing a global observation platform, including the diverse and complex optical properties of inland waters and guided algorithm selection procedure required to deliver reliable data. The development and validation of a global satellite data processing chain (Calimnos) has been supported by access to an extensive in situ data from more than thirty partners around the world that are now held in the LIMNADES community -owned database. This approach has resulted in a step -change in our ability to produce regional and global water quality products for optically complex waters. Local examples of the data outputs will be explored and the opportunities in how these data can be embedded within local and national monitoring schemes to facilitate better management of water will be discussed.

AB  - Remote Sensing contributes through the processing and analysis of very high spatial and spectral resolution time series satellite data to a decision support at field level. In this paper, in the olive tree farms of the Agricultural Association of Messolonghi-Nafpaktia, the extraction of K-c and various vegetation indices, such as chlorophyll and red-edge, are presented aiming at the assessment of crop evapotranspiration and irrigation/fertiliser inflows during a period of 24 months. The methodology includes the generation of red-edge, chlorophyll and FPAR indices based on the second NIR band of WV-2, and clustering. The so-called ETc(satellite) produced by using the reference ETo from FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation, meteorological data set and K-c(satellite) extracted by NDVI utilising the red-edge and second NIR bands of WV-2, respectively. The dynamic ETd compared with ETc. The applied methodology proved to be very useful for the implementation and verification of AGRO 2.1 and 2.2 standards.

AB  - Indian cities are expanding exponentially due to rapid and unplanned urbanization. The unprecedented pace of expansion is a major challenge for surface water management. The shrinkage of surface water bodies is considered as an important criterion by urban planners and policymakers. This research utilizes remote sensing data to address this problem for the suburbs of Chennai The extent of urbanization is studied through remote sensing data obtained from satellite imagery at 30 m resolution for the year 2019 and land use land cover classification is also carried out to determine the urban built up. The initial surface area of the water bodies were determined using the topographical maps and was then compared with the present areal extent. The result reveals that the urbanization had a significant impact on the spatial extent of surface water bodies. The water bodies have significantly undergone reduction and disappearance due to urban expansion. Proactive land use planning and monitoring are essential to safeguard the ecological value of water bodies.

AB  - Since the late 19th century, global warming as obtained more attention as the global mean surface temperature has increased and urbanization is one of the major causes of global warming. Given the fact of the heavy migration of people from rural to urban, uncontrollable growth takes place to accommodate this population. This is considered to be a major problem in developing countries. Ludhiana a city in the state of Punjab, India is considered for the study. In this study, LANDSAT 8 (2019) and LANDSAT 5 (2000 and 2009) were taken from USGS to retrieve Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Land Use Land Cover (LULC). Rapid urbanization resulted in the formation of Urban Heat Island (UHI). The UHI had a mixed pattern of temperature variation for barren, urban, water and vegetation lands. The results of the land covers were computed as normalized indices as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference Barren Index (NDBaI). The relationship between temperature and indices were determined, the NDBI and Normalized NDBaI produced an increase in LST as the range of NDBI and NDBaI increased.

AB  - Urbanization is the process in which population shifts from rural to cities or urban centers for an improved standard of living due to economic growth and development. As the migration rate increases, urban cities undergo major changes in land use and land cover which trigger several negative effects such as overcrowding, water scarcity, air pollution, loss of productive agricultural lands and forest cover. Remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) are used for monitoring the emerging urbanization of the cities using satellite images. In this study, the land use land cover classification of Surat city has been studied for 26 years (1993-2019). The results showed that the urban built-up area in the city has increased by 175.2% over the years. In this study, the contemporary situation of surface water bodies of Surat city was examined by the intersection of urban land use areas and the digitized surface water bodies. The result reveals the reduction and disappearance of surface water bodies due to the encroachment of urban land-use. This study is done to raise the awareness paid for surface water management issues during the urban expansion process.

TI  - Urban heat island effect over Delhi NCR using LANDSAT™ data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the authors have analysed the phenomenon of urban heat island using LANDSAT (TM) data for the Delhi NCR region applying the mono-window algorithm. The spatial pattern of land surface temperature (LST) from 2001 to 2019 was retrieved to study its effect on urban heat island, henceforth referred to as UHI. The LST maps of 26 profiles spread over the entire study area for every year were studied to find any corroboration. The authors conclude that the UHI effect increased during 2001-2010 as the region underwent a massive infrastructure development phase. During 2010-2016, it showed a decreasing trend due to an increase in forest cover and the various government initiatives to minimise the effect of construction activities and climate change. However, beyond 2016, the LST and UHI data shows an increasing trend. The calculated LST value is observed to be highest in 2018 whereas the UHI effect is increasing and has been obtained as the maximum in 2019, giving rise to localised climate change. This indicates that the earlier initiatives taken are no longer effective and new steps need to be taken to minimise the effect of UHI.

TI  - Dental Patient Safety in the Military Health System: Joining Medicine in the Journey to High Reliability
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionDelivering consistent high quality care in a safe environment is the goal of the modern dental delivery system. Preventable adverse events, however, are still commonplace in dentistry. As has been demonstrated in the medical field, a concerted and persistent effort will be required to objectively understand and begin to eliminate the sources of dental error. In civilian dental practice this effort is hampered by the underreporting of patient safety events in comparison to the medical field. Patient safety reporting in the Military Health System (MHS) is robust and includes dentistry. This provides an important opportunity to analyze these data as the foundation for improvements in dental care and the elimination of preventable harm. The purpose of this article is to review MHS dental patient safety data, identify the primary sources of dental error and describe current initiatives based on the adoption of the High Reliability Organization (HRO) model of care that has been profitably embraced by the medical community.MethodsDental patient safety report data from the Defense Health Agency Patient Safety Analysis Center (PSAC) for the period 2013-2016 were analyzed to determine the type, incidence, contributing factors, setting and trends for dental errors occurring within the MHS. Comparison to medical data was also performed.ResultsFrom 2013 to 2016, there was a 32.1% increase in dental patient safety reports in the MHS. For this period, dentistry accounted for the highest number of Sentinel Events (SEs) compared to other clinical specialties and accounted for 32.7% of all SEs for the period. From 2013 to 2016, there was a five-fold increase in reported dental SEs. Wrong-Site Surgeries (WSS) comprised the highest proportion of SEs followed by intraoperative or immediate post-operative/post-procedure or surgery issues (63% and 14%, respectively). Within the WSS category, wrong-site anesthesia and wrong-tooth treated were the two largest sub-categories (40% and 32%, respectively). The data reviewed are not rates and do not take into account the total number of procedures performed by dentistry in comparison to medicine. Root cause analysis identified communication failures and inconsistent adoption of the Universal Protocol as the leading contributing factors for WSSs.ConclusionSafety initiatives in the dental profession remain immature in comparison to the medical field and the use of an HRO framework is just beginning to emerge in dentistry. The MHS benefits from a robust dental patient safety reporting system when compared to civilian practice in the United States. Review of these data demonstrates that a high priority focus should be the elimination of WSS. Initiatives based on high reliability strategies to address this issue will be discussed. A commitment to reporting and analyzing its performance and adopting the principles and behaviors of HROs will accelerate the MHS goal of providing ever increasing safety and quality in the dental care it provides.

AB  - Polycentricity refers to urban regions with more than one center. These additional (sub-) centers, e.g. spatial concentrations of jobs, are characteristic for the transformation of monocentric towards polycentric urban patterns. Frequently assessed with socioeconomic data, the phenomenon is also reflected in the built morphology of urban landscapes. Only recently, a methodology for largescale morphological characterization of built-up structures in urban areas relying on TanDEM-X and Sentinel-2 data has been introduced. Thus, a new way to investigate morphologic polycentricity in and among cities is provided. Relying on this approach, we derive the distribution of urban mass concentrations in four city regions. We identify high urban mass concentrations - proxies for (sub-) centers using a threshold approach. A comparison between the studied regions reveals that only one city tends to have a polycentric urban structure. Our study highlights a new and promising possibility to study the urban morphologic development at global scales.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Agricultural activities cause rapid changes in vegetation development at local and regional scales. Those modifications affect the small-scale behavior of animals, like the foraging ground usage of breeding white storks. Only recently, a novel approach, that enables to quantify the relationship between mowing and harvesting activities and a prolonged foraging time of storks by combining remote sensing time series with GPS telemetry, has been proposed. This study examines the stability of this approach. We investigate two potential influencing factors: different vegetation indices and time lags over which vegetation dynamics were retrieved. Mostly independent from the vegetation index and time lag, we observed that storks spent large proportions of foraging time in areas characterized by a recent drop in vegetation indices, indicative for a preferred usage after harvesting and mowing events. This suggest that the proposed approach is relatively stable and hence, provides a reasonable basis to investigate the effects of anthropogenic vegetation alterations on animal behavior at small spatiotemporal scales.

AB  - Simulated RCM SC50 compact polarimetry (CP) imagery was compared to RADARSAT-2 for detection of actionable or thick oil. The SC50 has 50 m resolution and a 350 km swath width. A key advantage of CP data is the acquisition of two data channels and the retention of the relative phase between the data channels. Although there are numerous CP parameter that are applicable for oil slick characterization, the degree of polarization (p) was selected for this study. p varies between 1 (completely polarized wave) and 0 (completely depolarized wave). Scattering from the ocean surface is dominated by Bragg scattering meaning p is polarized so approaches 1. In contrast, scattering from thick oil is generally depolarized, so p approaches 0. p for RADARSAT-2 and SC50 was compared to an oil thickness map derived from ASTER and Worldview imagery. Overall there was good visual agreement between the oil thickness classes and the spatial variability of the degree of polarization. There were, however, differences between the RADARSAT-2 and SC50 that were attributed to resolution and the noise floor. Overall the results suggest that the use of the SC50 CP mode, which balances resolution and spatial coverage, provides information on relative oil thickness that can effectively be used for operational oil spill response.

TI  - Satellite-Based Mapping of Urban Poverty With Transfer-Learned Slum Morphologies
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the course of global urbanization, poverty in cities has been observed to increase, especially in the Global South. Poverty is one of the major challenges for our society in the upcoming decades, making it one of the most important issues in the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations. Satellite-based mapping can provide valuable information about slums where insights about the location and size are still missing. Large-scale slum mapping remains a challenge, fuzzy feature spaces between formal and informal settlements, significant imbalance of slum occurrences opposed to formal settlements, and various categories of multiple morphological slum features. We propose a transfer learned fully convolutional Xception network (XFCN), which is able to differentiate between formal built-up structures and the various categories of slums in high-resolution satellite data. The XFCN is trained on a large sample of globally distributed slums, located in cities of Cape Town, Caracas, Delhi, Lagos, Medellin, Mumbai, Nairobi, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Shenzhen. Slums in these cities are greatly heterogeneous in its morphological feature space and differ to a varying degree to formal settlements. Transfer learning can help to improve segmentation results when learning on a variety of slum morphologies, with high F1 scores of up to 89%.

T2  - IMPLICIT RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1960s there has been a considerable increase in the number of Canadians who identify as having "no religion". The increase in the nonreligious notwithstanding, little is known about the beliefs, values, and practices of the nonreligious and what might generally entail a "worldview" commonly understood as nonreligion. Nonreligion therefore remains somewhat of a quagmire to sociologists of religion. This lack of understanding is particularly prevalent in the realm of law, particularly Canadian law as the Supreme Court of Canada has yet to define nonreligion as it has done religion. Drawing on the results of the discourse analysis of the Supreme Court of Canada's 2013 Bedford decision this article seeks to explore the category of nonreligion as it is conceptualized in legal discourse about sex work. This article takes into consideration the changing religious and nonreligious diversity of Canadian society and argues that nonreligion is, like religion, framed as having its own positive content.

TI  - Impact of GPS Processing on the Estimation of Snow Water Equivalent Using Refracted GPS Signals
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) antennas buried underneath a snowpack have a high potential for in situ snow water equivalent (SWE) estimation. Automated and continuous SWE quantification independent of weather conditions could enhance snow hydrological monitoring and modeling. Accurate and reliable in situ data are needed for the calibration and validation of remote sensing data and snowpack modeling. A relative bias of less than 5 is achieved using sub-snow global positioning system (GPS) antennas (GPS refractometry) during a three full seasons time period in the Swiss Alps. A systematic overview regarding the temporal reliability of the sub-snow GPS derived results is, however, missing for this emerging technique. Moreover, GPS processing impacts the results significantly. Different GPS processing parameters are therefore selected and their influence on the SWE estimation is investigated. The impact of elevation-dependent weighting, the elevation cutoff angles, and the time intervals for SWE estimation are systematically assessed. The best results are achieved using all observations with an elevation-dependent weighting scheme. Moreover, the SWE estimation performance is equally accurate for hourly SWE estimation as for lower temporal resolutions up to daily estimates. The impact of snow on the coordinate solution is furthermore evaluated. While the east and north components are not systematically influenced by the overlying snowpack, the vertical component exhibits a significant variation and strongly depends on the SWE. The biased vertical component therefore provides an additional possibility to estimate SWE.

AB  - Based on regular studies performed in the coastal waters of the Black Sea within the area of the Sevastopol and Southern Coast of Crimea for the first time during the period from 2000 to 2010, the seasonal dynamics of the ratio between organic carbon and chlorophyll a (C/Chl a) in phytoplankton within the surface layer (0-0.5 m) were analyzed. The maximal values of this parameter (234 +/- 139) were observed in summer and the minimal values (56 +/- 23) - in winter. Intermediate values of C/Chl a were registered during spring and autumn. The main reasons for the variability of this ratio are the factors of light, nutrients, and the phytoplankton cell's taxonomic structure and size variability. The results obtained should be considered when developing regional algorithms for calculating the C/Chla ratio based on satellite data.

AB  - The article considers the problem of the correlation interaction of value orientations of the social ideal with the imperatives of the economic sphere of social reproduction. Awareness of the social ideal by society is nothing more than an awareness of the path of one's own civilizational development in general and of the methods of economic production as well. Potential opportunities and models of social ideals are projected onto a complex of methods of economic interaction. The economic ideal is a spiritual-worldview category and is recognized by society as an image of truth, goodness, culture. The economic system is a special sociocultural phenomenon, which on the one hand is organizationally included in the spiritual and moral potential of society, and on the other hand, it is initially influenced by its cultural priorities.

AB  - The article is an analysis of a text by a well-known Polish mountaineer in the context of "mountain" literature (mountaineering, climbing). It is a specific subcultural literature that sits between non-fiction and autobiographical literature, written by mountaineers for mountaineers and lovers of this specific sport. The text points to the uniqueness of Chinese maharaja within the ranks of typical mountaineering literature (creative narrative, specific worldview, broad audience).

AB  - High-resolution global-scale estimates of aboveground biomass density will soon be available from a suite of space-borne LiDAR and radar missions. The 2016-2017 AfriSAR campaign was specifically designed to evaluate a suite of sensors for estimating biomass in a range of tropical forest environments. Here, we compare the calibration and biomass estimates from 5 different active sensors - ALOS Global Digital Surface Model (DSM), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), NASA Land Vegetation Ice Sensor (LVIS), and TanDEM-X (TDX) - in the tallest known mangrove forest on Earth - Pongara National Park, Gabon. We leverage this comparison to evaluate the implications for future satellite missions that are aimed at improving global estimates of forest carbon storage. Our findings are directly relevant for space-borne missions estimating terrestrial carbon storage - GEDI, ICESat-2, NISAR, BIOMASS, Tandem-X, and Tandem-L - highlighting the specific uncertainty and bias that can be expected in several global biomass products in mangrove ecosystems.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article explores the worldview features of the Sinitic civilization, and China is its core. There is given an illustration of the system-forming role of mentioned worldview distinctions in the complex of public relations in modern Chinese society. In particular, this research analyzes those fundamental historicalcultural and legal-philosophic conditions that have been influencing upon the Chinese outlook formation, in respect of lifestyle inside China and the world conception outside. It is demonstrated how the worldview features of the Sinitic civilization can be implemented in the PRC contemporary social space, with its specific social practice. The worldview factors affect the development of the entire social relations system of today's China, but there are two specific subsystems - an ideological sphere, and a legal one. These two realms appear as the most illustrative environment for Sinitic features, which the article focuses on.

AB  - For 25 years the Corona reconnaissance satellite mission has been declassified, making available an unprecedented historic archive of very high spatial resolution panchromatic images acquired during the cold war era. During the same time, Bulgaria has observed a decreasing and ageing population and a slow agricultural productivity. In this study, we attempt to map the settlements around the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria based on textural analysis of a Corona image acquired in 1968. We compare the results with information derived from recent Sentinel-2B and Landsat-8 images. We discuss on the discerning capability of the Corona image in mapping settlements and the potential usability of textural analysis in the context of land use and land cover mapping of historical images. Overall, we present the textural analysis of an image from one of the first satellite missions and report on the potential for feature extraction from such primitive satellite products.

TI  - M. MAETERLINCK'S ART IN F. SOLOGUB'S RECEPTION
T2  - IZVESTIYA URALSKOGO FEDERALNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-GUMANITARNYE NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with the history of the artistic dialogue between F. Sologub and M. Maeterlinck and singles out stages of Sologub's perception of the Belgian author's oeuvre. The article refers to writings by Maeterlinck (the original physiophilosophical essay The Life of the Bee, poems translated by Sologub, and The Blue Bird play) and by Sologub (articles and reviews, plays The Gift of Wise Bees, The Night Dances). The first step of reception included reading and translating original texts into Russian. In Sologub's personal library, there were volumes by Maeterlinck in French and in Russian; in his archives, there are unpublished translations of poems; in addition, there is a probability that Sologub participated in the translations of plays made by his wife An. Chebotarevskaya. The next stage implied references to Maeterlinck's art in journalistic works (including the article The Wisdom of Maeterlinck). In Sologub's opinion, one of the fundamental principles of Maeterlinck's art was the idea of an inseparable connection between love and death. The intertextual links between Sologub's The Gift of Wise Bees and Maeterlinck's The Life of the Bee are allusions to the images of bees, honey, and wax, which become metaphors of life, love, and art, respectively in the Russian play. The concept of "dialogue" was particularly important for Sologub's art: according to him, a genuine writer can only create within the scope of previous works of art, and his primary task is to be selective and able to "see" and use the material of their own. In this paper, the author suggests the idea that Sologub started writing plays under the influence of Maeterlinck's writings and his concept of the new theatre. Then there was a new level of artistic communication: almost simultaneously two plays were created and staged in Russia (one by Sologub and the other by Maeterlinck). The two plays are typologically similar: both have a symbolic central image, life-affirming spirit, magic assistants, and a circular plot structure. The author of the article puts forward a hypothesis that translation can become a catalyst of interconnection at such a sophisticated level when two writers have a similar worldview and tend to create within the same aesthetics, as The Blue Bird and The Night Dances resemble tendencies within a common paradigm of creative thinking.

TI  - Land consumption in Italy
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper illustrates a land consumption map for Italy (year 2017) at a scale 1:1,300,000, and the assessment of its changes (2012-2017). We define land consumption as the replacement of a non-artificial land cover to an artificial land cover, both permanent and no-permanent. The maps are a 10 m spatial resolution raster, produced by photointerpretation of very high resolution images and semiautomatic classification of high resolution remote sensing images. An overall accuracy of 97.7% for the map of 2012 and of 99.66% for the map of 2017 was obtained. The results suggest that the method proposed is appropriate to detect land consumption, both for the urban densification and for the sprawling phenomena, from national to local level. Furthermore, because of the high spatial resolution and the classification scheme adopted, it is suitable for an effective monitoring system, compared to other existing classification systems or monitoring programs.

TI  - Dimensionality Reduction and Feature Selection for Object-Based Land Cover Classification based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping Earth's surface and its rapid changes with remotely sensed data is a crucial task to understand the impact of an increasingly urban world population on the environment. However, the impressive amount of available Earth observation data is only marginally exploited in common classifications. In this study, we use the computational power of Google Earth Engine and Google Cloud Platform to generate an oversized feature set in which we explore feature importance and analyze the influence of dimensionality reduction methods to object-based land cover classification with Support Vector Machines. We propose a methodology to extract the most relevant features and optimize an SVM classifier hyperparameters to achieve higher classification accuracy. The proposed approach is evaluated in two different urban study areas of Stockholm and Beijing. Despite different training set sizes in the two study sites, the averaged feature importance ranking showed similar results for the top-ranking features. In particular, Sentinel-2 NDVI, NDWI, and Sentinel-1 VV temporal means are the highest ranked features and the experiment results strongly indicated that the fusion of these features improved the separability between urban land cover and land use classes. Overall classification accuracies of 94% and 93% were achieved in Stockholm and Beijing study sites, respectively. The test demonstrated the viability of the methodology in a cloud-computing environment to incorporate dimensionality reduction as a key step in the land cover classification process, which we consider essential for the exploitation of the growing Earth observation big data. To encourage further research and development of reliable workflows, we share our datasets and publish the developed Google Earth Engine and Python scripts as free and open-source software.
