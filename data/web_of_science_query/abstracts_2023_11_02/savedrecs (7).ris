TI  - Assessment of Changes of Complex Shoreline from Medium-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The imagery collected by medium-resolution earth-observing satellites is a powerful and cost-effective tool for the quantitative assessment of shoreline dynamics for water bodies of different spatial scales. In this study, we utilize imagery collected in 1984-2021 on the Middle Peninsula, Virginia, bordering the Chesapeake Bay, USA, by medium-resolution (10-30 m) satellites Landsat-5/7/8 and Sentinel-2A/B. The data was managed in the Earth Analytics Interoperability Lab (EAIL) Data Cube built and configured by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO, Australia and Chile). The assessments of shoreline change demonstrate adequate agreement with assessments based on aerial photography collected during 1937-2009 by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, with reasonable disagreement attributed to the differences in the analyzed periods and in the accuracy of land/water edge detection. Most of the studied coastline was subject to land loss (erosion), in some locations exceeding 3 m year(-1), usually along low-lying sandy beaches. The shoreline segments with man-made structures such as marinas, bulkheads, revetments, and offshore breakwaters demonstrated a significantly lower range of changes as compared to natural reaches. Regular analysis of medium-resolution satellite imagery appears to be an effective method for routine assessment of shoreline changes along the land/water edge.

A1  - African Intussusception
TI  - Evaluation of Intussusception Following Pentavalent Rotavirus Vaccine (RotaTeq) Administration in 5 African Countries
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background A low-level risk of intussusception following rotavirus vaccination has been observed in some settings and may vary by vaccine type. We examined the association between RotaTeq vaccination and intussusception in low-income settings in a pooled analysis from 5 African countries that introduced RotaTeq into their national immunization program.Methods Active surveillance was conducted at 20 hospitals to identify intussusception cases. A standard case report form was completed for each enrolled child, and vaccination status was determined by review of the child's vaccination card. The pseudo-likelihood adaptation of self-controlled case-series method was used to assess the association between RotaTeq administration and intussusception in the 1-7, 8-21, and 1-21 day periods after each vaccine dose in infants aged 28-245 days.Results Data from 318 infants with confirmed rotavirus vaccination status were analyzed. No clustering of cases occurred in any of the risk windows after any of the vaccine doses. Compared with the background risk of naturally occurring intussusception, no increased risk was observed after dose 1 in the 1-7 day (relative incidence = 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.47-8.03) or the 8-21 day window (relative incidence = 0.77; 95%CI = 0.0-2.69). Similarly, no increased risk of intussusception was observed in any risk window after dose 2 or 3.Conclusions RotaTeq vaccination was not associated with increased risk of intussusception in this analysis from 5 African countries. This finding mirrors results from similar analyses with other rotavirus vaccines in low-income settings and highlights the need for vaccine-specific and setting-specific risk monitoring.The risk of intussusception following rotavirus vaccination may vary by vaccine type and socioeconomic status. In a pooled analysis of data from 5 countries in Africa, RotaTeq vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of intussusception.Graphical Abstract

TI  - Ideal marker for targeted axillary dissection (IMTAD): a prospective multicentre trial
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTargeted axillary dissection (TAD) is an established method for axillary staging in patients with breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). TAD consists of sentinel lymph node biopsy and initially pathological lymph node excision, which must be marked by a reliable marker before NAC.MethodsThe IMTAD study is a prospective multicentre trial comparing three localisation markers for lymph node localisation (clip + iodine seed, magnetic seed, carbon suspension) facilitating subsequent surgical excision in the form of TAD. The primary outcome was to prospectively compare the reliability, accuracy, and safety according to complication rate during marker implantation and detection and marker dislodgement.ResultsOne hundred eighty-nine patients were included in the study-in 135 patients clip + iodine seed was used, in 30 patients magnetic seed and in 24 patients carbon suspension. The complication rate during the marker implantation and detection were not statistically significant between individual markers (p = 0.263; p = 0.117). Marker dislodgement was reported in 4 patients with clip + iodine seed localisation (3.0%), dislodgement did not occur in other localisation methods (p = 0.999). The false-negativity of sentinel lymph node (SLN) was observed in 8 patients, the false-negativity of targeted lymph nodes (TLN) wasn & PRIME;t observed at all, the false-negativity rate (FNR) from the subcohort of ypN + patients for SLN is 9.6% and for TLN 0.0%.ConclusionThe IMTAD study indicated, that clip + iodine seed, magnetic seed and carbon suspension are statistically comparable in terms of complications during marker implantation and detection and marker dislodgement proving their safety, accuracy, and reliability in TAD. The study confirmed, that the FNR of the TLN was lower than the FNR of the SLN proving that the TLN is a better marker for axillary lymph node status after NAC.

TI  - LiaX is a surrogate marker for cell-envelope stress and daptomycin non-susceptibility in Enterococcus faecium.
T2  - bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Daptomycin (DAP) is often used as a first line therapy to treat vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VR Efm ) infections but emergence of DAP non-susceptibility threatens the effectiveness of this antibiotic. Moreover, current methods to determine DAP MICs have poor reproducibility and accuracy. In enterococci, DAP resistance is mediated by the LiaFSR cell membrane stress response system and deletion of liaR encoding the response regulator results in hypersusceptibility to DAP and antimicrobial peptides. The main genes regulated by LiaR are a cluster of three genes, designated liaXYZ . In Enterococcus faecalis , LiaX is surface exposed with a C-terminus that functions as a negative regulator of cell membrane remodeling and an N-terminal domain that is released to the extracellular medium where it binds DAP. Thus, in E. faecalis , LiaX functions as a sentinel molecule recognizing DAP and controlling the cell membrane response, but less is known about LiaX in E. faecium . Here, we found that liaX is essential in E. faecium ( Efm ) with an activated LiaFSR system. Unlike E. faecalis , Efm LiaX is not detected in the extracellular milieu and does not appear to alter phospholipid architecture. We further postulated that LiaX could be used as a surrogate marker for cell envelope activation and non-susceptibility to DAP. For this purpose, we developed and optimized a LiaX ELISA. We then assessed 86 clinical E. faecium BSI isolates for DAP MICs and used whole genome sequencing to assess for substitutions in LiaX. All DAP-R clinical strains of E. faecium exhibited elevated LiaX levels. Strikingly, 73% of DAP-S isolates by standard MIC determination had elevated LiaX ELISAs above the established cut-off. Phylogenetic analyses of predicted amino acid substitutions showed 12 different variants of LiaX without a specific association with DAP MIC or LiaX ELISA values. Our findings also suggest that many Efm isolates that test DAP susceptible by standard MIC determination are likely to have an activated cell stress response that may predispose to DAP failure. As LiaX appears to be essential for the cell envelope response to DAP, its detection could prove useful to improve the accuracy of susceptibility testing by anticipating therapeutic failure.

TI  - A blended TROPOMI CGOSAT satellite data product for atmospheric methane using machine learning to correct retrieval biases
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations of dry-column methane mixing ratios (XCH4) from shortwave infrared (SWIR) solar backscatter radiation provide a powerful resource to quantify methane emissions in service of climate action. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), launched in October 2017, provides global daily coverage at a 5.5 X 7 km(2) (nadir) pixel resolution, but its methane retrievals can suffer from biases associated with SWIR surface albedo, scattering from aerosols and cirrus clouds, and across-track variability (striping). The Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) instrument, launched in 2009, has better spectral characteristics and its methane retrieval is much less subject to biases, but its data density is 250 times sparser than TROPOMI. Here, we present a blended TROPOMI CGOSAT methane product obtained by training a machine learning (ML) model to predict the difference between TROPOMI and GOSAT co-located measurements, using only predictor variables included in the TROPOMI retrieval, and then applying the correction to the complete TROPOMI record from April 2018 to present. We find that the largest corrections are associated with coarse aerosol particles, high SWIR surface albedo, and across-track pixel index. Our blended product corrects a systematic difference between TROPOMI and GOSAT over water, and it features corrections exceeding 10 ppb over arid land, persistently cloudy regions, and high northern latitudes. It reduces the TROPOMI spatially variable bias over land (referenced to GOSAT data) from 14.3 to 10.4 ppb at a 0.25 degrees X 0.3125 degrees resolution. Validation with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) ground-based column measurements shows reductions in variable bias compared with the original TROPOMI data from 4.7 to 4.4 ppb and in single-retrieval precision from 14.5 to 11.9 ppb. TCCON data are all in locations with a SWIR surface albedo below 0.4 (where TROPOMI biases tend to be relatively low), but they confirm the dependence of TROPOMI biases on SWIR surface albedo and coarse aerosol particles, as well as the reduction of these biases in the blended product. Fine-scale inspection of the Arabian Peninsula shows that a number of hotspots in the original TROPOMI data are removed as artifacts in the blended product. The blended product also corrects striping and aerosol/cloud biases in single-orbit TROPOMI data, enabling better detection and quantification of ultra-emitters. Residual coastal biases can be removed by applying additional filters. The ML method presented here can be applied more generally to validate and correct data from any new satellite instrument by reference to a more established instrument.

TI  - Can inflammatory indices predict sentinel lymph node status in patients with early-stage breast cancer?
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer research has focused on the early detection and treatment of breast cancer. Axillary lymph node status is essential for primary breast cancer staging, recurrence, and survival. The current quest for precision medicine is to identify predictive markers that offer the advantage of individualized treatment options. This study aimed to investigate the value of inflammatory indices in predicting positive sentinel nodes in breast cancer. We studied 602 patients with early-stage breast cancer who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB) at the Bulent Ecevit University General Surgery Clinic. We obtained data, including the clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients, such as age, histological type, and sentinel lymph nodes. Neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, and monocyte counts were obtained from preoperative complete blood count test data from the patient registry. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), systemic inflammatory index (SII), and sentinel lymph node biopsy were analyzed. Sentinel LAP was negative in 391 (65%) patients and positive in 211 (35%). In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, no significant difference was found between SLNB positivity and negativity in terms of NLR, PLR, LMR, or SII. In contrast to previous research, NLR, PLR, LMR, or SII did not affect SLNB positivity prediction in our study.

TI  - A novel cloud detection method based on segmentation prior and multiple features for Sentinel-2 images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds in Sentinel-2 images seriously affect its usage in various fields, such as agricultural production and environmental monitoring. Although cloud masks have been provided in Sentinel-2 products, the stability of cloud detection accuracy may be affected by different types of underlying surfaces. This study presents a novel cloud detection method for Sentinel-2 images based on segmentation prior and multiple features. In the presented method, spectral, texture, and exponential features are extracted to enhance the difference between clouds and underlying surfaces. Meanwhile, segmentation results are regarded as priors to constrain pre-classification results to improve the edge accuracy of cloud detection and to obtain detection results with low false alarm rate and low omission rate. Experiments on the Sentinel-2 image dataset show that the presented method achieves good and stable cloud detection results, and the accuracy of cloud detection for six underlying surface types (impervious areas, water, croplands, bare lands, snow & ice, and forest) are above 0.93. These findings demonstrate that the presented method has the potential to effectively improve the stability of cloud detection accuracy while reducing the requirement for the number of samples.

TI  - Long-term outcomes and predictors of recurrence in node-negative early stage breast cancer patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundWe evaluated the outcomes, and risk factors for recurrence in patients with early stage node-negative breast cancer in this study.MethodRetrospective data analysis was done on patient treatment records from 1988 to 2018. The patient's demographic, clinical, pathological, and therapeutic characteristics were noted. To evaluate survival analysis and predictors of recurrence, we employed Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log-rank test.ResultsA total of 357 patients in all were enrolled in the research. At the time of diagnosis, the median age was 50 (with a range of 18-81). A total of 85.5% of patients had undergone a lumpectomy, while 14.5% had a mastectomy. 78.7% of patients had sentinel lymph node biopsy, and 21.3% had axillary lymph node dissection. In addition, the patients received adjuvant radiotherapy (88.7%), adjuvant endocrine therapy (82.1%), and adjuvant chemotherapy (48.5%). Recurrence of the tumor occurred in 31 (8.7%) patients (local recurrence 45.2% and metastatic disease 54.8%). Ten- and twenty-year recurrence-free survival rates were 92% and 77%. 19 (5.3%) patients had also developed contralateral breast cancer. Ten-year survival rates were 91.6%, and 20-year survival rates were 76.6%, respectively. Aged over 65 years (p = 0.004), necrosis (p = 0.002), mitosis (p = 0.003), and nuclear pleomorphism (p = 0.049) were found as statistically significant factors for recurrence in univariate analysis. In the ROC analysis, the largest size of the tumor (over 1.45 cm, p = 0.07) remained outside the statistical significance limit in terms of recurrence.ConclusionsThirty-year outcomes in individuals with early stage, node-negative breast cancer were shown in this study. We found that the recurrence ratios between 10 and 20 years were more frequent than the first 10 years during the follow-up. Despite the small number of patients who experienced a recurrence, we demonstrated that, in univariate analysis, being older than 65 and having some pathological characteristics (nuclear pleomorphism, mitosis, and necrosis) were statistically significant factors for disease recurrence.

TI  - Rejection methods for vegetation mapping using hyperspectral airborne data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation mapping from remote sensing data has proven useful for monitoring ecosystems at local, regional and global scales. Generally based on supervised classification methods, ecosystem mapping needs representative and consistent labelling. Such completeness is often difficult to achieve and requires the exclusion of minority species poorly represented in the studied scene in the training base. This exclusion leads to wrong predictions in the resulting map. In this study, the use of a posteriori classification rejection methods to limit the errors associated with minority species was evaluated in three different mapping scenarios: classification according to vegetation layers, prediction of genera from various vegetation types from low vegetation to trees and mapping of habitat (assemblages of species). For this purpose, several supervised classification methods based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF) and Regularized Logistic Regression (RLR) algorithms were first applied to hyperspectral images covering the reflective domain. On these classifications, the usual evaluation methods (confusion matrix and its derivatives calculated on an independent test set composed of the majority species) showed performances similar to those of the state-of-the-art. However, the introduction of a new score taking into account minority species demonstrated the need to include them in the evaluation process to provide robust performance quantification representing map effectiveness. Three a posteriori rejection methods, based on simple thresholding, K-means and SVM algorithms, were well suited to monitor minority species. The performance gain depended on the mapping scenario, the machine learning model and the rejection method. An increase in performance with the inclusion of minority species of up to 12% could be observed through the new score. These methods also detected a similar proportion of prediction errors associated with predominant species

TI  - Greenery change and its impact on human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka: a model-based assessment using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is a significant conservation issue for Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and an environmental and socioeconomic crisis in elephant range countries, including Sri Lanka. Approximately 14,897 HEC incidents were recorded in Sri Lanka between 2015 and 2021. In this study, we present a Sri Lanka-wide analysis to explore the impact of greenery change on HEC. Our sources were official government data, and land use and land cover maps developed using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. We applied the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and object-based image analysis classifications to classify land cover into six categories. This classification scheme also considered the differences observed in Sri Lanka's woody vegetation, consisting of forest, open forest, paddy fields, homestead gardens, and other crops. Analysis of the accuracies of the three types of classifiers confirmed that the supervised classification with two machine learning algorithms, RF and SVM, delivered a higher level of precision in land cover classification. RF was the best option, with a 97.34% overall accuracy and a 0.94 kappa coefficient, while SVM recorded a 94.68% overall accuracy and a 0.89 kappa coefficient. According to the findings, most HEC incidences were recorded in open forests (54%), while 62% were recorded within 2 km of the forest edge. Results indicated that HEC coincides with the human-occupied changed landscape adjacent to forest reservations and patches. The findings could be valuable for HEC management by identifying areas where elephants are most likely to conflict with humans, and the government may declare these as protected areas. Also, we propose an early warning system as an effective approach that helps detect and monitor elephant herds' movement. Therefore, implementing long-term land use planning is crucial for protecting the forest and natural habitats, restoring elephant habitats, and mitigating HEC by minimizing human encroachment and promoting sustainable land use practices.

TI  - Quantifying wetness variability in aapa mires with Sentinel-2: towards improved monitoring of an EU priority habitat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Aapa mires are waterlogged northern peatland ecosystems characterized by a patterned surface structure where water-filled depressions ('flarks') alternate with drier hummock strings. As one of the EU Habitat Directive priority habitats, aapa mires are important for biodiversity and carbon cycling, harbouring several red-listed species and supporting unique species communities. Due to their sensitivity to hydrological disturbances, reliable, up-to-date and systematic information on the hydrological condition and responses of mires is crucial and required for multiple purposes ranging from carbon exchange modelling to EU Habitats Directive reporting and conservation and ecosystem restoration planning. Here, we demonstrate the usability of Sentinel-2 satellite data in a semi-automatic cloud-based approach to retrieve large-scale information on aapa mire hydrological variability. Two satellite-derived metrics, soil moisture index and the extent of water-saturated surfaces based on pixel-wise classification, are used to quantify monthly and interannual wetness variation between 2017 and 2020 across Natura 2000 aapa mires in Finland, including responses to the extreme drought of 2018. The results revealed high temporal variability in wetness, particularly in the southern parts of the aapa mire zone and generally in the late summer months interannually. Observations from the drought summer showed that one third of usually year-round wet flark surfaces may be exposed to drying during climatic extremes. Responses varied between sites and regions, implicating the significance of environmental factors for drought resistance: some sites maintained high levels of moisture, whereas others lost wet surfaces completely. Our study provides the first comprehensive national-level representation of seasonal and interannual wetness variability and drought-sensitivity of pristine aapa mire sites. The approach and methods used here can be directly upscaled outside protected areas and to other EU countries. Thus, they provide a means for harmonized, systematic large-scale monitoring of this priority habitat, as well as valuable information for other applications supporting peatland conservation and research.

TI  - Perceptions of Controversies and Unresolved Issues in the 2014 FIGO Staging System for Endometrial Cancer: Survey Results From Members of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists and International Gynecologic Cancer Society.
T2  - International journal of gynecological pathology : official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Long-standing controversial and unresolved issues in the current "International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics" staging system for endometrial cancer are well-recognized by pathologists and clinicians alike and exist primarily as a result of limitations to the existing literature. To guide the design of future outcome-based studies specifically aimed at resolving such gaps, the International Society of Gynecologic Pathologists developed a survey of the current perceptions of pathologists (n = 172) and clinicians (n= 135) from the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists and from the International Gynecologic Cancer Society on areas for potential refinement of the current International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system. The highest priority issues for pathologists and clinicians alike were the need to determine whether stage IIIA patients (ovarian/fallopian tube involvement) can be reliably separated into favorable versus unfavorable outcome groups to avoid over-treatment of the former group and to determine whether stage IIIC patients (lymph node metastases) can be separated into favorable versus unfavorable outcome groups based on the size of lymph node metastases. The majority of pathologists and clinicians viewed lymphovascular space invasion as an independent prognostic variable and favored incorporating lymphovascular space invasion into staging, though the level of support did not meet the threshold of 75% in support that we used to define a formal consensus. While pathologists did agree on the prognostic value of reporting the extent of lymphovascular space invasion, there was no consensus on the diagnostic criteria to distinguish focal versus substantial involvement. The majority of pathologists and clinicians viewed that a universally accepted protocol for sentinel lymph node ultra-staging is lacking. Both survey groups conveyed a slight preference for incorporating tumor histotype and molecular classification into staging but the support was short of the 75% threshold for formal consensus. Collectively, this survey permits the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists to develop a pathologist and clinician-driven long-term strategy for prioritizing and designing outcome-based studies specifically targeted to resolving controversial and unresolved issues in the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging of endometrial cancer.

TI  - Exploring the capability of high-resolution satellite data in delineating the potential distribution of common invasive alien plant species in the Tshivhase Tea Estate
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive alien plants (IAPs) continue to exert significant impacts on agriculture in many countries, resulting in food insecurity. IAPs reduce agricultural production through competition and parasitism with planted crops. More recently, the IAPs continue to extend their plasticity to tea plantations, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. This study thus aimed at exploring the potential of SPOT 7 and Sentinel 2 satellite data in mapping the occurrence and co-occurrence of three common IAPs Solanum mauritianum, Lantana camara, and Chromolaena odorata in the Tshivhase Tea Estate in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The stepwise logistic regression models were generated for Solanum mauritianum and Lantana camara occurrence as well as the observed and conditional co-occurrence probability of S. mauritianum (P1), L. camara (P2) and C. odorata (P3). From the remote sensing indices, the Brightness Index (BI) was significant in most SPOT 7 stepwise logistic regression models at p<0.05 whereas the blue, red, and near infrared (NIR) bands and standard deviation (STDv) variables were significant at p<0.05 in most of the Sentinel 2 models. The SPOT 7 model performed Sentinel-2 models, thus resulting in the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96 for the conditional co-occurrence of S. mauritianum (P1) and L. camara (P2). The Sentinel 2 model yielded an AUC of 0.83. The SPOT 7 model performed superior in mapping the conditional co-occurrence of S. mauritianum and L. camara than the Sentinel 2 model. These results suggest that high spatial resolution satellite images like SPOT 7 can delineate the potential distribution of IAPs in the tea plantation and thus assisting in management strategies geared towards IAP's elimination and control.

TI  - Performance-Aware Big Data Management for Remote Sensing Systems
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Remote sensing data, whose dimensions increase exponentially and turn into big data with the new technologies, cause significant difficulties in transferring, storing, and processing because of consisting of gigantic coarse-grained files. This article proposes a novel two-phase big data management system on the geo-distributed private cloud that takes advantage of network topology and resource utilization in a distributed manner. The system optimizes resource allocation to facilitate efficient and extensive data analysis for remote sensing applications by minimizing file fragmentation, resulting in faster analysis. In order to simulate the proposed system, different network topologies are created using virtual machines. Moreover, the proposed method named performance-aware assignment is compared with well-known methods such as random assignment, Hungarian algorithm, and Hadoop Distributed File System, also famous in the big data era. The experimental results indicate that performance-aware assignment outperforms random assignment, Hungarian algorithm, and Hadoop Distributed File System, achieving 36%, 26%, and 71% more stored data, respectively, within the same time while also exhibiting lower IOPS values. In addition, it optimizes resource usage in data centers, which is particularly important for preventing resource exhaustion.

TI  - Spatial enhanced spatiotemporal reflectance fusion model for heterogeneous regions with land cover change
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous spatiotemporal fusion models have been developed to fuse dense time-series data with a high spatial resolution for monitoring land surface dynamics. Nonetheless, enhancing spatial details of fused images, eliminating the obvious 'plaque' phenomenon and image blurring in fused images, and developing relatively simple and 1 easy-to-implement algorithms remain a challenge for spatiotemporal fusion algorithms. Therefore, this paper presents a newly proposed spatial enhanced spatiotemporal reflectance fusion model (SE-STRFM) for image fusions in heterogeneous regions with land cover change. The SE-STRFM model predicts temporal changes of reflectance in sub-pixel details based on the spectral unmixing theory, and allocates reflectance changes caused by abrupt land cover change in fine-resolution images with a relatively simple algorithm and easy implementation. SE-STRFM only needs one pair of input data, comprising one fine-resolution image and one coarse-resolution image, to achieve high-precision reflectance prediction with spatial details. To verify the reliability and applicability of the SE-STRFM, we use Landsat image and simulated MODIS-like image to fuse high spatial and temporal resolution images and select two study areas with heterogeneous landscape and land cover type change for fusion experiments and accuracy evaluation. The results show that the images fused by SE-STRFM have clearer spatial details and a more accurate spectral distribution compared with those fused by the most widely used STARFM, ESTARFM and FSDAF. In two study areas with heterogeneous landscape and land cover type change, compared with STARFM, ESTARFM and FSDAF, the RMSE of SE-STRFM is 10.52%, 28.39% and 6.58% lower on average, respectively; r is 3.67%, 10.33% and 1.65% higher on average, respectively; AAD is 9.05%, 24.58% and 7.29% lower on average, respectively; and SSIM is 3.16%, 10.16% and 1.92% higher on average, respectively. SE-STRFM can accurately capture temporal changes with spatial details and effectively predict abrupt land-cover changes.

TI  - Green colonialism and decolonial feminism: A study of Wayúu women's resistance in La Guajira
T2  - HUMAN RELATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This qualitative study scrutinises how green energy investment affects Indigenous Wayuu people in Colombia's La Guajira region. Employing coloniality of power and decolonial feminism frameworks, we delve into Wayuu women's struggles and resilience in defending territories against large-scale wind energy projects. Our findings suggest that governments and businesses are 'tuned in' to the economic benefits of these projects, yet 'tuned out' from Indigenous peoples' ontologies, concerns, needs and cosmovisions. This dynamic prompts questions about the unintended consequences of organisations' engagement with Indigenous peoples through corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies. Despite good intentions, CSR practices that are 'tuned out' from Indigenous peoples' cosmovisions may inadvertently reinforce power imbalances and further marginalise Indigenous communities. Our study highlights the need to honour Indigenous territories and protect Indigenous women's rights in long-term investments. Clean energy focus can mask green colonialism, which Wayuu women actively safeguard, upholding Indigenous worldviews via feminist decoloniality. We advocate for businesses to incorporate diverse perspectives beyond the dominant western worldview into their climate change mitigation actions and CSR strategies, and for public policies to balance decarbonisation efforts with Indigenous rights to contribute to sustainable and equitable energy transitions.

TI  - Ozone and water vapor variability in the polar middle atmosphere observed with ground-based microwave radiometers
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leveraging continuous ozone and water vapor measurements with the two ground-based radiometers GROMOS-C and MIAWARA-C at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard (79ffi N, 12ffi E) that started in September 2015 and combining MERRA-2 and Aura-MLS datasets, we analyze the interannual behavior and differences in ozone and water vapor and compile climatologies of both trace gases describing the annual variation of ozone and water vapor at polar latitudes. A climatological comparison of the measurements from our ground-based radiometers with reanalysis and satellite data was performed. Overall differences between GROMOS-C and Aura-MLS ozone volume mixing ratio (VMR) climatology are mainly within 7% throughout the middle and upper stratosphere and exceed 10% in the lower mesosphere (1-0.1 hPa) in March and October. For the water vapor climatology, the average 5% agreement is between MIAWARA-C and Aura-MLS water vapor VMR values throughout the stratosphere and mesosphere (100-0.01 hPa). The comparison to MERRA-2 yields an agreement that reveals discrepancies larger than 50% above 0.2 hPa depending on the implemented radiative transfer schemes and other model physics. Furthermore, we perform a conjugate latitude comparison by defining a virtual station in the Southern Hemisphere at the geographic coordinate (79ffi S, 12ffi E) to investigate interhemispheric differences in the atmospheric compositions. Both trace gases show much more pronounced interannual and seasonal variability in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. We estimate the effective water vapor transport vertical velocities corresponding to upwelling and downwelling periods driven by the residual circulation. In the Northern Hemisphere, the water vapor ascent rate (5 May to 20 June in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2021 and 15 April to 31 May in 2019 and 2020) is 3.4 1.9mms 1 from MIAWARA-C and 4.6 1.8mms 1 from AuraMLS, and the descent rate (15 September to 31 October in 2015-2021) is 5.0 1.1mms 1 from MIAWARA-C and 5.4 1.5mms 1 from Aura-MLS at the altitude range of about 50-70 km. The water vapor ascent (15 October to 30 November in 2015-2021) and descent rates (15 March to 30 April in 2015-2021) in the Southern Hemisphere are 5.2 0.8 and 2.6 1.4mms 1 from Aura-MLS, respectively. The water vapor transport vertical velocities analysis further reveals a higher variability in the Northern Hemisphere and is suitable to monitor and characterize the evolution of the northern and southern polar dynamics linked to the polar vortex as a function of time and altitude.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The present work evaluates the impact of land use changes in one of the important capital cities of Central India to understand the relation between land use practices and urbanization on the increasing trend of land surface temperature. Therefore, quantify the spatial changes in land use land cover (LULC) and Urban Heat Island (UHI) of the Bhopal city over 12 years (2008 to 2020) carried out considering multi-temporal satellite and field data. The Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS sensors were used to estimate the physical changes such as land use, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), normalized differential built-up index (NDBI), Land Surface Temperature (LST) and co-relate their interrelationship. It was found that the built-up area increased by 12.57% from 2008 to 2020, and vegetation increased by 15.95% from 2008 to 2020. It was also found that the bare rocky region has converted to vegetation by 22.95%. The Pearson coefficient between LST with NDBI was found to be 0.55 to 0.79. Pearson coefficient for NDVI association with LST was found to be negative, which varies between - 0.4 and - 0.7. The build-up area increase has been strongly influenced by the conversion of fallow land (5.84%) and bare rocky regions (22.92). Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) has also been calculated and found to be 4 & DEG;C higher in 2020 than in 2008. Overall, based on these findings, it is recommended to prioritize effective urban planning and land use policies that promote sustainable development and mitigate the adverse effects of increasing LST on the urban environment.

TI  - Transcription termination factor rho polymerizes under stress.
T2  - bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Bacterial RNA helicase rho is a genome sentinel that terminates synthesis of damaged and junk RNAs that are not translated by the ribosome. Co-transcriptional RNA surveillance by rho is essential for quality control of the transcriptome during optimal growth. However, it is unclear how bacteria protect their RNAs from overzealous rho during dormancy or stress, conditions common in natural habitats. Here we used cryogenic electron microscopy, biochemical, and genetic approaches to show that residue substitutions, ADP, or ppGpp promote hyper-oligomerization of Escherichia coli rho. Our results demonstrate that nucleotides bound at subunit interfaces control rho switching from active hexamers to inactive higher-order oligomers and extended filaments. Polymers formed upon exposure to antibiotics or ppGpp disassemble when stress is relieved, thereby directly linking termination activity to cellular physiology. Inactivation of rho through hyper-oligomerization is a regulatory strategy shared by RNA polymerases, ribosomes, and metabolic enzymes across all life.

TI  - Regional climate trend analyses for Aqua MODIS land surface temperatures
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is the skin surface temperature of the Earth's land surface and is an essential climate variable (ECV) that critically characterizes the Earth's climate and surface energy processes. This is the first regional trend analysis for LST with uncertainties, using a stable LST climate data record suitable for climate trend analyses: the Aqua Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset (MYDCCI) produced in the European Space Agency (ESA) LST Climate Change Initiative (LST_cci) Project. The quality of the trends is verified here for Western Europe, for which consistent trends per decade of 0.5 K and 0.57 K across daytime and night-time data, respectively. Eight regions representative of a range of biomes and, including the Amazon, Western U.S.A., Greenland, the Sahel, Siberia, China, India, and Australia, have been analysed. Our most significant findings show substantial LST increases for Siberia and the Amazon, as well as evidence of recent increasing trends for the Western U.S.A. Siberia showed the most substantial daytime and night-time changes per decade of +0.87 K and +0.93 K, respectively. Furthermore, the Amazon and Western U.S.A. showed significant daytime LST trend increases of +0.82 K and +0.51 K, respectively. Western Europe and Western U.S.A. show the largest night-time change of +0.57 K and +0.54 K, respectively. India presents an atypical time series with a decreasing daytime and increasing night-time trend per decade of -0.62 K and +0.44 K, respectively, consistent with reported air temperatures. Overall the results show significant positive regional LST trends, against a background of both strong seasonal cycles and intermittent disruptive events, which demonstrate the importance of continued LST observations. The results also incentivize remote sensing science to derive ever more rigorous LST datasets and to continue to investigate emissivity and error correlations to allow improved trend analyses for smaller regions and individual locations.

M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the concentration range and penetration depth of methylene blue near-infrared fluorescence imaging, and to clarify the role of methylene blue in oral lymphatic drainage and sentinel lymph node localization, so as to lay a foundation for the potential research and application of sentinel lymph node in oral cancer.METHODS: 10% (mass fraction) methylene blue injection was diluted into 29 different concentrations with 0.9% (mass fraction) normal saline, and the concentration range of methylene blue near-infrared fluorescence imaging was determined by near-infrared fluorescence imager. The maximum penetration depth of methylene blue near-infrared fluorescence was determined by covering pigskin with different thicknesses (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mm) in methylene blue solution. 0.2 mL methylene blue solution was injected into the submucosal 0.5 cm at the lateral margin of tongue on one side of the rats. The near-infrared fluorescence imager was used for continuously monitoring for 3 hours. The first near-infrared fluorescence hotspot was identified as sentinel lymph node and labeled by percutaneous observation. The rats were then sacrificed and dissected in the head and neck. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging was performed again to observe whether the fluorescent tissue was consistent with the labeled fluorescent hotspot in vitro, and the presence of lymphoid tissue was confirmed by pathological examination after resection.RESULTS: Except that no fluorescence signals were detected in the blank control groups, the fluorescence intensity of methylene blue increased first and then decreased with its solution concentration decreased. When the concentration of methylene blue was diluted to the picomole level, the fluorescence signal could still be detected. The maximum penetration depth of methylene blue fluorescence was 4 mm. Methylene blue near-infrared fluorescence could be localized in oral lymphatic drainage and sentinel lymph node. The fluorescence was sustained for more than 3 hours after methylene blue injection. Methylene blue solution concentrations of 3.34 mmol/L, 6.68 mmol/L, 13.37 mmol/L and 26.74 mmol/L were selected in the rats to map sentinel lymph node by near-infrared fluorescence.CONCLUSION: Methylene blue near-infrared fluorescence has a certain penetrating ability and can transcuta-neously map the sentinel lymph node and their associated lymphatic vessels in rats, which is expected to be further applied in the study of sentinel lymph node in oral cancer.

TI  - Windthrow damage detection in Nordic forests by 3D reconstruction of very high-resolution stereo optical satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We tested whether windthrow damage to Nordic conifer forest stands could be reliably detected as canopy height decrease between a pre-storm LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) digital surface model (DSM) and a photogrammetric DSM derived from a post-storm WorldView-3 stereo pair. The post-storm ground reference data consisted of field and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) observations of windthrow combined with no-damage areas collected by visual interpretation of the available very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. We trained and tested a thresholding model using canopy height change as the sole predictor. We undertook a two-step accuracy assessment by (1) running k-fold cross-validation on the ground reference dataset and examining the effect of the potential imperfections in the ground reference data, and (2) conducting rigorous accuracy assessment of the classified map of the study area using an extended set of VHR imagery. The thresholding model produced accurate windthrow maps in dense, productive forest stands with a sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 71%, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over 0.7. However, in sparse and high elevation stands, the classification accuracy was poor. Despite certain collection challenges during the winter months in the Nordic region, we consider VHR stereo satellite imagery to be a viable source of forest canopy height information and sufficiently accurate to map windthrow disturbance in forest stands of high to moderate density.

TI  - Protocol for establishing a model for integrated influenza surveillance in Tamil Nadu, India
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential for influenza viruses to cause public health emergencies is great. The World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2005 concluded that the world was unprepared to respond to an influenza pandemic. Available surveillance guidelines for pandemic influenza lack the specificity that would enable many countries to establish operational surveillance plans. A well-designed epidemiological and virological surveillance is required to strengthen a country's capacity for seasonal, novel, and pandemic influenza detection and prevention. Here, we describe the protocol to establish a novel mechanism for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in the four identified districts of Tamil Nadu, India. This project will be carried out as an implementation research. Each district will identify one medical college and two primary health centres (PHCs) as sentinel sites for collecting severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza like illness (ILI) related information, respectively. For virological testing, 15 ILI and 10 SARI cases will be sampled and tested for influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2 every week. Situation analysis using the WHO situation analysis tool will be done to identify the gaps and needs in the existing surveillance systems. Training for staff involved in disease surveillance will be given periodically. To enhance the reporting of ILI/SARI for sentinel surveillance, trained project staff will collect information from all ILI/SARI patients attending the sentinel sites using pre-tested tools. Using time, place, and person analysis, alerts for abnormal increases in cases will be generated and communicated to health authorities to initiate response activities. Advanced epidemiological analysis will be used to model influenza trends over time. Integrating virological and epidemiological surveillance data with advanced analysis and timely communication can enhance local preparedness for public health emergencies. Good quality surveillance data will facilitate an understanding outbreak severity and disease seasonality. Real-time data will help provide early warning signals for prevention and control of influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks. The implementation strategies found to be effective in this project can be scaled up to other parts of the country for replication and integration.

TI  - Exploring the potential of thermal infrared remote sensing to improve asnowpack model through an observing system simulation experiment
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The assimilation of data from Earth observation satellites into numerical models is considered to be the path forward to estimate snow cover distribution in mountain catchments, providing accurate information on the mountainous snow water equivalent (SWE). The land surface temperature (LST) can be observed from space, but its potential to improve SWE simulations remains underexplored. This is likely due to the insufficient temporal or spatial resolution offered by the current thermal infrared (TIR) missions. However, three planned missions will provide global-scale TIR data at much higher spatiotemporal resolution in the coming years.To investigate the value of TIR data to improve SWE estimation, we developed a synthetic data assimilation (DA) experiment at five snow-dominated sites covering a latitudinal gradient in the Northern Hemisphere. We generated synthetic true LST and SWE series by forcing an energy balance snowpack model with the ERA5-Land reanalysis. We used this synthetic true LST to recover the synthetic true SWE from a degraded version of ERA5-Land. We defined different observation scenarios to emulate the revisiting times of Landsat 8 (16 d) and the Thermal infraRed Imaging Satellite for High-resolution Natural resource Assessment (TRISHNA) (3 d) while accounting for cloud cover. We replicated the experiments 100 times at each experimental site to assess the robustness of the assimilation process with respect to cloud cover under both revisiting scenarios. We performed the assimilation using two different approaches: a sequential scheme (particle filter) and a smoother (particle batch smoother).The results show that LST DA using the smoother reduced the normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of the SWE simulations from 61 % (open loop) to 17 % and 13 % for 16 d revisit and 3 d revisit respectively in the absence of clouds. We found similar but higher nRMSE values by removing observations due to cloud cover but with a substantial increase in the standard deviation of the nRMSE of the replicates, highlighting the importance of revisiting times in the stability of the assimilation performance. The smoother largely outperformed the particle filter algorithm, suggesting that the capability of a smoother to propagate the information along the season is key to exploit LST information for snow modelling. Finally, we have compared the benefit of assimilating LST with synthetic observations of fractional snow cover area (FSCA). LST DA performed better than FSCA DA in all the study sites, suggesting that the information provided by LST is not limited to the duration of the snow season. These results suggest that the LST data assimilation has an underappreciated potential to improve snowpack simulations and highlight the value of upcoming TIR missions to advance snow hydrology.

TI  - Saltmarsh Carbon Stock Changes under Combined Effects of Vegetation Succession and Reclamation
T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems have been widely recognized for their carbon sequestration function to mitigate climate changes. However, both natural processes (e.g., interspecific competition) and human activities could alter the ability of blue carbon storage. To clarify the impacts of vegetation succession and reclamation on carbon stock changes, field investigation and laboratory analysis were conducted in a saltmarsh within Hangzhou Bay. Remote sensing data indicated a zonation pattern: the exotic species Spartina alterniflora encroached into the native species Scirpus mariqueter at a rate of 3.51 km(2) a(-1), but S. mariqueter expanded to the front bare mudflat at a rate of 2.51 km(2) a(-1). The carbon stock (1 m in depth) was found to be 85.37 Mg C ha(-1) for the exotic species, 56.52 Mg C ha(-1) for the native species, and 39.78 Mg C ha(-1) for the bare mudflat. The carbon burial rate varied among 3 habitats, from 0.63 Mg C ha(-1) a(-1) in the bare mudflat to 1.39 to 1.59 Mg C ha(-1) a(-1) in the vegetation sites. Within the study area, vegetation succession contributed an additional 4,858 Mg of organic carbon between 2017 and 2020 to the carbon pool. The organic carbon content of the reclamation site showed a considerable reduction, from 8.51 g kg(-1) to 3.34 g kg(-1) after 2 years of reclamation, resulting in an emission of 21.61 Mg C ha(-1). Overall, the vegetation succession increased the carbon stock of the region while reclamation caused a net carbon loss in the saltmarshes. These findings can enrich the cognition to promote blue carbon management in coastal zones.

TI  - Mapping peat thickness and carbon stock of a degraded peatland in West Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Tropical peatlands store a large amount of carbon and act as carbon sinks, thus have crucial roles in regulating climate by preventing CO2 emission and enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the conversion of these peatlands for agricultural purposes, such as oil palm plantations, leads to carbon loss and increased CO2 emissions. To effectively protect and manage vulnerable areas, accurate mapping of peatland thickness and carbon stocks is essential, aligning with Indonesia's National Determined Contribution to climate action. This research article aims to assess the status of peatland in Agam-West Pasaman, Western Sumatra, which was cleared between 1990 and 2000 for oil palm cultivation. Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) approaches were employed to map peat thickness, carbon stock and estimate carbon loss resulting from land use change. The study area, spanning 54,000 hectares, was covered by peat-swamp forest in 1989. A grid of 2 km was used for a soil survey, resulting in 134 observation points of peat thickness, water level and subsidence. Various spatial prediction methods, including geostatistics, machine learning (ML) and their combination, were tested to map peat thickness, carbon stocks, subsidence rate and carbon loss. The covariates considered in the analysis were elevation, nearest distance from rivers and Sentinel 1a radar images. The results obtained through 10-fold cross-validations revealed that ordinary kriging exhibited the best performance, with an R-2 of 0.44 for peat thickness and 0.39 for carbon stocks. The superior performance of ordinary kriging can be attributed to the severe impact of human activities in the area, which disrupted the clear relationship between peat parameters and environmental covariates. The estimated carbon stock of the area was 107 Mt C (std. dev. 0.143 Mt), while the carbon loss since the establishment of oil palm plantations was estimated to be 19.50 Mt C (std. dev. 0.017 Mt C) based on subsidence data. These findings provide insights into the degradation of the peatland and the magnitude of carbon loss over the past three decades. This information supports informed decision-making and contributes to efforts aimed at preserving and restoring peatlands.

TI  - Grazing capacity determination in short-term and long-term scales using MODIS and Sentinel-2 data in the southern rangelands of Zagros, Iran
T2  - RANGELAND JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and updating grazing capacity are necessary due to spatio-temporal variations of production in rangelands as a result of climatic and management changes. This study utilised short- and long-term grazing capacity mapping and monitoring by using satellite images in the rangelands of southern Zagros, Iran. In 2018, production of 16 rangeland types was estimated at spatial scales of 250 and 10 m from MODIS and Sentinel-2 images, and validated with field production data measured at 185 sampling sites through the R-2 coefficient of determination. The production maps, along with the parameters of allowable utilisation of rangeland plant species, animal grazing area, animal daily requirement and length of grazing period, were used to calculate grazing capacity. In addition, the effect of climatic fluctuations on grazing capacity was investigated using the Standard Index of Annual Precipitation (SIAP) index from 2009 to 2018. The production obtained from satellite images varied between 2.4 and 393.2 kg ha(-1) in 2018. The high correlation (80%) between image production maps and field measurements, as well as the significance of these relationships in all rangeland types (P < 0.05), allowed grazing capacity estimation by using satellite-based production. The minimum and maximum grazing capacities in a 100-day period were 1809 and 297 146 animal units (AU) respectively, in 258 387 ha. Grazing capacity monitoring from 2009 to 2018 showed that during a drought period, AUs were about 0.7 ha(-1) below those in years of above-average rainfall. Use of satellite remote-sensing with different spatio-temporal scales therefore appears capable of mapping and monitoring grazing capacity, and can be used as a management tool by rangeland owners and related organisations.

TI  - Nonlinearity of the cloud response postpones climate penalty of mitigating air pollution in polluted regions
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud droplet number concentrations are often assumed to depend linearly on atmospheric aerosols (in log-log space). Here the authors show that this relationship is instead sigmoid, which delays additional warming due to air pollution mitigation by 20-30 years in heavily polluted regions.Aerosol-cloud interactions contribute substantially to uncertainties in anthropogenic forcing, in which the sensitivity of cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) to aerosol plays a central role. Here we use satellite observations to show that the aerosol-N-d relation (in log-log space) is not linear as commonly assumed. Instead, the N-d sensitivity decreases at large aerosol concentrations due to the transition from aerosol-limited to updraft-limited regime, making the widely used linear method problematic. A sigmoidal transition is shown to adequately fit the data. When using this revised relationship, the additional warming that arises from air pollution mitigation is delayed by two to three decades in heavily polluted locations, compared to the linear relationship. This cloud-mediated climate penalty will manifest markedly starting around 2025 in China and 2050 in India after applying the strongest air quality policy, underlining the urgency of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Effects of build orientation and hatch spacing on high-speed milling behavior of L-PBF 316L stainless steel
T2  - MATERIALS TESTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the philosophy of the process, the surface roughness is usually high for the parts produced with laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing (AM). Parts produced by this method need surface quality improvement processes for many applications. One of the methods used for this purpose is high speed machining (HSM). HSM is a modern manufacturing technique that offers several benefits, including improved productivity, enhanced product quality, and reduced production costs. In addition, HSM can improve the quality of finished products by reducing machining errors. In this study, samples produced with 316L powder in size of 10 x 10 x 5 mm using three different hatch spacings (60, 70, 80 mu m) and building orientations (0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees) were produced by L-PBF method, and HSM process was applied to these samples. In this context, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of porosity, microstructure and microhardness properties of 316L samples produced by L-PBF method using different hatch spacings and build orientations on cutting forces, surface roughness and burr formation in HSM. When the numerical values of the cutting forces were analyzed in both x and y directions, it was observed that the greatest cutting force occurred in the x direction. While the Fx force ranged from 6.23 to 9.35 N, the Fy force ranged from 4.88 to 8.27 N. It has been determined that as the build orientation increases at the same hatch spacing value, the cutting forces increase due to the increased porosity ratio.

TI  - The exit of nanoparticles from solid tumours
T2  - NATURE MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanoparticles enter tumours through endothelial cells, gaps or other mechanisms, but how they exit is unclear. The current paradigm states that collapsed tumour lymphatic vessels impair the exit of nanoparticles and lead to enhanced retention. Here we show that nanoparticles exit the tumour through the lymphatic vessels within or surrounding the tumour. The dominant lymphatic exit mechanism depends on the nanoparticle size. Nanoparticles that exit the tumour through the lymphatics are returned to the blood system, allowing them to recirculate and interact with the tumour in another pass. Our results enable us to define a mechanism of nanoparticle delivery to solid tumours alternative to the enhanced permeability and retention effect. We call this mechanism the active transport and retention principle. This delivery principle provides a new framework to engineer nanomedicines for cancer treatment and detection.Nanoparticle retention inside tumours has been associated with lymphatic vessel collapse. It is now shown that nanoparticles exit from solid tumours through lymphatic vessels in or surrounding the tumour by a nanoparticle-size-dependent mechanism.

TI  - Entropy-weight-based spatiotemporal drought assessment using MODIS products and Sentinel-1A images in Urumqi, China
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Drought is one of the most severe natural hazards influenced by many factors, which can in turn cause severe damage to agricultural, economic, social and ecological systems. For assessing drought intensity, early studies have typically used single-factor-based modeling approaches to delineate a specific aspect of drought. In this study, we developed an entropy weight method (named LNPS-EWM) for drought assessment based on MODIS products and Sentinel-1A images, considering four important factors, including land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), potential evapotranspiration (PET), and soil moisture. The new LNPS-EWM method was applied to analyze the spatiotemporal drought patterns in Urumqi for 2018-2021. The results show that LST and PET were the dominant factors, which accounted for about 70% while NDVI and soil moisture only accounted for about 30%. A five-level drought classification shows that severe drought accounts for the largest portion and exceptional drought for the smallest portion. From 2018 to 2021, the Urumqi city center is the most drought-prone area, followed by the low-lying areas, while the southwestern and eastern mountainous areas are in a mild drought. In the central region in the north-south direction, the drought intensity in Urumqi was mitigated from 2018 to 2021. These results are useful for risk assessment, large-scale monitoring, and early warning of drought conditions. This study improves our understanding of drought intensity patterns in arid Northwest China and should help improve regulatory and regional policies to combat drought to maintain eco-friendly cities in other arid regions.

TI  - Confounding effects of snow cover on remotely sensed vegetation indices of evergreen and deciduous trees: An experimental study
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Located at northern latitudes and subject to large seasonal temperature fluctuations, boreal forests are sensitive to the changing climate, with evidence for both increasing and decreasing productivity, depending upon conditions. Optical remote sensing of vegetation indices based on spectral reflectance offers a means of monitoring vegetation photosynthetic activity and provides a powerful tool for observing how boreal forests respond to changing environmental conditions. Reflectance-based remotely sensed optical signals at northern latitude or high-altitude regions are readily confounded by snow coverage, hampering applications of satellite-based vegetation indices in tracking vegetation productivity at large scales. Unraveling the effects of snow can be challenging from satellite data, particularly when validation data are lacking. In this study, we established an experimental system in Alberta, Canada including six boreal tree species, both evergreen and deciduous, to evaluate the confounding effects of snow on three vegetation indices: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), and the chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI), all used in tracking vegetation productivity for boreal forests. Our results revealed substantial impacts of snow on canopy reflectance and vegetation indices, expressed as increased albedo, decreased NDVI values and increased PRI and CCI values. These effects varied among species and functional groups (evergreen and deciduous) and different vegetation indices were affected differently, indicating contradictory, confounding effects of snow on these indices. In addition to snow effects, we evaluated the contribution of deciduous trees to vegetation indices in mixed stands of evergreen and deciduous species, which contribute to the observed relationship between greenness-based indices and ecosystem productivity of many evergreen-dominated forests that contain a deciduous component. Our results demonstrate confounding and interacting effects of snow and vegetation type on vegetation indices and illustrate the importance of explicitly considering snow effects in any global-scale photosynthesis monitoring efforts using remotely sensed vegetation indices.

TI  - Mapping cover crop species in southeastern Michigan using Sentinel-2 satellite data and Google Earth Engine
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cover crops are a critical agricultural practice that can improve soil quality, enhance crop yields, and reduce nitrogen and phosphorus losses from farms. Yet there is limited understanding of the extent to which cover crops have been adopted across large spatial and temporal scales. Remote sensing offers a low-cost way to monitor cover crop adoption at the field scale and at large spatio-temporal scales. To date, most studies using satellite data have mapped the presence of cover crops, but have not identified specific cover crop species, which is important because cover crops of different plant functional types (e.g., legumes, grasses) perform different ecosystem functions. Here we use Sentinel-2 satellite data and a random forest classifier to map the cover crop species cereal rye and red clover, which represent grass and legume functional types, in the River Raisin watershed in southeastern Michigan. Our maps of agricultural landcover across this region, including the two cover crop species, had moderate to high accuracies, with an overall accuracy of 83%. Red clover and cereal rye achieved F1 scores that ranged from 0.7 to 0.77, and user's and producer's accuracies that ranged from 63.3% to 86.2%. The most common misclassification of cover crops was fallow fields with remaining crop stubble, which often looked similar because these cover crop species are typically planted within existing crop stubble, or interseeded into a grain crop. We found that red-edge bands and images from the end of April and early July were the most important for classification accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential to map individual cover crop species using Sentinel-2 imagery, which is critical for understanding the environmental outcomes of increasing crop diversity on farms.

TI  - Combining environmental DNA with remote sensing variables to map fish species distributions along a large river
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Biodiversity loss in river ecosystems is much faster and more severe than in terrestrial systems, and spatial conservation and restoration plans are needed to halt this erosion. Reliable and highly resolved data on the state of and change in biodiversity and species distributions are critical for effective measures. However, high-resolution maps of fish distribution remain limited for large riverine systems. Coupling data from global satellite sensors with broad-scale environmental DNA (eDNA) and machine learning could enable rapid and precise mapping of the distribution of river organisms. Here, we investigated the potential for combining these methods using a fish eDNA dataset from 110 sites sampled along the full length of the Rhone River in Switzerland and France. Using Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images, we generated a set of ecological variables describing both the aquatic and the terrestrial habitats surrounding the river corridor. We combined these variables with eDNA-based presence and absence data on 29 fish species and used three machine-learning models to assess environmental suitability for these species. Most models showed good performance, indicating that ecological variables derived from remote sensing can approximate the ecological determinants of fish species distributions, but water-derived variables had stronger associations than the terrestrial variables surrounding the river. The species range mapping indicated a significant transition in the species occupancy along the Rhone, from its source in the Swiss Alps to outlet into the Mediterranean Sea in southern France. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of combining remote sensing and eDNA to map species distributions in a large river. This method can be expanded to any large river to support conservation schemes.

AB  - Deep learning models have been widely used in hyperspectral images classification. However, the classification results are not satisfactory when the number of training samples is small. Focused on above-mentioned problem, a novel Two-stage Multi-dimensional Convolutional Stacked Autoencoder (TMC-SAE) model is proposed for hyperspectral images classification. The proposed model is composed of two sub-models SAE-1 and SAE-2. The SAE-1 is a 1D autoencoder with asymmetric structre based on full connection layers and 1D convolution layers to reduce spectral dimensionality. The SAE-2 is a hybrid autoencoder composed of 2D and 3D convolution operations to extract spectral-spatial features from the reduced dimensionality data by SAE-1. The SAE-1 is trained with raw data by unsupervised learning and the encoder of SAE-1 is employed to reduce spectral dimensionality of raw data. The data after dimension reduction is used to train the SAE-2 by unsupervised learning. The fine-tuning of SAE-2 encoder and the training of classifier are implemented simultaneously with small number of samples by supervised learning. Comparative experiments are performed on three widely used hyperspectral remote sensing data. The extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture can effectively extract deep features and maintain high classification accuracy with small number of training samples.

TI  - A granular iterated local search for the asymmetric single truck and trailer routing problem with satellite depots at DHL Group
T2  - NETWORKS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - To plan the postal deliveries of our industry partner DHL Group (DHL), the single truck and trailer routing problem with satellite depots (STTRPSD) is solved to optimize mail carriers routes. In this application context, instances feature a high number of customers and satellites, and they are based on real street networks. This motivates the study of the asymmetric STTRPSD (ASTTRPSD). The heuristic solution methods proposed in the literature for the STTRPSD can either solve only the symmetric problem variant, or it is unclear whether they can also be used to solve the ASTTRPSD. We introduce an iterated local search, called ILS-ASTTRPSD, which generates different first-level tours in the perturbation phase, and improves the second-level tours in the local search phase. To speed up the search, granular neighborhoods are used. The computational results on instances from the literature prove the capability of ILS-ASTTRPSD to return high-quality solutions. On DHL instances, ILS-ASTTRPSD significantly decreases total travel times of the mail carriers and returns solutions with a different structure compared to the ones provided by DHL. Based on these differences, we give recommendations on how DHL could design more efficient mail carrier practices. Dedicated computational experiments reveal that considering parking and loading times when solving the ASTTRPSD leads to lower travel times, and that ignoring parking times is more counterproductive than ignoring loading times. Moreover, we assess the robustness of our solutions under parking time fluctuations. Finally, we derive properties of instances for which optimal solutions contain multiple second-level tours rooted at the same parking spot and for which the optimal solutions of the ASTTRPSD correspond to the ones of a pure traveling salesman problem.

TI  - An assessment of completeness and medical coding of Medicare Advantage hospitalizations in two national data sets
T2  - HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objective: To compare the Encounter Data System (EDS) and Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) completeness and medical coding of Medicare Advantage hospitalizations.Data Sources: FY 2016-FY 2019 data limited to hospitals paid under Medicare's Inpatient Prospective Payment System.Study Design: Secondary data analysis.Data Collection/Extraction Methods: Completeness of EDS and MedPAR data was estimated using the total number of unique hospitalizations in both data sources as denominator. Deriving this denominator involved matching cases in the EDS and MedPAR by MA enrollee, discharge date, and hospital. The higher the match rate, the more informative the comparison of EDS and MedPAR medical coding of the same hospitalization. EDS and MedPAR codes were assessed for similarity on six measures of Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Group (MS-DRG) assignment and identical diagnosis and procedure codes.Principal Findings: EDS hospitalizations' completeness increased steadily each year from 90% to 93%, driven by the 23 largest Medicare Advantage Organizations, which account for 83% of total cases. MedPAR completeness was relatively stable (89%) and benefited from 91% completeness among the largest hospitals, which are often teaching hospitals and account for 63% of MedPAR cases. By 2019, 97% of medical cases were assigned the same MS-DRG, indicating the high consistency of the severity level coding, since 98% were assigned the same base MS-DRGs, which include all severity levels for the same condition. Without chart reviews, medical cases with identical diagnosis codes increased from 87% to 92%.Conclusions: The EDS has a completeness advantage over MedPAR for studies of non-teaching disproportionate share (DSH) hospitals and individual hospitals generally. MedPAR is only slightly less complete for hospitalizations of teaching DSH hospitals and large hospitals in general. A highly consistent EDS and MedPAR medical coding of matched cases is an important finding since the matched cases are 88% of EDS and 90% of MedPAR cases.

TI  - The limits of the just-too-different argument
T2  - RATIO
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - According to moral non-naturalism, the kind of genuine or robust normativity that is characteristic of moral requirements cannot be accounted for within a wholly naturalistic worldview, but requires us to posit a domain of non-natural properties and facts. The main argument for this core non-naturalist claim appeals to what David Enoch calls the 'just-too-different intuition'. According to Enoch, robust normativity cannot be natural, since it is just too different from anything natural. Derek Parfit makes essentially the same claim under the heading of 'the normativity objection', and several other non-naturalists have said similar things. While some naturalists may be tempted to reject this argument as methodologically or dialectically illegitimate, we argue instead that there are important limits to what the just-too-different intuition can show, even setting all other worries aside. More specifically, we argue that the just-too-different argument will backfire on any positive, independent specification of the distinction between the natural and the non-natural. The upshot is that the just-too-different argument can show significantly less than non-naturalists have suggested.

T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to detect changes that occurred in Ravi River channel over the period of last three decades (1990 to 2020). This paper spatially and temporally assesses the changes and geo-visualize variation of Ravi River using Landsat imageries. The maximum likelihood image classification technique has been used to process and analyze the spatial data in geographic information system (GIS) environment. It was found from the results that vegetation cover has gradually decreased from 976 km(2) in 1990 to 905 km(2) in 2019, whereas the built-up land had increased from 82 to 188 km(2) in the same temporal extent. Generally, the channel is shifted from east to west and the growth of built-up land to towards river which has pushed the channel. Similarly, the extreme discharge also causes change in channel shifting. Minor floods have been occurred after 2010 but Ravi is not affected much as their discharge was not that much higher to put any abrupt or significant effect on Ravi River's channel pattern.

TI  - Prediction model with multi-point relationship fusion via graph convolutional network: A case study on mining-induced surface subsidence
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate prediction of surface subsidence is of significance for analyzing the pattern of mining-induced surface subsidence, and for mining under buildings, railways, and water bodies. To address the problem that the existing prediction models ignore the correlation between subsidence points, resulting in large prediction errors, a Multi-point Relationship Fusion prediction model based on Graph Convolutional Networks (MRF-GCN) for mining-induced subsidence was proposed. Taking the surface subsidence in 82/83 mining area of Yuandian No. 2 Mine in Anhui Province in eastern China as an example, the surface deformation data obtained from 250 InSAR images captured by Sentinel-1A satellite from 2018 to 2022, combined with GNSS observation data, were used for modeling. The deformation pattern of each single observation point was obtained by feeding their deformation observation data into the LSTM encoder, after that, the relationship graph was created based on the correlation between points in the observation network and MRF-GCN was established. Then the prediction results came out through a nonlinear activation function of neural network. The research shows that the R(2)R2 value of MRF-GCN model was 0.865 0, much larger than that of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and other conventional models, while mean square error (MSE) of MRF-GCN model was 1.59 899, much smaller than that of LSTM and other conventional models. Therefore, the MRF-GCN model has better prediction accuracy than other models and can be applied to predicting surface subsidence in large areas.

TI  - Defining Sentinel Injuries of Suspected Child Abuse by Age Using International Classification of Diseases-10: A Delphi Study.
T2  - Pediatric emergency care
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To address child abuse effectively requires accurate assessment of the magnitude of the problem. Although it is difficult to assess the scale of child abuse cases nationwide, it can be estimated through the incidence of sentinel injuries, which are defined as minor but unusual injuries such as bruises or wounds in children of precruising age. Therefore, this study aimed to define disease codes for sentinel injuries by age as a preliminary study to elucidate the incidence of sentinel injuries among patients who visited hospitals nationwide.METHOD: This study was designed using the Delphi method with a structured questionnaire. An extensive literature review was conducted to develop the questionnaire. The 9 participants selected as experts in child abuse were all experienced pediatric emergency medicine specialists working at pediatric emergency medicine training hospitals in South Korea, and 8 participants responded to the first survey. The Delphi method comprised 3 rounds of online surveys using Google Forms and Excel sheet questionnaire via e-mail. Only questions that achieved consensus were selected and assigned a sentinel injury disease code.RESULTS: In total, 105 questions regarding the definition of sentinel injury disease codes were surveyed as to whether they should be included as sentinel injuries, categorized by type (bruises, burns, open wounds/lacerations, and others) and anatomical location. Among them, 5 (62.5%) or more participants agreed on 92 items.CONCLUSIONS: Using the Delphi method, we defined disease codes for sentinel injuries in children aged younger than 12 months, possibly enabling assessment of the incidence of child abuse based on national data. Future research is needed to validate this result and investigate the incidence of sentinel injuries using the defined disease codes and to determine their association with actual cases of child abuse.

TI  - High-Resolution Interseismic Strain Mapping From InSAR Phase-Gradient Stacking: Application to the North Anatolian Fault With Implications for the Non-Uniform Strain Distribution Related to Coseismic Slip Distribution
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution interseismic strain mapping is important for studying faulting behavior and for assessing seismic hazards. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar has been widely applied to measure interseismic deformation along active strike-slip faults. However, phase unwrapping errors and over-smoothing effects limit its ability to map the extremely-high strain due to shallow creep. Here, without the involvement of ground-based measurement, we perform phase-gradient stacking on wrapped Sentinel-1 interferograms to directly map the shear strain rates along the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) with unprecedented resolution. The derived high-resolution strain-rate map reveals five strain-concentrated segments on the NAF, implying shallow creeps. We find that their spatial distribution coincides with the lower coseismic slip of previous earthquakes that occurred since 1939. The proposed method can be applied to other less-studied strike-slip faults to distinguish segments with shallow creep and strong coupling, and thus to better quantify the shallow strain budget and its associated seismic hazards.

TI  - Hyperspectral remote sensing technology for water quality monitoring: knowledge graph analysis and Frontier trend
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Water environment health assessment is one of the vital fields closely related to the quality of human life. The change of material contained in water will lead to the reflectance change of hyperspectral remote sensing data. According to this phenomenon, the water quality parameters are calculated to achieve the purpose of water quality monitoring. Series knowledge graphs in this field are drawn after analyzing 564 publications from WOS (Web of Science) and EI (The Engineering Index) databases since 1994 with the support of VOSviewer and CiteSpace. Including statistics of documents publication time, contribution analysis, the influence of publications and journals, and the influence of funding institutions. It is concluded that the research trend of hyperspectral water quality monitoring is the machine learning algorithm based on UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) hyperspectral instrument data by analyzing scientific research cooperation, keyword analysis, and research hotspots. The whole picture of the research is obtained in this field from four subfields: application scenarios, data sources, water quality parameters, and monitoring algorithms in this paper. It is summarized that the miniaturization, integration, and intelligence of hyperspectral sensors will be the research trend in the next 10 years or even longer. The conclusions have significant reference values for this field.

TI  - Survival after sentinel node biopsy alone in early-stage cervical cancer: a systematic review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - ObjectiveTo assess the oncologic outcomes of sentinel lymph node biopsy alone as part of surgical management in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. MethodsA systematic search of the literature was performed following the PRISMA checklist. MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, and Scopus databases were searched from June 1991 to May 2023. Studies of women with early-stage cervical cancer International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2009 stage IA-IIA, of any age or histology, and articles only in English language were included. After the removal of duplicates, only articles including sentinel node mapping alone compared with full pelvic lymphadenectomy were retained. ResultsFour studies with a total of 2226 patients were included. Among these, 354 (15.9%) underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy alone. A total of 2210 (99.2%) patients had FIGO 2009 stage I disease and 1514 (68%) patients had squamous cell carcinoma. Median body mass index was 25.5 kg/m(2) (range 23.5-27). Lymph vascular space invasion was present in 633 patients (34%) who underwent full lymphadenectomy and in 78 patients (22%) who underwent sentinel node biopsy alone. The results of the survival analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rates of patients who underwent either sentinel biopsy alone or lymphadenectomy. Three-year recurrence-free survival was 93.1% (95% CI 28.3% to 64.7%) for patients who underwent sentinel node biopsy alone and 92.5% (95% CI 39.0% to 53.4%) for patients who underwent sentinel node biopsy and lymphadenectomy (p=0.773). ConclusionsIn patients with early-stage cervical cancer, performing sentinel lymph node biopsy alone compared with pelvic lymphadenectomy does not appear to independently confer a higher risk or recurrence.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Water scarcity is developing in the Middle East as a result of the region's growing population and tremendously advanced agricultural and industrial sectors. Saudi Arabia is the Middle East country with the highest water consumption, so there is an urgent need to take action, and new technology advancements in geophysical measurements allow for the monitoring of groundwater. Wadi Ar-Ramah is one region that has witnessed significant agricultural expansion as well as a serious over-exploitation of the groundwater resources that are available there. Depletion rate in groundwater of the Wadi Ar-Ramah basin at eastern Saudi Arabia was determined for the time interval of 04/2002 to 12/2021 using a combination of gravity data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and results of land surface models. The findings are: 1) the average yearly rainfall rate was computed at 87.7 mm yr(-1) over the Wadi Ar-Ramah; 2) the terrestrial water storage variation (Delta TWS) was computed at -1.216 +/- 0.013 cm yr(-1); 3) the GLDAS-derived soil moisture (Delta SMS) was minimal at -0.32 +/- 0.025mmyr(-1); 4) the GRACE-derievd groundwater decreasing rate was calculated at 1.212 +/- 0.012 cm yr(-1); 5) the relief of the ground surface is producing northeasterly streams that carry the minimal surface water to the east; 6) our integrated method provides a repeatable and cost-effective approach.

TI  - Symbiotic bacteria, immune-like sentinel cells, and the response to pathogens in a social amoeba
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Some endosymbionts living within a host must modulate their hosts' immune systems in order to infect and persist. We studied the effect of a bacterial endosymbiont on a facultatively multicellular social amoeba host. Aggregates of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum contain a subpopulation of sentinel cells that function akin to the immune systems of more conventional multicellular organisms. Sentinel cells sequester and discard toxins from D. discoideum aggregates and may play a central role in defence against pathogens. We measured the number and functionality of sentinel cells in aggregates of D. discoideum infected by bacterial endosymbionts in the genus Paraburkholderia. Infected D. discoideum produced fewer and less functional sentinel cells, suggesting that Paraburkholderia may interfere with its host's immune system. Despite impaired sentinel cells, however, infected D. discoideum were less sensitive to ethidium bromide toxicity, suggesting that Paraburkholderia may also have a protective effect on its host. By contrast, D. discoideum infected by Paraburkholderia did not show differences in their sensitivity to two non-symbiotic pathogens. Our results expand previous work on yet another aspect of the complicated relationship between D. discoideum and Paraburkholderia, which has considerable potential as a model for the study of symbiosis.

TI  - National quantifications of methane emissions from fuel exploitation using high resolution inversions of satellite observations
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing methane emissions from fossil fuel exploitation (oil, gas, coal) is an important target for climate policy, but current national emission inventories submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are highly uncertain. Here we use 22 months (May 2018-Feb 2020) of satellite observations from the TROPOMI instrument to better quantify national emissions worldwide by inverse analysis at up to 50 km resolution. We find global emissions of 62.7 & PLUSMN; 11.5 (2 & sigma;) Tg a(-1) for oil-gas and 32.7 & PLUSMN; 5.2 Tg a(-1) for coal. Oil-gas emissions are 30% higher than the global total from UNFCCC reports, mainly due to under-reporting by the four largest emitters including the US, Russia, Venezuela, and Turkmenistan. Eight countries have methane emission intensities from the oil-gas sector exceeding 5% of their gas production (20% for Venezuela, Iraq, and Angola), and lowering these intensities to the global average level of 2.4% would reduce global oil-gas emissions by 11 Tg a(-1) or 18%.High-resolution satellite data enables a unique verification of national methane emissions worldwide. Global estimates are 63 Tg a(-1) for oil-gas, 30% higher than the UNFCCC reports due to under-reporting by four largest emitters, and 33 Tg a(-1) for coal, consistent with previous estimates.

TI  - Evaluating the driving forces of spectral inversion methods used for assessing water quality parameters in Poyang Lake, China
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality parameters are key indicators of quality of water and can indicate the algal biomass and eutrophication in lakes. Therefore, this study spectrally inverted and evaluated the water quality of the Poyang Lake in China by analysing the differences between the measured water quality parameters and the observed image spectra of Sentinel-2 remote sensing. This analysis was done using statistical regression models (SRMs) and various machine learning models (e.g., support vector machine [SVM] and random forest [RF]). The following major conclusions were drawn: (1) nutrients accumulated more in summer (June-August) than in winter (December-February). For example, in local areas of the main river, total nitrogen (TN) concentration reached 3.4 mg/L in summer of 2016, whereas total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were below 0.052 mg/L in winters of 2016 and 2017. (2) The three models, SRM, RF and SVM, achieved good results in the inversions of Secchi depth and permanganate index. However, differences were noted in the inversions of other parameters. For example, the goodness-of-fit (r(2)) between the inversion and measured values of TN concentration from RF was 0.81, while that from SR was 0.73. (3) The spatial distribution patterns of the water quality parameters showed differences. The ammoniacal nitrogen concentration was higher in the central region than that in the western region of the lake, whereas TP concentration was higher at the shoreline of the lake at 0.07 mg/L on 2 April 2017 but was relatively low in the main channel.

TI  - Rubber leaf fall phenomenon linked to increased temperature
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding phenological responses of vegetation to temperature have become increasingly important as the global climate changes. We examined how changes in temperature may be associated with the occurrence of rubber leaf fall, a new phenomenon affecting many rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations. Spatial and temporal characteristics of the start and end of the rubber season for six study areas from four major rubber-producing countries were investigated using satellite imagery and 10 years of surface temperature data from 2010 to 2019. These study areas were Palembang (1154 ha) in South Sumatra, Indonesia; Medan (2667 ha) in North Sumatra, Indonesia; Ratnapura (581 ha) in Sri Lanka; Johor (195 ha) in Malaysia; Kedah (803 ha) in Malaysia; and Tboung Khmum (2421 ha) in Cambodia. Our results showed that there was a significant upward trend in average mean temperature for Palembang, Medan, Ratnapura and Johor, and that these trends were associated with a statistically significant difference in rubber defoliation and refoliation events. This shift also coincides with the reported occurrence of Rubber Leaf Fall disease from these study areas. In contrast, no change in temperature trends or phenological shift was identified for the two other study areas, and the disease was not reported in these areas. Overall, warming resulted in delayed phenological timing in most locations. While additional research is required to exclude alternative explanations, there is a strong possibility that climate change is responsible for the emergence of the new Rubber Leaf Fall disease.

TI  - Elevated Mast Cell Abundance Is Associated with Enrichment of CCR2+Cytotoxic T Cells and Favorable Prognosis in Lung Adenocarcinoma
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mast cells constitute indispensable immunoregulatory sentinel cells in the tumor microenvironment. A better understanding of the regulation and functions of mast cells in lung adenocarci-noma (LUAD) could uncover therapeutic approaches to repro-gram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Here, we performed flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of patient LUAD samples to comprehensively characterize LUAD-infiltrating mast cells. Mast cells exhibited functional heterogeneity and were enriched in LUAD with ground-glass opacity features (gLUAD). The mast cells in gLUAD exhibited proinflammatory and chemotactic properties while those in radiologically solid LUAD (sLUAD) were associ-ated with tumor angiogenesis. Mast cells were an important source of CCL2 and correlated with the recruitment of CCR2+ CTL, a specific subcluster of preexhausted T cells with tissue-resident memory phenotype and enhanced cytotoxicity. Increased infiltration of mast cells and CCR2+ CTLs and their colocalization showed a strong association with favorable prognosis after sur-gery but were not associated with improved survival after che-motherapy. Collectively, these findings reveal a key role of mast cells in LUAD and their potential cross-talk with CTLs, suggesting that targeting mast cells may be an immunotherapeutic strategy for LUAD.Significance: Comprehensive characterization of mast cells in lung adenocarcinoma elucidates their heterogeneity and identifies interplay between mast cells and CCR2+ T cells that is associated with a favorable prognosis.

TI  - Improved outcome in penile cancer with radiologically enhanced stratification protocol for lymph node staging procedures: a study in 316 inguinal basins with a mean follow-up of 5 years
T2  - BMC UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundLymph node metastasis is the main determinant of survival in penile cancer patients. Conventionally clinical palpability is used to stratify patients to Inguinal Lymph node dissection (ILND) if clinically node positive (cN +) or Dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB) if clinically node negative (cN0). Studies suggest a false negative rate (FNR) of around 10% (5-13%) for DSNB. To our knowledge there are no studies reporting harder end point of survival and outcomes of all clinically node positive (cN +) patients. We present our outcome data of all patients with penile cancer including false negative rates and survival in both DSNB and ILND groups.MethodsOne hundred fifty-eight consecutive patients (316 inguinal basins), who had lymph node surgery for penile cancer in a tertiary referral centre from Jan 2008 to 2018, were included in the study. All patients underwent ultrasound (US) & PLUSMN; fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and then MRI/ CT, if needed, to stage their disease. We used combined clinical and radiological criteria (node size, architecture loss, irregular margins) to stratify patients to DSNB vs ILND as opposed to clinical palpability alone.Results11.2% i.e., 27/241 inguinal basins had lymph node positive disease by DSNB. 54.9% i.e., 39/71 inguinal basins (IBs) had lymph node-positive disease by ILND. 4 inguinal basins with no tracer uptake in sentinel node scans are being monitored at patient's request and have not had any recurrences to date.With a mean follow-up of 65 months (range 24-150), the false-negative rate (FNR) for DSNB is 0%. Judicious uses of cross-sectional imaging necessitated ILND in 2 inguinal basins with non-palpable nodes and negative US with false positive rate of 6.3% (2/32) for ILND. The same cohort of DSNB patients might have had 11.1% (3/27) FNR if only palpability criteria was used. 43 (28%) patients who did require cross sectional imaging as per our criteria had a low node positive rate of 4.7% (p = 0.03). Mean cancer specific survival of all node-positive patients was 105 months.ConclusionThe performance of DSNB improved with enhanced radiological stratification of patients to either DSNB or ILND. We for the first time report the comprehensive outcome of all lymph node staging procedures in penile cancer.

TI  - Literature and Modern Japanese Urbanism: Features of the Traditional Worldview in a Modern Space
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This article was aimed to study the demonstration of urban images as topographic or background effects for depicting the social reality of life in large megacities. The research considered four literary works of Japanese and Chinese writers, namely the manga 'Hanzawa Naoki' (2020) by Jun Ikeido, the novel 'Convenience Store Woman' (2016) by Sayaka Murata, the manga 'Tokyo Ghoul' (2011) by Sui Ishida, and the Chinese novel 'Northern Girls' (2004) by Sheng Keyi. It was found that each literary work demonstrated the symbolism of the urban platform, on which specific cultural and social rules were formed (in the Japanese sense, the term 'joshiki' was used). So, there was a certain transformation of the Japanese traditional worldview to a mutually beneficial life activity, which can lead to marginalization. The study results also showed that the folklore images of Japanese yokai have transformed in the fantasy genre as metaphorical social roles that lack a sense of tolerance and liberality in the context of modern society.

TI  - A monthly 1° resolution dataset of daytime cloud fraction over the Arctic during 2000-2020 based on multiple satellite products
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The low accuracy of satellite cloud fraction (CF) data over the Arctic seriously restricts the accurate assessment of the regional and global radiative energy balance under a changing climate. Previous studies have reported that no individual satellite CF product could satisfy the needs of accuracy and spatiotemporal coverage simultaneously for long-term applications over the Arctic. Merging multiple CF products with complementary properties can provide an effective way to produce a spatiotemporally complete CF data record with higher accuracy. This study proposed a spatiotemporal statistical data fusion framework based on cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching and the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) method to produce a synthetic 1 degrees x 1 degrees CF dataset in the Arctic during 2000-2020. The CDF matching was employed to remove the systematic biases among multiple passive sensor datasets through the constraint of using CF from an active sensor. The BME method was employed to combine adjusted satellite CF products to produce a spatiotemporally complete and accurate CF product. The advantages of the presented fusing framework are that it not only uses the spatiotemporal autocorrelations but also explicitly incorporates the uncertainties of passive sensor products benchmarked with reference data, i.e., active sensor product and ground-based observations. The inconsistencies of Arctic CF between passive sensor products and the reference data were reduced by about 10%-20% after fusing, with particularly noticeable improvements in the vicinity of Greenland. Compared with ground-based observations, R-2 increased by about 0.20-0.48, and the root mean square error (RMSE) and bias reductions averaged about 6.09% and 4.04% for land regions, respectively; these metrics for ocean regions were about 0.05-0.31, 2.85 %, and 3.15 %, respectively. Compared with active sensor data, R-2 increased by nearly 0.16, and RMSE and bias declined by about 3.77% and 4.31 %, respectively, in land; meanwhile, improvements in ocean regions were about 0.3 for R-2, 4.46% for RMSE, and 3.92% for bias. The results of the comparison with ERA5 and the Meteorological Research Institute - Atmospheric General Circulation model version 3.2S (MRI-AGCM3-2-S) climate model suggest an obvious improvement in the consistency between the satellite-observed CF and the reanalysis and model data after fusion. This serves as a promising indication that the fused CF results hold the potential to deliver reliable satellite observations for modeling and reanalysis data. Moreover, the fused product effectively supplements the temporal gaps of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-based products caused by satellite faults and the data missing from MODIS-based products prior to the launch of Aqua, and it extends the temporal range better than the active product; it addresses the spatial insufficiency of the active sensor data and the AVHRR-based products acquired at latitudes greater than 82.5 degrees N. A continuous monthly 1 degrees CF product covering the entire Arctic during 2000-2020 was generated and is freely available to the public at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7624605 (Liu and He, 2022). This is of great importance for reducing the uncertainty in the estimation of surface radiation parameters and thus helps researchers to better understand the Earth's energy imbalance.

TI  - Enhanced snow cover mapping using object-based classification and normalized difference snow index (NDSI)
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The study aims to improve the classification and mapping of snow cover over the Himalayan region, which is essential for assessing water availability and understanding hydrological and climatic interactions. The normalized difference snow index (NDSI) is a traditional digital classification method for snow cover mapping. However, it is not always effective in differentiating snow from other features such as water bodies and shadows of mountain hills. In this study, an improved methodology for snow cover mapping was developed using an object-based classification with NDSI and normalized difference water index (NDWI) over segmented objects instead of pixels to separate snow and water with reduced noise. Shepherd segmentation was used to generate spatially homogeneous objects associated with ground cover features. The study focused on the Chandra basin in Himachal Pradesh, India, using an Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-P6) LISS-III optical image from 30-09-2016. The developed framework was tested using an object-based NDSI classification and further improved with an object-based NDSI-NDWI classification and validated against a manually digitized snow cover map. Validation showed that the object-based NDSI-NDWI classification provided a significant improvement in snow cover mapping compared to traditional NDSI classification, reducing the overestimation of snow-covered areas by up to 6.14%. The developed methodology was executed in the Python environment with efficient computing power. This study demonstrates that an integrated analysis of object-based classification with NDSI and NDWI, can significantly improve snow cover mapping by separating non-snow features. The results of this study show that they have the potential to be extended to larger regions with snow cover.

TI  - Ocher deposit prospecting using object-based image analysis of WorldView-3 VNIR data: A case study in Hormuz Island southern Iran
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping lithological units and conducting mineral exploration in a relatively short time and at a reduced cost, requires high -resolution satellite data and state-of-the-art image processing approaches and methods. In this regard, the current paper aims to test an integration of visible-near infrared imagery from WorldView-3 (WV-3) and object-based classification for mapping potential deposits of ocher in Hormuz Island, southern Iran. A combination of field observations, spectroscopy, microscopic mineralogy, and geochemical-based XRD and XRF analyses were conducted on the samples collected throughout the study area. The reflectance and absorption fea-tures of the ocher were extracted from spectroscopic measurements of samples from well-known ocher mines at the area, and were then convolved to the WV-3 bands. Results showed that the spectral characteristics of ocher are governed by iron oxides and clay minerals with a presence of distinct strong absorption and high reflectance features in the 510-625 nm and 630-745 nm wavelength regions, respectively. These features are complemented by molecular vibration processes of water O-H intramolecular stretching and H-O-H bending that generate absorption features in the 1440-1940 nm region. Additional absorption features in the 2210-2300 nm are most likely due to the Al-OH and CO3-2 vibrations. The absorptions centered at 480 nm, 540 nm, and 820 nm correspond to bands 2, 3, and 7 of the WV-3, respectively, whereas the high reflectance feature centered near 700 nm corresponds to band 6. These four bands, which were considered as index bands of ocher in this study, were used to assign the segmentation weights and to create the thresholds during image processing. Brightness, density, compactness, and homogeneity features were the primary factors for selecting the training areas in the index bands. The ocher-rich areas were enhanced by using a two-stepapproach of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and image classification, for suitable threshold selection. The information about the feature variables of the ocher within the image and litho -logical object hierarchy were obtained to evaluate the features of ocher deposits. Information extracted from the index bands provided an important description of the object features, including mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum pixel values, hue, saturation, and intensity, while the training areas obtained information from the three known ocher mines. Considering the fixed numerical range of ocher mines as a reference, the fixed numerical range of general and specific features of ocher in index bands of WV-3 were achieved. The numerical ranges of pixels were used for creating threshold conditions when applying the "assign class" algorithm in bands 2, 3, and 7 are 815-975 nm, 930-1052 nm, and 1721-1904 nm, respectively. The presented OBIA approach shows a high potential with an overall accu-racy of 88 % to discriminate deposits of ocher based on compatibility between ocher mines and identified ocher-bearing pixels.& COPY; 2023 COSPAR.

TI  - Urban feature shadow extraction based on high-resolution satellite remote sensing images
T2  - ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous increase in the resolution of high-resolution remote sensing satellite images, shadows have increasingly impacted feature target recognition and classification in images, urban reconstruction, and image interpretation. Although various shadow detection methods exist for different features, undetected small shadowed areas, misclassified dark areas, and highlighted non-shadowed areas remain. Moreover, it is still difficult to distinguish waters from shadowed regions owing to their similar characteristics. To further solve these problems, we propose a novel mixed shadow detection index (MSDI) for extracting urban feature shadows, using the original information of the first principal component that contains the differences between most of the different objects in the image, as well as the difference features in the shadowed areas and water bodies. We evaluated the effectiveness and robustness of our method by conducting comparison experiments using Gaofen-1, Gaofen-2, and WorldView-3 images from different scenes, times, and acquisition locations. Through visual analysis and data analysis of our method, we found that the method achieved excellent shadow detection results, with an average total accuracy 94% for shadow detection. The proposed shadow detection algorithm could accurately recognize waters, and it could also accurately recognize easily missed small shadowed areas and easily confused non-shadowed areas.& COPY; 2023 THE AUTHORS.

TI  - Earth observation approach for targeting stratiform deposit of manganese in central India
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The stratiform manganese deposits, hosted within the Sausar Group of rocks, in Madhya Pradesh state of India, has undergone polyphase deformation and metamorphism. The region is an enterprising geosite to understand the lithological and tectonic control on manganese mineralization. We have carried out a conjugate remote sensing based analysis using Visible, Near Infrared and Short Wave Infrared bands (VIS-NIR-SWIR) of optical imagery from multiple sensors supplemented with analysis of L-band microwave data over the Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh to delineate prospective areas for manganese exploration, supported by the lab and field-based evidence.The enhanced image products (i.e.band ratios, principal components) and spectral anomaly map derived from Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Sentinel-2B multispectral bands are used to delineate the lithological contrast of the host rock and indicate key locales of mineralization. The geological structures interpreted using the merged product of Advanced Land Observation Satellite Phased Array L-band SAR (ALOS PALSAR -1), Landsat 8 PC bands (2 & 3) and the processed Horizontal Gradient Magnitude (HGM) from advanced satellite gravity model (EIGEN-6C4), illustrates the structural control on the mineralization. The petrological details derived from the host rock samples shows microstructures like micro-folding, foliations, quartz grain elongation etc., thus representing the microscale deformations within the rock units occurring in the area.The lab-based spectral signatures of manganese-bearing host rock was resampled to image spectra and spectral anomaly map using Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM), which shows good correlation with the existing mine locations.The information from remote sensing and lab analysis has been integrated thematically using the knowledge-based Weighted Sum Method (WSM) with existing mine locations as the training dataset. The derived mineral prospect map indicates several new areas of manganese prospectivity which can serve as a guide for detailed future explorations in the region .& COPY; 2023 COSPAR.

TI  - Ensemble learning based on remote sensing data for monitoring agricultural drought in major winter wheat-producing areas of China
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Drought is mainly triggered by the lack of precipitation, which can lead to insufficient water supply for crops thus affecting their growth and development. Reliable drought monitoring is crucial to understanding drought risk and avoiding drought-induced crop yield losses. Based on the Stacking regression method and multiple remotely-sensed drought factors from 2001 to 2017, this study developed an ensemble learning framework for monitoring agricultural drought in major winter wheat-producing areas in China. Stacking used five machine learning algorithms, namely, extreme gradient boosting, support vector regression, extra trees, and multi-layer perceptron, as the base learners to model the relationship between remote sensing drought factors and 1-, 3-, and 6-month standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). In this study, county-level winter wheat yield records and drought maps provided by the Global SPEI database (SPEIbase) were adopted to assess the suitability of Stacking-predicted SPEI drought maps in agricultural drought monitoring. The results show that Stacking outperformed other machine learning algorithms in terms of estimation accuracy, with the highest R-2 value of 0.77 and the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.47. The longer the time scale of model-predicted SPEI, the higher its correlation with detrended winter wheat yields. The comparison with the drought maps of SPEIbase shows that the Stacking-predicted drought maps successfully captured the spatial pattern and intensity change of drought events. The approach presented in the study has good applicability for agricultural drought monitoring and could be extended to the rest of the areas.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Biomass of a Regional Forest Landscape by Integrating Textural and Spectral Variables of Sentinel-2 Along with Ancillary Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is crucial for assessing forest productivity, carbon sequestration, and functional diversity. Integrating optical remote sensing data with field inventory to estimate AGB saturates at high biomass. However, transformed optical imagery is effective in tropical forest AGB estimation, especially for eliminating saturation effects. Recent AGB mapping research uses diverse predictor data fusion and advanced machine learning models. In this research, we extracted texture parameters using the Gray-level co-occurrence Matrix from the first two principal components of Sentinel-2's multispectral bands. We also calculated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Visible Atmospheric Resistance Index, and Leaf Area Index for the analysis. Elevation, slope, and aspect data from SRTM DEM and GEDI-Landsat tree height product were used as ancillary datasets due to their significant impact on AGB. Neighborhood statistics (3 x 3 pixels) of predictor variables were calculated to account surrounding contributions of the focal plot. A total of 60 plots of 0.1 ha were established across the landscape where 70% and 30% of randomly selected plots were used for random forest model development and validation respectively. The final model explained AGB variability significantly (correlation coefficients = 0.72, root mean square error (RMSE) = 69.18 Mg/ha, mean absolute error (MAE) = 58.22 Mg/ha) with an uncertainty observation of 41.3 percent relative RMSE (rRMSE). The study concluded that combinations of texture and spectral variables derived from Sentinel-2 optical imagery along with physical variables are found effective in AGB mapping. The method and obtained results were promising and appeals to its replicability for building a generalized AGB model.

TI  - Validation of ESA-CCI Forest Biomass Products over India: Methodological and Data Challenges and Results
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Forest aboveground biomass (AGB), an essential climate variable, is a major priority for the delivery of usable products from multi-sensor remote sensing data. Recent AGB global products such as ESA-CCI and GlobBiomass could provide critical inputs for carbon sequestration, emission and climate change studies. While these have been developed and tested with global field datasets, very little use of Indian field measurements and validation with Indian observations has been reported. In this study, a database of field measurements was created, of 1 ha (135 plots), clustered plots of 0.1 ha (101 plots) and 582 plot AGB of 0.1-0.04 ha from the published literature and used for validating ESA-CCI 2018 & 2010 and Santoro-2010 (Santoro et al., Earth System Science Data 13:3927-3950, 2021) datasets. Validation of mean AGB for larger areas such as regional and national estimates was carried out with field-based national forest inventory results of Forest Survey of India (FSI), which indicated an RMSE of 13.47 Mg/ha at zone level and a bias of 48.82 Mg/ha for AGB density and 983.96 Mt in AGB pool at national level. The plot-level comparison at 1 ha plots had RMSE of 215 Mg/ha. However, data from smaller plots did not show any correlation with the AGB product. In general, all products exhibited saturation and were unable to capture AGB of plots above 250 Mg/ha. The large area mean AGB was underestimated when compared with national forest inventory results. Expanding the Indian datasets for use in the development and validation of AGB models, updating the global datasets with Indian observations through new data integration approaches is suggested.

TI  - Controlled Human Infection Model for Hepatitis C Virus Vaccine Development: Trial Design Considerations
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The design of a clinical trial for a controlled human infection model (CHIM) to accelerate hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccine development requires careful consideration. The design of a potential approach to HCV CHIM is outlined, involving initial sentinel cohorts to establish the safety and curability of the viral inoculum followed by larger cohorts to establish the spontaneous clearance rate for each inoculum. The primary endpoint would be HCV clearance by 24 weeks post-inoculation, recognizing that the prevention of chronic infection would be the primary goal of HCV vaccine candidates. Additional considerations are discussed, including the populations to be enrolled, the required monitoring approach, indications for antiviral therapy, and the required sample size for different CHIM approaches. Finally, safety considerations for CHIM participants are discussed.

TI  - Flash drought evaluation using evaporative stress and evaporative demand drought indices: a case study from Awash River Basin (ARB), Ethiopia
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Drought is one of the most devastating phenomena that affect the livelihood of most communities in Ethiopia as they have low adaptive capacity. Recent advancements in remote sensing and drought investigations have made it possible to identify a new type of flash drought that has rapid intensification with a short duration (i.e., less than 1 month unlike conventional droughts). This study intends to identify flash drought in the Awash River Basin (ARB) based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data of actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration using Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) and Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) indices. The flash drought result exhibited that agricultural lands, grasslands, vegetation areas, and irrigational croplands along the river were vulnerable to flash drought in the ARB. Using ESI, the area of ARB that experienced flash drought in 2002, 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2015 were 23%, 40%, 20%, 40%, and 24%, respectively. These intense flash drought areas can be used as drought monitoring sites. The flash drought extent of EDDI is more compared to ESI because of ESI's dependency on vegetation coverages and soil moisture. The lowland downstream part of the ARB is highly prone to flash drought, particularly in the major rainy season (MRS) and the last two months of the minor rainy season (mRS). EDDI can discern the onset of flash drought better compared to ESI, but both can be used as a drought early warning mechanisms to minimize agricultural losses and drought-associated risks in the basin.

TI  - Mammalian bioturbation amplifies rates of both hillslope sediment erosion and accumulation along the Chilean climate gradient
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal burrowing activity affects soil texture, bulk density, soil water content, and redistribution of nutrients. All of these parameters in turn influence sediment redistribution, which shapes the earth's surface. Hence it is important to include bioturbation into hillslope sediment transport models. However, the inclusion of burrowing animals into hillslope-wide models has thus far been limited and has largely omitted vertebrate bioturbators, which can be major agents of bioturbation, especially in drier areas.Here, we included vertebrate bioturbator burrows into a semi-empirical Morgan-Morgan-Finney soil erosion model to allow a general approach to the assessment of the impacts of bioturbation on sediment redistribution within four sites along the Chilean climate gradient. For this, we predicted the distribution of burrows by applying machine learning techniques in combination with remotely sensed data in the hillslope catchment. Then, we adjusted the spatial model parameters at predicted burrow locations based on field and laboratory measurements. We validated the model using field sediment fences. We estimated the impact of bioturbator burrows on surface processes. Lastly, we analyzed how the impact of bioturbation on sediment redistribution depends on the burrow structure, climate, topography, and adjacent vegetation.Including bioturbation greatly increased model performance and demonstrates the overall importance of vertebrate bioturbators in enhancing both sediment erosion and accumulation along hillslopes, though this impact is clearly staggered according to climatic conditions. Burrowing vertebrates increased sediment accumulation by 137.8 % +/- 16.4 % in the arid zone (3.53 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) vs. 48.79 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), sediment erosion by 6.5 % +/- 0.7 % in the semi-arid zone (129.16 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) vs. 122.05 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), and sediment erosion by 15.6 % +/- 0.3 % in the Mediterranean zone (4602.69 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) vs. 3980.96 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Bioturbating animals seem to play only a negligible role in the humid zone. Within all climate zones, bioturbation did not uniformly increase erosion or accumulation within the whole hillslope catchment. This depended on adjusting environmental parameters. Bioturbation increased erosion with increasing slope, sink connectivity, and topography ruggedness and decreasing vegetation cover and soil wetness. Bioturbation increased sediment accumulation with increasing surface roughness, soil wetness, and vegetation cover.

AB  - We present the first results of the proof-of-concept phase 2a study of oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor in subjects with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). Three adult subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of CAPS were enrolled and administered 50 mg of ZYIL1 twice daily for 7 days. A total of 5 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 2 subjects. All 5 TEAEs were mild in severity and considered unrelated to the study drug. At steady state, the average plasma concentration and trough concentration ranged from 2.5 to 4.2 and 1.4 to 2.5 & mu;g/mL, respectively. Inflammatory markers and disease activity (physician and patient global assessment score) decreased notably 12 hours post-last dose.

TI  - Prognostic Significance of Sentinel Lymph Node Status in Thick Primary Melanomas (> 4 mm)
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundThe key prognostic factors for staging patients with primary cutaneous melanoma are Breslow thickness, ulceration, and sentinel lymph node (SLN) status. The multicenter selective lymphadenectomy trial (MSLT-I) verified SLN status as the most important prognostic factor for patients with intermediate-thickness melanoma (Breslow thickness, 1-4 mm). Although most international guidelines recommend SLN biopsy (SLNB) also for patients with thick (> 4 mm, pT4) melanomas, its prognostic role has been questioned. The primary aim of this study was to establish whether SLN status is prognostic in T4 melanoma tumors.MethodsData for all patients with a diagnosis of primary invasive cutaneous melanoma of Breslow thickness greater than 1 mm in Sweden between 2007 and 2020 were retrieved from the Swedish Melanoma Registry, a large prospective population-based registry. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model for melanoma-specific survival (MSS) was constructed based on Breslow thickness stratified for SLN status.ResultsThe study enrolled 10,491 patients, 1943 of whom had a Breslow thickness greater than 4 mm (pT4). A positive SLN was found for 34% of these pT4 patients. The 5-year MSS was 71%, and the 10-year MSS was 62%. There was a statistically significant difference in MSS between the patients with a positive SLN and those with a negative SLN (hazard ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval CI 1.6-3.5) for stage T4a and 2.0 (95% CI 1.6-2.5) for satage T4b.ConclusionSentinel lymph node status gives important prognostic information also for patients with thick (> 4 mm) melanomas, and the authors thus recommend that clinical guidelines be updated to reflect this.

TI  - Drivers of suspended sediment dynamics along the shorelines of the Yellow River Delta detected from satellite data
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Total suspended solids (TSS) can be a useful indicator of environmental change in nearshore coastal environments. Understanding the mechanisms of TSS variations in response to environmental drivers is of broad interest for ecology and geomorphology. The Yellow River Delta (YRD) in China is a fragile coastal region that has been affected by human activities and climate change. Here, we investigated TSS along the YRD shoreline over two decades with time-series satellite data (2002-2020). We observed that TSS concentration decreased significantly in nearshore waters (5-m isobath) surrounding the YRD, especially in the LaiZhou Bay. During the same time period, wave height (WH) along the deltaic shoreline and sediment load from the Yellow River have decreased, while sea surface height (SSH) has displayed a positive trend. Our results indicate that WH and SSH play a major role in sediment resuspension and dispersion, while the YSD mildly affected TSS variability along the coast. Monthly bed shear stress triggered by waves was then computed using WH, wave period (WP), and SSH. Bed shear stress and TSS displayed a positive correlation. We concluded that seasonal oscillations in SSH in conjunction with wind waves are responsible for TSS variability in the shallow waters in front of the YRD.

TI  - Remote sensing detection of seagrass distribution in a marine lagoon (Swan Lake), China.
T2  - Optics express
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Seagrass, a submerged flowering plant, is widely distributed in coastal shallow waters and plays a significant role in maintaining marine biodiversity and carbon cycles. However, the seagrass ecosystem is currently facing degradation, necessitating effective monitoring. Satellite remote sensing observations offer distinct advantages in spatial coverage and temporal frequency. In this study, we focused on a marine lagoon (Swan Lake), located in the Shandong Peninsula of China which is characterized by a large and typical seagrass population. We conducted an analysis of remote sensing reflectance of seagrass and other objectives using a comprehensive Landsat satellite dataset spanning from 2002 to 2022. Subsequently, we constructed Seagrass Index I (SSI-I) and Seagrass Index II (SSI-II), and used them to develop a stepwise model for seagrass detection from Landsat images. Validation was performed using in situ acoustic survey data and visual interpretation, revealing the good performance of our model with an overall accuracy exceeding 0.90 and a kappa coefficient around 0.80. The long-term analysis (2002-2022) of the seagrass distribution area in Swan Lake, generated from Landsat data using our model, indicated that the central area of Swan Lake sustains seagrass for the longest duration. Seagrass in Swan Lake exhibits a regular seasonal variation, including seeding in early spring, growth in spring-summer, maturation in the middle of summer, and shrinkage in autumn. Furthermore, we observed an overall decreasing trend in the seagrass area over the past 20 years, while occasional periods of seagrass restoration were also observed. These findings provide crucial information for seagrass protection, marine blue carbon studies, and related endeavors in Swan Lake. Moreover, our study offers a valuable alternative approach that can be implemented for seagrass monitoring using satellite observations in other coastal regions.

T2  - GERMAN LIFE AND LETTERS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In the Third Reich, ideas about Heimat became entwined with racial fantasies about blood and soil. This article investigates the dynamics and consequences of this development based on a study of the kinship network of Annemarie and Heinrich Brenzinger from Freiburg (Breisgau). The Brenzingers subscribed to a 'volkisch' worldview which conceptualised Heimat as a refuge for kinship groups connected to their locality through lineage. While volkisch groups assisted the Nazi regime in amplifying a fascistic discourse which predated the dictatorship, they also influenced the culture of the Third Reich according to their own ideas. The Nazi regime accepted their activities as part of a transformation of society which required civil engagement. A contrasting reading of Heimat is found in the letters of the Jewish members of this kinship network who were forced from their homeland. It is further elucidated by emigre writers who carefully avoided the volkisch aspects of the Heimat narrative and employed alternative definitions of belonging. By historicising the concepts of Heimat contained in the family collection of the Brenzingers, this article sheds light on the narrowing of the Heimat discourse in Nazi Germany and recovers some of the marginalised voices that resisted it.

TI  - Deriving particulate backscattering coefficient at 400 nm from small-scale optically shallow waters using Landsat-8 data: a case study at Luhuitou Peninsula, Sanya
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The particulate backscattering coefficient (bbp) plays an important role in the growth of coral reefs by influencing the light field conditions. Small-scale optically shallow waters are commonly found in coastal fringing reefs, making it challenging to monitor the spatial and temporal patterns accurately using Aqua satellites with a low spatial resolution. In this study, six existing optimization-based algorithms for deriving bbp at 400 nm (bbp(400)) were evaluated with three simulated Landsat-8 (spatial resolution = 30 m) data sets and in situ data from the Luhuitou Peninsula, Sanya. The comparison results indicated that the HOPE (hyperspectral optimization process exemplar) (Fix-H-error or Fix-H-error-free) algorithm which sets an input value of the water depth alone outperformed other algorithms. However, the estimated bbp(400) from all the algorithms tended to be either overestimated and underestimated due to the improper the spectral shape value of the backscattering coefficient. The HOPE (Fix-H-error) algorithm estimatedbbp(400) from in situ reflectance also had a good correlation with the in situ total suspended particle concentrations data derived-bbp(400), with a correlation coefficient of 0.83. Therefore, the HOPE (Fix-H-error) algorithm was selected to estimate the bbp(400) from satellite-based Landsat-8 data of the Luhuitou Peninsula, Sanya. Time-series (2014-2021) results from these Landsat-8 images reveal the seasonal variation of bbp(400). The bbp(400) was low from May to September every year. From October to December or January, bbp(400) had an increasing trend, and then it decreased until May. Spatial analysis indicated that bbp(400) decreased with increasing water depth. The spatial and temporal patterns of bbp(400) were consistent with in situ observations reported in the literature. This study preliminarily showed the efficiency of an optimization-based algorithm in deriving bbp(400) in small-scale optically shallow water region using Landsat-8 data.& COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing with Ground-based Observations to Quantify the Effects of an Extreme Freeze Event on Black Mangroves (<i>Avicennia germinans</i>) at the Landscape Scale
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Climate change is altering the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Quantifying ecosystem responses to extreme events at the landscape scale is critical for understanding and responding to climate-driven change but is constrained by limited data availability. Here, we integrated remote sensing with ground-based observations to quantify landscape-scale vegetation damage from an extreme climatic event. We used ground- and satellite-based black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) leaf damage data from the northern Gulf of Mexico (USA and Mexico) to examine the effects of an extreme freeze in a region where black mangroves are expanding their range. The February 2021 event produced coastal temperatures as low as - 10 & DEG;C in some areas, exceeding thresholds for A. germinans damage and mortality. We used Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data to assess vegetation greenness before and after the freeze, along with ground-based observations of A. germinans leaf damage. Our results show a negative, nonlinear threshold relationship between A. germinans leaf damage and minimum temperature, with a temperature threshold for leaf damage near - 6 & DEG;C. Satellite-based analyses indicate that, at the landscape scale, damage was particularly severe along the central Texas coast, where the freeze event affected > 2000 ha of A. germinans-dominated coastal wetlands. Our analyses highlight the value of pairing remotely sensed data with regional, ground-based observations for quantifying and extrapolating the effects of extreme freeze events on mangroves and other tropical, cold-sensitive plants. The results also demonstrate how extreme freeze events govern the expansion and contraction of mangroves near northern range limits in North America.

TI  - Voicing the Terrestrial: Theory of the Lyric and the Pressures of the Anthropocene
T2  - JOURNAL OF LITERARY THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present essay, I argue that lyric ecopoetry is particularly suited to alter our worldview in favor of a more ecologically-aware stance. In itself this position has been announced by numerous ecocritics, with some doubts as to its adequacy expressed by Timothy Clark in his Ecocriticism on the Edge. Partly in response to his critique, it is here argued that poems do offer a viable way of altering human modes of thinking not by what or how they evoke but by the way in which they register in the reader's consciousness. To this effect, I depart from the theories of the lyric advanced in the last two decades by the likes of Jonathan Culler, Derek Attridge and the poet Don Patterson, all of whom argue that lyric poetry differs from any other form of linguistic expression in being itself the event it evokes rather than a representation of an event. This is because by dint of being performed by readers, lyric poems compel one to embrace the voices that comprise them as one's own, as a result helping one interiorize an experience of ultimate otherness. It is this modus of poetry's existence that makes it a particularly apt literary form for impelling one to appreciate the complexity of and one's imbrication in the networks of planetary ecosystems. In this way, as I claim further on, poetry may be conceived of as a vehicle for instilling a form of thinking that Bruno Latour has recently theorized as Terrestrial. For him, the Terrestrial is characterized by what he calls the system of engendering, a way of dwelling in the interrelated systems of the Earth that is reciprocally beneficial for human and non-humans. After an overview of Latour's idea, which is put forward as a potential political platform, and its relation to the extant theories of environmental humanities that emphasize poetry's role in conjuring the awareness of the intricacy of natural processes, I suggest that lyric poetry offers not only a means of linguistic expression of the interdependence of all elements in any given ecosystem but also constitutes a language capable of swaying human modes of thinking in favor of the Terrestrial.

TI  - Response of water-use efficiency to phenology in the natural forest and grassland of the Loess Plateau in China
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) is an integrated physiological metric for the coupling cycle between terrestrial carbon, water, and energy. How WUE responds to vegetation phenology (e.g., SOS, EOS-start, end of growing season, and GSL-growing season length) shifting in temperate semi-arid regions is a hot spot in relative research fields. Based on remote-sensing products and in-situ measured climate data, this study discussed how gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and WUE (quantified by GPP/ET) would change with the altering vegetation phenology and climate in the untouched semi-arid forests and grasslands of the Chinese Loess Plateau during 2001-2020. Our results show that vegetation tended to green-up earlier and brown-down later from 2001 to 2020, causing an extended GSL. The forests had an earlier SOS, later EOS, and longer GSL than the grasslands, but the latter had a bigger variation amplitude. The WUE in the study area decreased significantly during spring and summer, while the grassland WUE increased in autumn; the annual mean reduction rate in grassland WUE was approximately twice that of woodland. Earlier SOS could increase forest WUE but reduce grassland WUE in spring, mainly because leaf unfolding has a more pronounced limitation on soil evaporation beneath the forest canopy. EOS had less impact on WUE, and no apparent difference existed between these two ecosystems. Climate change could affect WUE directly by changing GPP and ET and indirectly by regulating vegetation phenology. Warming can increase GPP and ET, causing an earlier SOS, further promoting GPP and ET (except forest ET). Precipitation significantly affected forest GPP and ET in spring, grassland GPP and ET in summer, and grassland ET in autumn; precipitation affects spring grassland WUE mainly via regulating SOS. Enhanced solar radiation could suppress grassland GPP in spring, promote forest ET in autumn, and regulate grassland WUE by affecting phenology. This study is meaningful for improving the process-based vegetation model and studying arid and semi-arid ecosystems' responses to a changing climate.

TI  - A Multistage Information Complementary Fusion Network Based on Flexible-Mixup for HSI-X Image Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Mixup-based data augmentation has been proven to be beneficial to the regularization of models during training, especially in the remote-sensing field where the training data is scarce. However, in the process of data augmentation, the Mixup-based methods ignore the target proportion in different inputs and keep the linear insertion ratio consistent, which leads to the response of label space even if no effective objects are introduced in the mixed image due to the randomness of the augmentation process. Moreover, although some previous works have attempted to utilize different multimodal interaction strategies, they could not be well extended to various remote-sensing data combinations. To this end, a multistage information complementary fusion network based on flexible-mixup (Flex-MCFNet) is proposed for hyperspectral-X image classification. First, to bridge the gap between the mixed image and the label, a flexible-mixup (FlexMix) data augmentation strategy is designed, where the weight of the label increases with the ratio of the input image to prevent the negative impact on the label space because of the introduction of invalid information. More importantly, to summarize diverse remote-sensing data inputs including various modal supplements and uncertainties, a multistage information complementary fusion network (MCFNet) is developed. After extracting the features of hyperspectral and complementary modalities X-modal, including multispectral, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) separately, the information between complementary modalities is fully interacted and enhanced through multiple stages of information complement and fusion, which is used for the final image classification. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that Flex-MCFNet can not only effectively expand the training data, but also adequately regularize different data combinations to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

TI  - Predicting burn severity for integration with post-fire debris-flow hazard assessment: a case study from the Upper Colorado River Basin, USA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Burn severity significantly increases the likelihood and volume of post-wildfire debris flows. Pre-fire severity predictions can expedite mitigation efforts because precipitation contributing to these hazards often occurs shortly after wildfires, leaving little time for post-fire planning and management. Aim. The aim of this study was to predict burn severity using pre-fire conditions of individual wildfire events and estimate potential post-fire debris flow to unburned areas. Methods. We used random forests to model dNBR from pre-fire weather, fuels, topography, and remotely sensed data. We validated our model predictions against post-fire observations and potential post-fire debris-flow hazard estimates. Key results. Fuels, pre-fire weather, and topography were important predictors of burn severity, although predictor importance varied between fires. Post-fire debris-flow hazard rankings from predicted burn severity (pre-fire) were similar to hazard assessments based on observed burn severity (post fire). Conclusion. Predicted burn severity can serve as an input to post-fire debris-flow models before wildfires occur, antecedent to standard post-fire burn severity products. Assessing a larger set of fires under disparate conditions and landscapes will be needed to refine predictive models. Implications. Burn severity models based on pre-fire conditions enable the prediction of fire effects and identification of potential hazards to prioritise response and mitigation.

TI  - Improving sea surface floating matter identification from Sentinel-2 MSI imagery using optical radiative simulation of neighborhood difference.
T2  - Optics express
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The reflectance difference (DeltaR) between a floating matter pixel and a nearby water reference pixel is a method of atmospheric radiation unmixing. This technique unveils target signals by referencing the background within the horizontal neighborhood. DeltaR is effective for removing the mixed-pixel effect and partial atmospheric path radiance. However, other atmospheric interference sources in the difference pixel, including atmospheric extinction and sunglint, need to be clarified. To address these challenges, we combined in situ floating matter endmember spectra for simulation and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) sensors for validation. We focused on radiative transfer simulation of horizontal neighborhood and vertical atmospheric column, investigating the bilateral conversion of DeltaR between bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) signals, and clarifying how the atmosphere affects the difference pixel (DeltaR) and floating matter identification. Results showed that direct use of TOA DeltaR works in discriminating algae from non-algae floating matters under weak sunglint, and is a suitable candidate for no bother with atmospheric correction, least uncertain, and wider coverage. And then, sunglint interference is also inevitable, whether serious or not.

TI  - Spatial prediction of soil micronutrients using machine learning algorithms integrated with multiple digital covariates
T2  - NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The design and application of multiple tools to map soil micronutrients is key to efficient land management. While collecting a representative number of soil samples is time consuming and expensive, digital soil mapping could provide maps of soil properties fast and reliably. The objective of this research was to predict the spatial distribution of soil micronutrients within the piedmont plain in northeastern Iran using random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) algorithms. Sixty-eight locations with different land uses were sampled to determine the content of iron, manganese, zinc and copper in the topsoil (0-20 cm). Forty-one digital covariates were used as input to the models and were derived from a digital elevation model, open-source remote sensing (RS) data (Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2A MSI images), WorldClim climate database and maps of soil properties. Covariates were grouped into 11 scenarios: I-III, based on RS data; IV-VI, including RS, topographic, climate and soil covariates; VII, VIII and IX, based only on topographic, climate and soil covariates, respectively; X and XI, based on recursive feature elimination and expert opinion, respectively. The RF algorithm gave 91, 94, 91 and 108% normalized root mean squared error values for iron, manganese, zinc and copper, respectively, for the validation dataset with scenario XI. The most important digital covariates for micronutrients prediction with both RF and SVR models were precipitation seasonality, mean annual temperature and the mean saturation index based on Sentinel 2A MSI data. Digital maps produced at 30 m spatial resolution using scenario XI could be used to effectively identify micronutrient deficiencies and excess hotspots.

TI  - Satellite rainfall performance evaluation and application to monitor meteorological drought: a case of Omo-Gibe basin, Ethiopia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Drought assessment is important to minimize its negative consequences and design appropriate management strategies. However, in situ rainfall measurement networks are scarce and unevenly distributed in the majority of watersheds in Ethiopia to assess drought. Performance-evaluated satellite rainfall estimates (SREs) could be an alternative data source in this regard. This study assessed the performance of SREs, namely Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations version 2 (CHIRPS), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CCS-CDR) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) in Omo-Gibe basin. Point-to-pixel pairwise comparison using statistical indices such as Pearson correlation coefficient (r), mean error (ME), root mean square error (RMSE), and bias was used to evaluate the SREs for the 2000 to 2019 study periods. The best SRE was identified and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was used to assess meteorological drought. The CHIRPS-based SPI was compared with station-based SPI and further compared with MODIS-derived vegetation drought indices. The results showed 'better' performance of CHIRPS with higher r and lower ME, and bias, and acceptable RMSE values at monthly, seasonally and annual timescales, and its meteorological drought detection capability. Consequently, the CHIRPS rainfall product was used as input data to assess the spatiotemporal meteorological drought for 3- and 12-month periods. The results showed that 2000, 2002, 2009, and 2015 were identified as drought years where the central and southern parts of the basin experienced severe to extreme drought. The 3-month SPI drought index was correlated with drought severity index (DSI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) with R-2 value of 0.4 and 0.5, respectively. In the next 100 years, 3-month drought occurrences will be expected in the basin with varying intensities. Henceforth, the CHIRPS rainfall product can be used as an alternative rainfall data source in developing grid-based drought monitoring tools for data-scarce basins, which could assist in creating early warning systems.

TI  - Combining remote sensing, habitat suitability models and cellular automata to model the spread of the invasive shrub <i>Ulex europaeus</i>
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling the past or future spread patterns of invasive plant species is challenging and in an ideal case requires multi-temporal and spatially explicit data on the occurrences of the target species as well as information on the habitat suitability of the areas at risk of being invaded. Most studies either focus on modeling the habitat suitability of a given area for an invasive species or try to model the spreading behavior of an invasive species based on temporally or spatially limited occurrence data and some environmental variables. Here we suggest a workflow that combines habitat suitability maps, occurrence data from multiple time steps collected from remote sensing data, and cellular automata models to first reconstruct the spreading patterns of the invasive shrub Ulex europaeus on the island Chiloe in Chile and then make predictions for the future spread of the species. First, U. europaeus occurrences are derived for four time steps between 1988 and 2020 using remote sensing data and a supervised classification. The resulting occurrence data is combined with occurrence data of the native range of U. europaeus from the GBIF database and selected environmental variables to derive habitat suitability maps using Maxent. Then, cellular automata models are calibrated using the occurrence estimates of the four time steps, the suitability map, and some additional geo-layer containing information about soils and human infrastructure. Finally, a set of calibrated cellular automata models are used to predict the potential spread of U. europaeus for the years 2070 and 2100 using climate scenarios. All individual steps of the workflow where reference data was available led to sufficient results (supervised classifications Overall Accuracy > 0.97; Maxent AUC > 0.85; cellular automata Balanced Accuracy > 0.91) and the spatial patterns of the derived maps matched the experiences collected during the field surveys. Our model predictions suggest a continuous expansion of the maximal potential range of U. europaeus, particularly in the Eastern and Northern part of Chiloe Island. We deem the suggested workflow to be a good solution to combine the static habitat suitability information-representing the environmental constraints-with a temporally and spatially dynamic model representing the actual spreading behavior of the invasive species. The obtained understanding of spreading patterns and the information on areas identified to have a high invasion probability in the future can support land managers to plan prevention and mitigation measures.

TI  - Antifa's Political Violence on Twitter: a Grounded Theory Approach
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL ON CRIMINAL POLICY AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper explores antifa activists' use of doxing on Twitter against individuals perceived as alt-right militants. Following the principles of Grounded Theory, we collected 4690 tweets published by antifa users between September 2019 and September 2020 and analysed a random subsample of 1638. Results show that antifa users perceive alt-right activists as a serious threat to their worldview and seek to neutralise their activism even at the cost of making them social pariahs. To achieve that goal, antifa activists collect personal data on persons they suspect of being alt-right activists to "build a case" and then disseminate that information through different virtual social networks to the largest audience possible. The aim of doxing is to encourage other social actors to react and take actions that could be detrimental to the individual targeted. The article discusses practical and ethical implications of this kind of political-based harassment and suggests that future research on doxing could focus on antifa blogs and websites, which include sensitive information forbidden on Twitter.

TI  - Prognostic Impacts of the Localization and Diameter of Breast Cancer Axillary Micrometastasis
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The prognostic importance of breast cancer axillary micrometastases is still controversial. This study aims to investigate the features of the micrometastases on recurrence and survival. Surgically treated breast cancer patients who were detected to harbor axillary micrometastasis were divided into subgroups as sinusoidal and intranodal and 0.2-1 mm and 1-2 mm according to the localization and size of the micrometastases, respectively. The association of micrometastasic features on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was statistically analyzed. Thirty-three women with a mean age of 58.2 SD13.3 (range: 20-95) years were included. The median follow-up period was 50 (interquartile range: 30-62) months. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 27 (81.8%) and axillary dissection in 6 (18.2%) patients. The rate of intranodal micrometastasis of 1-2 mm diameter was higher than the other subgroups. Although the patients with a 1-2 mm diameter micrometastasis had an increased risk of distant metastasis development (hazard ratio (HR), 95% CI: 12.3, 1.2-126.0; p=0.035), tumor localization was not found to affect DFS (HR, 95% CI: 5.60, 0.55-57.10; p=0.15). The DFS of the group with a 0.2-1 mm diameter micrometastasis was found to be longer than the group with a micrometastasis of 1-2 mm diameter. Survival analysis revaled that OS was not affected by either the localization or the size of the micrometastases according to the comparisons of the study subgroups. We consider that the size of axillary micrometastasis poses importance during the follow-up of surgically treated breast cancer patients in terms of distant metastasis development.

M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Paget's disease of the breast (PDB) is a rare breast neoplasm that presents as eczematous changes near the nipple that is often associated with underlying malignancy.Recent FindingsThe pathogenesis of Paget's disease of the breast is debated to either originate from malignant ductal epithelial cells, transformation in situ, or both. Tissue biopsy is the hallmark for diagnosis in order to avoid misdiagnosis and ensure prompt treatment. Imaging modalities such as mammogram, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging are used to ascertain if there is a concurrent underlying carcinoma. Treatment options resemble that of an invasive breast cancer and consist of mastectomy or breast conservation therapy including central segmentectomy with radiation therapy.Purpose of ReviewThis review will discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and the various available treatment modalities. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of this rare entity in order to better recognize and clinically manage it.

TI  - On the distinction of seasonal internal solitary waves characteristics in the Lombok Strait based on multi-satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study presents a multi-satellite approach utilizing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical sensors to distinguish the characteristics of internal solitary waves (ISWs) during different seasons in the Lombok Strait. SAR and optical sensors are employed to estimate the dynamic parameters (soliton number, wavelength, and phase speed) of ISWs during different seasons based on the detected ISW patterns. ISW characteristics in the Lombok Strait during two seasons were observed using Sentinel-1/SAR, GCOM-C/SGLI, and Terra/MODIS sensors. Results indicated that Sentinel-1/SAR detected a higher soliton number for the northward-propagating ISWs in the Lombok Strait during the north-west monsoon (NWM) than the south-east monsoon (SEM) period. The identified wavelengths of ISWs were wider during the SEM than during the NWM whenever two packets were detected in one image. Similar variations were observed by optical sensors (SGLI and MODIS). Estimation of ISW phase speed derived from multi-satellite images and the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation showed that the phase speed was faster during the NWM than the SEM. These results correlated with the seasonal variation of thermocline depth and density differences between the two layers. Because of the bias caused by turbid water, a pattern of high chlorophyll-a was observed during the NWM period in the SGLI, MODIS, and VIIRS products. Propagation of turbid water to the north was assumed to be a result of the intense ISW activity in this area. Highly variable currents due to ISW activity in the Lombok Strait area were assumed to cause the anomalous sediment transport in this study. The multi-satellite observation data used in this study enhanced understanding of the influence of ISWs on coastal interactions in the Lombok Strait.

TI  - Roles of RIPK1 as a stress sentinel coordinating cell survival and immunogenic cell death
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 functions as a molecular switch to control cell survival, inflammation and cell death. Recent mechanistic studies shed light on the catalytic and non-catalytic roles and on the context-dependent functions of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 in health and disease.Cell death and inflammation are closely linked arms of the innate immune response to combat infection and tissue malfunction. Recent advancements in our understanding of the intricate signals originating from dying cells have revealed that cell death serves as more than just an end point. It facilitates the exchange of information between the dying cell and cells of the tissue microenvironment, particularly immune cells, alerting and recruiting them to the site of disturbance. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is emerging as a critical stress sentinel that functions as a molecular switch, governing cellular survival, inflammatory responses and immunogenic cell death signalling. Its tight regulation involves multiple layers of post-translational modifications. In this Review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms that regulate RIPK1 to maintain homeostasis and cellular survival in healthy cells, yet drive cell death in a context-dependent manner. We address how RIPK1 mutations or aberrant regulation is associated with inflammatory and autoimmune disorders and cancer. Moreover, we tease apart what is known about catalytic and non-catalytic roles of RIPK1 and discuss the successes and pitfalls of current strategies that aim to target RIPK1 in the clinic.

TI  - Sentinel-2 time series: a promising tool in monitoring temperate species spring phenology
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The changes in vegetation phenology observed in recent decades may have significant implications for carbon, water, and energy fluxes as well as ecosystem productivity. Phenology is an important indicator of a changing environment, and studying species-specific phenology can help understand their responses to varying climate conditions. While satellite-based phenology provides long-term information for large areas, it describes different traits than ground-based phenology. Nonetheless, emerging research on remote sensing-based phenology has shown its usefulness in determining inter- and intra-specific differences, as well as interannual changes. In this study, we examined the potential of the Sentinel-2 time series from 2018 to 2022 in assessing the spring phenology of seven temperate tree species. Three vegetation indices were calculated, namely, the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and the Enhanced Vegetation Index. We examined interspecific variations in the start of the season (SOS) and interannual variability. Additionally, we explored intraspecific variations in spring phenology among common beech stands across an elevation gradient. Our findings reveal substantial differences in Sentinel-2-derived phenology across species, with larch, birch, and hornbeam displaying an earlier SOS compared with oak and alder. The latest SOS dates were observed in 2021, whereas the earliest occurred in 2018 and the difference exceeded 20 days. It corresponded to the diverse spring meteorological conditions in the examined years, with the highest heat accumulation in 2018 and the lowest in 2021. Additionally, the three examined indices showed different phenological curves, with MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index exhibiting distinct patterns with a delayed start of the spring increase compared with the other two indices. The relationship between elevation and SOS dates was generally positive, but there was high variability in some years. The earliest SOS dates occurred at similar to 600 m a.s.l. and larger interannual variations were observed for stands located on the highest elevations. These results underscore the potential of Sentinel-2 in monitoring the spring phenology of temperate species, offering insights into inter- and intra-specific variations, as well as year-to-year changes. In the future, longer Sentinel-2 time series will improve estimates and facilitate the tracking of long-term changes. Such advancements hold relevance for forest management, carbon budget predictions, and understanding ecosystem dynamics.

TI  - Is there a populist personality? Populist attitudes, personality, and voter preference in Australian public opinion
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper investigates whether personality affects support for populist parties either directly or indirectly through "populist attitudes." It theorizes that populist attitudes should be disambiguated into their component facets and that the attitudinal components of populism are best understood as loosely related characteristic adaptations, which mediate the relationship between personality and vote choice. Using data from a nationally representative survey of 2200 Australians fielded prior to the general election in 2019, the paper demonstrates that the three attitudinal components of populism (People-centrism, Anti-elitism, and a Manichean outlook) are weakly associated with one another and distinctively connected with underlying personality traits. Our results indicate that populist attitudes are better conceptualized as a cluster of weakly related psychological tendencies rather than as a coherent worldview or personality. Mediation analysis indicates that personality traits affect support for populist parties both directly and indirectly through the attitudinal components of populism.

TI  - "An invitation to think differently": a narrative medicine intervention using books and films to stimulate medical students' reflection and patient-centeredness
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNarrative medicine purports to improve medical students' communication skills, self-reflection, empathy and professional development. These interpersonal skills and attitudes can facilitate more patient-centered care and positively impact patients' treatment outcomes. However, current studies report mainly on small study populations, leaving the efficacy of narrative medicine in larger study groups unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate a mandatory narrative medicine lesson in a large sample of medical students. We assessed if this narrative medicine lesson stimulated meaningful self-reflection on patient-centeredness in medical students.MethodsAll fourth-year medical students of a Dutch medical school participated in this mandatory narrative medicine lesson. The four-step activity consisted of an introductory lecture, close reading and watching of a book and film, a discussion group and a short reflective writing exercise. Students were divided over three thematic pairings (or book and film combinations): 'The doctor as a patient,' 'The mysterious brain,' and 'Until death do us part.' A mixed-methods design was used. First, we qualitatively analyzed the content of 203 essays from the reflective writing exercise. A quantitative analysis of the reflective quality was conducted using a scoring-system based on the REFLECT rubric.ResultsStudents demonstrated reflection on a professional level and connected this to future intentions as medical practitioners, for example to use specific communication strategies or to deliver healthcare in a broader sense. They also reflected on a personal level by questioning their own worldview or beliefs. Furthermore, they stressed the importance of individual patient stories to gain understaning of patients' perspectives. Approximately half of the students showed an in-depth and authentic reflection, according to the REFLECT rubric. Additionally, reflection levels differed between book and film pairings.ConclusionsThis study supports the value of narrative medicine in the medical curriculum by validating its outcomes in a larger study population and in a mandatory course. Students reflected on themes related to the principles of patient-centeredness, namely personal attitudes towards patients and the uniqueness of patient stories. In additon, the majority of students demonstrated higher levels of reflection, which suggests that this exercise contributes to self-awareness and self-reflection, important qualities for delivering patient-centered healthcare.

TI  - Investigating the spatial and temporal variation of aerosols and cloud parameters over South Asia using remote sensing
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The most important component in determining the spatiotemporal distribution of aerosol at local and regional levels is aerosol optical depth (AOD). In this study, data has been obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite to examine spatiotemporal variations in AOD and their effects on the Angstrom Exponent (AE), and clouds parameters, namely cloud fraction, cloud optical thickness, cloud top pressure, cloud top temperature, ice cloud water path, liquid cloud water path, ice cloud effective radius, and liquid cloud effective radius over South Asia from July 2002 to July 2021. The highest values of AOD (0.53-0.7) were observed in the Indo-Gangetic basin (IGB) region over South Asia. The value of AOD of 0.7 is observed in the IGB region during summer. The 0.2 AOD value is observed in winter. The highest mean AOD (0.63 & PLUSMN; 0.09) observed in Bangladesh is due to the noteworthy increase in agricultural activities. The negative correlation between AOD and AE was noticed in Karachi (-0.24), Lahore (-0.04), Rawalpindi (-0.08), Mumbai (-0.03), Kathmandu (-0.49), Colombo (-0.19), and in Kabul (-0.51). A positive correlation is observed in Delhi (0.21), Bangalore (0.09), and Dhaka (0.17).

TI  - Carbon dioxide emissions through land use change, fire, and oxidative peat decomposition in Borneo
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Borneo has accumulated an abundance of woody carbon in its forests and peat. However, agricultural land conversion accompanied by plantation development, dead wood burning, and peat drying from drainage are major challenges to climate change mitigation. This study aimed to develop a method of estimating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from land use change, forest and peat fires, and oxidative peat decomposition, and CO2 uptake from biomass growth across Borneo using remote sensing data from 2001 to 2016. Although CO2 uptake by biomass growth in vast forests has shown a significant increasing trend, an annual net release of 461.10 +/- 436.51 (average +/- 1 standard deviation) Tg CO2 year(-1) was observed. The estimated emissions were predominantly characterized by land use changes from 2001 to 2003, with the highest emissions in 2001. Land use change was evaluated from annual land use maps with an accuracy of 92.0 +/- 1.0% (average +/- 1 standard deviation). Forest and peat fires contributed higher emissions in 2002, 2006, 2009, 2014, and 2015 compared to other years and were strongly correlated with the Southern Oscillation Indexes. These results suggest that more CO2 may have been released into the atmosphere than previously thought.

TI  - The relationship between central Indian terrestrial vegetation and monsoon rainfall distributions in different hydroclimatic extreme years using time-series satellite data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The study explored the dependence of the spatio-temporal pattern of rainfall and its variability on the spatial distribution of forests in the central Indian landscape, which covers similar to 1 million km(2), includes five states, and supports a population of 329 million people. The monsoon rainfall is, thus, a crucial source of freshwater for these population. We analyzed the relationship between rainfall and satellite-derived vegetation vigor, vegetation fraction, and elevation across 22 experimental zones across central India (i.e., forested, non-forested, and agricultural regions; buffer zones within and outside forests). Around 87% of annual rainfall is received during the monsoon, with maximum rainfall (similar to 1600 mm) in Odisha and minimum (similar to 900 mm) in Maharashtra. The average rainfall was greater (similar to 1500 mm) inside forests than in non-forested regions (similar to 1000 mm). Moreover, 245 mm km(-2) year(-1) of rainfall was observed over forests during monsoon, but only 215 mm km(-2) year(-1) in non-forested areas. Overall, rainfall increases from the forest edge towards the forest core logarithmically at a rate of similar to 10 mm km(-1) year(-1), and it decreases exponentially when moving away from the forest edge at an average rate of -20 mm km(-1) year(-1) over 0-to-50 km range, and at a rate of -7.5 mm km(-1) year(-1) over the 50-to-100 km range. This rate of decrease was maximum in Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand and minimum in Chhattisgarh. The results confirmed the crucial role of forests in the distribution of monsoon rainfall, but in the elevated and Western Ghats regions, the orographic effect is dominant. These findings are of great concern to forest policymakers to conserve and protect the central Indian forests.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), including the exotic Halyomorpha halys (Stal), Nezara viridula (L.), and other indigenous species, are pests that damage a variety of agricultural crops. At a study site in the southeastern United States, we measured the density of stink bug species and patterns of parasitism and predation on corn, cotton, and soybean and host trees in an adjacent woodline. We assessed parasitism and predation of naturally laid egg masses in crops and sentinel egg masses in host trees and used pheromone-baited traps to determine H. halys seasonal development. Overall, H. halys and N. viridula were the dominant bugs observed. Adult H. halys were first detected each year on trees, followed by corn, and then cotton and soybean, suggesting that trees served as a source of H. halys dispersing into crops. For H. halys, more nymphs were captured in soybean than in corn or cotton. For N. viridula, more adults were captured in corn and cotton than in soybean, and more nymphs were captured in corn during 2019 and 2021 than in 2020. Percentage parasitism of N. viridula egg masses (74.2%) was higher than than that for H. halys egg masses (54.3%). Accordingly, conservation biological control has the potential to enhance parasitism of indigenous stink bugs and H. halys in field crop agroecosystems.

TI  - A framework for reconstructing 1km all-weather hourly LST from MODIS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential parameter in environmental monitoring. However, due to the cloud contamination and the limitations of sensors, existing thermal infrared LST products are challenging to provide all-weather LST with high spatiotemporal resolution. Therefore, this paper presents a framework for reconstructing hourly LST under clouds based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products. This framework consists of two main steps: (1) Instantaneous LST estimation for MODIS using a modified annual temperature cycle (ATCM) model and (2) Hourly LST reconstruction under all-weather conditions from atmospheric reanalysis data and MODIS instantaneous LST with the linear model (LM). The proposed framework is evaluated with the full year data of 2019 with tile number H26V05. The results show that the spatial distribution of the estimated LST is similar with the MODIS LST. Additionally, it could provide an accurate indication of the spatial and temporal variability of LST. Comparing the MODIS LST of the selected area for tile number H26V05 in 2019 with the estimated LST of the ATCM, the root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of the model are around 1K similar to 3K. The hourly LST is then reconstructed based on the LM method, and the RMSE is around 2K during the daytime and around 1K during the night-time. Finally, to verify the robustness of the hourly LST reconstruction method, the accuracy of the hourly LST was evaluated by the MODIS LST at different situations in the day. The results show that the missing data at one moment will cause the accuracy of the model decreasing by 0.09 similar to 1.67K at the corresponding moment. In general, the proposed framework has the potential to reconstruct the 1 km all-weather hourly LST with high accuracy and a certain level of robustness.

TI  - Remote sensing-based spatiotemporal variation and driving factor assessment of chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentrations in China's Pearl River Estuary
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and intensive anthropogenic activities have severely challenged the water quality of China's Pearl River Estuary (PRE). Further investigations into long-term water quality variation and associated driving mechanisms are therefore necessary to support the sustainable development of the PRE's Greater Bay Area (GBA). This study used remote sensing retrieval to address long-term spatiotemporal chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) variation characteristics in the PRE and the relationship between Chl-a concentrations and socioeconomic/environmental indicators. Three decades of Landsat satellite images and measured data were collected, and a two-band global algorithm was used to retrieve Chl-a concentration data. Results reveal significant spatiotemporal variability in Chl-a concentrations. The space-averaged Chl-a concentration exhibited a slight downward trend during the past three decades, and the multi-year mean value was 5.20 mg/L. Changes to environmental protection policies in recent years have improved overall PRE water quality. The western section of the PRE had the highest Chl-a concentration (i.e., 5.92 mg/L average) while the eastern section had the lowest (i.e., 3.98 mg/L average). This discrepancy was likely caused by the western section's more intensive industrial activities, resulting in a higher overall wastewater discharge volume. Affected by climatic conditions, winter Chl-a concentrations were evenly distributed while summer concentrations were significantly higher. Additionally, Chl- a concentrations significantly and positively correlated with total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and the biotic oxygen demand (BOD5). Chl-a concentrations also correlated with external factors (i.e., climate and anthropogenic activities). Among these factors, industrial wastewater discharge and the proportion of primary industries in coastal cities significantly and positively correlated with water quality. This study is intended to help direct water quality improvement management and urban sustainable development in the GBA.

TI  - Glacier Volume Estimation Using Laminar-Flow and Volume-Area Scaling Techniques in the Chenab Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - A proper estimate of glacier stored water is helpful to assess the long-term availability of water in any river basin. A method based on the laminar flow and volume-area scaling is used to estimate glacier stored water in the Chenab basin. Here, we used Landsat 8 images from 2015 to 2019 for the estimation of glacier surface velocity. The laminar flow technique needs surface velocity and slope of the glaciers, and other parameters which are assumed to be constants. The surface velocity of 223 glaciers was assessed by using the sub-pixel correlation technique, applied to Landsat 8 images. The slope was estimated using ASTER DEM. We calculated the average surface velocity and thickness as 11.12 +/- 0.05 m a(-1) and 54.56 +/- 7.4 m, respectively, and the maximum ice thickness as 470 +/- 63.9 m. Moreover, we have developed a volume-area scaling equation using laminar flow estimates and applied it to the remaining 1945 glaciers. The glacier-stored water estimated for 2168 Chenab glaciers covering 2519 +/- 125.8 km(2) area has been estimated as 145.61 +/- 26.2 Gt. Our investigation provides decent estimates of glacier stored water, which helps to advance hydrological studies, thereby developing innovative mitigation strategies.

TI  - Evaluating rates of chiropractic use and utilization by patient sex within the United States Veterans Health Administration: a serial cross-sectional analysis
T2  - CHIROPRACTIC & MANUAL THERAPIES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWithin the United States Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the number of patients using healthcare services has increased over the past several decades. Females make up a small proportion of overall patients within the VHA; however, this proportion is growing rapidly. Previous studies have described rates of VHA chiropractic use; however, no prior study assessed differences in use or utilization rates between male and female veterans. The purpose of this study was to assess rates of use and utilization of chiropractic care by sex among VHA patients receiving care at VHA facilities with on-station chiropractic clinics.MethodsA serial cross-sectional analysis of VHA national electronic health record data was conducted in Fall 2021 for fiscal year (FY) 2005-2021. The cohort population was defined as VHA facilities with on-station chiropractic clinics, and facilities were admitted to the cohort after the first FY with a minimum of 500 on-station chiropractic visits. Variables extracted included counts of unique users of any VHA on-station facility outpatient services, unique users of VHA on-station facility chiropractic services, number of chiropractic visits, and sex. To calculate use, we determined the proportion of patients of each sex who received chiropractic services to the total patients of the same sex receiving any outpatient care within each facility. To calculate utilization, we determined the number of chiropractic care visits per patient per fiscal year. A linear mixed effects model was applied to examine the difference in chiropractic care utilization by sex.ResultsThe percentage of female VHA on-station chiropractic patients increased from 11.7 to 17.7% from FY2005-FY2021. Among VHA facilities with on-station chiropractic care, the percentage of female VHA healthcare users who used chiropractic care (mean = 2.3%) was greater than the percentage of male VHA healthcare users who used chiropractic care (mean = 1.1%). Rates of chiropractic utilization by sex among VHA facilities with on-station chiropractic clinics were slightly higher for females (median = 4.3 visits per year, mean = 4.9) compared to males (median = 4.1 visits per year, mean = 4.6).ConclusionWe report higher use and utilization of VHA chiropractic care by females compared with males, yet for both sexes rates were lower than in the private US healthcare system. This highlights the need for further assessment of the determinants and outcomes of VHA chiropractic care.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundSeveral studies have been conducted to understand the impact of socioeconomic and maternal factors on child undernutrition. However, the past literature has not directly examined the joint impacts of fuel use and ambient pollution and have primarily focused on PM2.5.ObjectiveThis study explored the individual and community-level associations of both indoor (cooking fuel type) and ambient air pollution (PM2.5, NO2 and SO2) during maternal gestation on child undernutrition.MethodsThis study analysed stunting, being underweight, and anaemia of children aged 0-59 months (n = 259,627) using the National Family Health Survey. In-utero exposures to ambient PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 were measured using satellite data and self-reported fuel type was a marker of indoor pollution exposure. The study used univariate and bivariate Moran's I, spatial lag model and multivariable logistic regression models after adjusting for other covariates to understand the effect of pollution on in-utero exposure and child health status at the individual and community-levels.ResultsHigher concentration of indoor and ambient air pollution was found in the Northern and parts of Central regions of India. Estimates of spatial modelling show that each 1 & mu;g/m(-3) increase in maternal exposure to ambient PM2.5 across the clusters of India was associated with a 0.11, 9 and 19 percentage points increase in the prevalence of stunting, underweight and anaemia, respectively. The results of multi-pollutant model show that a higher ambient PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy was linked to higher odds of stunting (AOR:1.38; 95% CI:1.32-1.44), underweight (AOR:1.59; 95% CI:1.51-1.67) and anaemia (AOR:1.61; 95% CI:1.52-1.69) in children. Weaker but similar associations were observed for NO2, but not with SO2. Indoor pollution exposure during in-utero periods was also significantly associated with childhood undernutrition and this association was modified by ambient PM2.5 levels, where exposure to both indoor and ambient air pollution had even greater odds of being undernourished.Impact statementOur research on multi-pollutant models has revealed the initial proof of the individual impacts of indoor and outdoor pollution (PM2.5, NO2, and SO2) exposure during fetal development on children's nutrition.

TI  - Research on thermal infrared anomaly characteristics of moderate strong earthquakes in northeast China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, the daily brightness temperature data from January 2006 to May 2020 of China's geostationary meteorological satellite FY-2E/G were used to identify the brightness temperature differences before deep and shallow earthquakes in the study area using wavelet transform and the relative wavelet power spectrum (RWPS) methods. The objective was to explore the characteristics of thermal infrared (TIR) radiation anomaly changes before deep and shallow earthquakes in Northeast China by carrying out anomaly extraction and data analysis. The research has shown that five significant earthquakes experienced TIR radiation anomalies in the vicinity of the epicenter approximately 1-2 months before the event. The amplitude of the anomaly ranged from seven to twenty times higher than average, and the anomaly lasted about 3 months. The infrared radiation anomaly characteristics before the earthquake were especially significant in the case of two earthquakes in the Songyuan area. From the research, it was concluded that the TIR radiation anomaly could act as a short-term precursor for earthquake prediction. The method employed in this study would provide great support for predicting deep and shallow earthquakes in Northeast China using satellite thermal infrared technology.

TI  - Deformation Retrievals for North America and Eurasia from Sentinel-1 DInSAR: Big Data Approach, Processing Methodology and Challenges
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A fully automated processing system for measuring long-term ground deformation time series and deformation rates frame-by-frame using DInSAR processing technique was developed at the Canada Center for Remote Sensing. Ground deformation rates from 2017 to 2023 were computed over a large territory of North America and Eurasia from more than 220,000 readily available Sentinel-1 images, and the performance and shortcomings of the developed processing system were analyzed. Here, we present the processing methodology and several examples of deformation rate maps and time series produced with this automated system. Examples include the deformation of slow- moving deep-seated landslides in two regions of Canada, subsidence at the Komsomolskoe oil field in the Russian Arctic, the Tengiz oil field in Kazakhstan, multiple large subsiding regions and landslides in northwestern Iran, and two large subsiding regions in the Yellow River Delta and Xinjiang, China. Many deformation processes observed in these deformation rate maps, including large landslides, have previously been unknown to the research community. Systematic radar penetration depth changes were observed in multiple regions and were investigate in detail for 1 Eurasian region. Computed deformation rates for North America and Eurasia are available to the research community and can be downloaded from the data repository.

TI  - Defining and Illustrating "Extremism" Using the Largest Investigation into Islam in Prison
T2  - STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In the context of a damaging absence of clarity, we define "Islamist Extremism" as: the absolutely divided and antagonistic Worldview of the "Us"-true-Muslim "in-group" who must strive to live in an "Islamic" State versus "Them"-non-Muslim' and "wrong"-Muslim "out-groups" who are stripped of their human status due to their opposition to "true Islam." We illustrate this definition of "Extremism" - including showing how Islamist Extremism is different from Mainstream Islam - using fresh empirical data from the largest ever study of Islam and Muslims in prison. We proceed to show how this definition of "Extremism" can be used as the basis for understanding processes of radicalization and de-radicalization in and outside prison. We then extrapolate from the case of Islamist Extremism in prison to suggest a working definition of "Extremism" more generally as: any absolutely divided "Us" versus "Them" Worldview by which a "chosen" in-group strips "condemned" out-groups of their basic human qualities, properties and rights and thereby sets them up for harm.

AB  - Objective: Analysis of the characteristics of influenza epidemic in Anhui Province and quantification of the impact of different factors on influenza occurrence, providing scientific basis for better influenza prevention and control. Methods: Descriptive analysis and factor analysis were conducted on influenza-like illness (ILI) cases and RT-PCR results in Anhui Province from 2013 to 2021 using data from China's Influenza Monitoring Information System. Results: The percentage of influenza-like illness (ILI%) of sentinel hospitals in Anhui Province from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2021 was 3.80% (1 209 142/31 779 987), showing an overall increasing trend, with a relatively high proportion in 2017-2018 at 4.30% (191 148/4 448 211). The proportion of ILI cases in infants and young children aged 0-4 years was a relatively high at 54.14% (654 676/1 209 142), and the highest ILI% was observed in Fuyang City, Anhui Province (6.25%, 236 863/3 788 863). Laboratory monitoring results showed that the positive rate of ILI cases in sentinel hospitals in 8 influenza monitoring years was 16.38% (34 868/212 912), showing an increasing trend year by year, with a relatively proportion in 2017-2018 at 26.19% (6 936/26 488). The detection rate of school-age children aged 5-14 years was a relativelyhigh at 28.81% (13 869/48 144), and the positive rate was a relatively high in Wuhu City among the 16 cities, reaching 22.01% (2 693/122 237). Influenza activity showed a single peak in winter-spring and alternating double peaks in winter-spring and summer, with different subtypes alternating, and A (H3N2) was the dominant subtype in summer. The results of a multiple logistic regression model showed that the positive rate was higher in 2017-2018, among children aged 5-14 years, in winter, and in southern Anhui. Conclusions: Influenza epidemic in Anhui Province has a clear seasonal pattern, and the ILI% and detection rate have shown an upward trend from 2013 to 2021. Therefore, it is suggested to ensure vaccine supply before the winter-spring influenza season arrives, and to strengthen vaccine uptake and health education to avoid the risk of infection during the peak period of influenza.

M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the performance of the influenza surveillance network and compare the epidemic intensity of influenza during 2014-2020 in Shanghai. Methods: Based on the weekly reports of influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed influenza cases from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2020. This study first evaluated the data reporting and specimen collection of ILI cases for each sentinel hospital, and then calculated the percentage of ILI (ILI%), the proportion of specimens tested positive for influenza, and the incidence of influenza among all ILI outpatient and emergency visits to measure the epidemic intensity of influenza. Finally, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was applied to quantify the changes in epidemic intensity of influenza in 2020. Results: The proportion of influenza surveillance sentinel hospitals with a score of less than 5 in the evaluation of ILI data reporting and samples collection were 9.68% and 21.05% in 2020 in Shanghai, respectively. ILI% was estimated to be 1.51% (95%CI: 1.50%-1.51%) and 2.31% (95%CI: 2.30%-2.32%), respectively for 2014-2019 and 2020; the proportion of specimens tested positive was 24.27% (95%CI: 24.02%- 24.51%) and 7.15% (95%CI: 6.78%-7.54%), respectively; and the incidence of influenza was 3.66 (95%CI: 3.62-3.70) and 1.65 (95%CI: 1.57-1.74), respectively. ARIMA model showed that ILI% was increased by 45.25% in 2020 in Shanghai, and the proportion of specimens tested positive and the incidence of influenza were reduced by 78.45% and 51.80%, respectively. Conclusions: In 2020, the performance of influenza surveillance system has changed, ILI% has increased, the proportion of specimens tested positive and the incidence of influenza has decreased in Shanghai. The change in the quality of influenza surveillance is also a potential factor affecting the epidemic intensity of influenza. In the future, the quality control of influenza surveillance network still needs to be further strengthened.

TI  - Simulating heat and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in Beijing using SUEWS V2020b: sensitivity to vegetation phenology and maximum conductance
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) has recently been introduced to include a bottom-up approach to modeling carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and uptake in urban areas. In this study, SUEWS is evaluated against the measured eddy covariance (EC) turbulent fluxes of sensible heat (Q(H)), latent heat (Q(E)), and CO2 (FC) in a densely built neighborhood in Beijing. The model sensitivity to maximum conductance (g(max)) and leaf area index (LAI) is examined. Site-specific g(max) is obtained from observations over local vegetation species, and LAI parameters are extracted by optimization with remotely sensed LAI obtained from a Landsat 7 data product. For the simulation of anthropogenic CO2 components, local traffic and population data are collected. In the model evaluation, the mismatch between the measurement source area and simulation domain is also considered.Using the optimized g(max) and LAI, the modeling of heat fluxes is noticeably improved, showing higher correlation with observations, lower bias, and more realistic seasonal dynamics of Q(E) and Q(H). The effect of the g(max) adjustment is more significant than the LAI adjustment. Compared to heat fluxes, the F-C module shows lower sensitivity to the choices of g(max) and LAI. This can be explained by the low relative contribution of vegetation to the net F-C in the modeled area. SUEWS successfully reproduces the average diurnal cycle of F-C and annual cumulative sums. Depending on the size of the simulation domain, the modeled annual accumulated F-C ranges from 7.4 to 8.7 kgCm(-2)yr(-1), compared to 7.5 kgCm(-2)yr(-1) observed by EC. Traffic is the dominant CO2 source, contributing 59 %-70 % to the annual total CO2 emissions, followed by human metabolism (14 %-18 %), buildings (11 %-14 %), and CO2 release by vegetation and soil respiration (6 %-10 %). Vegetation photosynthesis offsets only 5 %-10 % of the total CO2 emissions. We highlight the importance of choosing the optimal LAI parameters and gmax when SUEWS is used to model surface fluxes. The F-C module of SUEWS is a promising tool in quantifying urban CO2 emissions at the local scale and therefore assisting in mitigating urban CO2 emissions.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of [<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc]Tilmanocept Relative to [<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc]Sulfur Colloid for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Stage Oral Cavity Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background. Several studies have demonstrated varying rates of efficacy, reliability, and sensitivity of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in identifying occult nodal disease for early stage oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) depending on the radionuclide agent utilized. No head-tohead comparison of cost or clinical outcomes of SLNB when utilizing [ Tc-99m]tilmanocept versus [Tc-99m]sulfur colloid has been performed. The goal of this study was to develop a decision model to compare the cost-effectiveness of [Tc-99m]tilmanocept versus [Tc-99m]sulfur colloid in early stage OCSCC.Patients and Methods. A decision model of disease and treatment as a function of SLNB was created. Patients with a negative SLNB entered a Markov model of the natural history of OCSCC parameterized with published data to simulate five states of health and iterated over a 30-year time horizon. Treatment costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for each health state were included. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was then estimated using $100,000 per additional QALY as the threshold for determining cost-effectiveness.Results. The base case cost-effectiveness analysis suggested [Tc-99m]tilmanocept was more effective than [Tc-99m]sulfur colloid by 0.12 QALYs (7.06 versus 6.94 QALYs). [Tc-99m] Tilmanocept was more costly, with a lifetime cost of $84,961 in comparison with $84,264 for sulfur colloid, however, the overall base case ICER was $5859 per additional QALY, well under the threshold for cost-effectiveness. Multiple one way sensitivity analyses were performed, and demonstrated the model was robust to alternative parameter values.Conclusion. Our analysis showed that while [Tc-99m]tilmanocept is more costly upfront, these costs are worth the additional QALYs gained by the use of [Tc-99m]tilmanocept.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of the earth's surface temperature and the changes in land user/land cover: implications for sustainable tourism development
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICY RESEARCH IN TOURISM LEISURE AND EVENTS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Tourism both contributes to environmental change and is, in turn, affected by such change. One area that is of considerable significance is tourism's contribution to land use change and its subsequent impacts. Land use change, such as tourism urbanization, together with global heating leads to an increase in surface temperature and deterioration in environmental quality and human comfort levels. Understanding the implications of tourism-related land use change is therefore of considerable importance for climate adaptation. Using Landsat satellite images, the evolution of land users/covers and the temperature of the land surface between 1985 and 2020 were studied in Cyprus. The analysis of the data confirms that tourism development activities have influenced the increase in urban hotspots. This destination has experienced a 6.2 & DEG;C increase in average temperature and 168.8% in the urban hotspot. Based on the findings the study highlights the implications for sustainable tourism development and potential means of mitigation.

TI  - Axillary lymph node dissection versus radiotherapy in breast cancer with positive sentinel nodes after neoadjuvant therapy (ADARNAT trial)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Breast cancer surgery currently focuses on de-escalating treatment without compromising patient survival. Axillary radiotherapy (ART) now replaces axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with limited sentinel lymph node (SLN) involvement during the primary surgery, and this has significantly reduced the incidence of lymphedema without worsening the prognosis. However, patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) cannot benefit from this option despite the low incidence of residual disease in the armpit in most cases. Data regarding the use of radiotherapy instead of ALND in this population are lacking. This study will assess whether ART is non-inferior to ALND in terms of recurrence and overall survival in patients with positive SLN after NST, including whether it reduces surgery-related adverse effects.Methods and analyses: This multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial will enroll 1660 patients with breast cancer and positive SLNs following NST in approximately 50 Spanish centers over 3 years. Patients will be stratified by NST regimen and nodal involvement (isolated tumoral cells or micrometastasis versus macrometastasis) and randomly assigned 1:1 to ART without ALND (study arm) or ALND alone (control arm). Level 3 and supraclavicular radiotherapy will be added in both arms. The primary outcome is the 5-year axillary recurrence determined by clinical and radiological examination. The secondary outcomes include lymphedema or arm dysfunction, quality of life based (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires), disease-free survival, and overall survival.Discussion: This study aims to provide data to confirm the efficacy and safety of ART over ALND in patients with a positive SLN after NST, together with the impact on morbidity.Ethics and dissemination: The Research Ethics Committee of Bellvitge University Hospital approved this trial (Protocol Record PR148/21, version 3, 1/2/2022) and all patients must provide written informed consent. The involvement of around 50 centers across Spain will facilitate the dissemination of our results.

AB  - Marine Heat Waves (MHWs) can cause significant distress to marine environment and modulate air-sea interaction, which in turn can have economic and societal impacts. This study aims to identify surface and subsurface MHWs in the Bay of Bengal using available sea-surface temperature data and buoy observations spanning four decades. The results show significant increase in the number, frequency, duration, and intensity of surface MHWs in recent years. To better understand the relationship between MHW occurrences and different phases of two climate phenomena, namely, the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, multiple extreme MHW event years between 2008 and 2018 are analyzed. The findings show that the surface MHWs become more prominent during El Nino/positive IOD events due to weakened winds, increased net heat flux input towards the ocean, increased stratification and warming tendency through vertical processes in the presence of inversion. This, in turn, affects the surface biological productivity in the region. Additionally, surface MHWs were also found to be driven by surface currents and eddies. On the other hand, subsurface MHWs develop during negative IOD/La Nina conditions due to the deepening of the thermocline, which is forced by coastally trapped downwelling Kelvin waves and reflected downwelling Rossby waves, and is followed by substantial freshening of deeper layers. This study provides a deeper understanding of the causes of surface and subsurface MHWs in the Bay of Bengal, which is a crucial basin in influencing monsoon and cyclonic events affecting its surrounding landmasses.

TI  - Impact of different land use and land cover in simulation of tropical cyclones over Bay of Bengal
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an assessment on the impact of different Land Use/Land Cover datasets in simulating the movement and severity of three extremely severe cyclonic storms, namely Phailin (2013), Hudhud (2014) and Fani (2019), which developed over the Bay of Bengal (BoB). For this purpose, the Advanced Research Weather and Forecasting System (WRF) is selected and the model is forced with necessary input parameters. Two sets of numerical experiment are conducted. The first set of experiments uses U.S. Geological Survey Land Use/Land Cover datasets, and the WRF model is integrated with four different land surface parameterization schemes. The second set of experiments uses the Indian satellite IRS P6 AWiFS-derived Land Use/Land Cover obtained from the National Remote Sensing Centre (here after; AWiFS), and WRF model is integrated with four different land surface parameterization schemes. The model simulated track, mean sea-level pressure, wind, and rainfall are analysed and verified with available observation as obtained from India Meteorological Department and NASA Global Precipitation Measurement. The dynamics and thermodynamic structure are analysed in terms of model simulated vorticity and equivalent potential temperature during the landfall of the system. The results suggested that the use of AWiFS Land Use/Land Cover improves the simulation of track of all the cyclones during and after the landfall of the system. Also, it significantly reduces the landfall point error for all the land surface parameterization schemes except with thermal diffusion scheme. The AWiFS experiments could simulate both the spatial and station rainfall reasonably well. Also, it could simulate the intensity and thermodynamic structure of the cyclone reasonably well.

TI  - Climate change adaptation through an integrative lens in Aotearoa New Zealand
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Climate change is being felt across all human and natural systems in Aotearoa New Zealand and is projected to worsen this decade as impacts compound and cascade through natural system and sectoral dependencies. The effectiveness of adaptation is constrained by how fast greenhouse gas emissions are reduced globally, the pace of change, the frequency and progression of impacts, and the capacity of our natural, societal and political systems to respond. We explore how these systems and sectors interact with existing and projected climate change stressors by categorising climate change impacts (Trends and Events) and consequential thresholds (Thresholds), and by grouping systems and sectors by types (Typologies). This approach has identified commonalities and differences between the typologies which are illustrated with examples. Critical constraints and opportunities for adaptation have been identified to guide sector adaptation decision-making and for ongoing adaptation progress and effectiveness monitoring. Constraints are found across all sectors, and opportunities exist to address them through modelling and projections, monitoring frameworks, decision tools and measures, governance coordination and integration of the Maori worldview of the relationship between humans and nature. However, limits to adaptation exist and will increase over time unless all sectors and all nations urgently reduce their emissions.

TI  - Exploring the mechanism of coordinated development with multi-source data fusion: a case study in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring the degree of regional coordinated development and analyzing the factors affecting regional coordinated development are of great significance for assessing the status of regional coordinated development and formulating regional coordinated development strategies. The advancement of remote sensing data and big data provide the possibility to measure the degree of regional coordinated development on a more precise scale. The aim of this study is to use multiple sources of data to construct the evaluation indicator system of coordinated development level and to analyze the mechanism of regional development. All the 200 counties (districts) in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region are selected as the study area. By measuring the level of coordinated development of 200 county units in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2012 to 2017, it is found that although the synergy degree at the county level of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei is increased, the overall regional synergy degree is still at a low level. The spatial panel model is further used to analyze the factors that influence the coordinated development of all counties. The conclusion is that with the promotion of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei coordinated development policy, the excessive government intervention, and the imbalance of market allocation in the past in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region have been alleviated. However, the weaknesses in the process of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei coordinated development are still obvious. The population density and urban size have become the constraints in the process of coordinated development. The degree of opening to the outside world and the investment in the ecological environment construction is still far from enough. These findings enable us to have a clearer assessment of the level of coordinated development and a deeper understanding of the influence mechanism of the regional development in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Furthermore, this study might benefit regional development strategy research.

TI  - China Building Rooftop Area: the first multi-annual (2016-2021) and high-resolution (2.5 m)building rooftop area dataset in China derived with super-resolutionsegmentation from Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Large-scale and multi-annual maps of building rooftop area (BRA) are crucial for addressing policy decisions and sustainable development. In addition, as a fine-grained indicator of human activities, BRA could contribute to urban planning and energy modeling to provide benefits to human well-being. However, it is still challenging to produce a large-scale BRA due to the rather tiny sizes of individual buildings. From the viewpoint of classification methods, conventional approaches utilize high-resolution aerial images (metric or submetric resolution) to map BRA; unfortunately, high-resolution imagery is both infrequently captured and expensive to purchase, making the BRA mapping costly and inadequate over a consistent spatiotemporal scale. From the viewpoint of learning strategies, there is a nontrivial gap that persists between the limited training references and the applications over geospatial variations. Despite the difficulties, existing large-scale BRA datasets, such as those from Microsoft or Google, do not include China, and hence there are no full-coverage maps of BRA in China yet. In this paper, we first propose a deep-learning method, named the Spatio-Temporal aware Super-Resolution Segmentation framework (STSR-Seg), to achieve robust super-resolution BRA extraction from relatively low-resolution imagery over a large geographic space. Then, we produce the multi-annual China Building Rooftop Area (CBRA) dataset with 2.5 m resolution from 2016-2021 Sentinel-2 images. CBRA is the first full-coverage and multi-annual BRA dataset in China. With the designed training-sample-generation algorithms and the spatiotemporally aware learning strategies, CBRA achieves good performance with a F1 score of 62.55 % (+10.61 % compared with the previous BRA data in China) based on 250 000 testing samples in urban areas and a recall of 78.94 % based on 30 000 testing samples in rural areas. Temporal analysis shows good performance consistency over years and good agreement with other multi-annual impervious surface area datasets. STSR-Seg will enable low-cost, dynamic, and large-scale BRA mapping (https://github.com/zpl99/STSR-Seg, last access: 12 July 2023). CBRA will foster the development of BRA mapping and therefore provide basic data for sustainable research (Liu et al., 2023; ).

M3  - Early Access
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEM) are an essential data source in many professional disciplines, with the help of gridded height information and values such as slope and aspect produced from that information. In this study, Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) satellite-altimetry data, and SRTM, ASTER-GDEM, and ALOS World3D data were used as Global DEMs (GDEMs) data in three different areas (U.S.A., New Zealand and Puerto Rico). We used kriging methods for interpolation to create the new rasters. Point-based accuracies were compared with the GDEMs from satellite-altimetry systems and raster-based comparisons were made by deriving DEMs with satellite-altimetry data in three different areas. It was seen that the ICESat-2 data in point-based results had similar accuracy with other GDEMs. DEMs produced by using ICESat-2 and GEDI data together gave relatively better results than using alone. In particular, the correlation was found to be highly correlated with 99%.

TI  - The NOMS approach to metastatic tumors: Integrating new technologies to improve outcomes.
T2  - Revista espanola de cirugia ortopedica y traumatologia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Treatment paradigms for patients with spine metastases have evolved significantly over the past two decades. The most transformative change to these paradigms has been the integration of spinal stereotactic radiosurgery (sSRS). sSRS allows for the delivery of tumoricidal radiation doses with sparing of nearby organs at risk, particularly the spinal cord. Evidence supports the safety and efficacy of radiosurgery as it currently offers durable local tumor control with low complication rates even for tumors previously considered radioresistant to conventional external beam radiation therapy. The role for surgical intervention remains consistent, but a trend has been observed toward less aggressive, often minimally invasive techniques. Using modern technologies and improved instrumentation, surgical outcomes continue to improve with reduced morbidity. Additionally, targeted agents such as biologics and checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer care by improving both local control and patient survival. These advances have brought forth a need for new prognostication tools and a more critical review of long-term outcomes. The complex nature of current treatment schemes necessitates a multidisciplinary approach including surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, interventionalists and pain specialists. This review recapitulates the current state-of-the-art, evidence-based data on the treatment of spinal metastases and integrates these data into a decision framework, NOMS, which is based on four sentinel pillars of decision making in metastatic spine tumors: neurological status, Oocologic tumor behavior, mechanical stability and systemic disease burden and medical co-morbidities.

TI  - Recurrent marine heatwaves threaten the resilience and viability of a key Mediterranean octocoral species
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Long-term ecological studies are essential for understanding the resilience of temperate reefs to ocean warming and the response of their habitat-forming species to recurrent marine heatwaves (MHWs).This study evaluated the long-term response (2005-2021) of the habitat-forming octocoral Eunicella singularis (Esper, 1791) to recurrent MHWs in a Mediterranean marine protected area established more than 25 years ago, where restrictions on fishing and diving activities are well enforced.During the study period, there were two mass-mortality events (MMEs), in 2007 and 2018, that dramatically disrupted the local gorgonian population. The MMEs were triggered by different temperature dynamics, which ultimately led to differential patterns in mortality rates.The record-breaking MHW in 2018 prompted one of the largest MMEs ever recorded in the Mediterranean Sea, which affected 75% of the individuals in the gorgonian population and killed 12.5% of colonies.Furthermore, MHWs were detected in all years from 2014 to 2021, preventing injured tissues from fully recovering, leading to significant accumulated damage at the end of the study period (30 times higher than the levels prior to the first MME), and a marked decrease in resilience that threatens the population viability of this long-lived species.The octocoral studied is one of the most important structural and biomass contributors to one of the most diverse Mediterranean communities. These results underscore the great risk that annual MHWs pose to the long-term integrity of the circalittoral rocky bottoms of the Mediterranean coasts.In the face of climate change, MPAs must provide areas of reduced anthropic stress for gorgonian populations, enabling the restoration and maintenance of natural processes. Additionally, MPAs should serve as sentinel areas to test the effectiveness of coral restoration actions, which can help managers and scientists to estimate the usefulness of these techniques.

TI  - Geospatial mitigation of the effect of undulating terrain on efficient water distribution network: a case study in Enugu Urban, South-Eastern Nigeria
T2  - AQUA-WATER INFRASTRUCTURE ECOSYSTEMS AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Undulating terrain has continued to aggravate pipe-borne water supply challenges in the Enugu Urban area. The rapid increase in urbanization has worsened the situation. This, therefore, calls for the deployment of systems that can support the effective planning of surface and underground facilities for the development of an efficient water distribution network in this region. Remote Sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Hydrographic Survey, and Geophysical Survey collectively referred to as geospatial technologies have been combined in different ways by developed nations to resolve challenges facing surface and underground facilities. This study, therefore, demonstrates the application of this technology in designing an efficient water distribution network for urban areas with undulating terrain. The spot heights dataset extracted from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) satellite imagery offered the bases for the re-structure of the existing water distribution network map to accommodate the undulation of the topography. This was integrated into a GIS tool to synergize the topography with the radial and dead-end standard water distribution patterns. The result was a sub-division of the Enugu Urban Area into 12 zones with reservoirs at the most elevated points to facilitate water reticulation by gravity. The efficacy of this distribution network map was confirmed suitable with EPANET software.

TI  - Monitoring and analysis of surface deformation in alpine valley areas based on multidimensional InSAR technology
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Joshimath has received much attention for its massive ground subsidence at the beginning of the year. Rapid urbanization and its unique geographical location may have been one of the factors contributing to the occurrence of this geological disaster. In high mountain valley areas, the complex occurrence mechanism and diverse disaster patterns of geological hazards highlight the inadequacy of manual monitoring. To address this problem, the inversion of deformation of the Joshimath surface in multiple directions can be achieved by multidimensional InSAR techniques. Therefore, in this paper, the multidimensional SBAS-InSAR technique was used to process the lift-track Sentinel-1 data from 2020 to 2023 to obtain the two-dimensional vertical and horizontal deformation rates and time series characteristics of the Joshimath ground surface. To discover the causes of deformation and its correlation with anthropogenic activities and natural disasters by analyzing the spatial and temporal evolution of surface deformation. The results show that the area with the largest cumulative deformation is located in the northeastern part of the town, with a maximum cumulative subsidence of 271.2 mm and a cumulative horizontal movement of 336.5 mm. The spatial distribution of surface deformation is based on the lower part of the hill and develops towards the upper part of the hill, showing a trend of expansion from the bottom to the top. The temporal evolution is divided into two phases: gentle to rapid, and it is tentatively concluded that the decisive factor that caused the significant change in the rate of surface deformation and the early onset of the geological subsidence hazard was triggered by the 4.7 magnitude earthquake that struck near the town on 11 September 2021.

TI  - Optimal estimation retrieval of tropospheric ammonia from the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder on board FengYun-4B
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) is a reactive nitrogen compound that pollutes our environment and threatens public health. Monitoring the spatial and temporal variations is important for quantifying its emissions and depositions and evaluating the strategies for managing anthropogenic sources of NH3. In this study, we present an NH3 retrieval algorithm based on the optimal estimation method for the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) on board China's FengYun-4B satellite (FY-4B/GIIRS). In particular, we examine the information content based on the degree of freedom for signal (DOFS) in retrieving the diurnal NH3 in East Asia, with a focus on two source regions including the North China Plain and North India. Our retrieval is based on the FengYun Geostationary satellite Atmospheric Infrared Retrieval (FY-GeoAIR) algorithm and exploits the strong NH3 absorption window of 955-975 cm(-1). Retrieval results using FY-4B/GIIRS spectra from July to December 2022 show that the DOFS for the majority ranges from 0 to 1.0, mainly depending on the thermal contrast (TC) defined as the temperature difference between the surface and the lowest atmospheric layer. Consistent with retrievals from low-Earth-orbit (LEO) infrared sounders, the detection sensitivity, as quantified by the averaging kernel (AK) matrix, peaks in the lowest 2 km atmospheric layers. The DOFS and TC are highly correlated, resulting in a typical "butterfly" shape. That is, the DOFS increases when TC becomes either more positive or more negative. The NH3 columns from FY-4B/GIIRS exhibit significant diurnal cycles that are consistent with the day-night gradient from the collocated IASI retrievals in the North China Plain and North India for the averages in July-August, September-October, and November-December, respectively. A collocated point-by-point intercomparison with the IASI NH3 dataset shows generally good agreement with a small systematic difference in the summer months that may be attributed to the slight difference in a priori profiles. This study demonstrates the capability of FY-4B/GIIRS in capturing the diurnal NH3 changes in East Asia, which will have the potential to improve regional and global air quality and climate research.

TI  - Characterizing the interaction of groundwater with surface water and precipitation in the Mongolian Plateau in China
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Due to the arid climate, groundwater is a vital water resource for ecosystems such as those associated with Dalinor Lake in the Inner Mongolian Plateau, China. This research studied the groundwater circulation mechanisms in Dalinor Lake and surrounding areas and their contribution to surface water, based on remote sensing and environmental isotopes analyses. Using Landsat satellite data, it was found that the lake area of Dalinor Lake decreased by 12% between 1986 and 2021. The shrinkage rate increased from 0.31 km(2)/year in 1986-2005 to 1.24 km(2)/year in 2005-2021. The groundwater contribution to the lake is 1.49 x 10(8) m(3)/year. Soil profiles and a rainfall simulation test revealed that precipitation infiltration provides limited recharge to groundwater. The groundwater stable isotopic signature (& delta;D = -88.55 & PTSTHOUSND;, & delta;O-18 = -10.01 & PTSTHOUSND;), which is more depleted than local precipitation (& delta;D = -63.83 & PTSTHOUSND;, & delta;O-18 = -8.76 & PTSTHOUSND;), implies that local precipitation is not the main source of groundwater recharge. The groundwater stable isotopic signature in different river sources is diverse, indicating the spatial specificity of groundwater recharge sources. Groundwater and river water have mantle-derived helium (R/R-a > 1) and high tritium concentrations, so it is speculated that groundwater in the Dalinor Lake and its surrounding area is recharged by modern precipitation (post 1960s) outside the study area through fast channels, such as fault systems. This study provides information necessary for effective water management in the Inner Mongolian Plateau.

T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The effects of coconut fiber biochar (CFB) and nitrate-modified coconut fiber biochar (NCFB) on the passivation of exogenous lead (Pb) in paddy soils and their underlying mechanisms were investigated using soil incubation experiments combined with spectroscopic techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF), and Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy (FTIR). The effects of NCFB and CFB on the passivation of exogenous lead (Pb) in paddy soils and its underlying mechanisms were investigated. Compared with that of CFB, the inner wall of NCFB honeycomb pores was rougher, and the amount of alcohol-phenol-ether functional groups containing the C-O structure and the amount of carboxyl groups containing the C[FY=,1]O/O[FY=,1]C-O structure on the surface of CFB was significantly decreased after nitric acid modification. Compared with that in the control (without biochar) paddy soil after 150 d of incubation, the EDTA-extracted Pb content in the paddy soil with CFB and NCFB was reduced by 39.7% and 105.4%, respectively. The carbonate-bound and Fe-Mn oxide-bound Pb contents were significantly lower, and the organic-bound and residue Pb contents were significantly higher in the NCFB-added soil. The SRXRF scans showed that the exogenous Pb was enriched in the microregions of CFB particles rich in Ca and Cu elements and relatively less so in the microregions of soil aggregates rich in the Fe, Mn, and Ti elements. In addition, the characteristic peaks of carboxylates (1384 cm-1) in A-CFBPb and A-NCFBPb were significantly enhanced in the incubation experiment in the presence of exogenous Pb compared to A-CFB and A-NCFB in the absence of exogenous Pb. The addition of CFB or NCFB was more effective in passivating exogenous Pb in paddy soils and promoted the gradual transformation of Pb from unstable to more stable forms in paddy soils to achieve the effect of passivating Pb. The greater amount of carboxyl functional groups in NCFB participated in the passivation of exogenous Pb, which made NCFB more effective than CFB in passivating Pb. NCFB was more effective than CFB in passivating exogenous Pb in paddy soils due to its rougher inner walls of honeycomb pores and abundant carboxyl functional groups. In tropical areas such as Hainan, coconut fiber biochar and its modification can be considered as an environmentally friendly candidate method for the remediation of soil Pb contamination.

TI  - Land Cover Classification Using Landsat 7 Data for Land Sustainability
T2  - WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of land use/land cover with the help of satellite image data and extraction of geographical features is a challenging problem as it requires continuous monitoring and accurate processing of the images. For environment change management, Land Use Land Cover (LULC) information plays a vital part. This paper proposes a way for the detection of LULC types such as buildings, vegetation, water bodies, etc. with the use of Landsat 7 multispectral satellite images in Sabarmati Riverfront region, Ahmedabad, India. Landsat images have become valuable as well as a free resource as it provides the factors like high resolution, temporal distribution, and availability for the detection of LULC. Further, the use of the QGIS tool based Maximum/Minimum likelihood classification helps to explore and object-based image classification. Thus, Continuous monitoring over the same area will give the difference of LULC resulting in rapid or slower growth of land cover land use region. The proposed method gave a high rate of success and approximate 70-80% accurate results of LULC over period of 2014-2022.

TI  - A modified BG-Sentinel trap equipped with FTA card as a novel tool for mosquito-borne disease surveillance: a field test for <i>flavivirus</i> detection
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Early detection of pathogens in vectors is important in preventing the spread of arboviral diseases, providing a timely indicator of pathogen circulation before outbreaks occur. However, entomological surveillance may face logistical constraints, such as maintaining the cold chain, and resource limitations, such as the field and laboratory workload of mosquito processing. We propose an FTA card-based trapping system that aims to simplify both field and laboratory phases of arbovirus surveillance. We modified a BG-Sentinel trap to include a mosquito collection chamber and a sugar feeding source through an FTA card soaked in a long-lasting viscous solution of honey and hydroxy-cellulose hydrogel. The FTA card ensures environmental preservation of nucleic acids, allowing continuous collection and feeding activity of specimens for several days and reducing the effort required for viral detection. We tested the trap prototype during two field seasons (2019 and 2021) in North-eastern Italy and compared it to CDC-CO2 trapping applied in West Nile and Usutu virus regional surveillance. Collections by the BG-FTA approach detected high species diversity, including Culex pipiens, Aedes albopictus, Culex modestus, Anopheles maculipennis sensu lato and Ochlerotatus caspius. When used for two-days sampling, the BG-FTA trap performed equally to CDC also for the WNV-major vector Cx. pipiens. The FTA cards detected both WNV and USUV, confirming the reliability of this novel approach to detect viral circulation in infectious mosquitoes. We recommend this surveillance approach as a particularly useful alternative in multi-target surveillance, for sampling in remote areas and in contexts characterized by high mosquito densities and diversity.

TI  - The effects of climate change-induced flooding on harvest failure in Burkina Faso: case study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundClimate change leads to more frequent and severe extreme weather events including floods, heatwaves, heavy rainfalls, and droughts. In contrast to the majority of research on weather extremes in sub-Saharan Africa, which focus primarily on how a lack of rainfall causes droughts, this paper aims to elucidate the effect of flooding on harvest failure in rural Burkina Faso. MethodsWe conducted a case study in north-western Nouna, Burkina Faso, between August and December 2021 covering a study population of n = 180 participants. The study comprised four components: (i) interviews with farmers (n = 180) on whether any of their fields had been inundated and if so, on harvest loss on these fields; (ii) determining the feasibility of using Sentinel-2 satellite images to validate study participants reports of floods; (iii) characterizing short-term weather including frequency and duration, of extreme rainfall events within the study area, as well as comparing cumulative rainfall (long-term) over the past 50 years; and (v), estimating both the food energy and economic loss of harvest failure due to flooding. Results49% of interviewed farmers (n = 88) reported that floods had damaged at least one of their fields. Some fields (n = 13, 7%) had no harvest due to flooding, while some farmers (n = 14, 8%) had lost part of their harvest. Images from the Sentinel-2-Satellite indicated that reported and remotely observed flooding were consistent. According to time series of data from the local weather station, there has been an increase irregular rainfall distribution and at the same time of cumulative annual rainfall in Nouna. Furthermore, a first illustrative calculation allowed us to estimate the amount of energy lost when one hectare of a common crop is flooded. ConclusionThis case study demonstrated that flood-related harvest failures leading to crop losses in sub-Saharan Africa, exemplified by Burkina Faso, are likely to be substantial. This study serves as a proof-of-principle for flooding effects on food security. This could provide more detail for agricultural adaptation and mitigation strategies. Inundation-vulnerable fields need alternative and novel management practices, which may only be effectively implemented if agricultural institutions and national policy-making bodies receive evidence of flooding e.g., from remote sensing.

TI  - Advances in the genetic characterization of the malaria vector, <i>Anopheles funestus,</i> and implications for improved surveillance and control
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Anopheles mosquitoes present a major public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa; notably, as vectors of malaria that kill over half a million people annually. In parts of the east and southern Africa region, one species in the Funestus group, Anopheles funestus, has established itself as an exceptionally dominant vector in some areas, it is responsible for more than 90% of all malaria transmission events. However, compared to other malaria vectors, the species is far less studied, partly due to difficulties in laboratory colonization and the unresolved aspects of its taxonomy and systematics. Control of An. funestus is also increasingly difficult because it has developed widespread resistance to public health insecticides. Fortunately, recent advances in molecular techniques are enabling greater insights into species identity, gene flow patterns, population structure, and the spread of resistance in mosquitoes. These advances and their potential applications are reviewed with a focus on four research themes relevant to the biology and control of An. funestus in Africa, namely: (i) the taxonomic characterization of different vector species within the Funestus group and their role in malaria transmission; (ii) insecticide resistance profile; (iii) population genetic diversity and gene flow, and (iv) applications of genetic technologies for surveillance and control. The research gaps and opportunities identified in this review will provide a basis for improving the surveillance and control of An. funestus and malaria transmission in Africa.

T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWe aimed to define the indications for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), the third option for cervical treatment in oral cancer with negative cervical lymph nodes. MethodsThe greatest depth of invasion (DOI) and long diameter (LD) of the primary site were used as exposures. SLN metastasis was considered the outcome. ResultsIn three trials conducted between 2009 and 2016, 158 patients were eligible and reassigned to this study group. The scatterplot based on the respective values of DOI and LD would eventually be divided into three sections. In cases of sections T1, T2, and T3, the proportions of SLN metastasis positivity were 21.3%, 35.3%, and 51.2%, respectively. In certain cases of T1 with 2 mm < DOI & LE; 5 mm and 8 mm < LD & LE; 20 mm, the proportion of SLN metastasis positivity was 40.9%. ConclusionsSLNB-navigated or assisted neck dissection can be added as an effective procedure for N0 neck control.

TI  - Treatment of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in HIT in mice using deglycosylated KKO: a novel therapeutic?
T2  - BLOOD ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is characterized by thrombocytopenia associated with a highly prothrombotic state due to the development of pathogenic antibodies that recognize human platelet factor 4 (hPF4) complexed with various polyanions. Although nonheparin anticoagulants are the mainstay of care in HIT, subsequent bleeding may develop, and the risk of developing new thromboembolic events remain. We previously described a mouse immunoglobulin G2b & kappa; (IgG2b & kappa;) antibody KKO that mimics the sentinel features of pathogenic HIT antibodies, including binding to the same neoepitope on hPF4-polyanion complexes. KKO, like HIT IgGs, activates platelets through Fc & gamma;RIIA and induces complement activation. We then questioned whether Fc-modified KKO could be used as a novel therapeutic to prevent or treat HIT. Using the endoglycosidase EndoS, we created deglycosylated KKO (DGKKO). Although DGKKO retained binding to PF4-polyanion complexes, it inhibited Fc & gamma;RIIA-dependent activation of PF4-treated platelets triggered by unmodified KKO, 5B9 (another HIT-like monoclonal antibody), and IgGs isolated from patients with HIT. DGKKO also decreased complement activation and deposition of C3c on platelets. Unlike the anticoagulant fondaparinux, injection of DGKKO into HIT mice lacking mouse PF4, but transgenic for hPF4 and Fc & gamma;RIIA, prevented and reversed thrombocytopenia when injected before or after unmodified KKO, 5B9, or HIT IgG. DGKKO also reversed antibody-induced thrombus growth in HIT mice. In contrast, DGKKO was ineffective in preventing thrombosis induced by IgG from patients with the HIT-related anti-PF4 prothrombotic disorder, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Thus, DGKKO may represent a new class of therapeutics for targeted treatment of patients with HIT.

TI  - [Changes in Ozone Pollution Trend Characteristics and Sensitivity in Jinan from 2015 to 2020].
T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The surface ozone (O3) spatiotemporal distribution, variations, and its causes in Ji'nan from 2015 to 2020 were revealed based on the air quality monitoring network data and satellite retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The results showed that the ozone concentration in Ji'nan gradually increased from 2015 to 2020. The annual 90th percentile of the daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) O3(namely the annual evaluation value) and the MDA8 O3(April-September) increased by 4.8 mug·(m3·a)-1 and 3.8 mug·(m3·a)-1, respectively. The trend of the ozone levels in the high-concentration range increased faster than that in the low-concentration range. The MDA8 in June increased by 7.4 mug·(m3·a)-1, and the rate range of increases was 2.6-3.9 mug·(m3·a)-1 in the cool seasons (December-February); thus, the O3 control in winter cannot be ignored. It is apparent from the diurnal variations in ozone from 2015 to 2020 in April-September that the average ozone levels have risen in recent years. The growth rate in the daytime was higher than that at night. The capacity of photochemical production has been increasing, especially in recent years. Additionally, it is noteworthy that the peak time for ozone levels occurred approximately 1-2 h earlier. The disparity of ozone concentrations among different stations gradually decreased in recent years. Compared with that in 2015, the range of areas with high O3 concentrations in 2019-2020 was further expanded. The significant positive trends in MDA8-90th and MDA8 (April-September) were observed in 16.1% and 22.6% of the monitoring sites in Ji'nan (P<0.05), most of which were located in urban areas and the suburbs close to urban areas. The temporal and spatial changes in ozone in Jinan had been affected by the changes in VOCs and NOx emissions since 2015. Satellite remote sensing data from 2015 to 2020 revealed that the NO2 tropospheric columns (April-September) showed reductions of 20.6%, with a decreasing rate of 0.3*1015 mole·(cm2·a)-1, especially in the urban areas and suburbs. The detected variation trends of tropospheric HCHO were weak and insignificant, which suggested that the decrease in NOx emissions was much greater than the decrease in VOCs emissions, and the gap had become more obvious in the urban areas. With responses to precursor emissions, the chemical sensitivity of O3 formation had been changing. The VOCs-limited regimes continuously decreased, and the mixed NOx/VOCs-sensitive regimes and NOx-limited regimes increased. In general, such an extremely inappropriate control ratio of ozone precursor NOx/VOCs led to an overall trend of slow increasing fluctuations of O3 in Ji'nan. The findings clearly indicate that the reduction of VOCs in Ji'nan was far from sufficient, and strengthening the current control of VOCs emissions is an effective measure to control the growth trend of O3 pollution in Ji'nan in the near future, especially in urban and surrounding suburban areas.

TI  - Assimilating FY3D-MWRI 23.8 GHz observations in the CMA-GFS 4DVAR system based on a pseudo All-Sky data assimilation method
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In the current operational four-dimensional variational (4DVar) data assimilation (DA) system of the Global Forecast System developed by the China Meteorology Administration (CMA-GFS), all microwave observation data in cloud and precipitation regions are discarded during pre-processing. This study implemented a Pseudo All-Sky DA (referred to as PAS-DA hereafter) subsystem in the operational cycle version of the CMA-GFS (CMA-GFS v3.2). The term "pseudo" in this study indicates that the Jacobians of brightness temperature with respect to hydrometeors from the adjoint radiative transfer model were temporarily neglected. Specifically, a liquid hydrometeor sensitive channel (23.8 GHz V pol.) of the MicroWave Radiation Imager on the platform of FengYun-3D (FY3D-MWRI) was selected to assess the impact of the all-sky assimilation approach using the PAS-DA subsystem. In the observation error model, we proposed a new cumulative distribution function (CDF) bias correction method for the cloud proxy in consideration of large discrepancies between the probability density functions (PDFs) of the observed-cloud-proxy and simulated-cloud-proxy (known as "cloud bias"). Results of single-observation experiments justified that the present PAS-DA subsystem could extend analysis increments to cloud regions, meanwhile correcting the errors of humidity analysis according to the mislocation of cloud distributions. In addition, the forecast experiments that were run for 1 month of the 6 hr PAS-DA cycle in July and August 2021 demonstrate obvious superiority of the PAS-DA over the current operational clear-sky DA cycle: (a) root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of humidity analysis were reduced by about 10% in the tropics, (b) significant improvements in humidity forecasts could be sustained for 96 hr and (c) many other forecast scores in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere also benefit from the PAS-DA approach. Therefore, the PAS-DA could be used for all-sky assimilation studies and particularly for understanding how the all-sky assimilation approach works, although the PAS-DA serves as a transition scheme from the clear-sky to "true" all-sky DA.

AB  - Thermodynamics is regarded as a universal but not foundational theory because its laws for macroscopic quantities have not been derived from microscopic entities. Thus, to root thermodynamics into the fundamental substance, atomism is revived, thinking that the light quantum is the indivisible and permanent element. Assuming the same basic building blocks constitute everything, the state of any system can be quantified by entropy, the logarithmic probability measure multiplied by Boltzmann's constant. Then, the change in entropy expresses the system's evolution toward thermodynamic balance with its surroundings. These natural processes consuming free energy in the least time accumulate sigmoidally, resulting in skewed distributions found throughout nature. In this way, thermodynamics makes sense of phenomena across disciplines and provides a holistic worldview to address questions such as what the world is, how we know about it, what is the meaning of life and how we should live.This article is part of the theme issue ''Thermodynamics 2.0: Bridging the natural and social sciences (Part 1)'.

TI  - Complement terminal pathway inhibition reduces peritoneal injuries in a rat peritonitis model
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Peritonitis and the resulting peritoneal injuries are common problems that prevent long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy in patients with end-stage kidney diseases. Previously, we have analyzed the relationship between the complement system and progression of peritoneal injuries associated with PD, particularly focusing on the early activation pathways and effects of the anaphylatoxins. We here utilized a novel mAb 2H2 that blocks assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC) to investigate roles of the complement terminal pathway in PD-associated peritoneal injury. We intraperitoneally injected mAb 2H2 anti-C5b-7 (2.5 or 5 mg/rat) once or twice over the five-day course of the experiment to investigate the effects of inhibiting formation of MAC in a fungal rat peritonitis model caused by repeated intraperitoneal administration of zymosan after methylglyoxal pretreatment (Zy/MGO model). Rats were sacrificed on day 5 and macroscopic changes in both parietal and visceral peritoneum evaluated. Peritoneal thickness, the abundance of fibrinogen and complement C3 and MAC deposition in tissue and accumulation of inflammatory cells were pathologically assessed. The results showed that mAb 2H2, but not isotype control mAb, reduced peritoneal thickness and accumulation of inflammatory cells in a dose and frequency-dependent manner in the Zy/MGO model. These effects were accompanied by decreased C3, MAC, and fibrinogen deposition in peritoneum. In conclusion, in the rat Zy/MGO model, complement terminal pathway activation and MAC formation substantially contributed to development of peritoneal injuries, suggesting that MAC-targeted therapies might be effective in preventing development of peritoneal injuries in humans.To investigate roles of the terminal pathway (TP) of the complement system (C), we utilized a novel mAb 2H2 (anti-C5b-7) that blocks assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC) to investigate roles of the TP in PD-associated peritoneal injury using a fungal rat peritonitis model caused by repeated intraperitoneal administration of zymosan (Zy) after methylglyoxal pretreatment (Zy/MGO model).

AB  - PurposeThis mini-review aims to provide an overview of the current role of molecular imaging to guide surgery in patients with breast cancer, in non-palpable primary tumours as well as in the management of the axilla in early-stage cancers and when patients receive neoadjuvant systemic therapy.MethodsLiterature research in the PubMed/MEDLINE database was carried out to identify relevant studies evaluating molecular imaging to guide surgery in breast cancers including molecular breast imaging; breast-specific PET systems; radioguided occult lesion localisation; sentinel node and occult lesion localisation; radioactive seed localisation; sentinel lymph node biopsy and marking axillary lymph nodes with radioactive iodine seeds procedure.ResultsWe summarised the most relevant results on molecular imaging to guide surgery in breast cancers focusing on indications, technical aspects, accuracy and future perspectives.ConclusionsSeveral interventional nuclear medicine techniques are currently available for the management of patients affected by breast cancer in different clinical settings. They provide diagnostic advantages in sub-centimetric lesions or low-grade tumours and help to guide biopsy, also identifying the area with the highest degree of perfusion or metabolism. Nevertheless, some of them are too expensive and not widely spread in hospitals or clinicians still lack confidence in their usage. Further studies are needed to optimise their role in everyday clinical practice.

TI  - Precipitation explains GRACE water storage variability over large endorheic basins in the 21st century
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Seasonal-interannual variations in surface water storage revealed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites have received less attention than storage trends in the literature. We focus on six large endorheic basins and develop variability attribution diagnostics against independent precipitation and evapotranspiration (hereafter P and E) datasets.Methods: We generate a flux-inferred storage (FIS), representing the integral of the component flux anomalies into and out of a region, enabling a comparison between the P and E contributions to GRACE water storage anomalies on seasonal to interannual timescales. Additionally, a monthly budget closure approach is applied, giving self-consistent coupled water and energy exchanges from 2002 to 2020.Results: On seasonal timescales, P and E data show insufficient cancellation, implying over-large seasonal variations in surface storage. In most basins, P drives the seasonal storage cycle with E dampening storage amplitudes, although in the Caspian Basin, seasonal storage is driven by E, with P remaining seasonally constant when integrated over the whole drainage basin. Budget closure mostly adjusts E, which has larger uncertainties, in fitting the GRACE data. On year-to-year and multi-year timescales, there is a strong correlation between P-driven storage and the observed GRACE variability, which ranges between 0.55 and 0.88 across all basins, and this is maintained after budget closure. However, storage changes driven by P alone from GPCP are too large compared to GRACE, with E data from FLUXCOM generally having only very weakly compensating interannual variations. After budget closure, interannual E variability is substantially increased. Closed energy budgets often show interannual amplitudes, partly driven by radiation and partly by water budget variation through shared latent heat losses, although these have not been independently verified.Discussion: Although water flux trends cannot be detected with significance due to the large interannual variability, the strong agreement between multi-annual GRACE storage and precipitation variations, especially over the Caspian basin, lends no support to the suggestion that E changes driven by climate change are responsible for water storage trends seen by GRACE.

TI  - A comparison of FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC radio occultation and ionosonde measurements in sporadic E detection over mid- and low-latitude regions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The investigation of sporadic E or Es layers typically relies on ground-based or satellite data. This study compares the Es layers recorded in ionograms with those detected using GNSS L1 signal-to-noise ratio data from FORMOSAT3/COSMIC radio occultation at mid and low latitudes. GPS radio occultation measurements of Es layers, during an 11-year time span of 2007-2017, within a 2 degrees latitude x 5 degrees longitude grid around each ionosonde site are compared to the Es recordings of the ionosonde. By comparing multi-year radio occultation data with recordings from six ionosonde stations at mid and low latitudes, it was discovered that at least 20% of the Es layer detection results between each ionosonde and its crossing GPS radio occultation measurements did not agree. The results show that the agreement between the two methods in Es detection is highly dependent on the season and local time. This study suggests that Es layer recordings from ground-based ionosonde observations have the best agreement with the Es layers detected by radio occultation data during daytime and local summers. The difference in the Es detection mechanisms between the two methods can explain the inconsistency between Es events measured by these two methods. The detection of Es layers in ionograms relies on the high plasma concentration in the E region, whereas signal scintillations caused by a large vertical gradient of the plasma density in the E region are considered a sign of Es occurrence in satellite techniques.

TI  - The performance of speckle filters on Copernicus Sentinel-1 SAR images containing natural oil slicks
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is traditionally used in the identification, mapping and analysis of petroleum slicks, regardless of their origin. On SAR images, oil slicks appear as dark patches that contrast with the brightness of the surrounding sea surface. This distinction allows for automated detection algorithms to be designed using computer vision methods for objective oil slick identification. Nevertheless, efficient interpretation of the SAR imagery by statistical analysis can be diminished due to the speckle effect present on SAR images, a granular artefact associated with the coherent nature of SAR that visually degrades the image quality. In this study, a quantitative and qualitative assessment of common SAR image despeckling methods is presented, analysing their performance when applied to images containing natural oil slicks. The assessment is performed on Copernicus Sentinel-1 images acquired with various temporal and environmental conditions. The assessment covers a diverse array of filters that employ Bayesian and non-linear statistics in the spatial, transform and wavelet domains, focussing on their demonstrated performance and capabilities for edge and texture retention. In summary, the results reveal that filters using local statistics in the spatial domain produce consistent desired effects. The novel SAR-BM3D algorithm can be used effectively, albeit with a higher computational demand.

TI  - Impacts of clumping effect on canopy reflectance using 3D radiative transfer modeling
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The product of leaf area index (LAI) and clumping index (CI) quantifies the effective leaf abundance and distribution across the landscape, and therefore, governs the radiation absorption, evapotranspiration, and carbon assimilation processes in the terrestrial ecosystems. Previous studies were mainly focused on developing inversion methods applicable to large scale for retrieving LAI and CI from multi-angular satellite observations. However, a few studies focused on quantifying the sensitivity of canopy bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) to changes in CI in a forward manner, hampering an accurate understanding of the relationship between CI and BRDF. In this study, we simulated how BRDF responds to changes in CI in Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) forests based on a 3D radiative transfer model LESS and ground-measured data. We found that the LESS model effectively simulated the hot-spot, roof, and bowl-edge characteristics of the canopy BRDF by changing the sun-sensor geometry. We constructed forest scenes with variable CI (ranging from 0.4 to 0.8) to investigate the clumping effect on BRDF with different solar and observation angles. The red band bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) showed higher sensitivity to changes in CI than that in the near-infrared (NIR) band. Canopy BRFs in the red band along the principal plane and cross principal planes measured in different seasons showed consistent sensitivity to changes in CI, suggesting that the red band BRF is helpful for CI inversion for forests with different levels of foliage clumping. In the NIR band, canopy BRFs along the principal plane measured in growing seasons [with solar zenith angle (SZA) <40 & DEG;] and the cross principal plane measured in non-growing seasons (with SZA >40 & DEG;) were sensitive to changes in CI in highly clumped forests (with CI ranging from 0.4 to 0.6). However, canopy BRF in the NIR band showed low sensitivity to changes in CI in highly clumped forests (CI <0.6), especially along the cross principal plane when SZA was approximately 10 & DEG;. The simulated BRFs in the red and NIR bands showed relatively low sensitivity to changes in SZAs at a VZA of 40 & DEG; and 0 & DEG;, respectively. We highly recommend including the red band BRF for CI retrievals, and using a VZA of 40 & DEG; in the red band and 0 & DEG; in the NIR band may help reduce the CI estimation uncertainty caused by changes in SZA. This research provides a new perspective for understanding the sensitivity of multi-angular satellite data to changes in canopy structural characteristics of vegetation in global ecosystem studies and may help improve CI estimations using the multiangular optical remote sensing data.

TI  - Using high-resolution LiDAR-derived canopy structure and topography to characterise hibernaculum locations of the hazel dormouse
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The hazel dormouse is predominantly an arboreal species that moves down to the ground to hibernate in the autumn in temperate parts of its distributional ranges at locations not yet well understood. The main objective of this study is to test whether environmental characteristics surrounding hazel dormouse hibernacula can be identified using high-resolution remote sensing and data collected in situ. To achieve this, remotely sensed variables, including canopy height and cover, topographic slope, sky view, solar radiation and cold air drainage, were modelled around 83 dormouse hibernacula in England (n = 62) and the Netherlands (n = 21), and environmental characteristics that may be favoured by pre-hibernating dormice were identified. Data on leaf litter depth, temperature, canopy cover and distance to the nearest tree were collected in situ and analysed at hibernaculum locations in England. The findings indicated that remotely sensed data were effective in identifying attributes surrounding the locations of dormouse hibernacula and when compared to in situ information, provided more conclusive results. This study suggests that remotely sensed topographic slope, canopy height and sky view have an influence on hazel dormice choosing suitable locations to hibernate; whilst in situ data suggested that average daily mean temperature at the hibernaculum may also have an effect. Remote sensing proved capable of identifying localised environmental characteristics in the wider landscape that may be important for hibernating dormice. This study proposes that this method can provide a novel progression from habitat modelling to conservation management for the hazel dormouse, as well as other species using habitats where topography and vegetation structure influence fine-resolution favourability.

TI  - Combining remote sensing, SPAD readings, and laboratory analysis for monitoring olive groves and olive oil quality
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The color of olive oil is influenced by chlorophyll pigments, which is one of the basic quality characteristics of olive oil. Furthermore, the concentration of chlorophyll pigments in olives and oil is related to the ripening stage of the fruit at harvest. In this study, the chlorophyll content (CC) of olive groves was estimated using vegetation indices. The field datasets include CC measurements made in the laboratory using a destructive method, as well as SPAD readings taken in the field from different olive groves. Thus, Sentinel-2 time-series data were collected during the years 2021 and 2022, processed and used in to evaluate three vegetation indices (VIs), namely the Transformed Chlorophyll in Reflectance Index and the Optimised Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI), the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the Green Chlorophyll Index (CIgreen). The results demonstrated that the TCARI/OSAVI index is an accurate predictor of the phenological stage of olive trees. The CIgreen, using bands at 10 m spatial resolution, is highly correlated with SPAD-meter readings. The CC in olive oil is positively correlated with SPAD-meter readings in olive fruit in early stages of maturity (R-2 = 0.93), but there are inversely proportional in the late stages (R-2 = 0.67). Olive oil quality during the ripening process showed a slight decrease of the specific extinction coefficient K232, insignificant change of K270 coefficient and free acidity. In general, a decrease of CC and increase of oil content were observed in the late stages of maturity of olive fruit.

TI  - Validity of the Landsat surface reflectance archive for aquatic science: Implications for cloud-based analysis
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS
M3  - Letter
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Originally developed for terrestrial science and applications, the US Geological Survey Landsat surface reflectance (SR) archive spanning similar to 40 yr of observations has been increasingly utilized in large-scale water-quality studies. These products, however, have not been rigorously validated using in situ measured reflectance. This letter quantifies and demonstrates the quality of the SR products by harnessing a sizeable global dataset (N = 1100). We found that the Landsat 8/9 SR in the green and red bands marginally meet the targeted accuracy requirements (30%), whereas the uncertainties in the blue and coastal-aerosol bands ranged from 48% to 110%. We further observed > +25% biases in the visible bands of Landsat 5/7 SR, which can introduce an apparent downward trend when applied in time-series analyses combined with Landsat 8/9. Users must exercise caution when using this archive for trend analyses, and progress in atmospheric correction is required to foster advanced applications of the Landsat archive for aquatic science.

TI  - Systematic Review of GIS and Remote Sensing Applications for Assessing the Socioeconomic Impacts of Mining
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - As the mining industry expands, a comprehensive understanding of its socioeconomic risks and benefits is urgently needed. This paper systematically reviews 71 studies (1996-2021) that utilized spatially integrated approaches to evaluate socioeconomic mining impacts. The number of studies that utilize geographic information systems and remote sensing to study mining impacts increased from 2014 onwards. A framework was used to classify the mining impacts studied in the literature and all eight framework categories - Environment, Land, People, Community, Culture, Livelihoods, Infrastructure and Housing - were captured by the literature though Culture was least studied. Coal mining, active mining phase, Landsat data and classic remote sensing algorithms were most highlighted. Future research should focus on advancing geospatial technology like artificial intelligence (AI) to better capture intangible socioeconomic impacts, under-researched minerals and long-term mine lifecycle components. Spatially referenced social data can improve stakeholder involvement and support spatially explicit planning to ensure sustainability.

TI  - Spatial predictions and uncertainties of forest carbon fluxes for carbon accounting
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Countries have pledged to different national and international environmental agreements, most prominently the climate change mitigation targets of the Paris Agreement. Accounting for carbon stocks and flows (fluxes) is essential for countries that have recently adopted the United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting - ecosystem accounting framework (UNSEEA) as a global statistical standard. In this paper, we analyze how spatial carbon fluxes can be used in support of the UNSEEA carbon accounts in five case countries with available in-situ data. Using global multi-date biomass map products and other remotely sensed data, we mapped the 2010-2018 carbon fluxes in Brazil, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Sweden and the USA using National Forest Inventory (NFI) and local biomass maps from airborne LiDAR as reference data. We identified areas that are unsupported by the reference data within environmental feature space (6-47% of vegetated country area); cross-validated an ensemble machine learning (RMSE=9-39 Mg C ha(-1) and R-2=0.16-0.71) used to map carbon fluxes with prediction intervals; and assessed spatially correlated residuals (<5 km) before aggregating carbon fluxes from 1-ha pixels to UNSEEA forest classes. The resulting carbon accounting tables revealed the net carbon sequestration in natural broadleaved forests. Both in plantations and in other woody vegetation ecosystems, emissions exceeded sequestration. Overall, our estimates align with FAO-Forest Resource Assessment and national studies with the largest deviations in Brazil and USA. These two countries used highly clustered reference data, where clustering caused uncertainty given the need to extrapolate to under-sampled areas. We finally provide recommendations to mitigate the effect of under-sampling and to better account for the uncertainties once carbon stocks and flows need to be aggregated in relatively smaller countries. These actions are timely given the global initiatives that aim to upscale UNSEEA carbon accounting.

TI  - Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the PrEP Cascade at Two Veterans Affairs Healthcare Systems
T2  - AIDS AND BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Overall, fewer Veterans were eligible for PrEP in 2020, compared to 2019, and 2018 (Maryland Veterans Affairs Health Care System- MVAHCS-: n = 890 (2020), n = 1533 (2019); Washington DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center -DC VAMC- n = 1119 (2020), n = 1716 (2019)). While the proportion of Veterans engaged in PrEP out of those eligible for PrEP increased in 2020 compared to 2019 at both sites (MVAHCS: 5.73% (2020) vs. 3.39% (2019) p-value = 0.006; F = 7.58, and DC VAMC: 15.91% (2020) vs. 9.38% (2019) p-value < 0.001; F = 27.64), the absolute number of Veterans engaged in PrEP remained unchanged (MVAHCS n = 51 (2020) and n = 52 (2019); DC VAMC n = 178 (2020) and n = 161 (2019)). Engagement in PrEP was significantly lower among Black Veterans compared to White Veterans at the DC VAMC across all FY with a widening gap in 2020. Cisgender women were less likely to be engaged in PrEP compared to cisgender men at both sites and throughout all FY with a wider gender gap in 2020. There were no significant differences in retention in PrEP between FY.Anticipated improvements in linkage, engagement, and retention in PrEP in 2020 at the MVAHCS and DC VAMC may not have been seen due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, engagement rates in PrEP remained low overall, particularly among Black Veterans and cisgender women. Novel PrEP delivery models are needed to engage these populations in PrEP following the COVID-19 pandemic. Interactive dashboards and tele-PrEP may have played a big role in sustained retention in PrEP at the VHA.

TI  - Cutaneous melanoma
T2  - LANCET
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous melanoma is a malignancy arising from melanocytes of the skin. Incidence rates are rising, particularly in White populations. Cutaneous melanoma is typically driven by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from natural sunlight and indoor tanning, although there are several subtypes that are not related to ultraviolet radiation exposure. Primary melanomas are often darkly pigmented, but can be amelanotic, with diagnosis based on a combination of clinical and histopathological findings. Primary melanoma is treated with wide excision, with margins determined by tumour thickness. Further treatment depends on the disease stage (following histopathological examination and, where appropriate, sentinel lymph node biopsy) and can include surgery, checkpoint immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or radiotherapy. Systemic drug therapies are recommended as an adjunct to surgery in patients with resectable locoregional metastases and are the mainstay of treatment in advanced melanoma. Management of advanced melanoma is complex, particularly in those with cerebral metastasis. Multidisciplinary care is essential. Systemic drug therapies, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, have substantially increased melanoma survival following a series of landmark approvals from 2011 onward.

TI  - Thinning, selective harvesting and mangrove protection forests: Lessons learned and recommendations from the Vietnamese Mekong Delta
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To date, there have been controversies over the effects of thinning and selective harvesting (SH) on mangrove forests. Recently, thinning and SH regulations have been updated with limitation on intensity rates and the requirements for mangrove transplantation for mangrove protection forests of Vietnam. Crucial questions remain unanswered regarding whether upgraded thinning and SH have contributed to the mangrove loss, and whether they have resulted in longer-term negative effects on mangrove protection forests. We used the example of Kien Giang mangrove protection forest (KGMPF), Kien Giang, Vietnam as an appropriate case study to address the above questions. Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, Water Frequency Index, and Normalized Dif-ference Vegetation Index were calculated to understand the effects of upgraded thinning and SH on mangrove protection within KGMPF. The findings reveal that upgraded thinning and SH did not contribute to the loss of mangrove forests in KGMPF between 2005 and 2015. Likewise, these two silvicultural techniques have not created any negative effects on vegetation cover in the districts between 2005 and 2015. In addition, these techniques have not resulted in longer-term effects on the vegetation cover in KGMPF, with the vegetation cover being gradually increased in all four districts between 2020 and 2022. The findings of this study provide solid evidence that the termination of upgraded thinning and SH in Vietnam, Kien Giang and wider region may not be required.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewBreast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a major contributor to morbidity in breast cancer survivors. Immediate lymphatic reconstruction (ILR) has emerged as a promising surgical option for prevention of BCRL. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate recent literature on ILR in breast cancer patients.Recent FindingsShort-term outcomes of ILR at most centers have shown low BCRL rates similar to those seen with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Some centers reporting more than 4-year follow-up have demonstrated up to 50-75% BCRL risk reduction following axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Others have demonstrated equivocal results from ILR. ILR appears to be surgically and oncologically safe.ILR continues to be a promising surgical technique to reduce the risk of BCRL following ALND. Ongoing evaluation is needed to characterize the extent of protective effect conferred by ILR.

An upward expansion of A. alba to the subalpine belt is observed in the last decades as a result of stand maturation after logging cessation.ContextHigh-mountain forests constitute sensitive locations to monitor the impacts of global change on tree-species composition and ecotone dynamics. In this study, we focus on the Spanish Pyrenees where silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) coexists with mountain pine (Pinus uncinata Ramond.) forming montane-subalpine ecotones.AimsThe main goal of this study is to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of the silver fir-mountain pine ecotone and its underlying driving factors.MethodsWe reconstructed the spatial distribution and dynamics of the species by combining remote sensing imagery and field plot data from 1989 to 2015, employing support vector machine techniques for image classification. Using variance analysis and mixed effects models, we then analyzed the evolution of basal area and replacement index, a measure of relative change in species composition, over time and altitude range. Additionally, we explored their relationship with site factors and protection level (National Park vs. protection buffer zone).ResultsSilver fir has expanded its distribution in both the National Park and the protection buffer zone, whereas mountain pine has remained stable. Both species exhibit increased basal area associated with stand maturation and a higher level of protection. The replacement index indicates a rise in silver fir in the understory on North-facing slopes, attributed to stand densification. These findings are particularly noticeable in the area with the highest level of protection.ConclusionThe cessation of traditional land uses has led to ongoing stand densification, promoting succession and favoring the increased abundance of silver fir at its uppermost locations, where this species outcompetes mountain pine.

TI  - Operational interactions between humans and Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises, <i>Neophocaena phocaenoides</i>: An integrated spatial model in the northern Strait of Hormuz
T2  - ZOOLOGY IN THE MIDDLE EAST
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides) is a little-known cetacean under human pressure in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. In Iran, most sightings have been reported from the northern coasts of the Strait of Hormuz. We invested the spatial overlap between finless porpoise habitats and human activities in the Harra Protected Area and Biosphere Reserve in the north of the Strait of Hormuz. Suitable porpoise habitats were modeled using the Maxent model, employing 112 presence points and an array of physical seascape variables. A detailed (30 m) Landsat 8-derived depth layer was found as the most important factor determining porpoise distribution. The multi-criteria evaluation procedure was calibrated using a set of pairwise weighted and fuzzified layers including ship routes, and distance from main boat routes, coastal and port cities, and fishing zones to determine the intensity of human sea use. Results showed a significant spatial overlap of over 3,500 ha (8.7% of the region) between highly suitable porpoise habitats and human sea use areas, covering the whole entrance of the estuary where high-speed boats sail between northern and southern cities. Since the porpoise population is found in the study area only within the borders of the Harra Protected Area, limited fishing activities and low-speed boat movement inside the zone of overlap are suggested to lower the human-porpoise interaction in the region.

TI  - Toxicopathic effects of waterborne Cd in sole juveniles, a prospective pollution monitoring sentinel for estuarine ecosystems
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionEstuarine ecosystems are under high anthropogenic pressure and receive a wide Q7 variety of contaminants, including metals. They can remain trapped in estuarine sediments at high concentrations for long periods but eventually they can be released to the overlying water and become toxic for the resident benthic biota. As a consequence, biomonitoring programs surveying the health status of estuaries and coastal areas count with benthic species for the assessment of health disturbances in these specific ecosystems. The present investigation aims at recognizing toxicopathic effects elicited in estuarine life stages of the benthic fish Solea senegalensis on exposure to waterborne Cd, a model compound for metal contamination. MethodsBiological responses to metal exposure were assessed based on the application of a "biomarker + histopathology" approach. Two-year old sole juveniles were exposed to various concentrations of waterborne Cd for 3 and 7 days (Control; Low Cd: 1 & mu;g/l; Mid Cd: 10 & mu;g/l and High Cd: 1000 & mu;g/l). Liver samples were collected for chemical analysis at day 7. Biological samples were collected at days 3 and 7 for biochemical (brain and liver), histochemical (liver) and histopathological analysis (liver, gills and gonad). ResultsBrain acetyl cholinesterase was inhibited after 7 days exposure, indicating neurotoxic effects on exposure to 1000 & mu;g Cd/l. Hepatic catalase and glutathione-Stransferase were induced at day 3 and inhibited at day 7, which suggests a bell-shaped response. A dose-dependent lysosomal membrane destabilization in hepatocytes was recorded at day 7. In parallel, histopathological lesions in gills, liver and gonad were more frequent at day 7 in soles exposed to high Cd concentrations. DiscussionOverall, the "biomarker + histopathology" approach revealed that waterborne Cd causes toxicopathic effects in sole juveniles upon exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (10 & mu;g Cd/l). The effects were clearly time dependent, and thus it is conceivable that more severe biological effects would be elicited by these low concentrations of Cd at longer exposure periods. Therefore, biomarkers and histopathology in combination provide early-warning indications of altered health status after waterborne Cd exposure in sole juveniles, a prospective sentinel for biological effects assessment of metal contamination in pollution monitoring programs in estuaries and coastal areas.

TI  - How well is the basin plan meeting its objectives? From the perspective of the Coorong, a sentinel of change in the Murray-Darling Basin
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Freshwater aquatic ecosystems can be considered sentinels of change as they integrate signals from catchment, hydrology and biogeochemistry to provide an indication of how the system fluctuates. The Coorong estuary acts as a sentinel for the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), Australia. Its location at the terminus of the Murray-Darling River systems, which drains more than 1 million square kilometres across 22 major catchments, means that any change to climate, water extraction or land use in the upstream catchments will have repercussions for the Coorong. It therefore acts as an indicator of the health of the MDB and the effectiveness of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan at protecting this ecosystem. Environmental water secured through the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and establishment of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder has been critical to preventing significant ecosystem decline in the Coorong. For most water years in the last decade environmental water has contributed to the majority of flow through the barrages. This has exported salt from the basin, reduced influx of salt from the ocean, and expanded available habitat for fish in the Coorong. However, the environmental flows have not been sufficient to arrest sand build up, and dredges still operate at the Murray Mouth during all but the highest flow events. There is a clear case for continued water management and reform, extending beyond the boundaries of the MDB, to further increase security of water flowing along the river system through the barrages and supporting the ecological health of the Coorong, and by association the full MDB.

TI  - Peer victimization and Internet addiction among adolescents: The role of anger rumination and social dominance orientation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - IntroductionInternet addiction has garnered growing attention in recent years, and peer victimization plays a major contributor to adolescents' Internet addiction. However, little is known about the mediating and moderating mechanisms in the association between peer victimization and Internet addiction. Guided by cognitive behavioral model and worldview verification model, this study examined a moderated mediation model in which anger rumination at Time 1 (T1) mediated the association between peer victimization at T1 and Internet addiction at Time 2 (T2), and this mediation effect was moderated by T1 social dominance orientation (SDO). MethodsA short-term longitudinal design was adopted, incorporating two measurement occasions (with approximately 6-month intervals). Participants were 2597 adolescents (51.5% male, M-age = 13.9, SD = 0.60) from seven secondary schools in Zhengzhou City, China. All participants were invited to complete the self-reported questionnaires assessing peer victimization, anger rumination, SDO at T1 (December 2015) and Internet addiction at T2 (June 2016), respectively. A short-term longitudinal moderated mediation model was conducted to analyze the association between variables. ResultsThe results showed that T1 peer victimization was positively associated with T2 Internet addiction in which association was mediated by T1 anger rumination. T1 SDO moderated the associations between T1 peer victimization and T1 anger rumination and this effect was stronger with lower levels of SDO. In terms of gender differences, SDO moderated the associations between peer victimization and anger rumination only for boys. ConclusionsResults highlight that anger rumination is a potential mechanism explaining how peer victimization is related to Internet addiction and that this relation may be moderated by SDO.

TI  - Regional Nodal Irradiation and Post-Mastectomy Radiation Therapy After Up-Front Surgery
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of ReviewThis review serves to summarize available data impacting treatment decisions for the use of post-mastectomy radiation (PMRT) and regional nodal irradiation (RNI).Recent FindingsIn the last decade, there have been ongoing shifts in breast cancer management, including changes in the type and sequencing of systemic therapy tailored to receptor subtype and molecular profiling, changes to the surgical management of the regional nodes, and improvements in radiation treatment planning and delivery technology. In this chapter, we will consider historic and modern indications for PMRT and RNI after up-front surgery and discuss how the changing paradigms of surgical and systemic management continue to impact the role of PMRT and RNI.The majority of patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer will have some benefit from PMRT and/or RNI, but in the modern era, the impact may be modest, particularly for patients with low-volume nodal involvement. Clinical trial enrollment, tailored recommendations, and shared decision making are important to optimize treatment decisions.

TI  - Seasonal and interannual variability of the pelagic ecosystem and of the organic carbon budget in the Rhodes Gyre (eastern Mediterranean): influence of winter mixing
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rhodes Gyre is a cyclonic persistent feature of the general circulation of the Levantine Basin in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Although it is located in the most oligotrophic basin of the Mediterranean Sea, it is a relatively high primary production area due to strong winter nutrient supply associated with the formation of Levantine Intermediate Water. In this study, a 3D coupled hydrodynamic- biogeochemical model (SYMPHONIE/Eco3M-S) was used to characterize the seasonal and interannual variability of the Rhodes Gyre's ecosystem and to estimate an annual organic carbon budget over the 2013-2020 period. Comparisons of model outputs with satellite data and compiled in situ data from cruises and Biogeochemical-Argo floats revealed the ability of the model to reconstruct the main seasonal and spatial biogeochemical dynamics of the Levantine Basin. The model results indicated that during the winter mixing period, phytoplankton first progressively grow sustained by nutrient supply. Then, short episodes of convection driven by heat loss and wind events, favoring nutrient injections, organic carbon export, and inducing light limitation on primary production, alternate with short episodes of phytoplankton growth. The estimate of the annual organic carbon budget indicated that the Rhodes Gyre is an autotrophic area, with a positive net community production in the upper layer (0- 150 m) amounting to 31.2 +/- 6.9 g Cm-2 yr(-1). Net community production in the upper layer is almost balanced over the 7-year period by physical transfers, (1) via downward export (16.8 +/- 6.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and (2) through lateral transport towards the surrounding regions (14.1 +/- 2.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The intermediate layer (150-400 m) also appears to be a source of organic carbon for the surrounding Levantine Sea (7.5 +/- 2.8 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) mostly through the subduction of Levantine Intermediate Water following winter mixing. The Rhodes Gyre shows high interannual variability with enhanced primary production, net community production, and exports during years marked by intense heat losses and deep mixed layers. However, annual primary production appears to be only partially driven by winter vertical mixing. Based on our results, we can speculate that future increase of tem perature and stratification could strongly impact the carbon fluxes in this region.

AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to validate the DCIS-upstage model, a previously developed model to predict the risk of upstaging to invasive breast cancer in patients with biopsy-proven ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in a more recent cohort and to assess the model's clinical utility.MethodsThe model was validated in a registry cohort (n = 2269) and in an institution cohort (n = 302). A calibration plot was made, followed by a decision curve analysis (DCA). The model's area under the curve (AUC) was compared with the AUC of another published model and with the AUCs of new models using the risk factors of the DCIS-upstage model and additional risk factors.ResultsThe DCIS-upstage model had an AUC of 0.67 at development; in the validation, the AUC was 0.65 in the registry cohort and 0.73 in the institution cohort. The DCA showed that the model has clinical utility. The other published model had an AUC of 0.66 in the institution cohort. Adding risk factors to the DCIS-upstage model slightly increased the AUC.ConclusionsThe DCIS-upstage prediction model is valid in other cohorts. The model has clinical utility and may be used to select patients with biopsy-proven DCIS for sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Tolstoy on the injustice of the philosophy of education
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Tolstoy had a lifelong interest in education and philosophy. However, he was suspicious of using philosophy as a foundation for educational practice or applying philosophy to the educational problems of his day, most importantly, the development of an education system in Russia around the time of the emancipation of the serfs. Tolstoy's rejection of the philosophy of education arose from his concerns about what would be identified in contemporary terminology as 'epistemic injustice' or 'epistemicide'. How could European philosophy inform a curriculum and pedagogy for the Russian peasantry when the peasants' own forms of knowledge were more valuable to their ways of life? Tolstoy sought to answer this question by engaging with children in peasant schools. This experience informed the development of his own worldview, articulated in the latter years of his life-a vision of uniting the insights of indigenous peoples from various times and places to inform what he considered to be the pursuit of authentic knowledge. This article considers Tolstoy's apparent rejection of the philosophy of education, exploring how this seemingly bombastic position led to the evolution of an innovative meta-philosophy that offers some contribution to thinking about contemporary educational problems.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This study collected evidence on the use of early sown wheat varieties and complementary zero tillage technologies in Northwest India. Detailed information on farmers' knowledge, adoption decisions, personal experience, and perceptions of early sown wheat and zero tillage technologies were collected at the household level using different survey tools. Additional information on agricultural practices during the Rabi Season 2021/22 were collected at the plot level and geocoded. Overall, the dataset comprises responses from 1206 wheat farmers in 70 villages across 7 districts in Punjab and Haryana that were collected between September and October 2022. The villages were selected using stratified random sampling based on a sampling frame of 1722 communities that had been identified as predominantly wheat growing areas based on remote-sensing data from satellite images. The dataset provides rich information that may be used for assessing the diffusion and impact of recently developed wheat varieties designed for early sowing, identifying barriers to the wider adoption of these technologies, and informing policy making aimed at improving adoption and usage decisions of agricultural innovations.

TI  - Monitoring corn nitrogen nutrition index from optical and synthetic aperture radar satellite data and soil available nitrogen
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Nitrogen (N) nutrition index (NNI) is a reliable indicator of plant N status for field crops, but its determination is both labor- and cost-intensive. The utilization of remote sensing approaches for monitoring N, mainly in relevant crops such as of corn (Zea mays L.), will be critical for enhancing effective use of this nutrient. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess NNI predicted from optical and C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (C-SAR) satellite data and available soil N (N-av) at different vegetative growth stages for corn crop. Eleven field studies were conducted in the Pampas region (Argentina), applying five fertilizer N rates (0, 60, 120, 180, and 240 kg N ha(-1)), all at sowing time. Plant samples were collected at sixth-leaf (V-6), tenth-leaf (V-10), fourteen-leaf (V-14), and flowering (R-1). Using linear regression models, NNI was best predicted using only optical satellite data from V-6 to V-14, and integrating optical with C-SAR plus N-av at R-1. The best monitoring model integrated vegetation spectral indices, C-SAR and N-av data at V-10 with an adjusted R-2 of 0.75 achieved during calibration in the northern Pampa. During validation, it predicted NNI with an RMSE of 0.14 and a MAPE of 12% in the southeastern Pampa. The red-edge spectrum and Local Incidence Angle of C-SAR were necessary to monitor the corn N status via prediction of NNI. Thus, this study provided empirical models to remotely sensed corn N status within fields during vegetative period, serving as a foundational data for guiding future N management.

TI  - Topological defects law for migrating banded vegetation patterns in arid climates.
T2  - Science advances
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Self-organization and pattern formation are ubiquitous processes in nature. We study the properties of migrating banded vegetation patterns in arid landscapes, usually presenting dislocation topological defects. Vegetation patterns with dislocations are investigated in three different ecosystems. We show through remote sensing data analysis and theoretical modeling that the number of dislocations N(x) decreases in space according to the law N  log(x/B)/x, where x is the coordinate in the opposite direction to the water flow and B is a suitable constant. A sloped topography explains the origin of banded vegetation patterns with permanent dislocations. Theoretically, we considered well-established approaches to describe vegetation patterns. All the models support the law. This contrasts with the common belief that the dynamics of dislocations are transient. In addition, regimes with a constant distribution of defects in space are predicted. We analyze the different regimes depending on the aridity level and water flow speed. The reported decay law of defects can warn of imminent ecosystem collapse.

T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTo propose a new mode of HIV test and surveillance among population of men who have sex with men (MSM): Internet-based Self-sampling at home plus Laboratory testing of HIV total nucleic acid (TNA) in dried blood spot (DBS) (ISL of DBS TNA). Feasibility of ISL of DBS TNA was studied. Characteristics of the new mode and that of conventional surveillance mode at HIV voluntary counseling and testing clinic (VCT) were compared.MethodsA non-governmental organization (NGO) published the recruitment information on the WeChat public account. MSM filled in the questionnaire online, applied for self-sampling service package, and mailed the self made DBS to professional laboratory. The laboratory performed HIV TNA test and submitted the test results to online platform. Participants queried test results online with their unique ID. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) followed up participants with positive nucleic acid results using IDs and contact information. Rates were compared by using the Chi-Square test or Fisher's exact test.ResultsFour hundred twenty-three questionnaires were completed. 423 self-sampling service packages were sent out and 340 DBSs were returned to professional laboratory within one month with qualified rate of sampling as high as 95.0% (323/340). Seven samples were found to be TNA positive. Comparing ISL of DBS TNA with sentinel surveillance, it was found that there was a significant difference in the composition ratio of the two modes of surveillance population (P < 0.05). HIV prevalence of ISL of DBS as 2.17% was significantly lower than sentinel site as 8.96% (& chi;(2) = 14.953, P = 0.000 < 0.05).ConclusionsISL of DBS TNA proposed is feasible and has a high self-sampling qualification rate, good confidentiality. It is an effective supplement to routine sentinel surveillance and has important promotion value.

AB  - Spatial modeling can be used to predict future land cover changes based on past and present conditions. However, it is not yet known to what extent this model can be used to predict the future with reliable accuracy. Therefore, by using multi-temporal land cover data, this study aims to build an optimal model based on the calibration interval scenario. The optimal model is then used to predict and analyze changes in land cover in East Kalimantan in 2016-2036. 11 classified multi-temporal land cover maps from the Landsat Time Series using Random Forest in Google Earth Engine are used to model 14 calibration interval scenarios. A land Change Modeler is used to model and predict land cover change with 14 driving variables. The results of the classification of multi-temporal land cover maps show a good level of accuracy, with an Overall Accuracy value of 71.43-85.14% and a Kappa value of 0.667-0.827. Then 2016-2021 is one of the best scenarios with 5-year intervals where the accuracy of future predictions can still be relied upon for up to three prediction iterations. The calibration interval scenario approach in spatial modeling in East Kalimantan can be relied upon to show a decrease in forest cover from 2016 to 2021, with a deforestation rate of 651 km(2)/year. The prediction of land cover in 2036 estimates that the remaining forest cover area in East Kalimantan is 69.203 km(2). It is believed that topography is the most influential variable driving land cover change in East Kalimantan.

TI  - National Chauvinism, Group Identity Affirmation, and Trust in International Relations: Experimental Results from Ukraine
T2  - NATIONALITIES PAPERS-THE JOURNAL OF NATIONALISM AND ETHNICITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Research has found that affirming national identity can encourage the public's trust toward a foreign adversary. On the other hand, aggressor states have attempted to recategorize identity by promoting a superordinate identity that includes both aggressor and defender states. In comparison with national identity affirmation, we test how effective emphasis of a common identity might be in the context of Russia-Ukraine and evaluate the scope conditions under which such a strategy may backfire. We propose that the effectiveness of the two identity affirmation approaches should differ across people with varying levels of national chauvinism. We expect that high-in-chauvinism individuals will experience more worldview-conflict when exposed to promotion of superordinate identity. Experimental findings on Ukrainians' trust toward Russia in 2020 suggest a policy that emphasizes a common identity can backfire among highly chauvinistic Ukrainians in the Western region. This indicates that recategorizing one's nation as a member of a larger group may fuel resistance among individuals with a sense of nationalistic superiority. By contrast, highlighting Ukrainian national identity boosted trust toward Russia even among the more chauvinistic respondents in the Southeastern region. This study helps identify the scope conditions of identity affirmation as a way to increase trust in international relations.

TI  - A MODIS-Landsat cloud-based spatiotemporal downscaling algorithm to estimate land surface temperature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in the energy and water balance between the surface and the atmosphere. LST is typically retrieved from remote sensing data because of the lack of sufficient flux towers for meteorological data collection, which makes local availability of LST scarce. Remote sensing can provide data for large areas, but the spatial resolution of the data may be coarser than the temporal resolution (e.g. a daily revisit interval for satellite-based Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors), or conversely, the spatial resolution may be coarser than the temporal resolution (e.g. Landsat satellite images obtained every 16 days). This tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolutions has motivated researchers to develop methods and algorithms to create image collections with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. In this study, we used a cloud-based downscaling algorithm to create LST images with high temporal and spatial resolution for the southern region of Brazil using Google Earth Engine (GEE). A comparison of the downscaling estimates with thermal Landsat images showed that 65% of the root mean squared errors (RMSE) were lower than 2 K, and 77% of the correlation coefficients (R) were greater than 0.70, while 84% of the bias values were between -2 and 2 K. The downscaling estimates were also validated using in situ measurements. Overall, a comparison between in situ measurements and different LST retrieval methods differed slightly in accuracy, with average RMSE values between 1.55 and 4.32 K, bias between -1.07 and 3.96 K, and correlation coefficients of nearly 0.90. These results demonstrate that cloud computing can be used to retrieve LST with high spatiotemporal resolution.

TI  - Performance assessment of global open-access digital elevation models in China mainland coastal region
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) are the fundamental datasets for coastal ecosystem monitoring, and several global open-accessed DEMs have recently been reported. In coastal regions, a comprehensive vertical accuracy assessment of these DEMs has not yet been carried out. In this study, eight open-access DEM datasets, including SRTM-3, SRTM-1, TanDEM-X, ASTER GDEM v3, MERIT DEM, AW3D30, NASADEM, and CoastalDEM, were investigated across the coastal region of the Chinese mainland using high accuracy ICESat-2 data as a reference. Statistical tools including mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) were selected to describe the data error/uncertainty and spatial distribution. Moreover, the effects of elevation ranging, slope degree, geomorphogenesis and landuse on vertical accuracy were further analyzed to assess their applicability. The assessment results revealed that the CoastalDEM and NASADEM datasets had the highest accuracy, with MAE values of 1.68 and 1.88 m and RMSE values of 2.55 and 2.61 m, for 3-arc second and 1-arc second resolution DEMs, respectively. Other DEMs with close accuracies include AW3D30, SRTM-1, MERIT, and SRTM-3 DEM. The results proved that the CoastalDEM outperformed other datasets, indicating its applicability in coastal regions.

TI  - Comparative research on multi-algorithm of soil salinity monitoring based on Gaofen-5, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil ecosystem provides a guarantee for the ecological environment. Soil salinization is a typical land degradation problem. In order to explore the applicability of GF-5, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 remote sensing data in soil salinity research, this study selected Golmud of Qaidam Basin in China as the study area, using particle swarm optimization-artificial neural network (PSO-ANN), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and whale optimization algorithm-extreme learning machine (WOA-ELM) to predict soil salinity. The research results indicated that the correlation between Sentinel-2 and electric conductivity (EC) was higher than GF-5 and Sentinel-1. The simulation accuracy of models based on Sentinel-2 was slightly higher than that based on GF-5 and Sentinel-1. The three models' mean values of root mean square error (RMSE), R-2, and mean absolute error (MAE) of Sentinel-2 were slightly better than those of GF-5 and Sentinel-1, and the fitting accuracy of GF-5 was similar to that of Sentinel-1 on the whole. The result proved that Sentinel-1, GF-5, and Sentinel-2 were suitable for salinity monitoring because the strong penetrability and sensitivity of Sentinel-1, the high spectral resolution of GF-5, and the high spatial resolution of Sentinel-2. The performance of PSO-ANN was the best, and that of PLSR was the worst. The salinity mapping result of Sentinel-2 coupled with PSO-ANN proved that machine learning methods and spaceborne data could be used to study large-scale soil salinization.

TI  - Change detection over the Aral Sea using relative radiometric normalization based on deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The desertification of the Aral Sea causes various environmental destruction and local community collapse. In order to prepare countermeasures, changed areas caused by desertification should be quickly and accurately detected. However, if the radiometric dissimilarity between bi-temporal satellite images is severe, the probability of false detection increases. Therefore, a relative radiometric normalization (RRN) approach based on deep learning is proposed to accurately detect the changed areas. .To this end, a deep learning network is designed to extract pseudo-invariant features (PIFs), which is invariant pixels with similar spectral characteristics. More specifically, training dataset generated based on the center points of objects defined by applying an image segmentation are inputted to the network. After training the deep learning network, the PIFs are extracted by measuring the similarity between deep features. The radiometric dissimilarity is non-linearly normalized by estimating an artificial neural network based on the extracted PIFs. Then, changed areas by desertification are detected in object units by combining the pixel-based change map and the segmented objects. Bi-temporal Landsat-8 images acquired from the Aral Sea in 2013 and 2021 were used as experimental images. The proposed method showed sufficient performance for detecting the overall change in land cover due to desertification.

TI  - Application of geospatial technology for the land use/land cover change assessment and future change predictions using CA Markov chain model
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The study of changes in land use and land cover (LULC) is helpful in the understanding of change and management of environmental sustainability. As a result, the central Telangana districts are the focus of this study since they are under stress from both natural and human-caused problems. The examination of LULC variations and predictions for the region between 2007-2015 and 2021-2030 employed Landsat OLI datasets, TerrSet, and geographic information system (GIS) tools. The LULC image is produced using a Landsat dataset and classified using a support vector machine (SVM). Then, consecutively to project future LULC change, LULC maps were constructed using the CA Markov model. The four stages included were change analysis, transition possibility, change forecasting, and model validation. It is found that the vegetation and the arid landscape are stressed and accumulating. The total accuracy was above 87 percent, and the kappa statistic measurement was above 85 percent with a three-year target. The study has found using the Markov chain land change modeler that Medchal-Malkajgiri district urban settlements will grow by 46, 37, and 26% from 2021-2030, 2030-2050, and 2050-2100, respectively. On other hand, the Warangal (Hanamkonda) observed 39, 45, and 30% between 2021-2030, 2030-2050, and 2050-2100, respectively, and Rangareddy districts observed 60, 24, and 12% between 2021-2030, 2030-2050, and 2050-2100, respectively. Given that urban areas are especially susceptible to flash flooding, this research will offer policymakers advice and a framework on behalf of planning city growth and managing the available resources judiciously with utmost planning.

TI  - The power of integrating proximal and high-resolution remote sensing for mapping SOC stocks in agricultural peatlands
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background and aims Soil electrical conductivity (ECa) data derived from electromagnetic induction (EMI) is valuable for estimating peat thickness and soil organic carbon stocks (SOCstocks). However, generating ECa maps locally using geostatistics limits the coverage area. This study explores the use of digital soil mapping (DSM) with random forest (RF) and universal kriging (UK) to create high-resolution ECa maps from field survey EMI data. The objective is to enhance the predictive accuracy of SOCstocks models in peatlands by incorporating these ECa maps as environmental variables.Methods Three scenarios were evaluated, combining different environmental variables and modelling techniques for ECa mapping. Scenario 1 used spectral indices from RapidEye satellite data and RF. Scenario 2 included spectral indices and terrain derivatives from LiDAR, with RF. Scenario 3 integrated spectral indices, terrain derivatives from LiDAR, and UK. Afterwards, we evaluated the effectiveness of adding ECa maps as environmental variables for SOCstocks mapping. Finally, we incorporated ECa maps from scenario 2 and RF in three ways: (a) scenario 2 variables only, (b) ECa2 with scenario 2 variables, and (c) ECa3 with scenario 2 variables.Results Scenarios 2 ( ECa2) and 3 ( ECa3) outperformed scenario 1 ( ECa1). The inclusion of ECa maps significantly improved the accuracy of SOCstocks models.Conclusion Our study demonstrates that DSM, combined with RF and UK techniques, enables the generation of high-resolution ECa maps from field surveys in peatlands. Incorporating these ECa maps as environmental variables enhances the accuracy of SOCstocks mapping, providing valuable insights for peatland management and carbon stock estimation.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeTo verify the anterior capsule opacification (ACO) and contraction (ACC) of the ZCB00V intraocular lens (IOL), made of the same material as the AR40e with a high ACC rate.Study designRetrospective cohort study.MethodsWe evaluated 35 patients at 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months post phacoemulsification with either a ZCB00V (n = 35) or FY-60AD (n = 34) IOL implantation. The ACC rate was calculated using retroillumination images of the anterior segment, and the ACO was measured using anterior segment photographs and image analysis software. The contact grade between the IOL and anterior capsule was estimated from the Pentacam(& REG;) images.ResultsThe postoperative ACC rates (mean & PLUSMN; standard deviation) at 3 months were 1.03%& PLUSMN;2.54% for the ZCB00V and, and 7.12%& PLUSMN;9.47% for the FY-60AD. The ZCB00V-implanted eyes showed a significantly lower postoperative ACC at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months (P < 0.01). On the other hand, the FY-60AD-implanted eyes had more pronounced ACO, and a significantly larger area of opacification (62.24%& PLUSMN;21.32% vs. 16.90%& PLUSMN;8.34%; P = 0.0005). Pentacam(& REG;) analysis revealed a space between the anterior capsule and IOL surface in the ZCB00V-implanted eyes, whereas the anterior capsule firmly adhered to the IOL surface in the FY-60AD-implanted eyes.ConclusionThe ACC and ACO were significantly lower in eyes with ZCB00V IOLs compared to those with the FY-60AD. The anterior segment image analysis revealed that the elevated anterior rim of the ZCB00V IOL prevented adhesion between the anterior capsule and IOL optic surface, suggesting an open capsule effect.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Research on investigating spatial resolution effect on image-based wetland mapping was done, and reported finer resolution is more appropriate. But is Sentinel image more effective than Landsat image for delineating ox-bow lake, a cut-off channel of a river, and for mapping inundation frequency? Inundation frequency means regularly, water appears in a pixel. In order to obtain these answers, the present study used frequently used spectral indices like normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified NDWI (MNDWI), re-modified NDWI (RmNDWI) and ensemble vegetation inclusive aggregated water index (ViAWI). For obtaining inundation consistency character, the water presence frequency (WPF) approach was adopted. A set of accuracy matrices was applied for validating the resolution effect. Results revealed that among the used indices, MNDWI was found suitable for ox-bow lake mapping. But this index is not able to map vegetated part of the ox-bow lakes. This problem was resolved using ensemble ViAWI. Inundation frequency analysis exhibited that about 70% of the area is consistent with water presence and therefore is hydro-ecologically and economically viable, and no such major differences were recorded between Sentinel and Landsat images. The study further revealed that finer resolution Sentinel images are more effective in ox-bow lake mapping and characterising inundation frequency, but they were not significantly better. Accuracy difference between them was found at the very minimum. Therefore, the study recommended that in a Sentinel image sparse condition, Landsat images could alternatively be used without much accuracy departure, particularly on those water bodies where water appearance is not highly erratic.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas; however, there is a lack of large-scale studies on ground-level CH4 concentrations. We estimated global ground-level CH4 concentrations based on the CH4 columns from the Copernicus Sentinel-5 precursor satellite (S5P) and vertical profiles of CH4 concentrations simulated from the Atmospheric Chemical Transport Model (GEOS-Chem). The proposed approach had achieved a high predictive accuracy for monthly ground-level CH4 concentrations, with a correlation coefficient of 0.93 (p < 0.01) and RMSE of 29.93 ppb between the estimated CH4 concentrations and those of ground measurements from the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG). Compared with the S5P CH4 columns, the estimated ground-level CH4 concentration has a close spatial relationship with emissions. The high CH4 concentrations occurred in eastern China, northern India, western Russia, eastern U.S., and central Europe. Furthermore, the estimated ground-level CH4 concentrations could reflect the seasonal variations of the observations, with correlation coefficients from 0.14 to 0.92. Our findings highlight the importance of satellite observations on atmospheric CH4 in understanding the spatial and temporal emissions.

TI  - Retrieving PM10 Surface Concentration from AERONET Aerosol Optical Depth: The Cairo and Delhi Megacities Case Studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Large concentrations of air-suspended particulate matter (PM) in megacities represent an important health risk for their populations, but PM time series are often missing or too short to quantify the associated burden of diseases. In this study, we propose a model for retrieving the surface PM in Cairo (Egypt) and Delhi (India) from the automated measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD), precipitable water (PW), and Angstrom exponent (AE) performed by the sunphotometers of the Aerosol Robotics Network (AERONET). For this we exploit the (1) synchronous measurements performed from 2010 to 2015 at the headquarters of the Egyptian Meteorological Authority and in 2009 at the Gual Pahari station (25 km south of Delhi) and (2) the ERA5 estimate of the planetary boundary layer height (H). The correlation between the surface PM10 and the AOD is primarily controlled by the variations of PW and secondarily by those of H: for similar surface PM10 concentrations, the AOD tends to be the largest in summer because of the hygroscopic enhancement of the mass extinction efficiency (& sigma;) of the particles and their dilution in the more developed mixing layer. The variations of composition also play a significant role in Cairo. This effect, particularly marked in spring (coinciding with the dust season), can be parameterized as a linear function of AE. Finally, we show that the variations of the surface PM10 concentration at the two sites can be retrieved simply from those of the AOD, PW, AE and H. At the weekly temporal resolution, the agreement between the model and the observations is very good at the two locations (correlation coefficient > 0.81, relative mean absolute error < 15%). This validates indirectly the assumption made in the development of the model, namely that the aerosols are mostly confined to the mixing layer of the two megacities and not transported in the free atmosphere. Provided a few years of surface PM measurements are available, the methodology proposed in this study could be easily applied to any other AERONET station.

TI  - A graph multi-head self-attention neural network for the multi-point long-term prediction of sea surface temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of sea surface temperature has always been the focus of ocean meteorological research. However, existing sea surface temperature prediction methods have limited ability in spatial information extraction of sea surface temperature and also perform poorly in long-term prediction. To address these problems, we propose a multi-point long-term prediction method for sea surface temperature, which is named graph multi-head self-attention neural network (GMSAN). Firstly, GMSAN constructs an adaptive graph neural network, which can adaptively extract the spatial information between points and realize multi-point prediction of sea surface temperature. GMSAN then uses the multi-head self-attention mechanism to extract global dependence point by point from the historical series of sea surface temperature to improve its long-term forecasting ability. We use 35 years of sea surface temperature data from Bohai Sea for the experiment and predict the sea surface temperature in three time windows of 120 days, 180 days and 240 days. The experimental results show that our model can meet the demand of multi-point long-term prediction of sea surface temperature. In addition, compared with the best-performing sea surface temperature prediction model, GMSAN improves the average prediction accuracy by 4.4% at 28 points and 3.3% at 112 points.

AB  - The glacier database provides an opportunity to track its dynamics and address issues linked with water resources, hazards and sustainability. To better understand the dynamics of Eastern Dhauliganga basin, we mapped the clean and debris-covered glaciers by using satellite images from Landsat-series and Sentinel 2. The band-ratio based methods-NDSI (Normalised Difference Snow Index) and NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) were used to map the clean ice glaciers. The debris-covered glaciers were delineated using topographic parameters and thermal band of Landsat TM. The glacier extent and length change were monitored for 25 glaciers in the basin, of which 13 are clean ice and 12 are debris-covered glaciers. During the time period from 1994 to 2018, higher area loss was observed for clean ice glaciers (+/- 20.6%) compared with debris-covered glaciers (+/- 10.9%). The clean-ice glaciers retreated at a rate of 4.8-33.7 m/year, whereas debris-covered glaciers retreated at a rate of 2.9-28.8 m/year during 1994-2018.

TI  - Biophysical factors control invasive annual grass hot spots in the Mojave Desert
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive annual grasses can promote ecosystem state changes and habitat loss in the American Southwest. Non-native annual grasses such as Bromus spp. and Schismus spp. have invaded the Mojave Desert and degraded habitat through increased fire occurrence, severity, and shifting plant community composition. Thus, it is important to identify and characterize the areas where persistent invasion has occurred, identifying where subsequent habitat degradation has increased. Previous plot and landscape-scale analyses have revealed anthropogenic and biophysical correlates with the establishment and dominance of invasive annual grasses in the Mojave Desert. However, these studies have been limited in spatial and temporal scales. Here we use Landsat imagery validated using an extensive network of plot data to map persistent and productive populations of invasive annual grass, called hot spots, across the entire Mojave Desert ecoregion over 12 years (2009-2020). We also identify important variables for predicting hot spot distribution using the Random Forest algorithm and identifying the most invaded subregions. We identified hot spots in over 5% of the Mojave Desert mostly on the western and eastern edges of the ecoregion, and invasive grasses were detected in over 90% of the Mojave Desert at least once in that time. Across the entire Mojave Desert, our results indicate that soil texture, aspect, winter precipitation, and elevation are the highest-ranking predictive variables of invasive grass hot spots, while anthropogenic variables contributed the least to the accuracy of the predictive model. The total area covered by hot spots varied significantly among subregions of the Mojave Desert. We found that anthropogenic variables became more important in explaining invasive annual establishment and persistence as spatial scale was reduced to the subregional level. Our findings have important implications for informing where land management actions can prioritize reducing invasive annual persistence and promoting restoration efforts.

TI  - Changes in Influenza Activities Impacted by NPI Based on 4-Year Surveillance in China: Epidemic Patterns and Trends
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background Since the Non-pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) by COVID-19 emerged, influenza activity has been somewhat altered. Objectives The aim of this study was to explore changes in influenza activities in the context of COVID-19 based on the sentinel hospitals/units in Guangdong, southern China. Methods The surveillance data in influenza-like illness (ILI) were collected from 21 cities in Guangdong between September 2017 and August 2021, while 43 hospitals/units were selected to analyze the predominant types of influenza, population characteristics, and seasonal features by three methods (the concentration ratio, the seasonal index, and the circulation distribution), based on a descriptive epidemiological approach. Results During the four consecutive influenza seasons, a total of 157345 ILIs were tested, of which 9.05% were positive for influenza virus (n = 14238), with the highest positive rates for both IAV (13.20%) and IBV (5.41%) in the 2018-2019 season. After the emergence of COVID-19, influenza cases decreased near to zero from March 2020 till March 2021, and the dominant type of influenza virus changed from IAV to IBV. The highest positive rate of influenza existed in the age-group of 5 similar to < 15 years in each season for IAV (P < 0.001), which was consistent with that for IBV (P < 0.001). The highest annual positive rates for IBV emerged in eastern Guangdong, while the highest annual positive rates of IAV in different seasons existed in different regions. Furthermore, compared with the epidemic period (ranged from December to June) during 2017- 2019, the period ended three months early (March 2020) in 2019-2020, and started by five months behind (April 2021) during 2020-2021. Conclusion The highest positive rates in 5 similar to < 15 age-group suggested the susceptible in this age-group mostly had infected with infected B/Victoria. Influenced by the emergence of COVID-19 and NPI responses, the epidemic patterns and trends of influenza activities have changed in Guangdong, 2017-2021.

TI  - A new approach to estimate daily evapotranspiration, based on Landsat data and FAO56 principles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of evapotranspiration is crucial for enhancing crop water productivity and effectively managing water resources. This research offers a novel method that integrates satellite data and crop coefficients to calculate ET (c) and ET (a) on a daily basis and overcome the limitation of low temporal frequency of non-commercial satellite data. The study was carried out in the southern part of Khuzestan Province, Iran, on sugarcane crops in the Amirkabir Agro-industries area. The method involves obtaining Landsat-8 data with an 8-day temporal resolution, which was used to estimate Land Surface Temperature (LST) using a Single-Channel Algorithm. The estimated LST was then validated with in-situ canopy temperature measurements and used to predict the crop stress coefficient (K (s)) based on its relationship with the crop water stress index (CWSI). The crop coefficient (K (c)) was obtained using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) algorithm, and both Ks and Kc were utilized to calculate daily ETa by multiplying by the daily reference evapotranspiration (ET (0)) obtained from local meteorological data. The results indicated that the crop coefficients of sugarcane in the initial and mid-stages were 12% and 18% higher, respectively, compared to the FAO56 guideline. The aggregated decadal and monthly ET (a) showed good agreement with the WaPOR datasets, with an RMSE of 8.7 and 1.93 mm, respectively. This approach offers a potential solution to the challenge of obtaining remote sensing data with a higher temporal frequency.

TI  - 'Islamic Epistemology' in a Modern Context: Anatomy of an Evolving Debate
T2  - SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper critically analyses how Islamization of Knowledge (IOK), Radical Reform (RR), and Maqasid Methodology (MM), three distinct Islamic intellectual projects, attempted to develop discourses of Islamic epistemology in facing contemporary developments of natural and social sciences. Mainly, the paper focuses on similarities, differences, and potential contributions of all three projects respectively. Initially, this paper observes that IOK, RR, and MM have solid agreements among themselves in defining the core crisis of the modern Islamic intellectual tradition, as well as in highlighting the importance of inclusion of Islamic primary sources and its normative guidance in the process of reorienting modern knowledge. Equally, each of those projects presents itself as a new reflection of Islamic primary texts considering current intellectual challenges. Nevertheless, this paper further finds that all three projects have deep disagreements among themselves in terms of defining the scope of epistemic authority of revelation, reason, and spirituality and thereby offer three different visions of Islamic epistemic schema in facing modern knowledge. Finally, this paper reflects how these differences could potentially impact visions of an alternative education system from an Islamic worldview.

TI  - Environmental racism and air pollution: Pre and post the COVID-19 economic shutdown(sic)(sic)(sic)Palabras clave
T2  - REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Decades of research demonstrates that minoritized groups are disproportionately affected by swathes of harmful pollutants, including air pollution, even controlling for low income. Would significantly reducing individual car traffic help reduce the EJ gap? The systemic shock of the COVID-19 economic shutdown, with accompanied reduction in car use, can be exploited to analyze this question. Kerr and colleagues ask this question for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), use satellite data and categorical differences, and find that majority-minoritized tracts on average benefited more from the shutdown, but the least-White tracts still were significantly worse off than the most-White tracts. We further explore this question for PM2.5, one of the most harmful air pollutants, using Geographic Information System (GIS) methods to combine several different federal datasets to compare pre- and post-COVID-19 shutdown. Analyzing Census tracts, we find (1) little evidence of discrimination in the placement of PM2.5 sensors, (2) evidence of the standard EJ disproportionality for PM2.5 in both pre-shutdown 2019 and post-shutdown 2020, but (3) evidence of disproportionate improvement for Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans, with concerning indications of possible harm to African Americans. This implies, as do the findings in Kerr and colleagues' study, that policies that limit gasoline-powered car use can reduce air pollution but are unlikely to importantly alleviate US environmental racism affecting African Americans.

TI  - Impact of axillary surgery on outcome of clinically node positive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeAxillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND) is recommended for breast cancer patients who present with clinically node positive disease (cN1) especially if they have residual nodal disease (ypN+) following neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). It is unknown whether axillary dissection improves outcome for these patients.MethodsA prospectively maintained database was used to identify all patients who were diagnosed with cTis-T4N1M0 breast cancer treated with NAT.ResultsIn our study, of 292 cN1 breast cancer patients who received NAT, we compared ALND with targeted axillary surgery (TAS) in ypN+ patients. ALND was performed in 75% of the ypN+ subgroup, while 25% underwent TAS. Axillary recurrence occurred in four ALND patients, but no recurrence was observed in the TAS group (p = 0.21). Five-year axillary recurrence-free survival was 100% for TAS and 90% for ALND (p = 0.21). Overall survival at five years was 97% for TAS and 85% for ALND (p = 0.39). Disease-free survival rates at five years were 51% for TAS and 61% for ALND (p = 0.9). Clinicopathological variables were similar between the groups, although some differences were noted. ALND patients had smaller clinical tumor size, larger pathological tumor size, more lymph nodes retrieved, larger tumor deposits, higher rates of extranodal extension, and greater prevalence of macrometastatic nodal disease. Tumor subtype and size of lymph node tumor deposit independently predicted survival.ConclusionAxillary recurrence is infrequent in cN1 patients treated with NAT. Our study found that ALND did not reduce the occurrence of axillary recurrence or enhance overall survival. It is currently uncertain which patients benefit from axillary dissection.

TI  - Study on the structural characteristics of the Yangdachengzi oil layer in the Quantou Formation, ZY block, central depression, Songliao Basin
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Songliao Basin is a large Mesozoic-Cenozoic continental basin with multiple sedimentary cycles. It has experienced the influence of multidirectional and different structural stresses in the peripheral structural belt, resulting in a complex geological structure. The continental clastic deposits at the depression of the Quantou Formation in the shallow part of the basin, including the Fuyu oil layer and the Yangdachengzi oil layer, are the primary exploration and development target. The structure and faults are the dominant factors controlling the hydrocarbon accumulation in the upper member of the Quantou Formation in the central Songliao Basin. In this study, we finely interpret the three-dimensional structure of the third member of Quantou Formation in the ZY block by the integration of well logging and seismic data and then analyze the stratigraphic distribution and fracture characteristic and the tectonic development history of the Yangdachengzi oil layer. The results show that the Yangdachengzi oil layer is a monoclinic structure from the southeast to northwest. It has four third-level structural units, the Mofantun nose structure, Yumin nose structure, Zhaoyuan nose structure, and Zhaoyuan western nose structure, which form the structure-lithostratigraphic trap zones in the study area, in which a total of 80 traps for the Yangdachengzi oil layer has been identified with the total area of about 58.06 km(2). Faults are highly developed in the central depression of the Songliao Basin. The ZY block is dominated by the extensional-strike-slip faults. The main fault direction is mostly north-northeast, and the secondary fault direction is mostly north-northwest. The complex tectonic activities determine the formation mechanism and the evolution of faults. The faults in this block can be classified as early-stage, middle-stage, late-stage, and long-term faults. The long-term fault is the major fault type of the five fault bundles, and it acts as the main channel for oil and gas migration. In addition, the reservoir is an above-generation and below-storage model. This study provides evidence for the hydrocarbon accumulation model of the Quantou Formation.

T2  - Revue neurologique
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although headache is a common symptom in acute ischemic stroke, the clinical and radiological factors associated with its occurrence are controversial. This work aimed to determine the frequency, characteristics, and predictors of headache occurrence among patients with acute ischemic stroke.METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 303 patients with acute ischemic stroke. The patients were submitted to detailed history taking, clinical and radiological assessment. A detailed analysis of headache was performed for the patients who experienced headache temporally related to stroke onset.RESULTS: Diagnosis of headache attributed to the ischemic stroke was established in 129 (42.6%) patients; sentinel headache in 17.2% of patients, and headache at stroke onset in 25.4% of patients. The headache group had a significantly younger age (P=0.017), lower NIHSS score (P=0.042), higher frequency of pre-existing headache disorders (P=0.001), substance use disorder (P=0.021), and fever (P=0.036), and lower frequency of chronic hypertension (P=0.013) and small vessel disease (P=0.004) than non-headache group. Infarction involving posterior circulation was more frequent in headache than in non-headache groups (P=0.003). The presence of migraine, tension-type headache, other types of headache, fever and posterior circulation stroke increased the odds of headache by 27.4 (95%CI=8.0-94.4), 7.6 (95%CI=3.93-14.6), 26.2 (95%CI=8.0-85.8), 3.75 (95%CI=1.22-11.6) and 3.15 (95%CI=1.65-6.0) times, respectively, whereas, the presence of small vessel disease decreased the odds of headache by 0.51 (95%CI=0.279-0.95) times.CONCLUSION: Pre-existing headache disorder, fever, and posterior circulation stroke were associated with headache occurrence in acute ischemic stroke patients.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Lycorma delicatula White (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae) is an invasive phloem feeder with a broad host range that includes both hardwood trees and cultivated temperate fruit crops. Here, we evaluated acceptability of wild hosts, A. altissima and Juglans nigra L. (Fagales: Juglandaceae) and cultivated hosts Vitis vinifera, Malus domestica (Rosales: Rosaceae), and Prunus persica L. Batsch (Rosales: Rosaceae) to L. delicatula under field conditions. Fluorescent-marked early instar nymphs, late instar nymphs, or adult L. delicatula were released at the base of single potted host plants and the number of individuals retained was recorded over 24 h. Paired choice trials with A. altissima and another host plant were conducted. Individuals retained on or moving between plants were recorded over 24 h. Sentinel A. altissima, J. nigra, V. vinifera, M. domestica, and P. persica potted plants were deployed at 5 sites and the number of L. delicatula present on each plant was recorded weekly. In single and paired host trials, early instars and adults were generally retained in higher numbers on A. altissima and V. vinifera, and late instars were retained on A. altissima and J. nigra. Significantly more L. delicatula were present on sentinel A. altissima compared with other host plants, except J. nigra during the period when late instars were the most prevalent lifestage in the field. These results indicate that wild hosts such as A. altissima and J. nigra are likely supporting establishment of L. delicatula populations, and that presence of cultivated V. vinifera may contribute to population establishment and growth.

TI  - Analysis of Built-Up Classes in Urbanised Zones Using Radar Images
T2  - QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of a study to determine the potential of radar imaging to detect classes of built-up areas defined in the Urban Atlas (UA) spatial database. The classes are distinguished by function and building density. In addition to the reflectance value itself, characteristics such as building density or spatial layout can improve the identification of these classes. In order to increase the classification possibilities and better exploit the potential of radar imagery, a grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was generated to analyse the texture of built-up classes. Two types of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images from different sensors were used as test data: Sentinel-1 and ICEYE, which were selected for their different setup configurations and parameters. Classification was carried out using the Random Forests (RF) and Minimum Distance (MD) methods. The use of the MD classifier resulted in an overall accuracy of 64% and 51% for Sentinel-1 and ICEYE, respectively. In ICEYE, individual objects (e.g. buildings) are better recognised than classes defined by their function or density, as in UA classes. Sentinel-1 performed better than ICEYE, with its texture images better complementing the features of urban area classes. This remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of urban areas in defining and characterising urban area classes. Automatic acquisition of training fields directly from UA is problematic and it is therefore advisable to independently obtain reference data for built-up area categories.

TI  - Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Japan Continue to Increase Even after the Launch of Specific Health Checkups.
T2  - Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective To examine the trends and relationships between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and dyslipidemia from fiscal year (FY) 2008, when specific health checkups (SHCs) were initiated in Japan, to FY 2019 and the relationship between NAFLD trends and dietary nutrition. Methods A total of 48,332 participants (25,121 men and 23,211 women) diagnosed with NAFLD who underwent health checkups, including ultrasonography, from FY 2008 to FY 2019 were included. A fatty liver was diagnosed using ultrasonography. The dietary nutrient intake status was based on data from The National Health and Nutrition Survey, Japan. Results Over 12 years, NAFLD prevalence increased from 26.9% to 43.1% in men (p<0.0001) and from 9.9% to 17.9% in women (p<0.0001) in all body mass index (BMI) groups except for obese II (according to the WHO Asia-Pacific criteria) in men and underweight in women and almost all age groups. T2DM prevalence increased in men (from 9.0% to 10.7%, p=0.0234), and obesity and higher waist circumference rates increased in women (from 16.0% to 18.0%, p=0.0059 and from 8.1% to 10%, respectively, p=0.0006). The dietary nutrient intake increased with regard to the total fat, fat/energy ratio, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and n6/n3 fatty acid ratio in both men and women, and these nutrient trends were correlated with NAFLD prevalence (all p≤0.0005). Conclusions In Japan, NAFLD increased in both men and women regardless of the BMI and age, even after starting SHCs. An unbalanced fat intake may be one of the major reasons for this increase.

In this study, we map spatio-temporal evolution of the land subsidence of Kolkata region using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) analysis of ENVISAT (2003-2010), ALOS (2007-2011) and Sentinel-1 (2017-2021) data sets along with GPS position time series (2012-2015) and Piezometric level measurements. During 2003-2011, the eastern part of the Kolkata City (east of Hooghly River) experienced similar to - 4 to - 12 mm/yr subsidence. Between 2017 and 2021, several new subsidence zones were evolved towards west of the Hooghly River as a response to the rapid decrease in groundwater level in this region (similar to - 0.3 m/yr). However, during 2017-2021, the widespread subsidence pattern in the eastern part of the city became segmented into 5-20 km(2) patches of low (similar to - 2 to - 3 mm/yr) and significant deformation (> - 10 mm/yr). This local deceleration in the subsidence is reflected as a reduction in groundwater decline rate, probably associated with the improved artificial recharge scenario. The correlation of the decadal-scale land subsidence with groundwater level changes suggests an inelastic mechanism for the confined aquifer system of Kolkata. The present results and published seismic micro-zonation results together suggest that the areas having significant subsidence in Kolkata are associated with large Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) values and thus are more vulnerable to seismic hazard.

TI  - Evaluating the drivers of groundwater spring discharge in Sindh basin of Kashmir Himalaya
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Mountain springs are the only water source for most of the communities in the Kashmir Himalayas. However, over the past two decades, the discharge of these springs has decreased, and some springs have dried up. The current study mapped springs from the Sindh basin of the Kashmir Himalaya via a GPS-based Field survey. The dynamics of spring discharge were evaluated vis-a-vis climatic variability, land use changes, snow cover area, and any major developmental projects in the catchment. The observed temperature and precipitation data were subjected to trend analysis using the Mann Kendall's tau test and Sen's slope estimator. MODIS data were used to understand the dynamics of the Snow Cover Area (SCA) from 2010 to 2021. Landsat satellite imagery was processed to quantify the changes in Land use/cover (LULC). The study found that 13% of the springs below 1600 masl, 22% from 1600 to 2500 masl, and 28.9% above 2500 masl have witnessed a high decrease in discharge. The seasonality of the spring discharge implies snowmelt is the predominant source. The time series analysis shows a weak decreasing trend in the precipitation during the growing season (Spring and Summer). However, both minimum and maximum temperatures show a statistically significant upward trend and result in the early melting of the snow, also confirmed by the analysis of SCA. The study reveals that climate change and LULC change are responsible for the drying of the springs.

TI  - Thirty-meter map of young forest age in China
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Young forest age mapping at a fine spatial resolution is important for increasing the accuracy of estimating land-atmosphere carbon fluxes and guiding forest management practices. In recent decades, China has actively conducted afforestation and forest protection projects, thereby laying the foundation for the realization of carbon neutrality. However, very few studies have been conducted which map the ages of young forests for the whole of China at a fine spatial resolution. In this research, a continuous change detection and classification (CCDC)-based method suitable for large-scale forest age mapping is proposed and used to estimate young forest ages across China in 2020 at a spatial resolution of 30 m. First, a 10 m spatial-resolution land cover dataset (WorldCover2020) from the European Space Agency (ESA) was used to determine the forest cover areas in 2020. Then, the CCDC algorithm was used to identify stand-replacing disturbances to determine the stand age based on 436 967 Landsat tiles across China from 1990 to 2020. A validation sample set composed of multiple land use and land cover (LULC) products was used to calculate the overall accuracy (OA) of the 2020 young forest age (1-31-year) map of China, and the OA was 90.28 %. The reliability and applicability of the proposed CCDC-based forest age mapping method were validated by comparing the forest age map with Hansen's forest change dataset, Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (MPI-BGC) 1 km global forest age datasets, and field measurements. The CCDC-based method has strong application potential in real-time mapping of the age of young forests at the global scale. The produced forest age map provides a basic dataset for research on the forest carbon cycle and forest ecosystem services as well as important guidance for government departments, such as the National Forestry and Grassland Administration and the National Development and Reform Commission in China. Data presented in this study is available at (Xiao, 2022).

TI  - Consistency of spatiotemporal variability of MODIS and ERA5-Land surface warming trends over complex topography
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this study, the trend of widely used MODIS MxD11 and MxD21 Land Surface Temperature (LST) and ERA5-Land Skin Temperature (SKT) and 2 m air temperature products were validated using 2 m air temperature trends obtained by ground observations from 266 stations in 2000-2021 over Turkey, known to have complex topography. The results show that colder regions have substantially higher temporal temperature variability than warmer ones. MxD21 and MxD11 products are 4.4 & DEG;C and 2.9 & DEG;C warmer than ERA5-Land products, respectively, while ERA5-Land products (SKT and 2 m) have nearly similar averages (12.5 & DEG;C). The consistency between MODIS and ERA5-Land data is significantly lower over areas with more complex topography and irrigation activities, despite the fact that the products show a high linear relationship over the study area. While February trends are consistently much higher than other months (2.2 and 1.4 & DEG;C/decade for MODIS and ERA5-Land, respectively), overall MODIS skin temperature products (0.7 & DEG;C/decade) generally exhibit smaller trends than ERA5-Land skin and air temperature trends (0.94 & DEG;C/decade). The results suggested that MODIS and ERA5-Land trends, which are highly consistent with observations, might replace observations in the absence of long-term station-based records.

TI  - Mechanics of the Kalabagh Fault, northwest Himalayan fold and thrust belt (convergence zone of India and Eurasia), using SAR interferometry and CFS
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kalabagh strike-slip fault, which is characterized by right-lateral movement, is part of the northwestern Himalayan foreland fold and thrust belt in Pakistan. This structure marks the western and eastern terminations of the Salt Range and Surghar Ranges, respectively. No significant (>M6) earthquakes have been reported along the Kalabagh Fault in recent decades. Here, we take advantage of space-borne Sentinel-1A SAR interferometry to gain insight into the mechanics of faulting, aseismic creeping, and stress loading of the seismic cycle on the Kalabagh Fault spanning over approximately 7 years. In this study, we also removed the tropospheric effects using the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service data from the rate map. We further resolved the LOS deformation into both horizontal and vertical deformations. Our Bayesian inversion indicates that the fault experiences significant horizontal and vertical displacements. The fault's southern and northern segments exhibit a creeping rate of approximately similar to 4.2 +/- 1.3 to 4.8 +/- 1.6 mm/year, respectively, while the central section does not display any horizontal creeping. We found that the creeping is confined between 0 and similar to 2.7 +/- 1.1 km depth at the northern section and 0 and similar to 3.9 +/- 1.1 km on the southern section of the faults. Nevertheless, we found that the vertical creeping of similar to 10 mm/year is confined between 0.5 and 6 km depth in the central segment of the fault. Moreover, our model does not resolve the interseismic slip at depth on the Kalabagh Fault. Our results affirm that Kalabagh Fault is creeping, and the internal deformation due to the presence of a thick salt layer over the decollement facilitates the creeping on this fault. In addition, Coulomb stress modeling depicts that the creeping on the Kalabagh Fault increases the Coulomb stress changes in the northern section of the KBF.

TI  - Characteristics of Land-Use Carbon Emissions and Carbon Balance Zoning in the Economic Belt on the Northern Slope of Tianshan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - How to identify variables for carbon reductions was considered as one of the most important research topics in related academic fields. In this study, the characteristics of landuse carbon emissions of the economic belt on the northern slope of Tianshan (NST) were tentatively investigated. Taking 12 cities in NST as the case study, land use carbon emissions and carbon intensities were estimated and analyzed based on the Landsat remote sensing image and socio-economic statistical data in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. Moreover, Moran's I model was applied to study spatial autocorrelation between carbon emissions and carbon intensities. Results show that (1) urban land and cropland were increased rapidly during the past three decades; (2) carbon emissions were increasing significantly, and the urban land was responsible for the majority of the carbon emission; (3) negative spatial correlations on both net carbon emissions and carbon intensities were obtained between 12 cities; and (4) based on carbon balance zoning analysis, NST could be divided into four different zones. The rising ratio of carbon emissions and intensities was significantly higher than urbanization expending speed. Results could provide references and useful insights into related arrangements of policies and attempts on carbon reduction for cities in NST.

TI  - Predicting water quality variability in a Mediterranean hypereutrophic monomictic reservoir using Sentinel 2 MSI: the importance of considering model functional form
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic eutrophication is a global environmental problem threatening the ecological functions of many inland freshwaters and diminishing their abilities to meet their designated uses. Water authorities worldwide are being pressed to improve their abilities to monitor, predict, and manage the incidence of harmful algal blooms (HABs). While most water quality management decisions are still based on conventional monitoring programs that lack the needed spatio-temporal resolution for effective lake/reservoir management, recent advances in remote sensing are providing new opportunities towards better understanding water quality variability in these important freshwater systems. This study assessed the potential of using the Sentinel 2 Multispectral Instrument to predict and assess the spatio-temporal variability in the water quality of the Qaraoun Reservoir, a poorly monitored Mediterranean hypereutrophic monomictic reservoir that is subject to extensive periods of HABs. The work first evaluated the ability to transfer and recalibrate previously developed reservoir-specific Landsat 7 and 8 water quality models when used with Sentinel 2 data. The results showed poor transferability between Landsat and Sentinel 2, with most models experiencing a significant drop in their predictive skill even after recalibration. Sentinel 2 models were then developed for the reservoir based on 153 water quality samples collected over 2 years. The models explored different functional forms, including multiple linear regressions (MLR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), random forests (RF), and support vector regressions (SVR). The results showed that the RF models outperformed their MLR, MARS, and SVR counterparts with regard to predicting chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids, Secchi disk depth, and phycocyanin. The coefficient of determination (R-2) for the RF models varied between 85% for TSS up to 95% for SDD. Moreover, the study explored the potential of quantifying cyanotoxin concentrations indirectly from the Sentinel 2 MSI imagery by benefiting from the strong relationship between cyanotoxin levels and chlorophyll-a concentrations.

TI  - Utilizing Remote Sensing and Satellite-Based Bouguer Gravity data to Predict Potential Sites of Hydrothermal Minerals and Gold Deposits in Central Saudi Arabia
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to aid in exploring and forecasting hydrothermal minerals and gold deposits in Central Saudi Arabia (SA), with a focus on structural contexts. Remote sensing (RS) and satellite-based Bouguer gravity (SBG) data were integrated in order to create a mineral prediction map for the researched location. Data from the Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) were transformed and enhanced using a variety of approaches. The delineation of hydrothermal alteration zones (HAZs) and highlighting of structural discontinuities in the OLI data were made possible using band ratios and oriented principal component analysis (PCA). Additionally, the underlying structural features were successfully exposed by processing the SBG using a variety of edge detection techniques, like the analytical signal (AS), total horizontal derivative (THD), tilt angle (TA), horizontal tilt angle (TDX), theta map (TM), horizontal derivative of the tilt derivative (HD_TDR), horizontal gradient of the tilt angle (HGTA), tilt angle of the analytical signal (TAAS), and soft sign function (SF). As a result, more prominent lineaments were found in the NW-SE, NNW-SSE, NE-SW, and NNE-SSW directions than in the N-S and E-W directions. The GIS incorporated surface/subsurface geological structure density maps with zones of hydrothermal alteration. It was found that the lineaments derived from the analysis of the RS and SBG data were more in line with the HAZs, which demonstrated the common connection between alteration zones and deep lineaments. The findings revealed a mineral prediction map with extremely low to extremely high probabilities. Overall, combining RS and SBG data effectively identified probable mineralization sites associated with hydrothermal processes and made it easier to create this study's final predictive mineralization map.

TI  - Machine Learning (ML)-Based Copper Mineralization Prospectivity Mapping (MPM) Using Mining Geochemistry Method and Remote Sensing Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploration of buried mineral deposits is required to generate innovative approaches and the integration of multi-source geoscientific datasets. Mining geochemistry methods have been generated based on the theory of multi-formational geochemical dispersion haloes. Satellite remote sensing data is a form of surficial geoscience datasets and can be considered as big data in terms of veracity and volume. The different alteration zones extracted using remote sensing methods have not been yet categorized based on the mineralogical and geochemical types (MGT) of anomalies and cannot discriminate blind mineralization (BM) from zone dispersed mineralization (ZDM). In this research, an innovative approach was developed to optimize remote sensing-based evidential variables using some constructed mining geochemistry models for a machine learning (ML)-based copper prospectivity mapping. Accordingly, several main steps were implemented and analyzed. Initially, the MGT model was executed by studying the distribution of indicator elements of lithogeochemical data extracted from 50 copper deposits from Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries to identify the MGT of geochemical anomalies associated with copper mineralization. Then, the geochemical zonality model was constructed using the database of the porphyry copper deposits of Iran and Kazakhstan to evaluate the geochemical anomalies related to porphyry copper mineralization (e.g., the Saghari deposit located around the Chah-Musa deposit, Toroud-Chah Shirin belt, central north Iran). Subsequently, the results of mining geochemistry models were used to produce the geochemical evidential variable by vertical geochemical zonality (Vz) (Pb x Zn/Cu x Mo) and to optimize the remote sensing-based evidential variables. Finally, a random forest algorithm was applied to integrate the evidential variables for generating a provincial-scale prospectivity mapping of porphyry copper deposits in the Toroud-Chah Shirin belt. The results of this investigation substantiated that the machine learning (ML)-based integration of multi-source geoscientific datasets, such as mining geochemistry techniques and satellite remote sensing data, is an innovative and applicable approach for copper mineralization prospectivity mapping in metallogenic provinces.

TI  - Lessons for Sustainable Urban Development: Interplay of Construction, Groundwater Withdrawal, and Land Subsidence at Battersea, London
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The capacity of aquifers to store water and the stability of infrastructure can each be adversely influenced by variations in groundwater levels and subsequent land subsidence. Along the south bank of the River Thames, the Battersea neighbourhood of London is renovating a vast 42-acre (over 8 million sq ft) former industrial brownfield site to become host to a community of homes, shops, bars, restaurants, cafes, offices, and over 19 acres of public space. For this renovation, between 2016 and 2020, a significant number of bearing piles and secant wall piles, with diameters ranging from 450 mm to 2000 mm and depths of up to 60 m, were erected inside the Battersea Power Station. Additionally, there was considerable groundwater removal that caused the water level to drop by 2.55 & PLUSMN; 0.4 m/year between 2016 and 2020, as shown by Environment Agency data. The study reported here used Sentinel-1 C-band radar images and the persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) methodology to analyse the associated land movement for Battersea, London, during this period. The average land subsidence was found to occur at the rate of -6.8 & PLUSMN; 1.6 mm/year, which was attributed to large groundwater withdrawals and underground pile construction for the renovation work. Thus, this study underscores the critical interdependence between civil engineering construction, groundwater management, and land subsidence. It emphasises the need for holistic planning and sustainable development practices to mitigate the adverse effects of construction on groundwater resources and land stability. By considering the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined by the United Nations, particularly Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), city planners and stakeholders can proactively address these interrelated challenges.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Assessment and Correction of Gridded Precipitation Products in North Western Morocco
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and spatially distributed precipitation data are fundamental to effective water resource management. In Morocco, as in other arid and semi-arid regions, precipitation exhibits significant spatial and temporal variability. Indeed, there is an intra- and inter-annual variability and the northwest is rainier than the rest of the country. In the Bouregreg watershed, this irregularity, along with a sparse gauge network, poses a major challenge for water resource management. In this context, remote sensing data could provide a viable alternative. This study aims precisely to evaluate the performance of four gridded daily precipitation products: three IMERG-V06 datasets (GPM-F, GPM-L, and GPM-E) and a reanalysis product (ERA5). The evaluation is conducted using 11 rain gauge stations over a 20-year period (2000-2020) on various temporal scales (daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual) using a pixel-to-point approach, employing different classification and regression metrics of machine learning. According to the findings, the GPM products showed high accuracy with a low margin of error in terms of bias, RMSE, and MAE. However, it was observed that ERA5 outperformed the GPM products in identifying spatial precipitation patterns and demonstrated a stronger correlation. The evaluation results also showed that the gridded precipitation products performed better during the summer months for seasonal assessment, with relatively lower accuracy and higher biases during rainy months. Furthermore, these gridded products showed excellent performance in capturing different precipitation intensities, with the highest accuracy observed for light rain. This is particularly important for arid and semi-arid regions where most precipitation falls under the low-intensity category. Although gridded precipitation estimates provide global coverage at high spatiotemporal resolutions, their accuracy is currently insufficient and would require improvement. To address this, we employed an artificial neural network (ANN) model for bias correction and enhancing raw precipitation estimates from the GPM-F product. The results indicated a slight increase in the correlation coefficient and a significant reduction in biases, RMSE, and MAE. Consequently, this research currently supports the applicability of GPM-F data in North Western Morocco.

TI  - Nonparametric assessment of mangrove ecosystem in the context of coastal resilience in Ghana
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud cover effects make it difficult to evaluate the mangrove ecosystem in tropical locations using solely optical satellite data. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a more precise evaluation using data from several sources and appropriate models in order to manage the mangrove ecosystem as effectively as feasible. In this study, the status of the mangrove ecosystem and its potential contribution to coastal resilience were evaluated using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the InVEST model. The GEE was used to map changes in mangrove and other land cover types for the years 2009 and 2019 by integrating both optical and radar data. The quantity allocation disagreement index (QADI) was used to assess the classification accuracy. Mangrove height and aboveground biomass density were estimated using GEE by extracting their values from radar image clipped with a digital elevation model and mangrove vector file. A universal allometric equation that relates canopy height to aboveground biomass was applied. The InVEST model was used to calculate a hazard index of every 250 m of the shoreline with and without mangrove ecosystem. Our result showed that about 16.9% and 21% of mangrove and other vegetation cover were lost between 2009 and 2019. However, water body and bare land/built-up areas increased by 7% and 45%, respectively. The overall accuracy of 2009 and 2019 classifications was 99.6% (QADI = 0.00794) and 99.1% (QADI = 0.00529), respectively. Mangrove height and aboveground biomass generally decreased from 12.7 to 6.3 m and from 105 to 88 Mg/ha on average. The vulnerability index showed that 23%, 51% and 26% of the coastal segment in the presence of mangrove fall under very low/low, moderate and high risks, respectively. Whereas in the absence of mangrove, 8%, 38%, 39% and 15% fall under low, moderate, high and very high-risk zones, respectively. This study will among other things help the stakeholders in coastal management and marine spatial planning to identify the need to focus on conservation practices.

M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying urban tree cover is important to ensure sustainable urban ecosystem. This study calculates urban percent tree cover (PTC) for Bursa city, Turkey from Sentinel-2 data and evaluates the driving factors of PTC using an Artificial Neural Network-Multi Layer Perception (ANN-MLP) approach. For the PTC calculation, a Regression Tree (RT) analysis was performed using several vegetation indices (NDVI, LAI, fCOVER, MSAVI2, and MCARI) to improve accuracy. Socio-economic, topographic, and biophysical variables were incorporated into the ANN-MLP approach to evaluate the factors that drive urban PTC. A PTC prediction map was generated with an accuracy of 0.95 and a coefficient of determination of 0.87. The ANN-MLP training process yielded a correlation coefficient value of 0.71 and an R-square of 0.82 was achieved between the predicted ANN-MLP and observed tree cover maps. A priority tree cover map was generated considering statistical relationships between the factors and the ANN-MLP prediction map in addition to visual interpretations at the urban scale. Results demonstrate that, unlike other urban forms, PTC has a statistically negative relationship with the gross dwelling density (R2 =0.31). Topographic variables including slope and DEM were positively correlated with PTC with the R2 value of 0.80 and 0.72 respectively. The integration of remote sensing data with vegetation indices and driving factors yielded accurate prediction for identifying and evaluating the variability in the urban PTC.

TI  - A Postmodern (Singularity) Future with a Post-Human Godless Algorithm: Trans-Humanism, Artificial Intelligence, and Dataism
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this manuscript is to reveal that the challenge in understanding the ethical consequences of a post-human condition characterizing trans-humanist ontology is linked to postmodern epistemology lacking any metaphysical and theological essence. The introductory section provides an overview of trans-humanist thought and the concerns deliberated against it at the recent conference titled A.I Ethics: An Abrahamic Commitment to the Rome Call, charting a path ensuring that technological innovations do not undermine the ethical, spiritual, and moral values animating the telos of the human being. The second section traces the philosophical genealogy of trans-humanism from the Age of Reason (i.e., modern epistemology) to our current Age of Feeling (i.e., postmodern epistemology). This section also stresses that the ontology accenting both periods-the death of God and the death of human-is latent in trans-humanist ideology, which seeks to extinguish the quest of knowing God with an ateleological state that crucifies the human in pursuit of worshipping technology. The third section scrutinizes the conceptual framework of trans-humanism by deconstructing concepts structuring its worldview such as Singularity, Artificial Super Intelligence, and the pseudo-religion known as Dataism. Additionally, this section examines how trans-humanist proponents-while adhering to postmodern philosophy-alter the definitions of sacred concepts that exclusively animate a human state of being, such as consciousness, intelligence, and awareness, by anthropomorphizing AI. The final section recalls the wisdom of the Nicomachean Ethics and the Alchemy of Happiness, composed-respectively-by Aristotle and Al-Ghazali. It highlights the immoral significances of choosing to ignore the implications of Dataism and its techno-scientific objectives, which obscure the use of techne in a virtuous manner attaining eudaimonia and the essence of humanness seeking a path-using God-given sensoria-knowledge of Divine Beauty.

TI  - Mapping Underwater Aquatic Vegetation Using Foundation Models With Air- and Space-Borne Images: The Case of Polyphytos Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping underwater aquatic vegetation (UVeg) is crucial for understanding the dynamics of freshwater ecosystems. The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has shown great potential in improving the accuracy and efficiency of UVeg mapping using remote sensing data. This paper presents a comparative study of the performance of classical and modern AI tools, including logistic regression, random forest, and a visual-prompt-tuned foundational model, the Segment Anything model (SAM), for mapping UVeg by analyzing air- and space-borne images in the few-shot learning regime, i.e., using limited annotations. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the SAM foundation model in air-borne imagery (GSD = 3-6 cm) with an F1 score of 86.5%& PLUSMN;4.1% when trained with as few as 40 positive/negative pairs of pixels, compared to 54.0%& PLUSMN;9.2% using the random forest model and 42.8%& PLUSMN;6.2% using logistic regression models. However, adapting SAM to space-borne images (WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2) remains challenging, and could not outperform classical pixel-wise random forest and logistic regression methods in our task. The findings presented provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of AI models for UVeg mapping, aiding researchers and practitioners in selecting the most suitable tools for their specific applications.

TI  - Sun the Mother and Moon the Father Gender Roles and Family Practices in Romuva
T2  - NOVA RELIGIO-JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND EMERGENT RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the construction of gender roles in contemporary Baltic Paganism through a case study of teachings and everyday practices among female members of the Ancient Baltic Religious Association Romuva in contemporary Lithuania. Reconstructionist Pagan religious groups usually represent a traditionalist worldview, while the impact of feminist ideas is mostly observed within goddess-oriented Pagan traditions like Wicca. Romuva represents a mixture of the two concerning gender roles. One of the main factors in this mixture is the influence, in her person and ideas, of archaeologist Marija Gimbutas (1921-1994), probably the only Lithuanian representative of second-wave feminism. Interviews with Romuva female members conducted in 2021 show that their conceptions of preferred gender roles and family practices varied. Factors like the interviewee's age and education, experiences of Soviet so-called "gender equality policies," and social conservatism all made an impact on them.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution in sub-humid region based on aerial photographs and satellite imagery: Case study in agni sub-catchment, Northern Morocco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the land use/land cover (LULC) and their evolution during the past six decades using maximum likelihood classification (MLC). The data from aerial photographs and satellite imageries are the primary sources that provide an opportunity to acquire information about LULC change. The study was based on three periods of LULC maps derived from aerial photographs 1960, 2000 and satellite imageries Landsat ETM + for 2000, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2B for 2020 and Terra IncognitaTM were used during image classification. For accuracy assessment, the confusion matrix was achieved. Since the 1960s, the LULC has changed in Agni subcatchment (sub-basin): increase of agriculture areas with the expense of forest in the study area. The results disclosed that Agni sub-catchment has changed significantly between 1960 and 2020. The forest was reduced from 17.4% in 1960 to 13.6% in 2020, but the agriculture was expanded from 46.9% in 1960 to 56.3% in 2020. This shows that agriculture increased at the expense of forest, this is due to policy change, population pressure and integration of cannabis in farms since 2006. The socio-economic crisis in 1980s aggravated by the shortened of fallow periods and the shortage of farmland land were major driving forces of the LULC changes, forced farmers in the Agni sub-catchment to seek new resources for subsistence. This situation has led to an increase in the frequency of migration to other cities and to Europe, especially among young people. This results in a vicious circle whose modalities of functioning we aim to analyze in this study, in order to contribute to a better understanding of the sub-humid to semi-arid Mediterranean environments of the Rif region.

TI  - Using Local Knowledge and Remote Sensing in the Identification of Informal Settlements in Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban planning within Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, has been impacted by the presence of informal settlements. An understanding of the spatial distribution of these settlements is essential in developing urban policies. This study used remotely sensed imagery to evaluate and characterize informal settlements within the city, both with and without expert knowledge of the study area (defined as expert knowledge, EK). An informal settlement ontology for four study sites within Riyadh City was developed using an analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Local knowledge was translated into a ruleset to identify and map settlement areas using spatial, spectral, textural, and geometric techniques. These were combined with an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach. The study demonstrated that combining expert knowledge and remotely sensed data can efficiently and accurately identify informal settlements. Two classified images were produced, one with EK, and one without EK, to investigate how a detailed understanding of local conditions could affect the final image classification. Overall accuracy when using EK was 94%, with a kappa coefficient of 89%, while without EK accuracy was 68% (kappa coefficient of 61%). The final OBIA classes included formal and informal settlements, road networks, vacant blocks, shaded areas, and vegetation. This study demonstrated that local expert knowledge and OBIA helpful in urban mapping. It also indicated the value of integrating a local ontological process during digital image classification. This work provided improved techniques for mapping informal settlements in Middle Eastern cities.

TI  - A multi-year land use trajectory strategy for non-active agricultural land mapping in sub-humid West Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-active agricultural land (NAAL) mapping in West Africa is essential to accurately assess agricultural systems and its contribution to food security and agro-ecological sustainability of current practices, and yet the available mapping methodologies are not adapted to the environmental and cropping conditions encountered when addressing tropical smallholder agriculture. In this study we present a strategy that makes use of Sentinel -2 image time series, CHIRPS monthly rainfall data and multiple years of in-situ data obtained from the JECAM database to map NAAL in a Soudanian site in Burkina Faso (Koumbia) between the years 2016 and 2021. In a first step we generated annual land use maps in four broad classes (managed, unmanaged, evergreen and non-vegetated) to detect fields being actively cultivated in a given year, and in a second step, we used these annual land use maps to differentiate non-active agricultural land by identifying shifts from one year to another. For the validation part, we analyzed the sensitivity of classification accuracy to in-situ data pre-processing by building 5 experimental validation data sets. The unmanaged classes F1-scores of the land use maps ranged between 0.86 and 0.98, depending on the year, whereas NAAL classes F1-scores ranged from 0.75 to 0.92 when validated against the most restrictive data set (pixels with no missing reference data for the period considered). NAAL represents between 7% to 14% of the study site cropland depending on the year. The higher class probabilities are in areas where data was available, whereas the low probabilities are localized and linked to transition areas on the outskirts of the department. Our results indicate that a multi-annual approach can allow NAAL mapping under challenging environments, yet efforts are to be made to develop more cost-efficient unsupervised solutions.

TI  - A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Detecting Volcanic Thermal Anomalies from Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The latest generation of high-spatial-resolution satellites produces measurements of high-temperature volcanic features at global scale, which are valuable to monitor volcanic activity. Recent advances in technology and increased computational resources have resulted in an extraordinary amount of monitoring data, which can no longer be so readily examined. Here, we present an automatic detection algorithm based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that uses infrared satellite data to automatically determine the presence of volcanic thermal activity. We exploit the potentiality of the transfer learning technique to retrain a pre-trained SqueezeNet CNN to a new domain. We fine-tune the weights of the network over a new dataset opportunely created with images related to thermal anomalies of different active volcanoes around the world. Furthermore, an ensemble approach is employed to enhance accuracy and robustness when compared to using individual models. We chose a balanced training dataset with two classes, one containing volcanic thermal anomalies (erupting volcanoes) and the other containing no thermal anomalies (non-erupting volcanoes), to differentiate between volcanic scenes with eruptive and non-eruptive activity. We used satellite images acquired in the infrared bands by ESA Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and NASA & USGS Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal InfraRed Sensor (OLI/TIRS). This deep learning approach makes the model capable of identifying the appearance of a volcanic thermal anomaly in the images belonging to the volcanic domain with an overall accuracy of 98.3%, recognizing the scene with active flows and erupting vents (i.e., eruptive activity) and the volcanoes at rest. This model is generalizable, and has the capability to analyze every image captured by these satellites over volcanoes around the world.

TI  - Modelling land use/land cover projection using different scenarios in the Cisadane Watershed, Indonesia: Implication on deforestation and food security
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Critical watersheds that exceed their carrying capacity occur in many regions of the world; their formation is facilitated by a significant driving factor known as land use/land cover (LULC) changes. This study aims to identify the LULC changes in Cisadane Watershed, Indonesia, in 2010, 2015, 2021, and simulate future LULC for 2030 and 2050. Landsat 2010 and 2015 and Sentinel 2A images from 2020 were employed for deriving LULC maps using Random Forest. This study applied a Land change modeler (LCM) under the multi-layer perception Markov chain (MLP-MC) to predict the future LULC in three scenarios. The scenarios are business as usual (BAU), protecting paddy fields (PPF), and protecting forest areas (PFA). The results showed that all the LULC maps demonstrated excellent accuracy, indicated by >83% overall accuracy. Furthermore, BAU produces the worst effect of decreasing forest and paddy field areas. PPF tends to cause forest loss, while PFA is predicted to reduce the paddy fields. There is a trade-off between maintaining food security and conserving natural resources. The study reveals the importance of efficient land use planning in the future amidst increasing resource demand due to population growth while existing land resources are limited.

AB  - Urbanization transforms simple two-dimensional natural spaces into complex three-dimensional (3D) artificial spaces through intense land use. Hence, urbanization continuously transforms vertical urban settings and the corresponding sky view area. As such, collecting data on urban settings and their interactions with urban climate is important. In this study, LiDAR remote sensing was applied to obtain finer-resolution footprints of urban-scale buildings and tree canopies (TCs). Additionally, a related sky view factor (SVF) analysis was performed. The study site comprised an area of Incheon Metropolitan City (501.5 km(2)). Results show that the proposed method can be applied to update institutional land maps, enhance land use management, and implement optimized and balanced urban settings.

TI  - Landscape ecological risk assessment and transformation processes in the Guinean-Congolese climate zone in Benin Republic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The landscape of Ramsar site 1018 in Benin Republic is increasingly modified by different types of land use. Understanding these changes dynamics is essential for efficient resource management. The aim of the research is to identify the spatial configuration of landscapes using landscape indices, which are the indicators and guide for agricultural policy. Fragstats 4 software helped for computing landscape metrics. Landsat imagery were analysed using Arcmap 10.7.1 and ENVI 5.3 software. The landscape of the Ramsar site is composed by the natural land (forests, savannahs, swamp formations), semi-natural land (plantations), anthropized land (agriculture lands, built-up area), and water land. These ecosystems have changed according to different trends 1990-2000, 2000-2020 and 1990-2020. The agricultural land showed an increasing trend of 143%, following by the built-up area (37%). From 1990 to 2020, a decreasing of 45% has been observed in the savannah land, plantation land (41%), forest land (30%) and swampy land (17%). Also, the Ramsar site ecological context is at medium level despite the increasing of the landscape Ecological Risk Index: 0.1899, 0.2128, and 0.2165 in 1990, 2000, and 2020, respectively. Between 1990 and 2000, the creation process occurred in the built-up area and agriculture land, attrition within forest and plantation classes, dissection in swampy land, aggregation for savannah and shrinkage in water area. From 2000 to 2020, the agriculture land and swampy land continued to experience the same spatial transformation processes respectively. Dissection has observed within the forest land, attrition in water area, and aggregation for built-up area. The perforation process has observed within plantation, and fragmentation in Savannah. Finally, the development of agricultural activities and built-up areas are leading to change in the spatial structure of the Ramsar site landscape. To better conserve the biodiversity of these area, it will be necessary to characterize the still natural ecosystems. This will make it possible to propose a comprehensive management plan that integrates the agricultural and urbanization policy of the government, and the sustainable development goals.

TI  - Leveraging weather radars for desert locust monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Desert locusts are infamous for their ability to cause widespread devastation to crops and agricul-tural lands. They have been known to cause significant economic losses in many parts of the world due to their capacity to swarm and consume large quantities of vegetation. The article briefly describes the use of remote sensing for monitoring locust populations as it enables re-searchers to predict and prepare for potential outbreaks, as well as deploy control measures promptly and effectively. Weather surveillance radars are another powerful tool for monitoring locust populations. These radars are capable of detecting locust swarms in real-time, providing high-resolution data at exceptional spatial-temporal scales. This is particularly advantageous for detecting locust migrations, which can span hundreds or even thousands of kilometers, and can be difficult to track through other means. With the help of weather surveillance radars, it be-comes possible to gain a better understanding of the behavior of locust swarms and to take appro-priate measures to mitigate their impact on crops and agricultural lands. The article also delves into the basics of radars and highlights the radar network across the recession and invasion areas of desert locusts. It concludes that the installation of radars would be immensely helpful in track-ing biological scatterers, including locust swarms, in near real-time. The continuous and high -resolution data provided by these radars could revolutionize our ability to monitor and control locust populations, leading to better food security and economic stability in affected regions. Overall, the article aims to spark the interest of individuals with a biological/meteorological background in the advancement of entomological polarimetric radar applications. By providing fundamental interpretations of new data products, the article helps to bridge the gap between sci-entific and biological research, enabling experts from different fields to collaborate and tackle the challenges posed by locust swarms and other biological scatterers.

TI  - Identifying and Monitoring Gardens in Urban Areas Using Aerial and Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In dry regions, gardens and trees within the urban space are of considerable significance. These gardens are facing harsh weather conditions and environmental stresses; on the other hand, due to the high value of land in urban areas, they are constantly subject to destruction and land use change. Therefore, the identification and monitoring of gardens in urban areas in dry regions and their impact on the ecosystem are the aims of this study. The data utilized are aerial and Sentinel-2 images (2018-2022) for Yazd Township in Iran. Several satellite and aerial image fusion methods were employed and compared. The root mean square error (RMSE) of horizontal shortcut connections (HSC) and color normalization (CN) were the highest compared to other methods with values of 18.37 and 17.5, respectively, while the Ehlers method showed the highest accuracy with a RMSE value of 12.3. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was then calculated using the images with 15 cm spatial resolution retrieved from the fusion. Aerial images were classified by NDVI and digital surface model (DSM) using object-oriented methods. Different object-oriented classification methods were investigated, including support vector machine (SVM), Bayes, random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). SVM showed the greatest accuracy with overall accuracy (OA) and kappa of 86.2 and 0.89, respectively, followed by RF with OA and kappa of 83.1 and 0.87, respectively. Separating the gardens using NDVI, DSM, and aerial images from 2018, the images were fused in 2022, and the current status of the gardens and associated changes were classified into completely dried, drying, acceptable, and desirable conditions. It was found that gardens with a small area were more prone to destruction, and 120 buildings were built in the existing gardens in the region during 2018-2022. Moreover, the monitoring of land surface temperature (LST) showed an increase of 14 C-? in the areas that were changed from gardens to buildings.

TI  - Damage assessment of Baghjan oil field blowout on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems near Dibru Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve, Assam India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems can be severely damaged by oil field blowouts. There is growing need to improve and enhance use of advance scientific tools and techniques for monitoring, mapping, and estimating the impact of oil spills on the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. It is also required to estimate the extent of spills to develop effective remediation plans, that ensures improved monitoring systems in place to spot early leakages. The Baghjan oil field blowout in Assam, India, adjacent to the Maguri-Motapung Wetland and the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, substantially affected the health of nearby terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. To assess the impact of the oil spill on the vegetation, we used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Case2Regional.CoastColour al-gorithm data to assess the pre and post blowout conditions. Results reflected to 41% increase in senescing vegetation followed by 25% increase in chlorophyll-a, and 35% of the total suspended matter (TSM) during the initial months. During the blowout period total TSM exceeded 175 kg/m3, which was observed to be exceptionally high for the wetland ecosystem. Areas cleared of vegetation after the oil spill were reported to have various levels of re-vegetation in the later year, according to change detection conducted for the two dates. Present study reflects the necessity of using high spatial resolution studies to map precise locations where the oil from the spill entered and later also to evaluate the impact of blowout on the vegetation. Study observed post-blowout changes in plant growth and survival which could be monitored to check ecosystem recovery after a year of oil spill.

TI  - The role of remote sensing in tropical grassland nutrient estimation: a review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) ratio is a key indicator of nutrient utilization and limitations in rangelands. To understand the distribution of herbivores and grazing patterns, information on grass quality and quantity is important. In heterogeneous environments, remote sensing offers a timely, economical, and effective method for assessing foliar biochemical ratios at varying spatial and temporal scales. Hence, this study provides a synopsis of the advancement in remote sensing technology, limitations, and emerging opportunities in mapping the C:N ratio in rangelands. Specifically, the paper focuses on multispectral and hyperspectral sensors and investigates their properties, absorption features, empirical and physical methods, and algorithms in predicting the C:N ratio in grasslands. Literature shows that the determination of the C:N ratio in grasslands is not in line with developments in remote sensing technologies. Thus, the use of advanced and freely available sensors with improved spectral and spatial properties such as Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8/9 with sophisticated algorithms may provide new opportunities to estimate C:N ratio in grasslands at regional scales, especially in developing countries. Spectral bands in the near-infrared, shortwave infrared, red, and red edge were identified to predict the C:N ratio in plants. New indices developed from recent multispectral satellite imagery, for example, Sentinel 2 aided by cutting-edge algorithms, can improve the estimation of foliar biochemical ratios. Therefore, this study recommends that future research should adopt new satellite technologies with recent development in machine learning algorithms for improved mapping of the C:N ratio in grasslands.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping for Road Corridors Using Coupled InSAR and GIS Statistical Analysis
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents landslide susceptibility mapping by using coupled GIS statistical analysis and interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data applied to a road corridor in West Sulawesi, Indonesia. Landslide-contributing factors in the road corridor including slope angle, distance to drainage, lithology, distance to road, distance to tectonic fault, and rainfall, were selected based on knowledge of landslide triggering mechanisms, numerically analyzed with the multicriteria decision of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), and controlled with the variance inflation factor (VIF) in the multicollinearity analysis. Then, the data associated with slope angle, the distance of the road to the slope, and the distance of the road to natural drainage were obtained from the digital elevation model (DEM) of the road corridor. In addition, the data of the lithological type of the area in the road corridor and the distance of the road to the tectonic faults were derived from a geology map, whereas the data of 10 years of daily rainfall were collected from three rainfall stations in the proximity of the road corridor and employed as rainfall data. Causal relations between those contributing factors and landslide occurrences were identified, statistically analyzed with the AHP, and numerically converted as landslide ratings into a GIS statistics-based landslide susceptibility map (LSM). In a parallel way, the interferogram of Sentinel-1's synthetic aperture radar images of the road corridor was also generated to observe the ground movement rate. The observed ground movement rates were then numerically converted into landslide ratings in the InSAR-based LSM. By overlaying these maps, a coupled GIS statistics and InSAR-based LSM of the road corridor was generated. To validate its accuracy, the landslide density index (R-index) was calculated, in which the highly and very highly susceptible zones in the LSM were compared with the actual sliding areas in the landslide inventory data. In comparison with the GIS-AHP-based LSM from a prior study, which had an R-index of 91.03%, the GIS statistical analysis and InSAR-based LSM's R-index was determined to be 97.09%, suggesting high accuracy and improved prediction. The results indicated that creating a landslide susceptibility map using GIS statistical analysis and InSAR would be beneficial in reducing the risk of landslides for road infrastructure.

TI  - Integrated Traditional Water Knowledge in Urban Design and Planning Practices for Sustainable Development: Challenges and Opportunities
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of flood research, scholars and practitioners have recognised that Western-knowledge-driven engineering-based flood management techniques are insufficient for successful water use and management in urban design and planning practices, while ideas, practices, and knowledge from local people are essential. Traditional water knowledge (TWK) explains people's profound understanding of natural processes and the ecological dependencies of water systems and connections with their local water system and the land, beliefs, sense, and practices that are an integral part of their culture. However, the concept of traditional knowledge may differ from scientific knowledge, as it represents a different worldview perspective from a modern Westernised world. Considering Khulna City, Bangladesh, as a case, this paper investigates the salient challenges and opportunities to integrate TWK with present urban design and planning practices. Interviews were conducted with key stakeholders, including relevant government officials, NGO workers, researchers, urban professionals, and local elders. This study finds that TWK can contribute to urban design and planning practices by identifying helpful ecosystem services and site-specific information; by sharing strategies for surface water protection, open-space design, and rainwater harvesting; and encouraging design of spaces for psychological benefit, and ensuring sustainability and building flood resilience in an urban context. Furthermore, this research demonstrates how these elements relate to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, issues with knowledge transmission, the identification of the actual knowledge holders, poor governance, weak urban planning, minimal institutional capacity, and perceived cultural inferiority are significant challenges restricting the integration of TWK, despite its relevance to sustainability. This paper suggests that considering traditional water use and management is necessary to develop flood resilience in an urban context in a sustainable way.

TI  - Variability of Parameters of Single-Layer Cloud Fields over Western Siberia in Summer for the Period from 2001 to 2019 According to MODIS Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term variability of the parameters of single-layer cloud fields over Western Siberia in summer from 2001 to 2019 is estimated based on MODIS data. The seasonal mean cloud cover and cloud parameters (optical thickness, effective radius of particles, waterpath, and top height) are estimated for different single-layer cloud types by the results of cloud classification from summer (June-August) daily satellite images of the target region. Parameters of single-layer clouds are analyzed for three latitudinal zones of Western Siberia: southern (<60 & DEG; N), transitional (60 & DEG;-65 & DEG; N), and northern (>65 & DEG; N). The linear trends in the cloud cover and in cloud parameters are found for different single-layer cloud types from the long-term data series. Convective and low-level clouds in the northern and transition zone of the region under study are characterized by maximal variability of the above parameters. The effect of anomalous blocking anticyclones on some cloud parameters is shown for different cloud types in the considered latitudinal zones of Western Siberia.

TI  - MORPHOMETRIC AND MORPHOTECTONIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WATERSHEDS IN PALELEH REGION, BUOL, INDONESIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, was formed due to tectonic activities from the collision of terranes of three plates, which resulted in typical tectonic-affected landforms. The main objective of this study was to characterize tectonic activity, as it acts as a controlling factor in the development of landforms in tectonically active areas. Digital analysis of remote sensing data was determined using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Reflection and Emission Radiometer (ASTER). 30m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and landform development were carried out to understand the morphometric and morphotectonic characteristics. There were a number of morphometric indices of bifurcation ratio (Rb = < 3), drainage density (Dd = < 4), and mountain front sinuosity (Smf = < 1.52). The low value of bifurcation ratio and mountain front sinuosity indicated that the area is tectonic active. The geomorphic index calculated in this study revealed considerable variations in relief, topography, and the dominance of tectonic activity over erosional processes in forming the watersheds.

TI  - Assessment of Spectral Vegetation Indices Performance for Post-Fire Monitoring of Different Forest Environments
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Although wildfires are a common disturbance factor to the environment, some of them can cause significant environmental and socioeconomic losses, affecting ecosystems and people worldwide. The wildfire identification and assessment of their effects on damaged forest areas is of great importance for provision of effective actions on their management and preservation. Forest regrowth after a fire is a continuously evolving and dynamic process, and the accuracy assessment of different remote sensing indices for its evaluation is a complicated task. The implementation of this task cannot rely on the standard procedures. Therefore, we suggested a method involving delineation of dynamic boundaries between conditional categories within burnt forest areas by application of spectral reflectance characteristics (SRC). This study compared the performance of firmly established for fire monitoring differenced vegetation indices-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and tested the capabilities of tasseled cap-derived differenced Disturbance Index (dDI) for post-fire monitoring purposes in different forest environments (Boreal Mountain Forest (BMF), Mediterranean Mountain Forest (MMF), Mediterranean Hill Forest (MHF)). The accuracy assessment of the tree indices was performed using Very High Resolution (VHR) aerial and satellite data. The results show that dDI has an optimal performance in monitoring post-fire disturbances in more difficult-to-be-differentiated classes, whereas, for post-fire regrowth, the more appropriate is dNDVI. In the first case, dDI has an overall accuracy of 50%, whereas the accuracy of dNBR and dNDVI is barely 35% and 36%. Moreover, dDI shows better performance in 16 accuracy metrics (from 17). In the second case, dNDVI has an overall accuracy of 59%, whereas those of dNBR and dDI are 55% and 52%, and the accuracy metrics in which dNDVI shows better performance than the other two indices are 11 (from 13). Generally, the studied indices showed higher accuracy in assessment of post-fire disturbance rather than of the post-fire forest regrowth, implicitly at test areas-BMF and MMF, and contrary opposite result in the accuracy at MHF. This indicates the relation of the indices' accuracy to the heterogeneity of the environment.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Characteristics Prediction and Driving Factors Analysis of NPP in Shanxi Province Covering the Period 2001-2020
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The advent of a range of high-precision NPP products, including MODIS NPP, MOD17 NPP, and GIMMS NPP, has sparked growing interest in the study of Earth's ecosystems. In order to enhance comprehension of ecosystem health, in order to facilitate the development of rational resource management and environmental conservation policies, this investigation employs the MOD17A3 dataset to analyze historical variations in Net Primary Productivity (NPP) within Shanxi Province from 2001 to 2020, while also exploring future trends. The Theil-Sen median trend analysis and Mann-Kendall test are commonly used methods for analyzing time series data, employed to study the spatiotemporal trends and variations in NPP. The Grey Wolf Optimization-Support Vector Machine (GWO-SVM) model combines optimization algorithms and machine learning methods, enhancing the predictive capacity of the model for future NPP time series changes. Conversely, the Hurst exponent utilizes historical NPP trends to assess the persistence characteristics of NPP and predict future spatial variations in NPP. This study additionally investigates the natural driving factors of NPP using the Geographic Detector approach. The key findings of this study are as follows. (1) Overall, NPP in Shanxi Province exhibits a fluctuating upward trend from 2001 to 2020, with an average value of 206.278 gCm(-2)a(-1). Spatially, NPP exhibits a northwest-low and southeast-high pattern, with significant spatial heterogeneity and considerable variability. (2) The average Hurst exponent is 0.86, indicating a characteristic of strong persistence in growth in future NPP. Regions with strong or higher persistent growth account for 95.54% of the total area. (3) According to the CMIP6 climate scenarios, NPP is projected to gradually increase from 2025 to 2030. (4) The interactive effects between natural factors contribute more to NPP variations than individual factors, with the rainfall-elevation interaction having the highest contribution percentage.

TI  - In the Crucible of Ottoman<i> Tahqiq:</i> A Fifteenth-Century Case of Verifying Philosophy and Theology under Sufi Agnosticism
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARLY MODERN HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Verification (tahqiq) was a post-classical practice in Islamicate scholarship that sought ways to attain syntheses between rational and religious sciences. This article argues, however, that the early Ottoman practice of tahqiq was not limited to the "verification of theology and philosophy," as it also included attempts to reconcile certain Sufi doctrines with philosophical theology. This tendency is evident in the works of fifteenth-century scholars, such as Sinan Pa</n>sa and his shaykh Vefa', as well as al-Jami and ibn Kemal, all of whom tried to reconcile conflicting aspects of philosophy and theology under the overarching rubric of the Akbari worldview. These cases demonstrate that Sufi tahqiq was already present very early in the development of Ottoman intellectual life, and that it was a diffuse and multi-variegated practice that drew upon the universalizing tendencies of Sufi agnosticism.

TI  - Mapping of tide-dominated Hooghly estuary water quality parameters using Sentinel-3 OLCI time-series data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study explores the spatio-temporal variation of water quality parameters in the Hooghly estuary, which is considered an ecologically-stressed shallow estuary and a major distributary for the Ganges River. The estimated parameters are chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter (TSM), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The Sentinel-3 OLCI remote sensing imageries were analyzed for the duration of October 2018 to February 2019. We observed that the water quality of the Hooghly estuaries is comparatively low-oxygenated, mesotrophic, and phosphate-limited. Ongoing channel dredging for maintaining shipping channel depth keeps the TSM in the estuary at an elevated level, with the highest amount of TSM observed during March of 2019 (41.59g m(-3)) at station A, upstream point. Since the pre-monsoon season, TSM data shows a decreasing trend towards the mouth of the estuary. Chl-a concentration is higher during pre-monsoon than monsoon and post-monsoon periods, with the highest value observed in April at 1.09 mg m(-3) in station D during the pre-monsoon period. The CDOM concentration was high in the middle section (January-February) and gradually decreased towards the estuary's head and mouth. The highest CDOM was found in February at locations C and D during the pre-monsoon period. Every station shows a significant correlation among CDOM, TSM, and Chl-a measured parameters. Based on our satellite data analysis, it is recommended that SNAP C2RCC be regionally used for TSM, Chl-a, and CDOM for water quality product retrieval and in various algorithms for the Hooghly estuary monitoring.

TI  - Sensor-based quantification of peanut disease defoliation using an unmanned aircraft system and multispectral imagery.
T2  - Plant disease
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Early leaf spot (Passalora arachidicola) and late leaf spot (Nothopassalora personata) are two of the most economically important foliar fungal diseases of peanut, often requiring 7-8 fungicide applications to protect against defoliation and yield loss. Rust (Puccinia arachidis) may also cause significant defoliation depending on season and location. Sensor technologies are increasingly being utilized to objectively monitor plant disease epidemics for research and supporting integrated management decisions. This study aimed to develop an algorithm to quantify peanut disease defoliation using multispectral imagery captured by an unmanned aircraft system. The algorithm combined the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index and included calibration to site-specific peak canopy growth. Beta regression was used to train a model for percent net defoliation with observed visual estimations of the variety 'GA-06G' (0 to 95%) as the target and imagery as the predictor (train: pseudo-R2 = 0.71, test k-fold cross validation: R2 = 0.84 and RMSE = 4.0%). The model performed well on new data from two field trials not included in model training that compared 25 (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 3.7%) and seven (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 9.4%) fungicide programs. This objective method of assessing mid-to-late season disease severity can be used to assist growers with harvest decisions and researchers with reproducible assessment of field experiments. This model will be integrated into future work with proximal ground sensors for pathogen identification and early-season disease detection.

TI  - Could Airborne Geophysical Data Be Used to Improve Predictive Modeling of Agronomic Soil Properties in Tropical Hillslope Area?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne geophysical data (AGD) have great potential to represent soil-forming factors. Because of that, the objective of this study was to evaluate the importance of AGD in predicting soil attributes such as aluminum saturation (ASat), base saturation (BS), cation exchange capacity (CEC), clay, and organic carbon (OC). The AGD predictor variables include total count (& mu;R/h), K (potassium), eU (uranium equivalent), and eTh (thorium equivalent), ratios between these elements (eTh/K, eU/K, and eU/eTh), factor F or F-parameter, anomalous potassium (Kd), anomalous uranium (Ud), anomalous magnetic field (AMF), vertical derivative (GZ), horizontal derivatives (GX and GY), and mafic index (MI). The approach was based on applying predictive modeling techniques using (1) digital elevation model (DEM) covariates and Sentinel-2 images with AGD; and (2) DEM covariates and Sentinel-2 images without the AGD. The study was conducted in Bom Jardim, a county in Rio de Janeiro-Brazil with an area of 382,430 km(2), with a database of 208 soil samples to a predefined depth (0-30 cm). Non-explanatory covariates for the selected soil attributes were excluded. Through the selected covariables, the random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models were applied with separate samples for training (75%) and validation (25%). The model's performance was evaluated through the R-squared (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), as well as null model values and coefficient of variation (CV%). The RF algorithm showed better performance with AGD (R-2 values ranging from 0.15 to 0.23), as well as the SVM model (R-2 values ranging from 0.08 to 0.23) when compared to RF (R-2 values ranging from 0.10 to 0.20) and SVM (R-2 values ranging from 0.04 to 0.10) models without AGD. Overall, the results suggest that AGD can be helpful for soil mapping. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that the accuracy of AGD in predicting soil properties could vary depending on various common factors in DSM, such as the quality and resolution of the covariates and available soil data. Further research is needed to determine the optimal approach for using AGD in soil mapping.

TI  - Wasting petabytes: A survey of the Sentinel-2 UTM tiling grid and its spatial overhead
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Following Landsat's practice, Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite products are delivered as raster images projected onto the Universal Transversal Mercator (UTM) spatial reference system, which divides Earth into 60 longitudinal zones. Locally, this guarantees high spatial accuracy, while also easing the interoperability with many regional and governmental datums. On top, the Sentinel-2 product grid uses the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) tiling scheme to facilitate manageable data slices and straightforward multitemporal image stacking. Although most convenient for small-area applications, activities with a larger geographic scope suffer from this approach and its overhead, as both data duplication and ambiguity appear along UTM zone overlaps and MGRS tile borders. In practice, such areas that are covered by multiple and incongruent grid pixels are known but just tolerated, and their degree has not been measured so far. In this paper, we illuminate the nature and patterns of these overlaps, and calculate the resulting spatial redundancy over the global land surface. We found that the total land area is enlarged in the Sentinel-2 grid definition by 33%, which is a value similar to the simple and single-zoned Plate Carree projection. The number of co-located grid pixels for a single location ranges from 1 up to 6, with on average more redundancy at mid-and high-latitudes. With regard to global satellite archives in times of big data and increased energy costs, the examined grid appears as a suboptimal choice, inducing complexity and overhead at an unreasonable level. Owing to the grid design, e.g., the yearly Sentinel-2 user product volume (Level-1C and-2A) is inflated by 1 petabyte, entailing cascading downstream costs of storage, bandwidth, and computing.

TI  - Analyze of spatial extent and current condition of land use land cover dynamics for the period 1990-2020 Wayu-Tuka district, western Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - LULC variation has increased in many parts of the world recent years. Analyzing LULC is valuable to ability to grasp for spatial extent, patterns and impacts of the dynamics. This research examines the magnitudes and trends of LULC dynamics of Wayu-Tuka District, Western Ethiopia for a period of 1990-2020. Data were acquired from Landsat images (i.e, TM from 1990 to 2000, ETM+ from 2010 and OLI 2020). LULC classes were classified (from Landsat images) to develop land use land cover change maps for the study area. Landsat images were grouped via supervised classification method and maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). Accuracy scores and kappa a coefficient was used to confirm the accuracy categorized for LULC classes. Forest, settlement area, cultivated area, water body, and bare land are the main land use land cover categories identified in the study area. At the study district, forest coverage decreased progressively within the past three decades (1990-2020) from 12.4% in 1990 to 2.6% in 2020. The settlements, cultivated lands and water bodies have been explained by a average rate of 0.41% per year and forest land has been reduced by 0.33% per year. The study identified the major drivers of land use/land cover dynamics such as expansion of agricultural land, extraction of fuel woodland, illegal settlements and illegal logging was the key factors of LULC changes in the field of the study. In expressions of historical and current LULC, the analysis indicated that in the three decades years' viewpoint; changes in agriculture land expansion and expansion of settlement land have had a strong impact on the LULC dynamics. The few remaining forest area coverage of the District shall be completely vanished unless measures are taken to curb these declining trends. Therefore, relevant stakeholders should take integrated actions to rehabilitate degraded landscapes through afforestation and reforestation programmes.

TI  - Advances in the Management of Early-Stage Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer with both inter- and intratumor heterogeneity, thought to result in a more aggressive course and worse outcomes. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) has become the preferred treatment modality of early-stage TNBC as it allows for the downstaging of tumors in the breast and axilla, monitoring early treatment response, and most importantly, provides important prognostic information that is essential to determining post-surgical therapies to improve outcomes. It focuses on combinations of systemic drugs to optimize pathologic complete response (pCR). Excellent response to NAT has allowed surgical de-escalation in ideal candidates. Further, treatment algorithms guide the systemic management of patients based on their pCR status following surgery. The expanding knowledge of molecular pathways, genomic sequencing, and the immunological profile of TNBC has led to the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted agents, including PARP inhibitors, further revolutionizing the therapeutic landscape of this clinical entity. However, subgroups most likely to benefit from these novel approaches in TNBC remain elusive and are being extensively studied. In this review, we describe current practices and promising therapeutic options on the horizon for TNBC, surgical advances, and future trends in molecular determinants of response to therapy in early-stage TNBC.

TI  - Molecular Interplay between Non-Host Resistance, Pathogens and Basal Immunity as a Background for Fatal Yellowing in Oil Palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i> Jacq.) Plants
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) bud rod disorder of unknown etiology, named Fatal Yellowing (FY) disease, is regarded as one of the top constraints with respect to the growth of the palm oil industry in Brazil. FY etiology has been a challenge embraced by several research groups in plant pathology throughout the last 50 years in Brazil, with no success in completing Koch's postulates. Most recently, the hypothesis of having an abiotic stressor as the initial cause of FY has gained ground, and oxygen deficiency (hypoxia) damaging the root system has become a candidate for stress. Here, a comprehensive, large-scale, single- and multi-omics integration analysis of the metabolome and transcriptome profiles on the leaves of oil palm plants contrasting in terms of FY symptomatology-asymptomatic and symptomatic-and collected in two distinct seasons-dry and rainy-is reported. The changes observed in the physicochemical attributes of the soil and the chemical attributes and metabolome profiles of the leaves did not allow the discrimination of plants which were asymptomatic or symptomatic for this disease, not even in the rainy season, when the soil became waterlogged. However, the multi-omics integration analysis of enzymes and metabolites differentially expressed in asymptomatic and/or symptomatic plants in the rainy season compared to the dry season allowed the identification of the metabolic pathways most affected by the changes in the environment, opening an opportunity for additional characterization of the role of hypoxia in FY symptom intensification. Finally, the initial analysis of a set of 56 proteins/genes differentially expressed in symptomatic plants compared to the asymptomatic ones, independent of the season, has presented pieces of evidence suggesting that breaks in the non-host resistance to non-adapted pathogens and the basal immunity to adapted pathogens, caused by the anaerobic conditions experienced by the plants, might be linked to the onset of this disease. This set of genes might offer the opportunity to develop biomarkers for selecting oil palm plants resistant to this disease and to help pave the way to employing strategies to keep the safety barriers raised and strong.

TI  - Correlates of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> antimicrobial resistance: cross-sectional results from an open cohort sentinel surveillance network in Quebec, Canada, 2016-2019
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo examine correlates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to first-line antimicrobials (azithromycin, cefixime and ceftriaxone). Design and settingThe sentinel surveillance network is an open cohort of gonococcal infection cases from Quebec, Canada. Cross-sectional results are reported herein. ParticipantsBetween 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2019, data from 886 individuals accounting for 941 gonorrhoea cases were included. MethodsEpidemiological and clinical data were collected using an auto-administered questionnaire, direct case interviews and chart reviews. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the agar dilution method. Generalised estimating equations were used for regression. ResultsThe prevalence of azithromycin resistance with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of & GE;2 mg/L was 21.3%. In 2016, men who have sex with men were more likely to be infected with an azithromycin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolate (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR)=4.73, 95% CI 1.48 to 15.19) or with an isolate with increased third-generation cephalosporin (3GC) MIC (aPR=5.32, 95% CI 1.17 to 24.11 for cefixime (MIC & GE;0.06 mg/L) and aPR=4.38, 95% CI 1.53 to 12.54 for ceftriaxone (MIC & GE;0.03 mg/L)). However, these associations were not maintained between 2017 and 2019, with increased MIC observed in men who have sex exclusively with women and women. Overall, azithromycin resistance was significantly more likely in cases who self-reported HIV infection (aPR=1.65, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.71). Cefixime increased MIC were more likely in individuals 25-34 years old (aPR=2.23, 95% CI 1.18 to 4.21). Cefixime and ceftriaxone increased MIC were both more likely in cases who reported & GE;5 sexual partners (cefixime: aPR=2.10, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.27 and ceftriaxone: aPR=1.62, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.30). ConclusionSignificant correlates of N. gonorrhoeae AMR to first-line antimicrobials were observed. Antimicrobial stewardship may be particularly important for 3GC. Active monitoring and interventions are critical for 3GC non-susceptible strains, especially considering the very low prevalence in Quebec.

TI  - Map of Land Cover Agreement: Ensambling Existing Datasets for Large-Scale Training Data Provision
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover information plays a critical role in supporting sustainable development and informed decision-making. Recent advancements in satellite data accessibility, computing power, and satellite technologies have boosted large-extent high-resolution land cover mapping. However, retrieving a sufficient amount of reliable training data for the production of such land cover maps is typically a demanding task, especially using modern deep learning classification techniques that require larger training sample sizes compared to traditional machine learning methods. In view of the above, this study developed a new benchmark dataset called the Map of Land Cover Agreement (MOLCA). MOLCA was created by integrating multiple existing high-resolution land cover datasets through a consensus-based approach. Covering Sub-Saharan Africa, the Amazon, and Siberia, this dataset encompasses approximately 117 billion 10m pixels across three macro-regions. The MOLCA legend aligns with most of the global high-resolution datasets and consists of nine distinct land cover classes. Noteworthy advantages of MOLCA include a higher number of pixels as well as coverage for typically underrepresented regions in terms of training data availability. With an estimated overall accuracy of 96%, MOLCA holds great potential as a valuable resource for the production of future high-resolution land cover maps.

TI  - Water Dynamics Analysis in Karst Flood Areas Using Sentinel-1 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying karst water dynamics is challenging because of the often unknown underground flows. Therefore, studies of visible karst waters receive considerable research emphasis. Researchers are turning to various data sources, including remote sensing imagery, to study them. This research paper presents an assessment of a water bodies dataset, automatically detected from Sentinel-1 imagery, for karst flood research. Statistical and visual analyses were conducted to assess the reliability and effectiveness of the dataset. Spearman's correlation coefficients were employed for statistical analysis to determine the degree of correlation between the areas of water bodies dataset and official water level data. Visual analyses involved the creation of heat maps based on the identified water areas, which were then compared to official flood maps, and the preparation of an analysis of historical flood events or results of hydrological and hydraulic modelling. Additionally, vegetation maps were produced to identify areas that lacked detection and complemented the heat maps. Statistical assessment showed a strong correlation (& GE;0.6) between the dataset and official water level data in smaller flood-prone areas with less complex inflow. Visual analyses using heat maps and vegetation maps effectively identified frequently flooded areas but had limitations in areas with dense vegetation. Comparisons with flood maps showed an important value of the dataset as an additional source of information for karst flood studies. This assessment highlights the dataset's potential in combination with other data sources and modelling approaches.

TI  - Seroprevalence of IgG Antibodies Directed against Dengue, Chikungunya and West Nile Viruses and Associated Risk Factors in Madagascar, 2011 to 2013
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Arboviruses have been shown to circulate in Madagascar, including West Nile, dengue, and chikungunya viruses, though the extent of their circulation remains poorly documented. We estimated the seroprevalence of these three arboviruses in Madagascar and determined risk factors associated with seropositivity. Serum samples obtained from 1680 individuals surrounding the Sentinel Health Centers network in all regions of the country were analyzed using ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition assays for dengue, chikungunya, and West Nile viruses IgG antibodies, and multivariate logistic regression models were run. Overall, 6.5% [IC 95% 3.2-9.9] were seropositive for dengue virus, predominantly of Dengue serotype 1, 13.7% [IC 95% 6.5-20.9] for chikungunya virus, and 12.7% [IC 95% 9.0-16.5] for West Nile virus. There was no association with age, showing that dengue and chikungunya viruses were likely recently introduced. Eastern and Northern parts were more affected by dengue and chikungunya viruses, while West Nile virus seemed to circulate in all parts of the country. Dengue and chikungunya seropositivity were notably associated with high levels of vegetation, as well as frequent work in the forest, and West Nile seropositivity with the presence of cultivated areas, as well as standard of living. This analysis gives a new insight into arboviruses circulation and transmission patterns in Madagascar.

TI  - Estimating aboveground biomass density using hybrid statistical inference with GEDI lidar data and Paraguay's national forest inventory
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are widely recognized as critical to combating climate change due to their ability to sequester and store carbon in the form of biomass. In recent years, the combined use of data from ground-based forest inventories and remotely sensed data from light detection and ranging (lidar) has proven useful for large-scale assessment of forest biomass, but airborne lidar is expensive and data acquisition is infeasible for many countries. By contrast, the spaceborne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar instrument has collected freely available data for most of the world's temperate and tropical forests since 2019. GEDI's biomass products rely on models calibrated with a global network of field plots paired with GEDI waveforms simulated from airborne lidar to predict biomass. While this calibration strategy minimizes spatial and temporal offsets between field measurements and corresponding lidar returns, calibration data are sparse in many regions. Paraguay's forests are known to be poorly represented in GEDI's current calibration dataset, and here we demonstrate that local models calibrated opportunistically with on-orbit GEDI data and field surveys from Paraguay's national forest inventory can be used with GEDI's statistical estimators of aboveground biomass density (AGBD). We specify a protocol for opportunistically matching GEDI observations with field plots to calibrate a field-to-GEDI biomass model for use in GEDI's hybrid statistical framework. Country-specific calibration using on-orbit data resulted in relatively accurate and unbiased predictions of footprint-level biomass, and importantly, supported the assumption underlying model-based inference that the model must 'apply' to the area of interest. Using a locally calibrated biomass model, we estimate that the mean AGBD in Paraguay is 65.55 Mg ha(-1), which coincides well with the design-based approach employed by the national forest inventory. The GEDI estimates for individual forest strata range from 52.34 Mg ha(-1) to 103.88 Mg ha(-1). On average, the standard errors are 47% lower for estimates based on GEDI than the forest inventory, representing a significant gain in precision. Our research demonstrates that GEDI can be used by national forest inventories in countries that seek reliable estimates of AGBD, and that local calibration using existing field plots may be more appropriate in some applications than using GEDI global models, especially in regions where those models are sparsely calibrated.

TI  - 10-Year axillary recurrence in the RACS SNAC1 randomised trial of sentinel lymph node-based management versus routine axillary lymph node dissection
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel node-based management (SNBM) is the international standard of care for early breast cancer that is clinically node-negative based on rand-omised trials comparing it with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and reporting similar rates of axillary recurrence (AR) without distant disease. We report all ARs, overall survival, and breast cancer-specific survival at 10-years in SNAC1.Methods: 1.088 women with clinically node-negative, unifocal breast cancers 3 cm or less in diameter were randomly assigned to either SNBM with ALND if the sentinel node (SN) was positive, or to SN biopsy followed by ALND regardless of SN involvement.Results: First ARs were more frequent in those assigned SNBM rather than ALND (11 events, cumulative risk at 10-years 1.85%, 95% CI 0.95-3.27% versus 2 events, 0.37%, 95% CI 0.08-1.26%; HR 5.47, 95% CI 1.21-24.63; p = 0.013). Disease-free survival, breast cancer-specific survival, and overall survival were similar in those assigned SNBM versus ALND. Lymphovascular invasion was an independent predictor of AR (HR 6.6, 95% CI 2.25-19.36, p < 0.001).Conclusion: First ARs were more frequent with SNBM than ALND in women with small, unifocal breast cancers when all first axillary events were considered. We recommend that studies of axillary treatment should report all ARs to give an accurate indication of treatment effects. The absolute frequency of AR was low in women meeting our eligibility criteria, and SNBM should remain the treatment of choice in this group. However, for those with higher-risk breast cancers, further study is needed because the estimated risk of AR might alter their choice of axillary surgery.

TI  - The Performance of Hyperspectral Measurements Integrated into Multispectral Data on the Detection of the Alpine Chromite Deposits in the Ophiolite Complexes
T2  - GEOLOGY OF ORE DEPOSITS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intense tectonic activities and alterations in ophiolites of the Alpine-Himalayan Orogeny Belt complicate the delineation and mapping of chromite-bearing rocks by traditional geology surveys. This study tests the performance of ASTER-based remote sensing in a region covered by ophiolite rocks with complex geology, alteration, and intense tectonism in Eastern-Central Anatolia. Today, there are many chromite deposits and detected mineralizations in the study area. The fact that there was almost no chromite mining activity in the study area at the acquisition date of the ASTER data, highlights the usability of the results of the remote sensing methods and techniques applied in the study for mineral exploration activities. According to field surveys, petrographic examinations, and ore microscopy, the ophiolite rocks consist of serpentinized peridotite, harzburgite, dunite, diabase, and gabbro. Chromite mineralizations occur in dunites such as disseminated, banded, and lens-shaped. Hyperspectral signatures obtained from the representative rock and mineralization samples using ASD FieldSpec 4 Hi-Res have been integrated into the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) multispectral satellite data. This study shows the performance of image enhancement techniques such as band ratio, minimum noise fraction (MNF), and spectral classification such as matched filtering (MF). The boundaries of ophiolite rocks with band ratio techniques are distinguished at the regional scale of the boundaries of sedimentary and igneous rocks, but sub-ophiolite rock units are not distinctly appearing within the ophiolite rocks. The MNF results can distinguish chromite-bearing rocks from the other rocks, although the boundaries of the rocks are not very distinct. The MF results map the sub-ophiolite units with high accuracy, except for the diabase dykes. The MF results have an overall accuracy of over 84% and a kappa coefficient of 0.74. Most of the chromite-bearing sites identified in the MF are currently being operated as chromite deposits. Consequently, this study shows that the MF spectral classification can be high performance in the delineation of chromite-bearing rocks in the ophiolite complexes.

TI  - Application of Spectral Analysis and Image Processing Methods to Discriminate Hydrothermal Alteration Minerals Around the Tutakdagi (Sebinkarahisar-Giresun) Lead-Zinc Deposits, Northeastern Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Tutakdagi (Sebinkarahisar-Giresun) area is located in the southern part of the Eastern Pontides, northeastern Turkey. It contains numerous types of mineralization, examples include massive sulfide, porphyry, skarn, and vein. The Tutakdagi area contains vein-type Pb-Zn deposits hosted by Upper Cretaceous volcanic rocks. Hydrothermal alteration and oxidized weathering products are well exposed in this mineralization area. Due to the inaccessible points, steep slopes, and rugged topography of the area, it is difficult to apply traditional geological field studies. This research addresses the applicability of remote sensing methods to identify and map alteration mineralogy within the area and presents the results of a set of remote sensing investigations, including spectral measurements, band ratios, relative absorption band depth, principal component analysis, and matched filtering techniques on the Landsat-8 OLI and the ASTER data sets. The spectral investigations were performed on the representative altered rock samples and the powder samples obtained during the clay separation processes. The spectra of hydrothermal alteration minerals like kaolinite, halloysite, illite, montmorillonite, kaolin/smectite, illite + smectite, illite + montmorillonite, montmorillonite + smectite, muscovite, chlorite, and calcite and the iron oxide/hydroxide minerals like jarosite, limonite and goethite were identified. A mineral distribution map has been prepared, and all the outputs on these maps contain useful information to track the distributions of hydrothermal alteration minerals, weathering-related iron oxide/hydroxide occurrences surrounding mineralization zones, and the lineament/lineament density. These maps are prepared in a shorter time and with lower costs compared to classical field geological methods and can make a valuable contribution to the exploration of new lead-zinc deposits in the region.

TI  - Diatom Indicators of Fluctuating/Intermittent Discharge from Springs in Two Bavarian Nature Conservation Areas
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - As a follow-up to the project "Springs in the Bavarian National Parks as Indicators of Climate Change (SpringNPB)", a standard methodology for using springs as sentinel environments of climate change was transferred to the UNESCO Rhon Biosphere Reserve and other Bavarian middle-elevation mountain ranges. We studied diatoms from fifteen springs selected in the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (9) and Steigerwald Nature Park (6). A total of 127 species belonging to 40 genera were found sampling 3 microhabitat types (lithic materials, hygrophilous or aquatic vegetation, and surface sediments). The cumulative percentage of endangered species according to the Red List was 41.5%. These very shaded, low-medium conductivity, low-discharge forest springs are fed by small surficial aquifers. As a consequence, the discharge fluctuates widely, and some springs even occasionally fall dry. Our results could contribute to the use of diatoms as indicators of discharge variability/desiccation in springs: springs affected by discharge variability have lower diatom species richness and distinct diatom communities; diatom indicators and metrics can be validated using invertebrates; larger databases will be necessary to identify the most suitable diatom indicators.

TI  - Invited Commentary: De-escalation of axillary surgery in node-positive breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant therapy
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The surgical management of patients presenting with node-positive breast cancer who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been an area of focus and debate as neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens increasingly eradicate the nodal disease. Axillary lymph node dissection has been the standard surgical approach, which carries morbidity risks of lymphedema, pain, and limited range of motion. Although there has been interest in de-escalating axillary surgery, hurdles must be addressed. The first is finding an accurate way to assess nodal response. Many trials have looked at this using the false negative rate as the defining endpoint, all finding that surgical techniques such as using a dual tracer technique, adding immunohistochemistry, and ensuring removal of the node that had biopsy-confirmed disease at diagnosis can impact the accuracy of minimally invasive approaches to evaluate the axilla. However, the second hurdle of defining the impact of minimizing axillary surgery on locoregional and overall outcomes has yet to be answered. Ongoing trials may give us insights over the next few years. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - An Assessment of Landscape and Land Use/Cover Change and Its Implications for Sustainable Landscape Management in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-caused environmental change has profoundly impacted resource management and land use patterns in Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts. This study used multi-temporal Land-sat images from 1998, 2008, and 2018 to analyze land use and land cover changes, particularly those associated with forest cover changes, in Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts. Using object-based image classification, Landsat images from 1998, 2008, and 2018 were separated into four categories based on their dominant land use and land cover features: forest, grassland, water bodies, and bare land. Post-classification comparison was used to assess the degree and frequency of change, and this method was further developed to evaluate the balance, fluctuation, and adaptation of forests. In addition, the spatial structure of land cover and temporal trajectories related to changes in for-est cover were studied. The CA-Markov chain model was also used to anticipate the 2048 LULC map. The image classification of the years 1998, 2008, and 2018 showed that the overall accuracy was 89.65%, 84.44%, and 86.26%; producer accuracy was 90.00%, 68.75%, and 72.22%; and the Kappa coefficient was 85.68, 82.84, and 76.36, respectively. The results showed that between 1998 and 2018, forest cover increased by 58.03%, transforming grassland to forest; grassland increased by 29.50%, converting bare land to grassland; and forest conversion to grassland was 13.34%. In addition, the result of the landscape metric revealed that during the whole study period, class level indicated a fragmentation of forest, bare land, grassland, and water in the CHT, and landscape level indicated by Shannon's Diversity Index and Shannon's Evenness Index showed a slight decrease in the land. Based on the CA-Markov model, forest area is predicted to expand to 9129 Km(2) in 2048; however, other land uses (bare land and grassland) continue to decrease. This substantial increase in forest cover results from effective forest management based on community forestry practices and the suc-cessful execution of Bangladesh's national forest strategy. However, as Bangladesh's population rises, so does the country's need for lumber/timber. Bangladesh's government should revise its for-est policy to meet the local community's needs without endangering the forest, and policymakers must take climate change seriously. Our strategy for evaluating the critical indicators of changes in forest cover and pathways of change will aid in connecting these patterns to the dynamics of change, such as deforestation and reforestation. It would therefore serve as a framework for developing effective conservation and management plans for the Chittagong Hill regions in Bangladesh.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of fire occurrence Dead Fuel Index threshold and spatio-temporal variation in different grassland types of China-Mongolia border area
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is manifesting rapidly in the form of fires, droughts, floods, resource scarcity, and species loss, and remains a global risk. Owing to the disaster risk management, there is a need to determine the Dead Fuel Index (DFI) threshold of the fire occurrence area and analyze the spatio-temporal variation of DFI to apply prevention measures efficiently and facilitate sustainable fire risk management. This study used the MODIS Burned Area Monthly L3 (MCD64A1), Landsat Global Burned Area (BA) products, and MODIS Surface Reflectance 8-Day L3 (MOD09A1) data from 2001 to 2020 to calculate the values of the DFI in the study area before the occurrence of fire. The results showed that: (1) The inversion of the meadow steppe DFI values in the fire area was distributed in the range of 14-26, and the fire rate was the highest in the range of 20-22. The inversion of the typical steppe DFI values in the fire area was distributed in the range of 12-26, and the fire rate was the highest in the range of 16-22. (2) Areas with high fire DFI values included Khalkhgol, Matad, Erdenetsagaan, Bayandun, Gurvanzagal, Dashbalbar in Mongolia, and scattered areas of the Greater Khingan Mountains (forest edge meadow steppe area), East and West Ujumqin Banner, and Xin Barag Right Banner. The highest fire probability of fire occurred during October and April. (3) The DFI values were sensitive to changes in altitude. The results of this study may provide useful information on surface energy balance, grassland carbon storage, soil moisture, grassland health, land desertification, and grazing in the study area, especially for fire risk management.

TI  - Mapping of Ecological Environment Based on Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing Platform and Landsat Long-Term Data: A Case Study of the Zhoushan Archipelago
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, with the rapid advancement of China's urbanization, the contradiction between urban development and the ecological environment has become increasingly prominent, and the urban ecological system now faces severe challenges. In this study, we proposed an ecological index-based approach to monitor and evaluate the ecological environment using a Google Earth Engine cloud-based platform and Landsat time series. Firstly, a long-term series of Landsat images was obtained to construct and calculate the remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI). Then, the Theil-Sen median estimation and the Mann-Kendall test were used to evaluate the trend and significance of the RSEI time series and combined with the Hurst index to predict the future development trend of the ecological environment in the study area. Finally, the coefficient of variation method was used to determine the temporal stability of the ecological environment. Taking Zhoushan Archipelago, China, as the study area, we mapped the distribution of the ecological environment using a spatial resolution of 30 m and evaluated the ecological environment from 1985 to 2020. The results show that (1) from 1985 to 2020, the average RSEI in the Zhoushan Archipelago decreased from 0.7719 to 0.5817, increasing at a rate of -24.64%. (2) The changes in the areas of each level of ecological environmental quality show that the ecological environment in the Zhoushan Archipelago generally exhibited a decreasing trend. During the study period, the proportion of the areas with excellent ecological environmental quality decreased by 38.83%, while the proportion of areas with poor and relatively poor ecological environmental quality increased by 20.03%. (3) Based on the overall change trend, the degradation in the ecological environment in the Zhoushan Archipelago was greater than the improvement, with the degradation area accounting for 84.35% of the total area, the improvement area accounting for 12.61% of the total area, and the stable area accounting for 3.05% of the total area. (4) From the perspective of the sustainability of the changes, in 86.61% of the study area, the RSEI exhibited positive sustainability, indicating that the sustainability of the RSEI was relatively strong. (5) The coefficient of variation in the RSEI was concentrated in the range of 0-0.40, having an average value of 0.1627 and a standard deviation of 0.1467, indicating that the RSEI values in the Zhoushan Archipelago during the study period were concentrated, the interannual fluctuations of the data were small, and the time series was relatively stable. The results of this study provide theoretical methods and a decision-making basis for the dynamic monitoring and regional governance of the ecological environment in island areas.

TI  - Land-Use Mapping with Multi-Temporal Sentinel Images Based on Google Earth Engine in Southern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use maps are thematic materials reflecting the current situation, geographical diversity, and classification of land use and are an important scientific foundation that can assist decision-makers in adjusting land-use structures, agricultural zoning, regional planning, and territorial improvement according to local conditions. Spectral reflectance and radar signatures of time series are important in distinguishing land-use types. However, their impact on the accuracy of land-use mapping and decision making remains unclear. Also, the many spatial and temporal heterogeneous landscapes in southern Xinjiang limit the accuracy of existing land-use classification products. Therefore, our objective herein is to develop reliable land-use products for the highly heterogeneous environment of the southern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region using the freely available public Sentinel image datasets. Specifically, to determine the effect of temporal features on classification, several classification scenarios with different temporal features were developed using multi-temporal Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and terrain data in order to assess the importance, contribution, and impact of different temporal features (spectral and radar) on land-use classification models and determine the optimal time for land-use classification. Furthermore, to determine the optimal method and parameters suitable for local land-use classification research, we evaluated and compared the performance of three decision-tree-related classifiers (classification and regression tree, random forest, and gradient tree boost) with respect to classifying land use. Yielding the highest average overall accuracy (95%), kappa (95%), and F1 score (98%), we determined that the gradient tree boost model was the most suitable for land-use classification. Of the four individual periods, the image features in autumn (25 September to 5 November) were the most accurate for all three classifiers in relation to identifying land-use classes. The results also show that the inclusion of multi-temporal image features consistently improves the classification of land-use products, with pre-summer (28 May-20 June) images providing the most significant improvement (the average OA, kappa, and F1 score of all the classifiers were improved by 6%, 7%, and 3%, respectively) and fall images the least (the average OA, kappa, and F1 score of all the classifiers were improved by 2%, 3%, and 2%, respectively). Overall, these analyses of how classifiers and image features affect land-use maps provide a reference for similar land-use classifications in highly heterogeneous areas. Moreover, these products are designed to describe the highly heterogeneous environments in the study area, for example, identifying pear trees that affect local economic development, and allow for the accurate mapping of alpine wetlands in the northwest.

TI  - Retrieval of Sea Surface Skin Temperature from the High Resolution Picture Transmission Data of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Series Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) data of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) series meteorological satellites had been received by the SeaSpace ground station located at the Ocean University of China (OUC). Based on the atmospheric radiative transfer model, we obtained the NOAA-15/16/17/18/19 Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sea surface skin temperature (SSTskin) data using the Bayesian cloud detection method and the optimal estimation (OE) sea surface temperature (SST) retrieval algorithm. Compared with the NOAA/AVHRR multi-channel SST data, the AVHRR SSTskin data have higher data accuracy. We also compared the AVHRR SSTskin with the buoy SST with spatial and temporal windows of 0.01 & DEG; and 30 min. The daytime biases ranged from -0.32 & DEG;C (NOAA-16) to 0.08 & DEG;C (NOAA-17) with standard deviations (SDs) ranging from 0.36 & DEG;C (NOAA-18/ NOAA-19) to 0.60 & DEG;C (NOAA-16), and the nighttime biases ranged from -0.26 & DEG;C (NOAA-16) to -0.02 & DEG;C (NOAA-17) with SDs ranging from 0.33 & DEG;C (NOAA-19) to 0.60 & DEG;C (NOAA-16). The accuracy of all five satellite data during daytime and nighttime was significantly improved. These results show that the AVHRR SSTskin of NOAA series satellites is good and consistent in different periods, and the SSTskin data products with high spatial resolution and accuracy can be used for mesoscale and submesoscale marine applications.

TI  - Summer Chlorophyll-a Increase Induced by Upwelling off the Northeastern Coast of Hainan Island, South China Sea
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - There are generally high chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) where upwelling is prevalent. High Chl-a is often observed in upwelling areas of the northeastern coast of Hainan Island during the summer. Using the satellite remote sensing data, including sea surface temperature, sea surface wind and Chl-a data from 2009 to 2022, we analyze the spatial-temporal and inter-annual variation of Chl-a on the northeastern coast of Hainan Island. Then, the possible influence of environmental factors on Chl-a are further examined by using satellite data, as well as Ekman transport and Ekman pumping velocity derived from the wind products. Finally, the key factors affecting the changes of Chl-a are discussed by correlation analysis. The results show the significant interannual variation of Chl-a in the region, with the maximum of summer Chl-a during the prevalent period of upwelling. The correlation analyses reveal that there is a higher correlation coefficient between the summer Chl-a and the upwelling index (i.e., upwelling regional temperature anomaly), suggesting the role played by upwelling in the summer high Chl-a is more important than the other environmental factors. It is speculated that the summer Chl-a increase is not only influenced by wind-induced upwelling but also by the upwelling caused by tidal mixing, large-scale circulation, topographic changes, and typhoon events.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node assessment in melanoma: current state and future directions
T2  - HISTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Assessment of sentinel lymph node status is an important step in the evaluation of patients with melanoma for both prognosis and therapeutic management. Pathologists have an important role in this evaluation. The methodologies have varied over time, from the evaluation of dimensions of metastatic burden to determination of the location of the tumour deposits within the lymph node to precise cell counting. However, no single method of sentinel lymph node tumour burden measurement can currently be used as a sole independent predictor of prognosis. The management approach to sentinel lymph node-positive patients has also evolved over time, with a more conservative approach recently recognised for selected cases. This review gives an overview of past and current status in the field with a glimpse into future directions based on prior experiences and clinical trials.

TI  - Application of Deep Learning in Multitemporal Remote Sensing Image Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The rapid advancement of remote sensing technology has significantly enhanced the temporal resolution of remote sensing data. Multitemporal remote sensing image classification can extract richer spatiotemporal features. However, this also presents the challenge of mining massive data features. In response to this challenge, deep learning methods have become prevalent in machine learning and have been widely applied in remote sensing due to their ability to handle large datasets. The combination of remote sensing classification and deep learning has become a trend and has developed rapidly in recent years. However, there is a lack of summary and discussion on the research status and trends in multitemporal images. This review retrieved and screened 170 papers and proposed a research framework for this field. It includes retrieval statistics from existing research, preparation of multitemporal datasets, sample acquisition, an overview of typical models, and a discussion of application status. Finally, this paper discusses current problems and puts forward prospects for the future from three directions: adaptability between deep learning models and multitemporal classification, prospects for high-resolution image applications, and large-scale monitoring and model generalization. The aim is to help readers quickly understand the research process and application status of this field.

TI  - Unicentric Castleman's disease imitating metastatic melanoma: A case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and importance: This case report shows a unique case of Castleman's disease in the context of his-topathological diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma where clinical and radiological features of Castleman's disease were masked by presumptive diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. The disease is part of a group of lymphopro-liferative disorders with characteristic histopathological features that can occur in any lymph node in the body, characterised by slow growing painless masses which are asymptomatic until mass effect occurs. This case highlights the need for caution when considering management of lymphadenopathy with clinically/radiologi-cally suspicious nodes. Presentation of case: A 65 year old man with metastatic melanoma of the left elbow presented for axillary sentinel node mapping and was found to have a hypoechoic enlarged node on ultrasound. This was further investigated and found to be a lymphoproliferative growth pathognomonic for Castlemans disease.Discussion: Whilst clinically detected lymphadenopathy in the draining node basin of a primary cutaneous melanoma is highly suspicious for nodal metastasis, it is sometimes not possible to confirm or exclude this diagnosis without complete histological examination of the node. Multidisciplinary input from the surgeon, histopathologist and radiologist is a key step in confirming diagnosis.Conclusion: Alternative diagnoses must be considered in the context of lymphadenopathy, even in the context of malignant melanoma.

TI  - Spatial Distribution of Snow Cover in Tibet and Topographic Dependence
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many major river systems in Asia, such as the Yangtze, Yarlung Zangbo, Indus, Ganges and Salween originate in the Tibetan mountains and snow cover in Tibet provides substantial water resources for these rivers, in addition to its weather-related and climatic significance. The high mountain terrain of Tibet is the main condition that snow cover exists and persists at mid-low altitudes. However, the relationships between snow cover and topographic factors of the plateau have not been fully addressed. In this study, the overall spatial distribution of snow cover and the impacts of topography (elevation, aspect and slope) on snow cover distribution in Tibet were analyzed based on the MODIS snow cover product and digital elevation model (DEM) using GIS spatial analysis techniques. The results showed that (1) snow cover in Tibet is spatially very uneven and is characterized by rich snow and high SCF (snow cover frequency) on Nyainqentanglha mountain and the surrounding high mountains, with less snow and a low SCF in the southern Tibetan valley and central part of northern Tibet. (2) Snow cover in Tibet has a strong elevation dependence and a higher SCF corresponds well with high mountain ranges. The mean SCF below 2000 m above sea level (m a.s.l) was less than 4%, while above 6000 m a.s.l, it reached 75%. (3) Intra-annual snow cover distribution below 4000 m a.s.l was characterized by unimodal patterns, while above 4000 m a.s.l, it was characterized by bimodal patterns. The lowest SCF below 6000 m a.s.l occurred in summer, while above 6000 m it occurred in winter. (4) The mountain slope and aspect affect snow cover distribution through changing radiation and energy balances in the mountain regions. The mean SCF generally increased with mountain slopes, with the highest on the north-facing aspect and the lowest on the south-facing aspect.

TI  - Snow Cover on the Tibetan Plateau and Topographic Controls
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover plays a critical role in global energy and water cycles. Snow cover on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) provides vital water sources in western China and Himalayan regions, in addition to its weather and climate significance. The massive high mountain topography of the TP is the main condition for the presence and persistence of snow cover on the plateau at the mid-low latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (NH). However, how the mountain topography controls snow-cover distribution on the TP remains largely unclear, and the relationship is not well quantified. Here, the spatial distribution and the topographic controls of snow cover on the TP are examined based on snow cover frequency (SCF) derived from MODIS snow cover product (MOD10A2 v005) and digital elevation model (DEM) data. The results show that snow cover on the TP is spatially unevenly distributed, and that it is characterized by rich snow and high SCF on the interior and the surrounding high mountain ranges, with less snow and low SCF in inland basins and river valleys. Snow cover on the TP presents elevation dependence: the higher the altitude, the higher the SCF, the longer the snow cover duration, and the more stable the intra-annual variation. The annual mean SCF below 3000 m above sea level (m a.s.l) is less than 4%, and it reaches 77% above 6000 m a.s.l. The intra-annual snow cover variation below 4000 m a.s.l features a unimodal distribution, while above 4000 m a.s.l it presents a bimodal distribution. The mean minimum SCF below 6000 m a.s.l occurs in summer, while above 6000 m a.s.l it occurs in winter. Due to differences in solar radiation and moisture condition caused by the mountain slope and aspect, the mean SCF generally increases with mountain slopes, and it is the highest on the north-facing aspect and the lowest on the south-facing aspect.

TI  - Remote sensing water quality inversion using sparse representation: Chlorophyll-a retrieval from Sentinel-2 MSI data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been widely applied to estimate the water quality parameters using empirical approaches. Numerous algorithms have been developed for water quality retrieval. However, the identification of key features for inversion and the reduction of uncertainty with limited field measurements are crucial aspects. In this study, satellite-based sparse representation is developed as an optimization model to simultaneously determine the major spectral features, and estimate water quality maps under noisy environment. Result shows that the blue-green ratio is the impor-tant feature for estimation of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, whereas the NIR-red algorithm is the better one with in retrieving Chl-a in a high concentration case. The Chl-a map is estimated by using main spectral features of Sentinel 2 MSI data constrained with observations (correlations between observations and estimations: over 0.9). The rapid mapping of Chl-a in inland water al-lows us to assess spatial distribution of the water quality. This study provides reliable and inter-pretable information for policymakers to implement effective water quality management prac-tices.

It begins with the Sino-Amer i can Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction (JCRR), a US-funded agency championing plant breed ing and land reform. Capitalizing on Jap a nese colo nial leg acy, a tech no cratic Chi nese nation al ism, and Cold War geo pol i tics, the JCRR boosted the pro duc tiv ity of rice while diver si fy ing the agri cul tural econ-omy through veg e ta ble cul ti va tion. The AVRDC, supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the US gov ern ment, was cre ated in 1971 to bring this vision to Southeast Asia. The expul sion of Taiwan from the United Nations none the less threat ened the cen ters' sur vival. To carve out its sphere of influ ence, the AVRDC com bined veg e ta ble breed ing pro grams with exper i ments on home gar den ing and small-scale agri cul ture, inserting itself into a bourgeoning sus tain-abil ity dis course in the 1980s. The arti cle argues that the cen ters' ambig u ous posi tion within the inter na tional agri cul tural research net work prompted it to adopt a "mod est nar ra tive" that celebrated not heroic figures but the collaborative endeavor ofscientists sympathetic to farmers. However, the marginalization of agriculture and shifting identity politics in Taiwan made the cen ters' achieve ment increas ingly less rel e vant to its host coun try, thus com pli cat ing the sig-nificance of the AVRDC to the agri cul tural his tory of Taiwan.

TI  - Preliminary Study of Axillary Lymphatic Drainage in Cutaneous Melanoma Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The axilla is a region of fundamental importance for the implications during oncological surgery, and there are many classifications of axillary lymph node subdivision: on the basis of studies on women with breast cancer, we used Clough's and Li's classification. However, currently we do not have a gold-standard classification regarding axillary lymphatic drainage in melanoma patients. Purpose: Our aim was to evaluate how these classifications could be adapted to sentinel lymph node evaluation in skin-melanoma patients and to look for a possible correlation between the most recent classifications of axillary lymph node location and Oeslner's classification, one of the most common anatomical classifications still widespread today. Methods: We analyzed data from 21 patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy between January 2021 and January 2022. Results: Our study demonstrates that, to an extent, there is a possible difference in the use of the various classifications, hinting at possible limits of each. The data we obtained underline how cutaneous melanoma presents extremely heterogenous lymphatic drainage at the level of the axillary cavity. However, the limited data in our possession do not allow us to obtain, at the moment, results that are statistically significant, although we are continuing to enroll patients and collect data. Conclusions: Results of this study support the evidence that the common classifications used for breast cancer do not seem to be exhaustive. Therefore, a specific axillary lymph node classification is necessary in skin melanoma patients.

TI  - Temporal analysis of the planform morphology of the Quevedo River, Ecuador, using remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to characterize the channel morphology and dynamic changes of the Quevedo River during 1986-2019 using Landsat and Sentinel satellite images. We classified around one hundred bends within a 125 km long section of the river into simple and compound bends. We measured their morphometric parameters: bend length, channel width, the radius of curvature, and sinuosity index (SI). Quevedo River showed a decrease in sinuosity and its total length (-3.7 km), mainly caused by cutoffs. Then, we compared the sequential positions of 50 bends or meanders (bends with SI > 1.25) in 1986-2000 and 2000-2019 to classify their change patterns and measure their migration's distance, rate, and direction. We found that migration patterns were dominated by translation and extension of bends and the presence of two differentiated reaches. The northern reach presents average migration rates four times higher than the southern one (7.1 vs. 1.7 m/year). Along with the observed decrease in sinuosity, there is a generalized decrease in migration rates, which might be attributed to the con-struction of the Baba Dam upstream of the river. Finally, we found that migration rates were maximum in meanders with medium curvatures. These findings can contribute to improving river management and imple-menting policies to increase local communities' resilience to river hazards.

TI  - An Extraordinary Location of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in a Patient with Endometrial Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To show dissection of sentinel lymph nodes.Design: A step-by-step demonstration of the technique with narration.Setting: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic malignancy worldwide. Sentinel lymph node biopsy with indocyanine green (ICG) has become more widely used and has been featured in recently published guidelines for EC [1]. Minimally invasive approaches with the sentinel lymph node concept (conventional laparoscopy, laparoscopic-assisted vaginal surgeries or robotic) to EC staging have resulted in lower rates of peri- and postoperative complications than conventional staging procedures [2].Interventions: No video article has been published in the literature about high pelvic, para-aortic sentinel lymph node dissection. An informed consent form was obtained from the patient. An institutional review board approval was not required. A 45 -year-old female with gravidity 0, parity 0, and body mass index of 23.4 kg/m(2) presented with complaints of abnormal uterine bleeding (spotting). Increased endometrial thickness was detected on transvaginal ultrasound (10 mm) in the post-menstrual period. Endometrioid-type endometrial adenocancer with focal squamous differentiation International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade I was detected on endometrial biopsy. The patient had hepatitis B virus positivity and no other chronic disease. A laparotomic myomectomy had been performed in 2016. Laparoscopic high pelvic, low para-aortic sentinel lymph node dissection with ICG and hysterectomy (without uterine manipulator) + bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed (Supplemental Video 1). The operation time for the procedure was 110 minutes and the estimated blood loss was <20 mL. No major complications occurred during or after the surgery. The patient stayed in the hospital for 1 day. The final pathology result showed an International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade I, endometrioid-type endometrial adenocancer with focal squamous differentiation, as a 1.5 x 1 cm tumorous mass invading less than one-half of the myometrium. Neither lymphovascular invasion nor sentinel lymph node metastasis was detected. A multicenter, prospective study showed that sentinel lymph node dissection with ICG in clinical stage 1 EC is feasible and has a high degree of diagnostic accuracy in detecting EC metastases. In that study, isolated para-aortic sentinel lymph node was detected in 3 of 340 patients (<1%) [2]. Another study reported the detection rate of isolated para-aortic sentinel lymph node to be 1.1% in patients with intermediate- and high-risk EC [3].Conclusion: There are in some cases 2 distinct channels emanating from one side, and it is important to follow each and to acknowledge there may be more than one sentinel, one of which is lower in a typical location and one higher as in this case. This video article is the first video demonstration of bilateral isolated high pelvic, para-aortic sentinel lymph node dissection in EC.

TI  - Local Variability of Trace Element Concentration in Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) Nestlings from the Po Plain (Northern Italy)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Birds are commonly used as bioindicators, and their feathers are considered suitable tissues for assessing the presence of contaminants, such as trace elements, in the environment. In agroecosystems, trace elements' occurrence can be associated with both natural and anthropogenic processes, including vehicular traffic, traditional fertilizers, food feed additives for livestock, and the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer. Here, we evaluated the concentrations of twelve trace elements (Aluminium, Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Mercury, Manganese, Nickel, Lead, Selenium, and Zinc) in the feathers of barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) nestlings. We then compared the concentrations of these elements between nestlings grown in areas amended or not amended with sewage sludge in 2019 and 2020 in a broad region of the Po Plain (Northern Italy). Multivariate analysis showed that the element content of the feathers significantly differed among years and areas, suggesting that the concentration of nestlings' feathers may indicate the local level of contamination. However, univariate analyses did not show clear spatial differences, possibly due to co-occurring sources of trace elements other than sewage sludge. These results suggest that barn swallow nestlings can be a reliable sentinel for the monitoring of local variation of the environmental occurrence of trace elements.

TI  - Litho-structural and hydrothermal alteration mapping for mineral prospection in the Maider basin of Morocco based on remote sensing and field investigations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat 8 OLI images were processed using band ratio (RB), principal component analysis (PCA), composite ratios (CR) 4/2-6/7-6/5 were used to map lithology, geological structures, and hydrothermal alteration zones. The studied area, Jbel Boulachrhal, is characterized by copper, barite, and amethyst mineralization and is in the Maider basin at the level of Morocco's eastern Anti-Atlas, which is formed by Paleozoic landfills. This vein-type mineralization, which oriented NE-SW, NNE-SSW, to E-W corresponds to the main orientations of mapped faults using remote sensing and confirmed by the field study, and is revealed by the lineaments extracted from the processing of Landsat 8 Oli. The mineralization is polymetallic, with copper oxide and sulfide dominating, as well as quartz, amethyst, lead, and barite. Remote sensing techniques combined with field research have showed that high lineament density areas that frequently correlate with areas of hydrothermal alteration are highly related to the occurrences of these mineralizations. These findings indicate that satellite image processing techniques (lineament density and hydrothermal alteration zones) will most likely be used in mining exploration.

TI  - Monitoring of Damages to Cultural Heritage across Europe Using Remote Sensing and Earth Observation: Assessment of Scientific and Grey Literature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This research is part of a wider framework of index literature studies that have been conducted in the past few years. Some of these have had a focus on specific remote sensing (RS) technologies, while others have tackled specific threats to cultural heritage and landscapes. By considering both damages to heritage sites and technologies used for documentation and the monitoring of such occurrences, this paper unveils the current trends on a global scale in the study of the threats to heritage caused by both human-induced and natural hazards. Papers published by Europe-based researchers over the last 20 years using RS and Earth Observation (EO) techniques were surveyed alongside recommendations and programmatic documents issued by institutions in charge of heritage protection and management of several countries in Europe. Around 300 documents, including scientific articles (published from 2000 until 2022) and Grey literature (from 2008 and 2022), were analysed. The data collection and analysis were undertaken by a working group that was intentionally composed to bring together diverse perspectives and expertise, i.e., requirements of heritage professionals using RS and EO technologies, knowledge on technologies and their use in the field, and expertise in methodology implementation to support heritage management. The results highlight the type of hazards considered the most and the geographical distribution of the archaeological sites and monuments targeted by these studies; the countries the researchers are affiliated with; the types of RS and specifically satellite-based technologies used (and hence the type of data used); the tendencies of satellite data usage-visual interpretation, image processing, employment of machine learning, and AI; the technologies most applied by public institutions and practitioners; and many others. Recommendations and future trajectories are then outlined to efficiently reframe discrepancies between types of damage that have received the greatest attention in the literature and the most impactful ones in terms of the number of sites damaged.

TI  - Role of Nuclear Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping Compared to New Alternative Imaging Methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - With the emergence of sentinel node technology, many patients can be staged histopathologically using lymphatic mapping and selective lymphadenectomy. Structural imaging by using US, CT and MR permits precise measurement of lymph node volume, which is strongly associated with neoplastic involvement. Sentinel lymph node detection has been an ideal field of application for nuclear medicine because anatomical data fails to represent the close connections between the lymphatic system and regional lymph nodes, or, more specifically, to identify the first draining lymph node. Hybrid imaging has demonstrated higher accuracy than standard imaging in SLN visualization on images, but it did not change in terms of surgical detection. New alternatives without ionizing radiations are emerging now from "non-radiological" fields, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, where fluorescence or opto-acoustic imaging, for example, are widely used. In this paper, we will analyze the advantages and limits of the main innovative methods in sentinel lymph node detection, including innovations in lymphoscintigraphy techniques that persist as the gold standard to date.

TI  - Effective treatment of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes by dual-targeting melittin nanoparticles
T2  - JOURNAL OF NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis is an important promoter of distant metastasis in breast cancer. Therefore, the timely diagnosis and precise treatment are crucial for patient staging and prognosis. However, the simultaneous diagnosis of metastasis and the implementation of imaging-guided SLN therapy is challenging. Here, we report a melittin-loaded and hyaluronic acid (HA)-conjugated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) mimic phospholipid scaffold nanoparticle (MLT-HA-HPPS), which dually-target to both breast cancer and its SLN and efficiently inhibit SLN metastasis in the LN metastasis model. The melittin peptide was successfully loaded onto HA-HPPS via electrostatic interactions, and MLT-HA-HPPS possesses effective cytotoxicity for breast cancer 4T1 cells. Moreover, the effective delivery of MLT-HA-HPPS from the primary tumor into SLN is monitored by NIR fluorescence imaging, which greatly benefits the prognosis and treatment of metastatic SLNs. After paracancerous administration, MLT-HA-HPPS can efficiently inhibit primary tumor growth with an inhibition rate of 81.3% and 76.5% relative to the PBS-treated control group and HA-HPPS group, respectively. More importantly, MLT-HA-HPPS can effectively inhibit the growth of the metastatic SLNs with an approximately 78.0%, 79.1%, and 64.2% decrease in SLNs weight than those in PBS, HA-HPPS, and melittin-treated mice, respectively. Taken together, the MLT-HA-HPPS may provide an encouraging theranostic of SLN drug delivery strategy to inhibit primary tumor progression and prevent SLN metastasis of breast cancer.

TI  - War and Deforestation: Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning to Identify the War-Induced Deforestation in Syria 2010-2019
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Armed conflicts and other types of violence are key drivers of human-induced landscape change. Since March 2011, Syria has been embroiled in a prolonged and devastating armed conflict causing immense human suffering and extensive destruction. As a result, over five million people have been forced to seek refuge outside the country's borders, while more than six million have been internally displaced. This study focuses on examining the impact of this conflict on forest cover by identifying the drivers of forest change. To assess this change, Landsat and PALSAR imagery were used to differentiate between forested and non-forested areas. Spectral information was synthetized using the Tasseled Cap transformation and the time series data was simplified and despiked using the LandTrendr algorithm. Our results show that between 2010 and 2019 there was a substantial decrease of 19.3% in forest cover, predominantly concentrated in the northwestern region of Syria. This decline was induced by the armed conflict, with several key drivers contributing to the decline, such as illegal logging activities conducted by both locals and refugees living in nearby forest areas. Drivers such as proximity to refugee camps, roads, and settlements played an important role in producing this change by facilitating access to forests. In addition, the occurrence of explosive events such as bombings and shelling near forests also contributed to this decline by causing forest fires. To mitigate further deforestation and reduce dependence on forests for fuel, it is crucial for local governments in the post-conflict period to offer sustainable alternatives for heating and cooking to both the local populations and refugees. Additionally, governments are recommended to enforce strict laws and regulations to protect forests and combat illegal logging activities. These measures are essential for preserving and restoring forests, promoting environmental sustainability, and ensuring the well-being of both displaced populations and local communities.

T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Model-Free Prediction Principle has been successfully applied to general regression problems, as well as problems involving stationary and locally stationary time series. In this paper, we demonstrate how Model-Free Prediction can be applied to handle random fields that are only locally stationary such as pixel values over an image or satellite data observed on an ocean surface, i.e., they can be assumed to be stationary only across a limited part over their entire region of definition. We construct novel one-step-ahead Model-Based and Model-Free point predictors and compare their performance using synthetic data as well as images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. In the latter case, we demonstrate that our best Model-Free point prediction results outperform those obtained using Model-Based prediction.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of vegetation and its relation to different hydroclimatic factors in Bangladesh
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Bangladesh, known for its remarkable ecological diversity, is faced with the pressing challenges of contemporary climate change. It is crucial to understand how vegetation dynamics respond to different climatic factors. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the spatio-temporal variations of vegetation and their interconnectedness with a range of hydroclimatic factors. The majority of the dataset used in this study relies on MODIS satellite imagery. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), precipitation (PPT), evapotranspiration (ET), and land surface temperature (LST) data from the years 2001 to 2020 have been obtained from Google Earth Engine (GEE). In this study, the temporal variations of the NDVI, EVI, PPT, ET, and LST have been investigated. The findings of the Mann-Kendall trend test indicate noticeable trends in both the NDVI and the EVI. Sen's slope value for NDVI and EVI is 0.00424/year and 0.00256/year, respectively. Compared to NDVI, EVI has shown a stronger connection with hydroclimatic factors. In particular, EVI exhibits a better relationship with ET, as indicated by a r2 value of 0.37 and a P-value of 6.81 x 10-26, whereas NDVI exhibits a r2 value of 0.17 and a Pvalue of 2.96 x 10-11. Furthermore, ET can explain 17% of the fluctuation in NDVI, and no correlation between NDVI and PPT has been found. The results clarify the significant relationship between the EVI and hydroclimatic factors and highlight the efficiency of the EVI for detecting vegetation changes.

TI  - Improving the Accuracy of Land Use and Land Cover Classification of Landsat Data in an Agricultural Watershed
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of remotely sensed imagery for reliable land use and land cover (LULC) remains a challenge in areas where spectrally similar LULC features occur. For example, bare soils of harvested crop fields in agricultural watersheds exhibit spectral characteristics similar to high-intensity developed regions and impede an accurate classification. The goal of this study is to improve the accuracy of LULC classification of satellite imagery for the Big Sunflower River Watershed, Mississippi using ancillary data, multiple classification methods, and a post-classification correction (PCC). To determine the best approach, the methodology was applied to Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery during the growing season and post-harvest. Imagery for the growing season was acquired on 25 August 2015, and post-harvest was acquired on 7 January 2018. Three classification methods were applied: maximum likelihood (ML), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). LULC imagery was classified as open water, woody wetlands, harvested crop, rangeland, cultivated crop, high-intensity developed, and mid-low intensity developed areas. Ancillary data such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), thematic maps of urban areas, river networks, transportation networks, high-resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery, Google Earth time-series data, and phenology were used to determine the training dataset. Initially none of the three classification methods performed adequately. Hence, a post-classification correction (PCC) was implemented by masking and applying a majority filter using thematic maps of urban areas. Once PCC was implemented, the accuracies from each of the classification methods increased significantly with the SVM classification method performing best in both the growing season and post-harvest with an overall classification accuracy of 93.5% with a Kappa statistic of 0.88 in the post-harvest imagery and an overall classification accuracy of 84% with a Kappa statistic of 0.789 in the imagery from the growing season. It was found that SVM was the best classification method while PCC is an effective strategy to implement when dealing with spectrally similar LULC features. The use of SVM together with PCC increased the reliability of the information extracted. Strategies from this study can help to evaluate the LULC in agricultural and other watersheds.

AB  - We have calculated surface-leaving spectral radiances for 285 detections of volcanic thermal emission from Io observations made by the Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) in the 0.7- -5.2-mu m wavelength range, the first such analysis of the entire low-spatial-resolution night-time data set. Most of these detections are of 53 individual hot-spots. We establish that 4.8-mu m spectral radiance is a good proxy for total thermal emission from a hot spot. Many detections reported here have not been previously modeled. This set of hot-spot detections is derived from NIMS night-time observations obtained between June 1996 (orbit G1) and October 2001 (Orbit I32), where the hot-spot is sub-pixel. Modeling of the spectra yields total thermal emission from each volcano in each observation, as well as the 2:5-mu m spectral radiance ratio and radiant flux density. Surface-leaving spectral radiance is derived at 2.0, 3.5, 3.8, 4.8, and 5.0 mu m allowing direct comparison with data obtained by other spacecraft and ground-based telescope data. The most energetic volcanic eruptions are identified. We find an unusual number of sources in a C30 observation suggesting that a vigorous volcanic activity was taking place simultaneously in multiple locations, possibly tidally controlled.

TI  - Time-series analyses of land surface temperature changes with Google Earth Engine in a mountainous region
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying changes in temperature is fundamental for understanding its interactions with the environment and biodiversity. However, studies in mountainous areas are few, due to their complex formation and the difficulty of obtaining local data. We analysed changes in temperature over time in Montesinho Natural Park (MNP) (Braganca, Portugal), an important conservation area due to its high level of biodiversity. Specifically, we aimed to analyse: i) whether temper-ature increased in MNP over time, ii) what environmental factors influence the Land Surface Temperature (LST), and iii) whether vegetation is related to changes in temperature. We used annual summer and winter mean data acquired from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spec-troradiometer (MODIS) datasets/products (e.g. LST, gathered at four different times: 11am, 1pm, 10pm and 2am, Enhance vegetation index -EVI, and Evapotranspiration -ET), available on the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine between 2003 and 2021). We analysed the dynamics of the temporal trend patterns between the LST and local thermal data (from a weather station) by correlations; the trends in LST over time with the Mann-Kendall trend test; and the stability of hot spots and cold spots of LST with Local Statistics of Spatial Association (LISA) tests. The temporal trend patterns between LST and Air Temperature (Tair) data were very similar (& rho; > 0.7). The temperature in the MNP remained stable over time during summer but increased during winter nights. The biophysical indices were strongly correlated with the summer LST at 11am and 1pm. The LISA results identified hot and cold zones that remained stable over time. The remote-sensed data proved to be efficient in measuring changes in temperature over time.

TI  - Response of semi-arid vegetation to agricultural drought determined by indices derived from MODIS satellite
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Indices based on data from remote sensors play an important role in the characterization, mapping and monitoring of a drought event. Thus, the objective of this study was to monitor the dynamics of agricultural drought, through the response of vegetation, in the semi-arid region that comprises the state of Paraiba, Brazil, through MODIS satellite products applied to the VCI (vegetation condition index), TCI (temperature condition index) and VHI (vegetation health index) indices, and to evaluate the correspondence of VHI index with standardized precipitation index (SPI) and agricultural standardized precipitation index (aSPI). In this study, values of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and LST (land surface temperature)-covering the period between 2010 and 2020-were used to estimate VCI, TCI and VHI. In addition, the correspondence of VHI with SPI and aSPI was evaluated at the 12-month time scale, conducted using Pearson's correlation analysis. Characteristics of a stressed vegetation predominated in the study region, due to irregularity of precipitation and high temperatures, confirming the possibility of detection of droughts through VHI, VCI and TCI, and that the indices detected remotely and through local data are strongly correlated in drought detection.

TI  - Axillary Management in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Upfront Surgery: Results from a Nationwide Survey on Behalf of the Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Group (COBCG) and the Breast Cancer Study Group of the Italian Association of Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology (AIRO)
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We assessed the current practice concerning the axillary management of breast cancer (BC) patients undergoing upfront surgery among radiation oncologists (ROs) practising in Italy. Methods: An online survey via SurveyMonkey (including 21 questions) was distributed amongst ROs in Italy through personal contacts and the Italian Association for Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology (AIRO) network from August to September 2022. We particularly focused on the emerging omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in the presence of 1-2 sentinel node-positive patients and the consequent change in the role of regional nodal irradiation (RNI). Results: A total of 101/195 (51% response rate) Italian Radiotherapy Cancer Care Centres answered the survey. With respect to patients with 1-2 sentinel node-positive, the relative proportion of respondents that offer patients ALND a) always, b) only in selected cases, and c) never was 37.6%, 60.4%, and 2.0%, respectively, with no significant geographical (North vs. Centre-South Italy; p = 0.92) or institutional (Academic vs. non-Academic; p = 0.49) differences. Radiation therapy indications varied widely in patients who did not undergo ALND. Among these, about a third of the respondents (17/56, 30.4%) stated that RNI was constantly performed. On the other hand, half of the respondents offered RNI in selected cases, stating that an unfavourable biologic tumour profile and extracapsular nodal extension were considered drivers of their decision. Conclusions: Results of the present survey show the variability of axillary management offered in clinical practice for BC patients undergoing conserving surgery upfront in Italy. Analysis of these attitudes may trigger the modification of some clinical approaches through multidisciplinary collaboration and create the background for future clinical investigations.

TI  - Assessing Groundwater Potential in a Mid-Mountain Dryland Area of North-Central Chile through Geospatial Mapping
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study utilized the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to assess groundwater potential (GWP) in the mid-mountain region of the Coquimbo region, north-central Chile. A comprehensive evaluation of twenty-one factors, primarily derived from Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and satellite data, was conducted against a database of 3822 groundwater discharge points. The majority of them consisted of shallow wells with relatively low yields. The main objective was to develop a groundwater potential (GWP) map for the study area. Among the factors considered, six variables, including two anthropogenic factors (distance to roads and presence of agricultural communities) and four natural factors (slope, elevation, concavity, and ruggedness index), were identified as the most influential indicators of GWP. The RF approach demonstrated excellent performance, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.95, sensitivity of 0.88, specificity of 0.86, and kappa coefficient of 0.74 in the test set. The majority of the study area exhibited low GWP, while only 14% of the area demonstrated high or very high GWP. In addition to providing valuable guidance for future hydrogeological investigations in the region, the GWP map serves as a valuable tool for identifying the areas that are most vulnerable to water shortages. This is particularly significant, as the region has been severely affected by extended drought, making water supply a critical concern.

TI  - Analysis of Seasonal Driving Factors and Inversion Model Optimization of Soil Moisture in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau Based on Machine Learning
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of soil moisture retrieval based on traditional microwave remote sensing models in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (QTP) is unstable due to its unique plateau climate. However, considering the impact of multiple multi-scale factors effectively improves the accuracy and stability of soil moisture inversion. This article uses Sentinel-1 and seasonal climate data to analyze factors and influencing mechanisms of soil moisture in the QTP. First, an artificial neural network (ANN) was used to conduct a significance analysis to screen significant influencing factors to reduce the redundancy of the experimental design and insert information. Second, the normalization effect of each factor on the soil moisture inversion was determined, and the factors with significant normalization influences were input to fit the model. Third, different fitting methods combined the semi-empirical models for soil moisture inversion. The decision tree Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) analyzed the model accuracy, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between the sample and measured data was tested to further validate the accuracy of the results to obtain an optimized model that effectively inverts soil moisture. Finally, the influencing mechanisms of various factors in the optimization model were analyzed. The results show that: (1) The terrain factors, such as elevation, slope gradient, aspect, and angle, along with climate factors, such as temperature and precipitation, all have the greatest normalized impact on soil moisture in the QTP. (2) For spring (March), summer (June), and autumn (September), the greatest normalized factor of soil moisture is the terrain factor. In winter (December), precipitation was the greatest factor due to heavy snow cover and permafrost. (3) Analyzing the impact mechanism from various factors on the soil moisture showed a restricted relationship between the inversion results and the accuracy of the power fitting model, meaning it is unsuitable for general soil moisture inversion. However, among the selected models, the accuracy of the linear fit was generally higher than 79.2%, the Pearson index was greater than 0.4, and the restricted relationship between the inversion results and accuracy was weak, making it suitable for the general inversion of soil moisture in the QTP.

TI  - Decadal Stability and Trends in the Global Cloud Amount and Cloud Top Temperature in the Satellite-Based Climate Data Records
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forty years of cloud observations are available globally from satellites, allowing derivation of climate data records (CDRs) for climate change studies. The aim of this study is to investigate how stable these cloud CDRs are and whether they qualify stability requirements recommended by the WMO's Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). We also investigate robust trends in global total cloud amount (CA) and cloud top temperature (CTT) that are significant and common across all CDRs. The latest versions of four global cloud CDRs, namely CLARA-A3, ESA Cloud CCI, PATMOS-x, and ISCCP-HGM are analysed. This assessment finds that all three AVHRR-based cloud CDRs (i.e., CLARA-A3, ESA Cloud CCI and PATMOS-x) satisfy even the strictest GCOS stability requirements for CA and CTT when averaged globally. While CLARA-A3 is most stable in global averages when tested against MODIS-Aqua, PATMOS-x offers the most stable CDR spatially. While we find these results highly encouraging, there remain, however, large spatial differences in the stability of and across the CDRs. All four CDRs continue to agree on the statistically significant decrease in global cloud amount over the last four decades, although this decrease is now weaker compared to the previous assessments. This decreasing trend has been stabilizing or even reversing in the last two decades; the latter is seen also in MODIS-Aqua and CALIPSO GEWEX datasets. Statistically significant trends in CTT are observed in global averages in the AVHRR-based CDRs, but the spatial agreement in the sign and the magnitude of the trends is weaker compared to those in CA. We also present maps of Common Stability Coverage and Common Trend Coverage that could provide a valuable metric to carry out an ensemble-based analysis of the CDRs.

TI  - Detection of Forest Fires through Deep Unsupervised Learning Modeling of Sentinel-1 Time Series
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With an increase in the amount of natural disasters, the combined use of cloud-penetrating Synthetic Aperture Radar and deep learning becomes unavoidable for their monitoring. This article proposes a methodology for forest fire detection using unsupervised location-expert autoencoders and Sentinel-1 SAR time series. The models are trained on SAR multitemporal images over a specific area using a reference period and extract any deviating time series over that same area for the test period. We present three variations of the autoencoder, incorporating either temporal features or spatiotemporal features, and we compare it against a state-of-the-art supervised autoencoder. Despite their limitations, we show that unsupervised approaches are on par with supervised techniques, performance-wise. A specific architecture, the fully temporal autoencoder, stands out as the best-performing unsupervised approach by leveraging temporal information of Sentinel-1 time series using one-dimensional convolutional layers. The approach is generic and can be applied to many applications, though we focus here on forest fire detection in Canadian boreal forests as a successful use case.

TI  - Shoreline Delineation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Imagery for High and Low Tidal States in Data-Deficient Niger Delta Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite image analysis is a potentially powerful tool for monitoring coastal shoreline positions. This study explores the use of multi-temporal, dual-polarised Sentinel-1 GRD synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery with a spatial resolution of 10 m for delineating shorelines. It was conducted in a data-deficient and complex environment (the Niger delta of Nigeria), in a developing country with a cloud-heavy climate. The study focuses on exploring and testing the capability of using multitemporal waterlines from SAR images to derive shoreline positions at high and low tidal states. From 54 Sentinel-1 images recorded in 2017, the study selected 12 images to represent both high and low tidal states. These were spread across the wet and dry seasons in order to account for seasonal differences. Shoreline positions were obtained by identifying the land-water boundary via segmentation using histogram-minimum thresholding, vectorizing and smoothing that boundary, and averaging its position over multiple waterlines. The land-water segmentation had an overall accuracy of 95-99%. It showed differences between wet and dry season shoreline positions in areas dominated by complex creek networks, but similarities along open coasts. The SAR-derived shorelines deviated from the reference lines by a maximum of 43 m (approximately four pixels), and often less than 10 m (one pixel) in most locations (open coast, estuarine, complex creek networks) at high and low tides, except low tide lines in areas with extensive inter-tidal flats at shorelines 70 m to 370 m from the reference lines. However, for applications such as coastal vulnerability assessment, the high tide shoreline is of greater importance. Thus, depending on the application of interest, problems with low tide shoreline delineation may be irrelevant. Despite limitations, notably the relatively small number of images available that were recorded at high or low tide, the method provides a simple, objective, and cost-effective approach to monitoring shorelines at high and low tide.

TI  - Monitoring early-season agricultural drought using temporal Sentinel-1 SAR-based combined drought index
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Early-season agricultural drought is frequent over South Asian region due to delayed or deficient monsoon rainfall. These drought events often cause delay in sowing and can even result in crop failure. The present study focuses on monitoring early-season agricultural drought in a semi-arid region of India over 5-year period (2016-2020). It utilizes hydro-climatic and biophysical variables to develop a combined drought index (CDI), which integrates anomalies in soil moisture conditions, rainfall, and crop-sown area progression. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based soil moisture index (SMI) represents in situ measured soil moisture with reasonable accuracy (r=0.68). Based on the highest F1-score, SAR backscatter in VH (vertical transmit-horizontal receive) polarization with specific values for parameter threshold (-18.63 dB) and slope threshold (-0.072) is selected to determine the start of season (SoS) with a validation accuracy of 73.53%. The CDI approach is used to monitor early-season agricultural drought and identified drought conditions during June-July in 2019 and during July in 2018. Conversely, 2020 experienced consistently wet conditions, while 2016 and 2017 had near-normal conditions. Overall, the study highlights the use of SAR data for early-season agricultural drought monitoring, which is mainly governed by soil moisture-driven crop-sowing progression. The proposed methodology holds potential for effective monitoring, management, and decision-making in early-season agricultural drought scenarios.

TI  - Lithium-Rich Pegmatite Detection Integrating High-Resolution and Hyperspectral Satellite Data in Zhawulong Area, Western Sichuan, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lithium (Li) has grown to be a strategic key metal due to the enormous demand for the development of new energy industries over the world. As one of the most significant sources of Li resources, pegmatite-type Li deposits hold a large share of the mining market. In recent years, several large and super-large spodumene (Spd)-rich pegmatite deposits have been discovered successively in the Hoh-Xil-Songpan-Garze (HXSG) orogenic belt of the northern Tibetan Plateau, indicative of the great Li prospecting potential of this belt. Hyperspectral remote sensing (HRS), as a rapidly developing exploration technology, is especially sensitive to the identification of alteration minerals, and has made important breakthroughs in porphyry copper deposit exploration. However, due to the small width of the pegmatite dykes and the lack of typical alteration zones, the ability of HRS in the exploration of Li-rich pegmatite deposits remains to be explored. In this study, Li-rich pegmatite anomalies were directly extracted from ZY1-02D hyperspectral imagery in the Zhawulong (ZWL) area of western Sichuan, China, using target detection techniques including Adaptive Cosine Estimator (ACE), Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), and SAM with BandMax (SAMBM). Further, the Li-rich anomalies were superimposed with the distribution of pegmatite dykes delineated based on GF-2 high-resolution imagery. Our final results accurately identified the known range of Spd pegmatite dykes and further predicted two new exploration target areas. The approaches used in this study could be easily extended to other potential mineralization areas to discover new rare metal pegmatite deposits on the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Mineral Element Identification in Remote Sensing Imagery: A Fusion Approach Using CH-Tucker Decomposition and RFDNet
T2  - TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the realm of geological and mineral exploration, remote sensing technology has emerged as a pivotal high-tech instrument. However, the effective interpretation of remote sensing images, especially in the context of heterogeneous data processing, noise, and the identification of fine granularity, remains a challenge. In this study, a novel method for the identification of mineral elements within remote sensing imagery was introduced. Firstly, a heterogeneous feature tensor migration technique anchored on the Coupled Heterogeneous Tucker Decomposition (CH-Tucker decomposition) was presented. Through this technique, multi-source remote sensing data were effectively processed and fused. Notably, associated data features from varying resolutions and angles were seamlessly coupled. Subsequently, an optical remote sensing image processing model founded on the RFDNet network was established. This model demonstrated robustness against noise data, thereby enabling the identification of mineral elements with a higher degree of granularity. The proposed methodology exhibited the capacity to extract mineral element information comprehensively and with remarkable accuracy. Thus, this research offers both valuable theoretical insights and practical evidence for furtherance in geological research and mineral element exploration.

TI  - A Global Systematic Review of Improving Crop Model Estimations by Assimilating Remote Sensing Data: Implications for Small-Scale Agricultural Systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - There is a growing effort to use access to remote sensing data (RS) in conjunction with crop model simulation capability to improve the accuracy of crop growth and yield estimates. This is critical for sustainable agricultural management and food security, especially in farming communities with limited resources and data. Therefore, the objective of this study was to provide a systematic review of research on data assimilation and summarize how its application varies by country, crop, and farming systems. In addition, we highlight the implications of using process-based crop models (PBCMs) and data assimilation in small-scale farming systems. Using a strict search term, we searched the Scopus and Web of Science databases and found 497 potential publications. After screening for relevance using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 123 publications were included in the final review. Our results show increasing global interest in RS data assimilation approaches; however, 81% of the studies were from countries with relatively high levels of agricultural production, technology, and innovation. There is increasing development of crop models, availability of RS data sources, and characterization of crop parameters assimilated into PBCMs. Most studies used recalibration or updating methods to mainly incorporate remotely sensed leaf area index from MODIS or Landsat into the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) model to improve yield estimates for staple crops in large-scale and irrigated farming systems. However, these methods cannot compensate for the uncertainties in RS data and crop models. We concluded that further research on data assimilation using newly available high-resolution RS datasets, such as Sentinel-2, should be conducted to significantly improve simulations of rare crops and small-scale rainfed farming systems. This is critical for informing local crop management decisions to improve policy and food security assessments.

AB  - The accurate evaluation of crop damage by wild animals is crucial for farmers when seeking compensation from insurance companies or other institutions. One of the game species that frequently cause crop damage in Europe is the wild boar, which often feeds on maize. Other game species, such as roe deer and red deer, can also cause significant crop damage. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of crop damage evaluation based on remote sensing data derived from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially a digital surface model (DSM) based on RGB imagery and NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) derived from multispectral imagery, at two growth stages of maize. During the first growth stage, when plants are in the intensive growth phase and green, crop damage evaluation was conducted using both DSM and NDVI. Each variable was separately utilized, and both variables were included in the classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, wherein crop damage was categorized as a binomial variable (with or without crop damage). In the second growth stage, which was before harvest when the plants had dried, only DSM was employed for crop damage evaluation. The results for both growth stages demonstrated high accuracy in detecting areas with crop damage, but this was primarily observed for areas larger than several square meters. The accuracy of crop damage evaluation was significantly lower for smaller or very narrow areas, such as the width of a single maize row. DSM proved to be more useful than NDVI in detecting crop damage as it can be applied at any stage of maize growth.

TI  - Melanoma: A Historical Walk-through from Palliative Treatment to Modern-day Practice
T2  - ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma is one of the most common types of malignancy in the world, and one known to carry a very poor prognosis until recent years. This review aims to outline the events in the history of the disease and the impact made by the discoveries along the way, as well as the modern-day consensus by referencing the updated literature regarding the present approach and future directions. In the last two decades, several studies and research have brought significant improvement in the diagnosis and clinical management of melanomas. The development of sentinel lymph node biopsy has brought major changes to the surgical approach to the disease, and modern therapies based on recently developed knowledge changed the death sentence this diagnosis once meant to a manageable condition despite its aggressiveness, keeping in mind that early diagnosis and safe margin excision remain the best and most optimistic course of treatment.

M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past two decades, advances in remote sensing methods and technology have enabled larger and more sophisticated datasets to be collected. Due to these advances, the need to effectively and efficiently communicate and visualize data is becoming increasingly important. We demonstrate that the use of mixed- (MR) and virtual reality (VR) systems has provided very promising results, allowing the visualization of complex datasets with unprecedented levels of detail and user experience. However, as of today, such visualization techniques have been largely used for communication purposes, and limited applications have been developed to allow for data processing and collection, particularly within the engineering-geology field. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential use of MR and VR not only for the visualization of multi-sensor remote sensing data but also for the collection and analysis of geological data. In this paper, we present a conceptual workflow showing the approach used for the processing of remote sensing datasets and the subsequent visualization using MR and VR headsets. We demonstrate the use of computer applications built in-house to visualize datasets and numerical modelling results, and to perform rock core logging (XRCoreShack) and rock mass characterization (EasyMineXR). While important limitations still exist in terms of hardware capabilities, portability, and accessibility, the expected technological advances and cost reduction will ensure this technology forms a standard mapping and data analysis tool for future engineers and geoscientists.

TI  - Radiometric Cross-Calibration of Wide-Field-of-View Cameras Based on Gaofen-1/6 Satellite Synergistic Observations Using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager Images: A Solution for Off-Nadir Wide-Field-of-View Associated Problems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gaofen-1 satellite is equipped with four wide-field-of-view (WFV) instruments, enabling an impressive spatial resolution of 16 m and a combined swath exceeding 800 km. These WFV images have shown their valuable applications across diverse fields. However, achieving accurate radiometric calibration is an essential prerequisite for establishing reliable connections between satellite signals and biophysical, as well as biochemical, parameters. However, observations with large viewing angles (>20 & DEG;) pose new challenges due to the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effect having a pronounced impact on the accuracy of cross-radiation calibrations, especially for the off-nadir WFV1 and WFV4 cameras. To overcome this challenge, a novel approach was introduced utilizing the combined observations from the Gaofen-1 and Gaofen-6 satellites, with Landsat-8 OLI serving as a reference sensor. The key advantage of this synergistic observation strategy is the ability to obtain a greater number of image pairs that closely resemble Landsat-8 OLI reference images in terms of geometry and observation dates. This increased availability of matching images ensures a more representative dataset of the observation geometry, enabling the derived calibration coefficients to be applicable across various sun-target-sensor geometries. Then, the geometry angles and bidirectional reflectance information were put into a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm incorporating radiative transfer modeling. This PSO-based approach formulates cross-calibration as an optimization problem, eliminating the reliance on complex BRDF models and satellite-based BRDF products that can be affected by cloud contamination. Extensive validation experiments involving satellite data and in situ measurements demonstrated an average uncertainty of less than eight percent for the proposed cross-radiation calibration scheme. Comparisons of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) results calibrated using our proposed scheme, the previous traditional radiative transfer modeling using MODIS BRDF products for BRDF correction (RTM-BRDF) method, and official coefficients reveal the superior accuracy of our method. The proposed scheme achieves a 36.99% decrease in root mean square error (RMSE) and a 38.13% increase in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to official coefficients. Moreover, it achieves comparable accuracy to the RTM-BRDF method while eliminating the need for MODIS BRDF products, with a decrease in RMSE exceeding 14% for the off-nadir WFV1 and WFV4 cameras. The results substantiate the efficacy of the proposed scheme in enhancing cross-calibration accuracy by improving image match-up selection, efficiently removing BRDF effects, and expanding applicability to diverse observation geometries.

TI  - Novel Threshold Self-Regulating Water Extraction Method
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources are crucial for human activities and sustainable socioeconomic development. Understanding surface water information can play a key role in water resource management, which affects the global water cycle and ecological environments. Considering the Hailar River water body as an example, this study proposes a new threshold self-learning water body extraction method (TSLWEM) based on modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) data. The optimal water extraction thresholds determined by the TSLWEM algorithm for four test images were -0.0030, 0, 0.1990, and -0.0800. The TSLWEM algorithm effectively identified the target water body with recognition accuracies of 98.08%, 99.93%, 93.39%, and 93.20% for the four test images. Moreover, it can accurately identify small tributaries, such as lakes and rivers. The TSLWEM algorithm is suitable for Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data, which can effectively monitor and map complex surface water in temperate and semiarid regions while improving the accuracy of water body identification. The study's findings provide technical support for the protection of water resources as well as their rational utilization and monitoring.

TI  - What Should Be Learned from the Dynamic Evolution of Cropping Patterns in the Black Soil Region of Northeast China? A Case Study of Wangkui County, Heilongjiang Province
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional and scientific cropping patterns are important in realizing the sustainable utilization of Black soil and promoting the high-quality development of agriculture. It also has far-reaching significance for protecting Black soil and constructing the crop rotation system to identify the cropping patterns in Northeast China and analyze their spatio-temporal dynamic change. Using the geo-information Tupu methods and transfer land matrix, this study identified the cropping patterns and their spatio-temporal change based on remote sensing data for three periods, namely 2002-2005, 2010-2013, and 2018-2021. The main results revealed that the maize continuous, mixed cropping, maize-soybean rotation, and soybean continuous cropping patterns were the main cropping patterns in Wangkui County, with the total area of the four patterns accounting for 95.28%, 94.66%, and 81.69%, respectively, in the three periods. Against the backdrop of global climate warming, the cropping patterns of continuous maize and soybean and the mixed cropping pattern in Wangkui County exhibited a trend towards evolving into a maize-soybean rotation in the northern region. Moreover, the maize-soybean rotation further evolved into a mixed cropping system of maize and soybean in the north. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal evolution of cropping patterns was significantly driven by natural and social factors. Specifically, natural factors influenced the spatio-temporal patterns of variation in cropping patterns, while social factors contributed to the transformation of farmers' cropping decision-making behavior. Accordingly, new insights, institutional policies, and solid solutions, such as exploring and understanding farmers' behavior regarding crop rotation practices and mitigating the natural and climatic factors for improving food security, are urgent in the black soil region of China.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of the Impact of Two Common Residue Burning Parameters on Urban Air Quality Indicators
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residue burning produces a lot of polluting gases and fine particles, endangering human health, damaging soil structure, and causing fire accidents. In addition to the impact of residue burning on the local environment, pollutants can spread with the wind to more distant areas and impact their air quality. Nevertheless, a comparative analysis of the impact of two common residue burning parameters, the number of residue fire points, and residue burned area on urban air quality indicators has not been reported. In this study, the correlation between these two different residue burning parameters on air quality in Daqing City (Western Heilongjiang Province, China) was investigated comparatively using the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) fire point product, the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burned area product, and buffer zone analysis. The association between MODIS burned area products and air quality index (AQI) was found to be around 0.8. Meanwhile, it was found that the correlation between the number of residue fire points extracted from the VIIRS active fire products and air quality was above 0.6, again with a maximum of 0.75 at a buffer radius of 50 km. Within other levels of buffer zones, the correlation between residue burned area and AQI was consistently higher than that between residue fire points and AQI. By comparing the correlation between VIIRS fire points, MODIS burned area, and the concentration of each AQI pollutant, it can be found that the correlation between the concentration of each AQI pollutant and the residue burned area was higher than that and the fire points number. MODIS burned area monitoring, on the other hand, detects changes in the time series of images taken by satellite at two transit moments to obtain a new burned area and cumulative burned area during this period, allowing the monitoring of fire traces caused by fire points at non-transit moments. From analyzing the correlation between residue fire points, residue burned area, and the concentration of each pollutant (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, and O-3), we found significant correlations between residue burning and PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2 concentrations, with the highest correlation (R-2) of 0.81 for PM2.5. Moreover, the correlation between residue burned area and PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2 concentrations was significantly higher than that between the number of residue fire points and their concentrations.

TI  - Expulsion of Counter Evershed Flows from Sunspot Penumbrae
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In addition to the Evershed flow directed from the umbra toward the outer boundary of a sunspot, under special circumstances a counter Evershed flow (CEF) in the opposite direction also occurs. We aim to characterize the proper motions and evolution of three CEFs observed by the Solar Optical Telescope on board the Japanese Hinode spacecraft and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We use state-of-the-art inversions of the radiative-transfer equation of polarized light applied to spectropolarimetric observations of the Fe i line pair around 630 nm. The three CEFs appeared within the penumbra. Two of the CEF structures, as part of their decay process, were found to move radially outwards through the penumbra parallel to the penumbral filaments with speeds, deduced from their proper motions, ranging between 65 and 117 m s(-1). In these two cases, a new spot appeared in the moat of the main sunspot after the CEFs reached the outer part of the penumbra. Meanwhile, the CEFs moved away from the umbra, and their magnetic field strengths decreased. The expulsion of these two CEFs seems to be related to the normal Evershed flow. The third CEF appeared to be dragged by the rotation of a satellite spot. Chromospheric brightenings were found to be associated with the CEFs, and those CEFs that reached the umbra-penumbra boundary showed enhanced chromospheric activity. The two CEFs, for which line-of-sight velocity maps were available during their formation phase, appear as intrusions into the penumbra. They may be associated with magnetic flux emergence.

TI  - Landfill Site Selection Using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, Remote Sensing Data, and Geographic Information System Tools in Najran City, Saudi Arabia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many practical issues arise when dealing with solid waste management, and there are also environmental effects to be considered. Selecting landfill sites requires extra care with respect to many factors such as the environment, health hazards for people, and the cost of transportation. Furthermore, cities have their own rules, methods, and practices for managing and selecting the best locations for collecting solid waste. In this research, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was presented and used to evaluate the appropriateness of and suggest the best locations for landfill sites in Najran, KSA. Some remote sensing data and the ArcGIS software were used to prepare nine thematic layers, including drainage density, groundwater depth, land use, soil type, road network, surface elevation, surface slope, distance from residential areas, and distance from protected areas. To evaluate the layer weightings, a questionnaire with pairwise comparisons was distributed among experts and analyzed using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy set technique. The one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) sensitivity test was conducted to test the sensitivity of the evaluated weightings. A landfill suitability index (LSI) map was created using raster calculator tools and divided into five classes: limited suitability (LSI value 1.39-2.49), least suitable (2.50-3.03), relatively suitable (3.04-3.48), suitable (3.49-3.91), and most suitable (3.92-4.66). According to the statistical analysis, 18.0% and 18.2% of the total area were within the most suitable and suitable landfill regions, while 21.2%, 14.9%, and 9.5% accounted for relatively suitable, least suitable, and limited suitability areas, respectively. The employed technique and its findings can provide an appropriate guideline to assist the municipality of Najran city, regional planners, and decision-makers in selecting an optimal landfill site in the future. This study also presented some recommendations to enhance the suitability map of landfill sites in Najran city.

TI  - Optimization of Machining Parameters to Minimize Cutting Forces and Surface Roughness in Micro-Milling of Mg13Sn Alloy
T2  - MICROMACHINES
M3  - Article
AB  - This comprehensive study investigates the micro-milling of a Mg13Sn alloy, a material of considerable interest in various high-precision applications, such as biomedical implants. The main objective of the study was to explore the optimizations of variable feed per tooth (fz), cutting speed (Vc), and depth of cut (ap) parameters on the key outcomes of the micro-milling process. A unique experimental setup was employed, employing a spindle capable of achieving up to 60,000 revolutions per minute. Additionally, the study leveraged linear slides backed by micro-step motors to facilitate precise axis movements, thereby maintaining a resolution accuracy of 0.1 mu m. Cutting forces were accurately captured by a mini dynamometer and subsequently evaluated based on the peak to valley values for Fx (tangential force) and Fy (feed force). The study results revealed a clear and complex interplay between the varied cutting parameters and their subsequent impacts on the cutting forces and surface roughness. An increase in feed rate and depth of cut significantly increased the cutting forces. However, the cutting forces were found to decrease noticeably with the elevation of cutting speed. Intriguingly, the tangential force (Fx) was consistently higher than the feed force (Fy). Simultaneously, the study determined that the surface roughness, denoted by Sa values, increased in direct proportion to the feed rate. It was also found that the Sa surface roughness values decreased with the increase in cutting speed. This study recommends a parameter combination of fz = 5 mu m/tooth feed rate, Vc = 62.8 m/min cutting speed, and ap = 400 mu m depth of cut to maintain a Sa surface roughness value of less than 1 mu m while ensuring an optimal material removal rate and machining time. The results derived from this study offer vital insights into the micro-milling of Mg13Sn alloys and contribute to the current body of knowledge on the topic.

TI  - Comparative predictive power of serum vs plasma proteomic signatures in feto-maternal medicine.
T2  - AJOG global reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood proteins are frequently measured in serum or plasma, because they provide a wealth of information. Differences in the ex vivo processing of serum and plasma raise concerns that proteomic health and disease signatures derived from serum or plasma differ in content and quality. However, little is known about their respective power to predict feto-maternal health outcomes. Predictive power is a sentinel characteristic to determine the clinical use of biosignatures.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the power of serum and plasma proteomic signatures to predict a physiological pregnancy outcome.STUDY DESIGN: Paired serum and plasma samples from 73 women were obtained from biorepositories of a multinational prospective cohort study on pregnancy outcomes. Gestational age at the time of sampling was the predicted outcome, because the proteomic signatures have been validated for such a prediction. Multivariate and cross-validated models were independently derived for serum and plasma proteins.RESULTS: A total of 1116 proteins were measured in 88 paired samples from 73 women with a highly multiplexed platform using proximity extension technology (Olink Proteomics Inc, Watertown, MA). The plasma proteomic signature showed a higher predictive power (R=0.64; confidence interval, 0.42-0.79; P=3.5*10-6) than the serum signature (R=0.45; confidence interval, 0.18-0.66; P=2.2*10-3). The serum signature was validated in plasma with a similar predictive power (R=0.58; confidence interval, 0.34-0.75; P=4.8*10-5), whereas the plasma signature was validated in serum with reduced predictive power (R=0.53; confidence interval, 0.27-0.72; P=2.6*10-4). Signature proteins largely overlapped in the serum and plasma, but the strength of association with gestational age was weaker for serum proteins.CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that serum proteomics are less informative than plasma proteomics. They are compatible with the view that the partial ex-vivo degradation and modification of serum proteins during sample processing are an underlying reason. The rationale for collecting and analyzing serum and plasma samples should be carefully considered when deriving proteomic biosignatures to ascertain that specimens of the highest scientific and clinical yield are processed. Findings suggest that plasma is the preferred matrix.

TI  - Urban theories and urbanization perspectives in cities across Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the emerging research trends from urbanization is the study of urban growth patterns. These growth patterns are primarily based on the growth of the local economy that directly affects agricultural lands. In Africa, the local economy has spurred the extinction of many agrarian sectors. Yet, few studies at the regional level have paid attention to these changes. Using diverse scientific literature on global urbanization, urban remote sensing, and economic geography, this study aimed to understand the theory behind urban developments in Nigeria. The primary data were collected in two study regions in the country's eastern and southern parts, making it a large dataset to assess urban formation in these areas. We examined the evolution of urban development from the perspectives of infrastructural development, expansion, change in land use, and urban job migration opportunities that affect agrarian activities. White-collar job opportunities are limited in urban areas, substantially increasing the startup of small-scale businesses. We introduce the notion of natural resource urbanism, which implies urbanization that is triggered by the influx of natural resource revenue to strengthen the dwindling local economy. The infusion of a shared natural resource revenue creates a reform in the local economy and the advent of a consumption-based economy. A shared natural resource revenue drives massive infrastructural developments, but the dependence on the availability of those natural resources in the states raises concerns about its long-term sustainability for strengthening the local economy.

TI  - Converging Channel Attention Mechanisms with Multilayer Perceptron Parallel Networks for Land Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a network structure called CAMP-Net, which considers the problem that traditional deep learning algorithms are unable to manage the pixel information of different bands, resulting in poor differentiation of feature representations of different categories and causing classification overfitting. CAMP-Net is a parallel network that, firstly, enhances the interaction of local information of bands by grouping the spectral nesting of the band information and then proposes a parallel processing model. One branch is responsible for inputting the features, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) band information generated by grouped nesting into the ViT framework, and enhancing the interaction and information flow between different channels in the feature map by adding the channel attention mechanism to realize the expressive capability of the feature map. The other branch assists the network's ability to enhance the extraction of different feature channels by designing a multi-layer perceptron network based on the utilization of the feature channels. Finally, the classification results are obtained by fusing the features obtained by the channel attention mechanism with those obtained by the MLP to achieve pixel-level multispectral image classification. In this study, the application of the algorithm was carried out in the feature distribution of South County, Yiyang City, Hunan Province, and the experiments were conducted based on 10 m Sentinel-2 multispectral RS images. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy of the algorithm proposed in this paper is 99.00% and the transformer (ViT) is 95.81%, while the performance of the algorithm in the Sentinel-2 dataset was greatly improved for the transformer. The transformer shows a huge improvement, which provides research value for developing a land cover classification algorithm for remote sensing images.

TI  - Synergistic Use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Based on Different Preprocessing for Predicting Forest Aboveground Biomass
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest aboveground biomass (AGB, Mg/ha) measurement is one of the key indicators for carbon storage evaluation. Remote sensing techniques have been widely employed to predict forest AGB. However, little attention has been paid to the implications involved in the preprocessing of satellite data. In this work, considering the areas of low forest AGB in our survey plots, we explored the implications of employing atmospheric correction and speckle filtering with Sentinel-1 (S1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (S2) to predict forest AGB using multiple linear regression (MLR) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). In the present study, the types of plots examined included oaks (Quercus spp.), Chinese firs (Cunninghamia lanceolata), and Masson pines (Pinus massoniana), and all of the plots were investigated. Specifically, the feature variables related to S1 (dual polarization and texture measures) and S2 (spectral bands) were modeled individually, and 16 feature sets, including different combinations of S1 and S2 based on different preprocessing measures, were established using MLR and XGBoost. The results show that speckle filtering and atmospheric correction marginally influenced the capacity of the S2 spectral bands, the SAR dual-polarization backscatter, and the SAR-based textural measures in predicting the AGB in our survey plots. The associations between the speckle-filtered and unfiltered SAR images and the S2 Top-of-Atmosphere and Bottom-of-Atmosphere products were considerably strong. Additionally, the texture models generally showed better performances than the raw SAR data. Ultimately, the groups that only encompassed the S2 spectral bands were the best-performing groups among the 16 feature sets, while the groups that included only S1-based data generally performed the worst.

TI  - Assessment of Forest Ecological Function Levels Based on Multi-Source Data and Machine Learning
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecological function is one of the key indicators reflecting the quality of forest resources. The traditional weighting method to assess forest ecological function is based on a large amount of ground survey data; it is accurate but costly and time-consuming. This study utilized three machine learning algorithms to estimate forest ecological function levels based on multi-source data, including Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing images and digital elevation model (DEM) and forest resource planning and design survey data. The experimental results showed that Random Forest (RF) was the optimal model, with overall accuracy of 0.82, recall of 0.66, and F1 of 0.62, followed by CatBoost (overall accuracy = 0.82, recall = 0.62, F1 = 0.58) and LightGBM (overall accuracy = 0.76, recall = 0.61, F1 = 0.58). Except for the indicators from remote sensing images and DEM data, the five ground survey indicators of forest origin (QI_YUAN), tree age group (LING_ZU), forest category (LIN_ZHONG), dominant species (YOU_SHI_SZ), and tree age (NL) were used in the modeling and prediction. Compared to the traditional methods, the proposed algorithm has lower cost and stronger timeliness.

TI  - Satellite Optical Brightness
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The apparent brightness of satellites is calculated as a function of satellite position as seen by a ground-based observer in darkness. Both direct illumination of the satellite by the Sun as well as indirect illumination due to reflection from the Earth are included. The reflecting properties of the satellite components and of the Earth must first be estimated (the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function, or BRDF). The reflecting properties of the satellite components can be found directly using lab measurements or accurately inferred from multiple observations of a satellite at various solar angles. Integrating over all scattering surfaces leads to the angular pattern of flux from the satellite. Finally, the apparent brightness of the satellite as seen by an observer at a given location is calculated as a function of satellite position. We develop an improved model for reflection of light from Earth's surface using aircraft data. We find that indirectly reflected light from Earth's surface contributes significant increases in apparent satellite brightness. This effect is particularly strong during civil twilight. We validate our approach by comparing our calculations to multiple observations of selected Starlink satellites and show significant improvement on previous satellite brightness models. Similar methodology for predicting satellite brightness has already informed mitigation strategies for next-generation Starlink satellites. Measurements of satellite brightness over a variety of solar angles widens the effectiveness of our approach to virtually all satellites. We demonstrate that an empirical model in which reflecting functions of the chassis and the solar panels are fit to observed satellite data performs very well. This work finds application in satellite design and operations, and in planning observatory data acquisition and analysis.

TI  - Identification of Paddy Croplands and Its Stages Using Remote Sensors: A Systematic Review
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Rice is a staple food that feeds nearly half of the world's population. With the population of our planet expected to keep growing, it is crucial to carry out accurate mapping, monitoring, and assessments since these could significantly impact food security, climate change, spatial planning, and land management. Using the PRISMA systematic review protocol, this article identified and selected 122 scientific articles (journals papers and conference proceedings) addressing different remote sensing-based methodologies to map paddy croplands, published between 2010 and October 2022. This analysis includes full coverage of the mapping of rice paddies and their various stages of crop maturity. This review paper classifies the methods based on the data source: (a) multispectral (62%), (b) multisource (20%), and (c) radar (18%). Furthermore, it analyses the impact of machine learning on those methodologies and the most common algorithms used. We found that MODIS (28%), Sentinel-2 (18%), Sentinel-1 (15%), and Landsat-8 (11%) were the most used sensors. The impact of Sentinel-1 on multisource solutions is also increasing due to the potential of backscatter information to determine textures in different stages and decrease cloud cover constraints. The preferred solutions include phenology algorithms via the use of vegetation indices, setting thresholds, or applying machine learning algorithms to classify images. In terms of machine learning algorithms, random forest is the most used (17 times), followed by support vector machine (12 times) and isodata (7 times). With the continuous development of technology and computing, it is expected that solutions such as multisource solutions will emerge more frequently and cover larger areas in different locations and at a higher resolution. In addition, the continuous improvement of cloud detection algorithms will positively impact multispectral solutions.

TI  - Effects of cadmium and zinc on gene expression of novel molecular biomarkers in the mangrove oyster<i> Crassostrea</i><i> gasar</i>
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Metal contamination impacts various aquatic species, and mollusk bivalves are appropriate sentinel organisms in coastal pollution assessment. Metal exposure can disrupt homeostasis, alter gene expression, and harm cellular processes. However, organisms have evolved mechanisms to regulate metal ions and counteract their toxicity. This study examined the effect of acute cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) on metal-related gene expression in gills of Crassostrea gasar following 24 and 48 h of laboratory exposure. We focused on Zn transport, metallothionein (MT), glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis, and calcium (Ca) transporter genes to understand the underlying Cd and Zn-accumulating mechanisms that prevent metal toxicity. Our findings revealed increased Cd and Zn levels in oyster gills, with significantly higher accumulation after 48 h. C. gasar accumulated high Cd concentrations even in scarce conditions and increased Zn levels, suggesting a strategy to cope with toxicity. While no significant gene expression differences were observed after 24 h, the increased metal accumulation after 48 h led to upregulation of CHAC1, GCLC, ZnT2, and MT-like genes in oysters exposed to Cd, and increased ZnT2-like expression following exposure to higher Cd/Zn mixtures. We found evidence of oysters may mobilize metal-related genes to mitigate Cd-induced toxicity by both chelating metals and/or reducing their intracellular concentrations. The observed genes upregulation also indicates their sensitivity to changes in metal bioavailability. Overall, this study offers insights into oyster mechanisms for coping with metal toxicity and suggests ZnT2, MT, CHAC1, and GCLC-like as molecular biomarkers for monitoring aquatic metal pollution using C. gasar as sentinel species.

TI  - Mitotic rate as a predictive factor for positive sentinel lymph nodes in pT1 and pT2 melanomas
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a crucial step in the management of patients af- fected by melanoma. The decision whether to perform it or not is based on different histolo- gical parameters, but the mitotic rate is no longer considered a prognostic variable after the release of the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) guidelines. Our objective was to investigate the risk factors that increase the chance for sentinel lymph node positivity in melanomas with a Breslow thickness of less than 2.00 mm, including the mitotic count. A retrospective single-center study was performed on a homogenous cohort of 408 pa- tients treated for cutaneous melanoma. Histological and clinical features were gathered and correlated with the increased risk for sentinel lymph node positivity by means of univariate and multivariate analyses. A statistically significant correlation between a high mitotic index and a positive sentinel lymph node was found in pT1 and pT2 patients, suggesting that in the case of pT1a melanoma with a high number of mitoses, a discussion about whether a sentinel lymph node biopsy is required should be done.& COPY; 2023 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

TI  - Particulate Organic Matter in the Atacama Trench: Tracing Sources and Possible Transport Mechanisms to the Hadal Seafloor
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic trenches are an important sink for organic matter (OM). However, little is known about how much of the OM reaching the hadal region derives from the sunlit surface ocean and other sources. We provide new insight into the OM sources in the Atacama Trench by examining the elemental and stable isotope composition of carbon and nitrogen in bulk OM throughout the entire water column and down to bathyal and hadal sediments. Moreover, we estimated the particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration and downward carbon flux. Our results, based on two-way variance analysis, showed statistical differences in delta N-15(PON) between the epipelagic zone and the deep zones. However, no statistical differences in delta C-13(POC) and C:N ratio between hadalpelagic and shallower pelagic zones were found, except for delta C-13(POC) in the oxygen-deficient zone. On the contrary, whereas the isotopic signatures of hadal sediments were distinct from those over the entire water column, they were similar to the values in bathyal sediments. Thus, our results suggest that bathyal sediments could contribute more OM to hadal sediments than the different zones of the water column. Indeed, whereas POC flux estimates derived from remote sensing data indicate that similar to 16%-27% of POC could evade surface remineralization within the top 200 m and potentially be exported to depths beyond the mesopelagic region, model estimates suggest that similar to 3.3% of it could reach hadal depths. Our results provide a quantitative baseline of pelagic-benthic coupling which can aid in assessment of carbon cycling changes in future climate scenarios.Plain Language Summary Hadal trenches (>6,000 m) represent the deepest part of the ocean and are an important sink for organic matter (OM). This OM is an important energy source for heterotrophic microbes living in hadal sediments and consequently for the recycling of nutrients. However, the mechanisms of how this material reaches the hadopelagic zone as well as the relative contributions from diverse sources remain poorly understood. The carbon and nitrogen stable isotope compositions of bulk OM have been widely used to elucidate the relative contribution of OM sources in the ocean. However, few studies have evaluated the isotopic composition of particulate organic matter from surface waters all the way to the hadopelagic region and surface hadal sediments. We conclude that whereas the hadopelagic water column receives <12% of OM from the sunlit shallow ocean, only similar to 3% reaches the hadal benthic zone, which receives a larger contribution from downslope sediment transport. Our results provide new insights in the cycling of carbon between the upper and deep ocean, which can assist with the forecasting of potential changes under progressive climate forcing.

TI  - Geo-Based Assessment of Vegetation Health Related to Agroecological Practices in the Southeast of Togo
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of climate change, the need to contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 is no longer in doubt, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study of the landscape within 10 km of the Donomade model farm, southeastern Togo, researchers sought to assess vegetation health in ecosystems and agrosystems, including their capacity to produce biomass for agroecological practices. Sentinel-2 sensor data from 2015, 2017, 2020, and 2022 were preprocessed and used to calculate the normalized vegetation fire ratio index (NBR), the vegetation fire severity index (dNBR), and CASA-SEBAL models. From these different analyses, it was found that vegetation stress increased across the landscape depending on the year of the time series. The research estimated that 9952.215 ha, 10,397.43 ha, and 9854.90 ha were highly stressed in 2015, 2017, and 2020, respectively. Analysis of the level of interannual severity revealed the existence of highly photosynthetic areas that had experienced stress. These areas, which were likely to have been subjected to agricultural practices, were estimated to be 8704.871 ha (dNBR2017-2015), 8253.17 ha (dNBR2020-2017), and 7513.93 ha (dNBR2022-2020). In 2022, the total available biomass estimated by remote sensing was 3,741,715 & PLUSMN; 119.26 kgC/ha/y. The annual average was 3401.55 & PLUSMN; 119.26 kgC/ha/y. In contrast, the total area of healthy vegetation was estimated to be 4594.43 ha, 4301.30 ha, and 4320.85 ha, in 2015, 2017, and 2022, respectively. The acceptance threshold of the net primary productivity (NPP) of the study area was 96%. The coefficient of skewness (0.81 & PLUSMN; 0.073) indicated a mosaic landscape. Productive and functional ecosystem components were present, but these were highly dispersed. These findings suggest a great opportunity to promote agroecological practices. Mulching may be an excellent technique for enhancing overall ecosystem services as targeted by the SDGs, by means of reconversion of plant biomass consumed by vegetation fires or slash-and-burn agricultural practices.

TI  - An assessment approach for pixel-based image composites
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is one of the main sources of information for monitoring forest dynamics; however, surface reflectance is often not possible to accurately derive due to haze, cloud, or cloud shadow. Pixel-based composites are generated from multi-temporal images to cover the entire area of interest using several different methods. While the availability of free and open remote sensing data has further expanded the use of compositing approaches, to date a comprehensive methodology to assess the quality of these composites does not exist, nor is there a detailed set of compositing requirements to ensure consistent and reliable outputs to produce maps and statistics. Herein, we introduce a pixel-based composite assessment methodology based on five criteria: (i) number of valid observations and number of pixels with no available observations (data gaps), (ii) amount of unscreened clouds, cloud shadows, haze, or smoke (noise), (iii) radiometric consistency of the surface reflectance data, (iv) temporal proximity of pixels acquisition dates, and (v) spatial agreement of pixels acquisition dates. To test our methodology, we processed more than 16,000 Landsat images to generate and assess the Best Available Pixel (BAP) and the Medoid pixel-based composites for summer 2019 (2019-Jun-1 to 2019-Aug-31) over Europe, with a focus on the forested ecosystems. We found that BAP resulted in composites that were more temporally consistent, whereas the Medoid approach resulted in composites that were more radiometrically consistent. Our results illustrate that our assessment approach is effective for comprehensively assessing the quality of pixel-based composites and could be implemented when using composites to generate statistical estimates (i.e. forest area) and for assessing the performance of new compositing algorithms or for selecting an appropriate compositing approach for a specific application.

TI  - Retrieval of Chla Concentrations in Lake Xingkai Using OLCI Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Xingkai is a large turbid lake composed of two parts, Small Lake Xingkai and Big Lake Xingkai, on the border between Russia and China, where it represents a vital source of water, fishing, water transport, recreation, and tourism. Chlorophyll-a (Chla) is a prominent phytoplankton pigment and a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, reflecting the trophic status of waters. Regularly monitoring Chla concentrations is vital for issuing timely warnings of this lake's eutrophication. Owing to its higher spatial and temporal coverages, remote sensing can provide a synoptic complement to traditional measurement methods by targeting the optical Chla absorption signals, especially for the lakes that lack regular in situ sampling cruises, like Lake Xingkai. This study calibrated and validated several commonly used remote sensing Chla retrieval algorithms (including the two-band ratio, three-band method, four-band method, and baseline methods) by applying them to Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) images in Lake Xingkai. Among these algorithms, the four-band model (FBA), which removes the absorption signal of detritus and colored dissolved organic matter, was the best-performing model with an R-2 of 0.64 and a mean absolute percentage difference of 38.26%. With the FBA model applied to OLCI images, the monthly and spatial distributions of Chla in Lake Xingkai were studied from 2016 to 2022. The results showed that over the seven years, the Chla concentrations in Small Lake Xingkai were higher than in Big Lake Xingkai. Unlike other eutrophic lakes in China (e.g., Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu), Lake Xingkai did not display a stable seasonal Chla variation pattern. We also found uncertainties and limitations of the Chla algorithm models when using a larger satellite zenith angle or applying it to an algal bloom area. Recent increases in anthropogenic nutrient loading, water clarity, and warming temperatures may lead to rising phytoplankton biomass in Lake Xingkai, and the results of this study can be applied for the satellite-based monitoring of its water quality.

TI  - R-Unet: A Deep Learning Model for Rice Extraction in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the world's three major food crops, second only to sugarcane and corn in output. Timely and accurate rice extraction plays a vital role in ensuring food security. In this study, R-Unet for rice extraction was proposed based on Sentinel-2 and time-series Sentinel-1, including an attention-residual module and a multi-scale feature fusion (MFF) module. The attention-residual module deepened the network depth of the encoder and prevented information loss. The MFF module fused the high-level and low-level rice features at channel and spatial scales. After training, validation, and testing on seven datasets, R-Unet performed best on the test samples of Dataset 07, which contained optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) features. Precision, intersection, and union (IOU), F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) were 0.948, 0.853, 0.921, and 0.888, respectively, outperforming the baseline models. Finally, the comparative analysis between R-Unet and classic models was completed in Dataset 07. The results showed that R-Unet had the best rice extraction effect, and the highest scores of precision, IOU, MCC, and F1-score were increased by 5.2%, 14.6%, 11.8%, and 9.3%, respectively. Therefore, the R-Unet proposed in this study can combine open-source sentinel images to extract rice timely and accurately, providing important information for governments to implement decisions on agricultural management.

TI  - Classifying Mountain Vegetation Types Using Object-Oriented Machine Learning Methods Based on Different Feature Combinations
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountainous vegetation type classification plays a fundamental role in resource investigation in forested areas, making it necessary to accurately identify mountain vegetation types. However, Mountainous vegetation growth is readily affected by terrain and climate, which often makes interpretation difficult. This study utilizes Sentinel-2A images and object-oriented machine learning methods to map vegetation types in the complex mountainous region of Jiuzhaigou County, China, incorporating multiple auxiliary features. The results showed that the inclusion of different features improved the accuracy of mountain vegetation type classification, with terrain features, vegetation indices, and spectral features providing significant benefits. After feature selection, the accuracy of mountain vegetation type classification was further improved. The random forest recursive feature elimination (RF_RFE) algorithm outperformed the RliefF algorithm in recognizing mountain vegetation types. Extreme learning machine (ELM), random forest (RF), rotation forest (ROF), and ROF_ELM algorithms all achieved good classification performance, with an overall accuracy greater than 84.62%. Comparing the mountain vegetation type distribution maps obtained using different classifiers, we found that classification algorithms with the same base classifier ensemble exhibited similar performance. Overall, the ROF algorithm performed the best, achieving an overall accuracy of 89.68%, an average accuracy of 88.48%, and a Kappa coefficient of 0.879.

TI  - Crop Mapping Based on Sentinel-2 Images Using Semantic Segmentation Model of Attention Mechanism
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remote sensing images to identify crop plots and estimate crop planting area is an important part of agricultural remote sensing monitoring. High-resolution remote sensing images can provide rich information regarding texture, tone, shape, and spectrum of ground objects. With the advancement of sensor and information technologies, it is now possible to categorize crops with pinpoint accuracy. This study defines crop mapping as a semantic segmentation problem; therefore, a deep learning method is proposed to identify the distribution of corn and soybean using the differences in the spatial and spectral features of crops. The study area is located in the southwest of the Great Lakes in the United States, where corn and soybean cultivation is concentrated. The proposed attention mechanism deep learning model, A(2)SegNet, was trained and evaluated using three years of Sentinel-2 data, collected between 2019 and 2021. The experimental results show that this method is able to fully extract the spatial and spectral characteristics of crops, and its classification effect is significantly better than that of the baseline method, and it has better classification performance than other deep learning models. We cross verified the trained model on the test sets of different years through transfer learning in both spatiotemporal and spatial dimensions. Proving the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in the process of knowledge transfer, A(2)SegNet showed better adaptability.

TI  - Dealing with the uncertainty of technical changes in the CORINE Land Cover dataset: The Portuguese approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) datasets are widely used across disciplines, with many users demanding more and better information. Understanding the uncertainties and errors associated to the main LULC datasets is a required step to facilitate their correct use, as well as to identify what could be improved in the future production of these products. CORINE Land Cover is probably the most well-known and used LULC dataset in Europe, especially valuable for the rich time-series that it provides. Despite being produced through a change mapping first approach, which tries to avoid technical errors and uncertainties in the temporal analysis of LULC changes, the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service distributes status layers of CORINE (CSL), which are not valid for change analysis because of their associated errors and uncertainties. The CORINE layers of changes (CHA) remove a lot of these issues, but do not meet the needs of many users. In Portugal, the national authority in charge of producing CORINE, the DGT, has implemented a backdating approach to produce consistent CSL layers that allow change analysis with low levels of uncertainty. Throughout this paper, we evaluate the changes that can be analyzed through all available CORINE layers in Portugal: Copernicus CSL layers; the national DGT CSL layers; and CHA layers. To this end, we aim to assess what type of changes can be studied through each type of layer, their associated sources of uncertainty and the relevance and utility of the Portuguese backdating approach to produce a consistent time-series of LULC maps. The results prove how the Portuguese CORINE layers distributed by the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service contain important sources of uncertainty, which however have been removed through the national backdating methodology. This methodology can be therefore exported for the production of CORINE in other European countries.

TI  - Sentinel Node Biopsy in Patients With Breast Carcinoma Without Axillary Involvement at Diagnosis Receiving Primary Systemic Therapy
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this work is to try to elucidate the optimal time to perform SLNB in cN0 patients with BC. At the moment we do not have randomized trials that answer this question. With the current criteria for performing ALND after NAC, we have concluded that we benefit patients with Luminal phenotype if we perform SLNB prior to NAC.Background: Primary systemic therapy (PST) has acquired great importance in breast cancer (BC) in the last few years. In this scenario, even if it is accepted to perform SLNB before PST, most of the guidelines remark the advantages of this practice after it, such as avoiding another surgery to the patient, a rapid start of the treatment and no need of axillary dissection in cases of pathologic complete response (pCR). Nevertheless, the lack of knowledge of the initial axillary state and the need to practice axillary dissection with any axillary disease are claimed to be some other disadvantages. There are no randomized studies yet that can conclude the optimal timing of SLNB in PST, so for the moment we may settle for our common practice. Patients and Methods: We studied all the cases attended in the Breast Unit that joined the inclusion criteria between 2011 and 2019 in our hospital and we compared the group with SLNB before PST with the group with SLNB after PST in terms of unnecessary axillary dissection and description features. Results: We included 223 female patients diagnosed with BC and without clinical nor radiological axillary disease (cN0), who had received NAC and SLNB performed before or after it. We observed a higher proportion of high-grade histological tumors (G3), tumors with aggressive phenotypes (Basal like and Her 2 enriched), and younger women in the group of SLNB before NAC compared with the SLNB after NAC group ( P < .01). Despite this, we did not find any difference in the number of positive SLNBs or in the number of ALND performed between the 2 groups. We found a higher proportion of ALND with all the lymph node (LN) negatives in the SLNB before NAC group. Conclusion: Taking into account that in the observation period we did not use ACOSOG Z0011 criteria with all the SLNBs, we figure out what would have been the real results nowadays following these criteria. In this scenario we conclude that patients with luminal phenotype seemed to benefit from practicing SLNB before NAC in terms of avoiding axillary dissections. We could not make any conclusion in the rest of the phenotypes. However, prospective studies are needed to confirm if this affirmation could be proved.

TI  - Feasibility of intraoperative injection of radioactive tracer and blue dye for sentinel lymph node biopsy in vulvar cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The objective of this studywas to examine the feasibility and success rate of intraoperative injection of radiotracer and blue dye performed by the surgeon without the use of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes in clinically early stage vulvar cancer. Methods. All patientswith clinically early stage vulvar cancerwho underwent attempted sentinel lymph node biopsy using intraoperative injection of Technetium-99 m (99mTc) tracer and blue dye performed by the surgeon after induction of anesthesia at single academic institution from 12/2009 to 5/2022 were identified. Demographic and clinicopathologic variables were collected. Data were compared using descriptive statistics. Results. One hundred sixty-four patients (median age 66.4 years) underwent intraoperative injection of radioactive tracer and dye for sentinel lymph node biopsy. Most patients (n= 156, 95.1%) were white. Squamous cell carcinoma accounted for 138 cases (84.1%), melanoma for 10 (6.1%), extra-mammary invasive Paget's disease for 11 (6.7%), and other histologies for 5 (3%). A majority of cases were stage I disease on final pathology (n= 119, 72.6%). Most patients (n= 117, 71%) had tumors located within 2 cm of the midline and underwent planned bilateral groin assessment, while 47 (29%) had well lateralized lesions and underwent unilateral groin assessment. For the patients undergoing unilateral groin assessment, 44 of 47 (93.6%) had successful unilateral mapping. Of the patients who underwent bilateral groin assessment, 87 of 117 (74.4%) had successful bilateral mapping, and 26 of 117 (22.2%) had successful unilateral mapping. Of the 26 patients who underwent bilateral assessment but only had unilateral mapping, 19 had unilateral mapping to ipsilateral groin but failed contralateral mapping, six hadmidline lesionswith successfulmapping to one groin but failedmapping to the other groin, and one had unilateral mapping to the contralateral groin but not ipsilateral groin. The total successful sentinel lymph node mapping rate in this cohort was 86.5% (243/281 total sentinel lymph node attempts). Conclusion. In this cohort, the overall success rate of sentinel lymph nodemapping and biopsywas 86.5%. The high rate of successful sentinel lymph nodemapping supports the use of intraoperative radiotracer and blue dye injection by trained providers. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Response of Urban Ecosystem Carbon Storage to Land Use/Cover Change and Its Vulnerability Based on Major Function-Oriented Zone Planning
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Vigorous emphasis has been placed on optimizing land spatial planning to protect carbon storage and enhance ecosystem resilience. What is the effectiveness of the Major Function-Oriented Zone (MFOZ) planning implemented to achieve this goal in China? Especially in urbanized areas where there are more pronounced conflicts between humans and land. Taking the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration as the target area, this study explored the response of carbon storage to land use/cover change (LUCC) and its vulnerability to ecological service functions under MFOZ planning. The 30 m x 30 m spatially resolved Landsat TM/ETM remote sensing images from 2000 to 2020 were used. The data preprocessing was performed mainly through radiometric calibration, clipping, and reclassification through the ArcGIS 10.7 software. Applying the InVEST model, which uses the LUCC map and carbon storage density of the four carbon pools, including above-ground carbon density, below-ground carbon density, dead organic carbon density, and soil organic carbon density, to evaluate the carbon storage under the current landscape or in the future, the results show that: (1) The BTH ecosystem experienced a carbon storage reduction of about 7.25 x 107 Mg from 2000 to 2020 due to the expansion of construction land, which crowded out cropland. Carbon storage in the BTH showed a high concentration in the "northeast-southwest" direction and a tiny distribution in the "middle-east" direction. (2) From 2015, the initial effects of the MFOZ planning were seen, with the ecological land in the Central Core Zone and Eastern Coastal Development Zone decreasing while the proportion of high-carbon storage areas in the Eastern Coastal Development Zone increasing. (3) Over the two decades, the land use intensity index improved by 4.65 overall, and vulnerability worsened from 2000 to 2015 and was alleviated from 2015 to 2020. This study will provide a scientific reference for optimizing urban spatial land use planning and promoting carbon sequestration in ecosystems.

TI  - NDVI Analysis for Monitoring Land-Cover Evolution on Selected Deglaciated Areas in the Gran Paradiso Group (Italian Western Alps)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing climate warming is affecting high-elevation areas, reducing the extent and the duration of glacier and snow covers, driving a widespread greening effect on the Alpine region. The impact assessment requires therefore the integration of the geomorphological context with altitudinal and ecological features of the study areas. The proposed approach introduces chronologically-constrained zones as geomorphological evidence for selecting deglaciated areas in the alpine and non-alpine belts. In the present study, the protected and low-anthropic-impacted areas of the Gran Paradiso Group (Italian Western Alps) were analysed using Landsat NDVI time series (1984-2022 CE). The obtained results highlighted a progressive greening even at a higher altitude, albeit not ubiquitous. The detected NDVI trends showed, moreover, how the local factors trigger the greening in low-elevation areas. Spectral reflectance showed a general decrease over time, evidencing the progressive colonisation of recently deglaciated surfaces. The results improved the discrimination between different greening rates in the deglaciated areas of the Alpine regions. The geomorphological-driven approach showed significant potential to support the comprehension of these processes, especially for fast-changing areas such as the high mountain regions.

TI  - Impact of land use/cover change and slope gradient on soil organic carbon stock in Anjeni watershed, Northwest Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Today's agri-food systems face the triple challenge of addressing food security, adapting to climate change, and reducing the climate footprint by reducing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). In agri-food systems, changes in land use and land cover (LULC) could affect soil physicochemical properties, particularly soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. However, the impact varies depending on the physical, social, and economic conditions of a given region or watershed. Given this, a study was conducted to quantify the impact of LULC and slope gradient on SOC stock and C sequestration rate in the Anjeni watershed, which is a highly populated and intensively cultivated area in Northwest Ethiopia. Seventy-two soil samples were collected from 0-15 and 15-30 cm soil depths representing four land use types and three slope gradients. Soil samples were selected systematically to match the historical records (30 years) for SOC stock comparison. Four land use types were quantified using Landsat imagery analysis. As expected, plantation forest had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher SOC (1.94 Mg ha(-1)) than cultivated land (1.38 Mg ha(-1)), and gentle slopes (1-15%) had the highest SOC (1.77 Mg ha(-1)) than steeper slopes (> 30%). However, higher SOC stock (72.03 Mg ha(-1)) and SOC sequestration rate (3.00 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) were recorded when cultivated land was converted to grassland, while lower SOC stock (8.87 Mg ha(-1)) and sequestration rate (0.77 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) were recorded when land use changed from cultivation to a plantation forest. The results indicated that LULC changes and slope gradient had a major impact on SOC stock and C sequestration rate over 30 years in a highly populated watershed. It is concluded that in intensively used watersheds, a carefully planned land use that involves the conversion of cultivated land to grassland could lead to an increase in soil C sequestration and contributes to reducing the carbon footprint of agri-food systems.

TI  - De-escalation of axillary surgery in patients outside Z0011 criteria
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past 2 decades, axillary surgical management for breast cancer patients has been reshaped after several practice-changing randomized clinical trials provided evidence to support the de-escalation of axillary surgery, specifically the omission of axillary lymph node dissection, for patients with positive axillary lymph nodes. One such practice-changing trial was the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial, which showed that patients with clinical T1-2 breast tumors and limited nodal disease (1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes) who underwent upfront breast-conserving therapy could be safely spared the morbidity of axillary lymph node dissection. American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 has been criticized as several important groups were excluded, such as patients who underwent a mastectomy, patients with >2 positive sentinel lymph nodes, or patients with imaging-detected lymph node metastases. These exclusions have led to unclear guidelines and very difficult management decisions for many patients with breast cancer who are just outside the Z0011 criteria. Several subsequent trials that investigated sentinel lymph node biopsy alone or sentinel lymph node biopsy plus axillary radiation versus axillary lymph node dissection enrolled patients with higher volumes of disease than American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011, such as mastectomy patients or patients with >2 positive sentinel lymph nodes. The goal of this review is to describe the findings of these trials and to discuss the current best practices regarding axillary management in patients who are candidates for upfront surgery but were excluded from American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011, with a particular focus on patients undergoing mastectomy, patients with >2 positive sentinel lymph nodes, patients with large or multifocal tumors, and patients with imaging-detected biopsy-proven lymph node metastases.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - An Application of Machine-Learning Model for Analyzing the Impact of Land-Use Change on Surface Water Resources in Gauteng Province, South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The change in land-use diversity is attributed to the anthropogenic factors sustaining life. The surface water bodies and other crucial natural resources in the study area are being depleted at an alarming rate. This study explored the implications of the changing land-use diversity on surface water resources by using a random forest (RF) classifier machine-learning algorithm and remote-sensing models in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Landsat datasets from 1993 to 2022 were used and processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, using the RF classifier. The results indicate nine land-use diversity classes having increased and decreased tendencies, with high F-score values ranging from 72.3% to 100%. In GP, the spatial coverage of BL has shrunk by 100.4 km(2) every year over the past three decades. Similarly, BuA exhibits an annual decreasing rate of 42.4 km(2) due to the effect of dense vegetation coverage within the same land use type. Meanwhile, water bodies, marine quarries, arable lands, grasslands, shrublands, dense forests, and wetlands were expanded annually by 1.3, 2.3, 2.9, 5.6, 11.2, 29.6, and 89.5 km(2), respectively. The surface water content level of the study area has been poor throughout the study years. The MNDWI and NDWI values have a stronger Pearson correlation at a radius of 5 km (r = 0.60, p = 0.000, n = 87,260) than at 10 and 15 km. This research is essential to improve current land-use planning and surface water management techniques to reduce the environmental impacts of land-use change.

TI  - Possibility of Using Zoning of Fallow Vegetation by Vegetation Indices to Assess Organic Matter Accumulation in Postagrogenic Soils
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Light gray forest soils (Eutric Retisols (Loamic, Cutanic, Ochric)) were studied under a 20-25-yr-old fallow at the stage of overgrowing by meadow vegetation, pine, and birch. The studied area plot was confined to one element of topography, without morphological evidences of erosion processes, and with relatively homogenous soil texture. To assess the influence of fallow vegetation on the formation of soil organic matter (SOM), the plant cover was zoned according to vegetation indices calculated on the basis of remote sensing data. The k-means algorithms and the Random Forest method were used for this purpose. It was shown that there were statistically significant differences between the types of land cover in terms of the SOM stocks in the upper layer of the old-arable horizon with the specification of three and four clusters. The specification of three classes of vegetation on the fallow-coniferous woody vegetation, deciduous woody vegetation, and herbaceous vegetation-proved to be the most expedient; the correctness of their allocation was confirmed by the geobotanical survey of the territory. The results of a pairwise comparison of sites occupied by different types of fallow vegetation indicated that they significantly differ in the SOM stocks only in the uppermost 5-cm-thick layer of the old-arable horizon and only for the pair of coniferous woody and herbaceous vegetation. Differences in the accumulated humus stocks in the layer of 0-10 cm were statistically significant for the soils under deciduous and coniferous woody vegetation and under herbaceous and coniferous woody vegetation. There was no significant difference in this indicator between the soils under deciduous woody vegetation and herbaceous vegetation.

TI  - Analysis of Aquifer-System Deformation in the Donana Natural Space (Spain) Using Unsupervised Cloud-Computed InSAR Data and Wavelet Analysis
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This work is focused on the Almonte-Marismas aquifer located within Donana Natural Space (SW Spain); this aquifer is threatened by droughts, irrigation-driven groundwater overexploitation, urban use, and the potential reactivation of gas extraction and storage projects. We present ground deformation measurements from Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data ranging from 1 to 2.5 cm, covering similar to 2,500 km(2) from 2014 to 2020. Detecting spatially distributed ground deformation over this agricultural area is challenging due to the low-coherence radar signals; consequently, the ground movement results are on the same order of magnitude as the errors associated with InSAR data. We have approached this issue by considering auxiliary information such as groundwater levels, climatic time series, and pumping rates and analyzing their spatio-temporal connections to ground displacements. We correlate InSAR and hydrogeological information through wavelet analysis, developing a Python package that allows applying the same methodology in other similar study areas. For the first time in the Donana area, a significant relationship between distances to pumping wells and the displacement extent is detected. Moreover, other subsidence-related triggering factors are identified, such as the soil moisture balance, clay shrinking-swelling processes, and creep of geological formations. These results are highly valuable to support aquifer management decisions in the Donana Natural Space; in this border region, three groundwater bodies were officially declared overexploited in 2020. Our findings provide a ground motion baseline assessment to help differentiate historical variations from any future anthropogenic effect in this complex marsh land ecosystem.Plain Language Summary This work is focused on Donana Natural Space (SW Spain), which integrates the Donana National Park and the Donana Natural Park in a single space. Donana has acquired the highest protected area categories that a natural area can receive from international conservation organizations. However, Donana's ability to support biodiversity is under constant threat due to droughts, groundwater overexploitation for irrigation, urban use, and the reactivation of a gas extraction and storage project. This study presents ground deformation measurements in the Donana area derived from Earth observation data ranging from 1 to 2.5 cm from 2014 to 2020. The work relates ground displacement, groundwater and climatic information through mathematical tools. For the first time in the Donana area, a significant relationship between distances to pumping wells and the displacement extent is detected. These results are highly valuable to support aquifer management decisions in the Donana Natural Space. Our findings provide a ground motion baseline assessment that will help differentiate historical variations from any future anthropogenic effect in this complex marsh land ecosystem.

AB  - We have developed a version of the Continuous Change Detection and Classification algorithm within the Google Earth Engine environment. It has been used with 20 years of Landsat data (1999-2019) to produce a new, publicly available global dataset of pre-computed time series break points and harmonic coefficients. We present results from regional use cases demonstrating classification and change detection with this new dataset and compare them to other temporal compositing techniques. Our results demonstrate that gains in overall accuracy using CCDC may be small on a yearly basis, but they are consistent, and improvements in temporal coherence-correctly detecting land use transitions and temporal trends-can be significant. These improvements can translate into better estimates of land use change activity and reduce the uncertainty in the greenhouse gas emissions estimates in REDD+ reporting.

TI  - Revisiting Climate-Related Agricultural Losses across South America and Their Future Perspectives
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate plays a major role in the spatiotemporal distribution of most agricultural systems, and the economic losses related to climate and weather extremes have escalated significantly in the last decades. South America is one of the most productive agricultural areas of the globe. In recent years, remote sensing data and geographic information systems have been used to improve geo-environmental hazard assessment. However, food security is still highly dependent on small farmer practices that are frequently the most vulnerable to climate extremes. This work reviews climate and weather extremes' impacts on crop production for South American countries, focusing on the projected ones considering different climate scenarios and countries. A positive trend in the productivity of maize, mainly related to agricultural improvements, was recently observed in Colombia, Ecuador, and Uruguay by up to 200%, as well as in the case of soybean in Bolivia and Uruguay by about 125%. Despite the generalized adverse impacts of climate extremes, results from agrometeorological models generally indicate an increase in crop production in southern regions of Chile (and highlands) and Brazil mainly related to increased temperature. Positive impacts in response to CO2 fertilization are also foreseen in Peru and Brazil (southeast, south, and Minas Gerais); in particular, in Brazil, increases in productivity can be raised by about 40%. The use of double-cropping systems, although with very good results in recent years, may also be at risk in a few decades, mainly due to forecasted precipitation decrease, delay in rainy season onset, and temperature increase. The development of timely early warning systems is imperative to produce technically accurate alerts and the interpretation of the risk assessment based on the link between producers and consumers. Promoting climate index insurance is crucial to build resilient food production, but its implementation should rely on regional or international support systems. Moreover, the implementation of adaptation and mitigation also requires climate-resilient technologies that involve an interdisciplinary approach.

TI  - Omitting axillary staging in selected patients: Rationale of Choosing Wisely in breast cancer treatment
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary surgery for breast cancer has continually evolved, with sentinel lymph node biopsy for clinically node-negative women with invasive breast cancer having long replaced axillary lymph node dissection. The information obtained from axillary staging has been important in providing prognostic information and guiding adjuvant treatment recommendations. However, recent studies suggest that sentinel lymph node biopsy should be omitted in select low-risk patients whose axillary surgery provides minimal prognostic value. This was highlighted by the Society of Surgical Oncology Choosing Wisely Guidelines, advocating against routine axillary staging in older women with early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Since the guideline release, ongoing research has continued to identify the subset of low risk patients who would benefit from the omission of axillary staging and improve adherence to Choosing Wisely to prevent overtreatment in older people.Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Canopy-Height and Stand-Age Estimation in Northeast China at Sub-Compartment Level Using Multi-Resource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stand age is a significant factor when investigating forest resource management. How to obtain age data at a sub-compartment level on a large regional scale conveniently and in real time has become an urgent scientific challenge in forestry research. In this study, we established two strategies for stand-age estimation at sub-compartment and pixel levels, specifically object-based and pixel-based approaches. First, the relationship between canopy height and stand age was established based on field measurement data, which was achieved at the Mao'er Mountain Experimental Forest Farm in 2020 and 2021. The stand age was estimated using the relationship between the canopy height, the stand age, and the canopy-height map, which was generated from multi-resource remote sensing data. The results showed that the validation accuracy of the object-based estimation results of the stand age and the canopy height was better than that of the pixel-based estimation results, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) increase of 40.17% and 33.47%, respectively. Then, the estimated stand age was divided into different age classes and compared with the forest inventory data (FID). As a comparison, the object-based estimation results had better consistency with the FID in the region of the broad-leaved forests and the coniferous forests. In addition, the pixel-based estimation results had better accuracy in the mixed forest regions. This study provided a reference for estimating stand age and met the requirements for stand-age data at the pixel and sub-compartment levels for studies involving different forestry applications.

TI  - Forest Canopy Cover Inversion Exploration Using Multi-Source Optical Data and Combined Methods
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate estimation of canopy cover can provide an important basis for forest ecological management by understanding the forest status and change patterns. The aim of this paper is to investigate the four methods of the random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and k-nearest neighbor with fast iterative features selection (KNN-FIFS) for modeling forest canopy cover, and to evaluate three mainstream optical data sources-Landsat8 OLI, Sentinel-2A, Gaofen-1 (GF-1)-and three types of data combined comparatively by selecting the optimal modeling method. The paper uses the Daxinganling Ecological Station of Genhe City, Inner Mongolia, as the research area, and is based on three types of multispectral remote sensing data, extracting spectral characteristics, textural characteristics, terrain characteristics; the Kauth-Thomas transform (K-T transform); and color transformation characteristics (HIS). The optimal combination of features was selected using three feature screening methods, namely stepwise regression, RF, and KNN-FIFS, and the four methods: RF, SVR KNN, and KNN-FIFS, were combined to carry out the evaluation analysis regarding the accuracy of forest canopy cover modeling: (1) In this study, a variety of remote sensing features were introduced, and the feature variables were selected by different parameter preference methods and then employed in modeling. Based on the four modeling inversion methods, the KNN-FIFS model achieves the best accuracy: the Landsat8 OLI with R-2 = 0.60, RMSE = 0.11, and RMSEr = 14.64% in the KNN-FIFS model; the Sentinel-2A with R-2 = 0.80, RMSE = 0.08, and RMSEr = 11.63% in the KNN-FIFS model; the GF-1 with R-2 = 0.55, RMSE = 0.12, and RMSEr = 15.04% in the KNN-FIFS model; and the federated data with R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 0.08, and RMSEr = 10.40% in the KNN-FIFS model; (2) the three multispectral datasets have the ability to estimate forest canopy cover, and the modeling accuracy superior under the combination of multi-source data features; (3) under different optical data, KNN- FIFS achieves the best accuracy in the established nonparametric model, and its feature optimization method is better than that of the random forest optimization method. For the same model, the estimation result of the joint data is better than the single optical data; thus, the KNN-FIFS model, with specific parameters, can significantly improve the inversion accuracy and efficiency of forest canopy cover evaluation from different data sources.

TI  - Modelling Heat Balance of a Large Lake in Central Tibetan Plateau Incorporating Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermodynamics of many lakes around the globe are shifting under a warming climate, affecting nutrients and oxygen transportation within the lake and altering lake biota. However, long-term variation in lake heat and water balance is not well known, particularly for regions like the Tibetan Plateau. This study investigates the long-term (1963-2019) variation in the heat balance of a large lake in the Tibetan Plateau (Nam Co) by combining the strengths of modeling and remote sensing. Remotely sensed lake surface water temperatures from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Along Track Scanning Radiometer Reprocessing for Climate: Lake Surface Water Temperature and Ice Cover (ARC-Lake) are used to calibrate and validate a conceptual model (air2water) and a thermodynamic model (LAKE) for the studied lake, for which in situ observation is limited. The results demonstrate that remotely sensed lake surface water temperature can serve as a valuable surrogate for in situ observations, facilitating effective calibration and validation of lake models. Compared with the MODIS-based lake surface water temperature (LSWT) for the period 2000-2019, the correlation coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE) of the LAKE model are 0.8 and 4.2 C-circle, respectively, while those of the air2water model are 0.9 and 2.66 C-circle, respectively. Based on modeling, we found that the water temperature of Nam Co increased significantly (p < 0.05) during the period of 1963-2019, corresponding to a warming climate. The rate of water temperature increase is highest at the surface layer (0.41 C-circle/10a). This warming trend is more noticeable in June and November. From 1963 to 2019, net radiation flux increased at a rate of 0.5 W/m(2)/10a. The increase in net radiation is primarily responsible for the warming of the lake water, while its impact on changes in lake evaporation is comparatively minor. The approaches developed in this study demonstrate the flexibility of incorporating remote sensing observations into modeling. The results on long-term changes in heat balance could be valuable for a systematic understanding of lake warming in response to a changing climate in the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - The Modified Soil Moisture Constraint Scheme Significantly Enhances the Evapotranspiration Simulation Accuracy of the MOD16 Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed (RS) evapotranspiration (ET) models can make full use of the land surface information retrieved using remote sensing and are therefore widely used in large-scale ET estimates. The MODIS Global Evapotranspiration model (MOD16) is one of the most commonly used remote sensing ET models. MOD16 parameterizes the moisture constraints on soil evaporation (Es) using atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and relative humidity (RH). This moisture constraint algorithm has been criticized by many studies due to the weak correlation between soil moisture and VPD or RH over short timescales (e.g., hourly and daily). In this study, we introduce a modified moisture constraint algorithm of ET, based on the ratio of antecedent accumulated precipitation to soil equilibrium evaporation, in order to improve the ET simulation capabilities of the MOD16 model. The original and modified MOD16 models are evaluated at 14 ChinaFlux sites and 286 basins in China, using eddy covariance measurements and water-balance-based ET estimates. The results show that the modified MOD16 model outperforms the original MOD16 model at both the site and basin scales. Compared with the original model, the modified model increases the value of KGE by an average of 0.17 at the flux site scale and by 0.01 at the basin scale. Using soil moisture measurements from flux sites as a reference, we further found that the modified MOD16 model also has a better soil moisture simulation capacity than the original model. This study highlights the importance of reliable soil moisture constraints in remotely sensed ET models.

TI  - A Cloud Framework for High Spatial Resolution Soil Moisture Mapping from Radar and Optical Satellite Imageries
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture plays an important role in crop yield estimation, irrigation management, etc. Remote sensing technology has potential for large-scale and high spatial soil moisture mapping. However, offline remote sensing data processing is time-consuming and resource-intensive, and significantly hampers the efficiency and timeliness of soil moisture mapping. Due to the high-speed computing capabilities of remote sensing cloud platforms, a High Spatial Resolution Soil Moisture Estimation Framework (HSRSMEF) based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was developed in this study. The functions of the HSRSMEF include research area and input datasets customization, radar speckle noise filtering, optical-radar image spatio-temporal matching, soil moisture retrieving, soil moisture visualization and exporting. This paper tested the performance of HSRSMEF by combining Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 images and in-situ soil moisture data in the central farmland area of Jilin Province, China. Reconstructed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) based on the Savitzky-Golay algorithm conforms to the crop growth cycle, and its correlation with the original NDVI is about 0.99 (P < 0.001). The soil moisture accuracy of the random forest model (R-2 = 0.942, RMSE = 0.013 m(3)/m(3)) is better than that of the water cloud model (R-2 = 0.334, RMSE = 0.091 m(3)/m(3)). HSRSMEF transfers time -consuming offline operations to cloud computing platforms, achieving rapid and simplified high spatial resolution soil moisture mapping.

TI  - Compensation of Background Ionospheric Effect on L-Band Geosynchronous SAR with Fully Polarimetric Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The L-band geosynchronous synthetic aperture radar (GEO-SAR) has been widely praised for its advantages of short revisit time, wide coverage and stable backscattering information acquisition. However, due to the ultra-long integrated time, the echo will be affected by the time-variant background ionosphere, leading in particular to defocusing in the azimuth direction. Existing compensation methods suitable for low Earth orbit SAR (LEO-SAR) are based on the SAR image or the semi-focused image at the ionospheric phase screen, assuming that the ionosphere is time-frozen for a short integrated period; thus, accurate reconstruction of the time-variant characteristics for the ionosphere in GEO-SAR cannot be achieved. In this paper, a compensation method of background ionospheric effects on L-band GEO-SAR with fully polarimetric data is proposed. Considering the continuous variation of the ionosphere within the synthetic aperture, a decompression processing is proposed to reconstruct the echo by recovering the temporal sampling according to the imaging geometry. By virtue of the Faraday rotation angle, the time-variant total electron content (TEC) is accurately estimated with the reconstructed echo. Based on the established error model, the ionospheric effects are well compensated with the estimated TEC. Simulations with the real SAR data from ALOS-2 and the measured time-variant TEC from USTEC validate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed method. The impacts from thermal noise and polarimetric calibration error are also quantitatively analyzed. From this, the error thresholds are given to guarantee compensation accuracy, namely 18.96 dB for SNR, -15.63 dB for crosstalk and -1.02 dB to 0.31 dB for the amplitude of the channel imbalance, and the argument of the channel imbalance is suggested to be maintained as close to zero as possible.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Soil Organic Carbon at Regional Scale Based on Deep Learning: A Case Study of Agro-Pastoral Ecotone in Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The North China agro-pastoral zone is a large, ecologically fragile zone in the arid and semi-arid regions. Quantitative remote sensing inversion of soil organic carbon (SOC) in this region can facilitate understanding of the current status of degraded land restoration and provide data support for carbon cycling research in the region. Deep learning (DNN) for SOC inversion has been W.a hot topic over the past decade, but there have been few studies at the regional scale in the arid and semi-arid zones. In this study, a DNN model with five hidden layers and five skip connections was established using 644 spatially distributed SOC samples and Landsat 8 OLI imagery. The model was compared with the random forest algorithm in terms of generalization ability. The main conclusions were as follows: 1. The DNN algorithm can establish a high-precision SOC inversion model (R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 0.7), with 90% of errors concentrated in the range of -2.5 to 2.5 kg & BULL;C/m(2); 2. the Boruta variable-screening algorithm can effectively improve the model accuracy of the random forest algorithm, but due to the DNN's better ability to mine hidden information in the data, the improvement effect on the DNN model accuracy is limited; 3. the SOC samples in arid and semi-arid areas are highly positively skewed, with a significant impact on the modeling accuracy of DNN, and conversion is required to obtain a model with better generalization ability; and 4. in arid and semi-arid regions, SOC has a weak correlation with vegetation indices but a stronger correlation with temperature, elevation, and aridity. This study established a reliable deep learning model for SOC density in a large arid and semi-arid region, providing a reference and framework for the establishment of SOC inversion models in other regions.

TI  - The impact of intraoperative frozen section in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer (cN0/ycN0) who received neoadjuvant systemic therapy
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: When surgical axillary staging reveals residual metastatic deposits in breast cancer (BC) patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), axillary lymphonodectomy is indicated. In this study, we investigate whether it is reasonable to perform intraoperative frozen section (FS) of the removed sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in cases where NACT had been administered in patients who had a clinically negative nodal status at the time of diagnosis.Patients and methods: We analyzed data from 101 BCE patients with 103 carcinomas who were diagnosed between 2014 and 2021 and met the above-mentioned criteria.Results: In three cases (2.8% of the study group), histologically active tumor tissue was detected in the removed axillary LNs. Discontinuation of therapy/the use of a low-dose NACT regimen was a significant factor for positive LNs (p = 0.02) at the subsequent surgical procedure; tumor progression during therapy approached borderline significance (p = 0.058). Among patients who had completed NACT with the planned standard dose regimen, and in which the primary tumors showed a response to therapy (n = 94), only one case had histologically detected residual metastases in the SLNs.Conclusions: Certified breast centers aim to improve the outcome of the patients. However, these specialized centers should also focus on economic aspects. This means that diagnostic and therapeutic procedures should be continuously critically reviewed in order to avoid unnecessary expenses. In BC patients with clinically node negative disease who completed NACT as planned and in which the tumor showed a good response to therapy, time consuming and costly FS of the SLNs removed should be omitted.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd, BASO -The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - Juno's Multi-Instruments Observations During the Flybys of Auroral Bright Spots in Jupiter's Polar Aurorae
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Juno's arrival at Jupiter in 2016 revealed unprecedented details about Jupiter's ultraviolet aurorae thanks to its unique suite of remote sensing and in situ instruments. Here we present results from in situ observations during Juno flybys above specific bright auroral spots in Jupiter's polar aurora. We compare data observed by Juno-UVS, JEDI, JADE, Waves, and MAG instruments when Juno was magnetically connected to bright polar auroral spots (or their immediate vicinity) during perijove 3 (PJ3), PJ15, and PJ33. The highly energetic particles observed by JEDI show enhancements dominated by upward electrons, which suggests that the particle acceleration region takes place below the spacecraft. Moreover, brightness and upward particle flux were higher for the northern bright spot in PJ3 than the southern spots found in PJ15 and PJ33. In addition, we notice the intensification of whistler-mode waves at the time of the particle enhancements, suggesting that wave-particle interactions contribute to the acceleration of particles that cause the UV aurorae. The MAG data reveal magnetic perturbations during the PJ3 spot detection by Juno, which suggests the presence of significant field-aligned electric currents. While the stable positions of the bright spots in System III suggest that the phenomenon is fixed to the planet's rotation, the presence of field-aligned currents leaves the possibility of an origin rooted much farther in the magnetosphere.

TI  - Soil Respiration and Related Abiotic and Remotely Sensed Variables in Different Overstories and Understories in a High-Elevation Southern Appalachian Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately predicting soil respiration (R-s) has received considerable attention recently due to its importance as a significant carbon flux back to the atmosphere. Even small changes in R(s )can have a significant impact on the net ecosystem productivity of forests. Variations in R-s have been related to both spatial and temporal variation due to changes in both abiotic and biotic factors. This study focused on soil temperature and moisture and changes in the species composition of the overstory and understory and how these variables impact R-s. Sample plots consisted of four vegetation types: eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L. Carriere)-dominated overstory, mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia L.)-dominated understory, hardwood-dominated overstory, and cinnamon fern (Osmundastrum cinnamomeum (L.) C. Presl)-dominated understory, with four replications of each. Remotely sensed data collected for each plot, light detection and ranging, and hyperspectral data, were compiled from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) to determine if they could improve predictions of R-s. Soil temperature and soil moisture explained 82% of the variation in R-s. There were no statistically significant differences between the average annual Rs rates among the vegetation types. However, when looking at monthly R-s, cinnamon fern plots had statistically higher rates in the summer when it was abundant and hemlock had significantly higher rates in the dormant months. At the same soil temperature, the vegetation types' R-s rates were not statistically different. However, the cinnamon fern plots showed the most sensitivity to soil moisture changes and were the wettest sites. Normalized Difference Lignin Index (NDLI) was the only vegetation index (VI) to vary between the vegetation types. It also correlated with R-s for the months of August and September. Photochemical reflectance index (PRI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference nitrogen index (NDNI) also correlated with September's R-s. In the future, further research into the accuracy and the spatial scale of VIs could provide us with more information on the capability of VIs to estimate R-s at these fine scales. The differences we found in monthly R-s rates among the vegetation types might have been driven by varying litter quality and quantity, litter decomposition rates, and root respiration rates. Future efforts to understand carbon dynamics on a broader scale should consider the temporal and finer-scale differences we observed.

TI  - Plot-Scale Irrigation Dates and Amount Detection Using Surface Soil Moisture Derived from Sentinel-1 SAR Data in the Optirrig Crop Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to develop an approach using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and the Optirrig crop growth and irrigation model to detect irrigation dates and amounts for maize crops in the Occitanie region, Southern France. The surface soil moisture (SSM) derived from SAR data was analyzed for changes indicating irrigation events at the plot scale in four reference plots located in Montpellier (P1) and Tarbes (P2, P3, and P4). As rain most likely covers several square kilometers, while irrigation is decided at the plot scale, a difference between SSM signals at the grid scale (10 km x 10 km) and plot scale is a clear indication of a recent irrigation event. Its date and amount are then sought by forcing irrigation dates and amounts in Optirrig, selecting the most relevant (date, amount) combination from an appropriate criterion. As the observed SSM values hold for a depth of a few centimeters, while the modeled SSM values hold for exactly 10 cm, the best irrigation combination is the one that gives similar relative changes in SSM values rather than similar SSM values. The irrigation dates were detected with an overall accuracy (recall) of 86.2% and a precision of 85.7%, and thus, with relatively low numbers of missed or false irrigation detections, respectively. The performance of the method in detecting seasonal irrigation amounts varied with climatic conditions. For the P1 plot in the semi-arid climate of Montpellier, the mean absolute error percentage (MAE%) was 16.4%, showing a higher efficiency when compared with the humid climate of Tarbes (P2, P3, and P4 plots), where a higher MAE% of 50% was recorded, indicating a larger discrepancy between the detected and actual irrigation amounts. The limitations of the proposed method can be attributed to the characteristics of the Sentinel-1 constellation, including its 6-day revisit time and signal penetration challenges in dense maize cover, as well as the mismatch between the parameterization of Optirrig for SSM simulations and the actual irrigation practices followed by farmers. Despite these weaknesses, the results demonstrated the relevance of combining Optirrig and S1 SAR-derived SSM data for field-scale detection of irrigation dates and, potentially, irrigation amounts.

TI  - Monitoring and Analysis of Land Subsidence in Jiaozuo City (China) Based on SBAS-InSAR Technology
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Jiaozuo, located in the northwest of Henan Province, is one of the six major anthracite production bases in China. It is susceptible to land subsidence due to over a hundred years of mining history, continuous urbanization, frequent human activities, etc., which poses a great threat to urban infrastructure construction and people's production and lives. However, traditional leveling techniques are not sufficient for monitoring large areas of land subsidence due to the time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive nature of the process. Furthermore, the results of conventional methods may not be timely, rendering them ineffective for monitoring purposes. With the continuous advancement of urbanization, land subsidence caused by groundwater extraction, ground load, and other factors in daily life poses a great threat to urban infrastructure construction and people's production and lives. In order to monitor the land subsidence in the area of Jiaozuo city, this article uses the Sentienl-1A satellite data covering the city from March 2017 to March 2021 to obtain the accumulated land subsidence and the average land subsidence rate based on the Small Baselines Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technology. The results indicate that the surface of Jiaozuo area is generally stable, and there has been no large-scale settlement. The settlement rate is roughly between -1 mm/a and 2.2 mm/a, and the areas with obvious land subsidence are mainly located in the southeast and east of Jiaozuo city center. After field investigation, it was found that the land subsidence is mainly caused by two reasons: groundwater excessive mining and excessive surface load. In the northeast of Jiaozuo city, there is a certain uplift area. After on-site investigation, it was found that the area is connected to a tailings pond of an aluminum mine, constantly accumulating abandoned rock masses and sediment, causing an annual uplift rate of +6 similar to+ 24 mm/a. The large-scale extraction of groundwater from farmland in the urban-rural integration area for irrigation of wheat has led to the settlement of buildings in the area with a rate of -11--74 mm/a.

TI  - Greenhouse gas monitoring instrument on the GF-5 satellite-II: on-orbit spectral calibration
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The greenhouse gas monitoring instruments were carried on the Gaofen-5-II satellite, which was launched into orbit from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center on September 7, 2021. In order to improve the on-orbit data quantification level, a calibration device based on diffuse reflector system was designed, which can realize on-orbit spectral and radiation calibration. In this paper, the principle of standard spectral line selection is given, and the characteristic spectral lines that can be used for on-orbit spectral calibration are extracted. The wavelength deviation evaluation function is established by using the method of matching the high-resolution reference spectrum after the linear function of the convolution instrument with the on-orbit calibration measurement spectrum, and finally using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to evaluate the function. The optimization solution is the onorbit wavelength calibration result. According to the above method, the on-orbit calibration data are processed. After calibration, the maximum deviation of the on-orbit spectral offset is changed from 0.133 to 0.009 cm-1, and variations in magnitude less than 10% of the spectral resolution for CO2 (1.57 & mu;m) band have been detected.

TI  - Remotely sensed environmental measurements detect decoupled processes driving population dynamics at contrasting scales
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of satellite imagery has supported a rapid expansion in forward-looking studies seeking to track and predict how climate change will influence wild population dynamics. However, these data can also be used in retrospect to provide additional context for historical data in the absence of contemporaneous environmental measurements. We used 167 Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images spanning 13 years to identify environmental drivers of fitness and population size in a well-characterized population of banner-tailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis) in the southwestern United States. We found evidence of two decoupled processes that may be driving population dynamics in opposing directions over distinct time frames. Specifically, increasing mean surface temperature corresponded to increased individual fitness, where fitness is defined as the number of offspring produced by a single individual. This result contrasts with our findings for population size, where increasing surface temperature led to decreased numbers of active mounds. These relationships between surface temperature and (i) individual fitness and (ii) population size would not have been identified in the absence of remotely sensed data, indicating that such information can be used to test existing hypotheses and generate new ecological predictions regarding fitness at multiple spatial scales and degrees of sampling effort. To our knowledge, this study is the first to directly link remotely sensed environmental data to individual fitness in a nearly exhaustively sampled population, opening a new avenue for incorporating remote sensing data into eco-evolutionary studies.

TI  - Monitoring intertidal golden tides dominated by Ectocarpus siliculosus using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Golden seaweed tides are a global environmental and social problem, that have been occurring along Ireland's eastern coastline since the 1990s. This study focused on analysing the spatiotemporal dynamics of golden seaweed (Ectocarpus siliculosus) coverage at Dollymount Strand in Dublin Bay (Ireland), between 2016 and 2022, and its relationship with meteorological conditions. Hyperspectral measurements in the field and Sentinel-2 imagery were utilized to monitor macroalgal blooms with a spatiotemporal resolution of 10 m and minimum costs. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values filtered between 0.1 and 1 were used to identify the coverage of golden seaweeds. The results showed that the golden seaweed coverage extended over 99% of the study area (54 ha) in June 2020 with an average NDVI of 0.25. A seasonal pattern of golden seaweed abundance was observed and modelled from May to October using a Generalized Additive Model. Approximately 28% of the coverage was correlated with daily average global radiance, and 38% of the mean NDVI was associated with daily average maximum air temperatures and wind direction by means of the Generalized Linear Models. A greater biomass of Ectocarpus spp. was accumulated on the beach when the wind direction was from the northeast and south-east. The results also suggested that freshwater nutrient inputs in winter from nearby estuaries may be contributing to golden tides on the shoreline. These findings are useful in developing strategies aimed at controlling and managing golden tides globally, as well as using them as bioindicators of ecological status in coastal environments.

TI  - Quantifying irrigation water demand and supply gap using remote sensing and GIS in Multan, Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Human interventions and rapid changes in land use adversely affect the adequate distribution of water resources. A research study was conducted to quantify the gap between demand and supply for irrigation water in Multan, Pakistan, which may lead to sustainable water management. Two remotely sensed images (Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 5 TM) were downloaded for the years 2010 and 2020, and supervised classification method was performed for the selected land use land cover (LULC) classes and basic framework. During the evaluation, the kappa coefficient was found in the ranges of 0.83-0.85, and overall accuracy was found to be more than 80% which indicated a substantial agreement between the classified maps and the ground truth data for both years and seasons. The LULC maps showed that urbanization has increased by 49% during the last decade (2010-2020). Reduction in planting areas for wheat (9%), cotton (24%), and orchards (46%) was observed. An increase in planting areas for rice (92%) and sugarcane (63%) was observed. The changing LULC pattern may be related to variation in water demand and supply for irrigation. The irrigation water demand has decreased by 370.2 Mm(3) from 2010 to 2020, due to the reduction in agricultural land and an increase in urbanization. Available irrigation water supply (canals/rainfall) was estimated as 2432 Mm(3) for the year 2020 which was 26% less than that of total irrigation water demand (3281 Mm(3)). The findings also provide the database for sustainable water management and equitable distribution of water in the region.

TI  - Sensitivity Evaluation of Time Series InSAR Monitoring Results for Landslide Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques are important for landslide detection and monitoring; however, several limitations and uncertainties, such as the unique north-south flying direction and side-look radar observing geometry, currently limit the ability of InSAR to credibly detect landslides, especially those related to high and steep slopes. Here, we conducted experimental and statistical analysis on the feasibility of time-series InSAR monitoring for steep slopes using ascending and descending SAR images. First, the theoretical (T-GNSS), practical (P-GNSS), and terrain (H-terrain) (T-P-H) indices for sensitivity evaluations of the slope displacement monitoring results from time-series InSAR were proposed for slope monitoring. Subsequently, two experimental and statistical studies were conducted for the cases with and without Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) monitoring data. Our experimental results of two high and steep open-pit mines showed that the defined theoretical and practical sensitivity indices can quantitatively evaluate the feasibility of ascending and descending InSAR observations in steep-slope deformation monitoring with GNSS data, and the terrain sensitivity index can qualitatively evaluate the feasibility of landslide monitoring results from ascending and descending Sentinel-1 satellite data without GNSS data. We further demonstrate the generalizability of these proposed indices using four landslide cases with both public GNSS and InSAR monitoring data and 119 landslide cases with only InSAR monitoring data. The statistical results indicated that greater indices correlated with higher reliability of the monitoring results, suggesting that these novel indices have wide suitability and applicability. This study can help to improve the practice of slope deformation monitoring using spaceborne InSAR, especially for high and steep slopes.

TI  - Comprehensive Evaluation of the Efficient and Safe Utilization of Two Varieties of Winter Rapeseed Grown on Cadmium- and Lead-Contaminated Farmland under Atmospheric Deposition
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine the feasibility of planting rapeseed to safely utilize heavy metals (HMs)-contaminated farmlands surrounding working smelters under atmospheric deposition, a field trial was conducted to analyze the yields, cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) concentrations, health risks, and economic benefits of 15 rapeseed cultivars (13 Brassica napus L. and two Brassica campestris L.) in Jiyuan City, Henan Province, China. The results show that the seeds' Cd concentration was 0.12-0.64 mg & BULL;kg(-1) and the seeds' Pb concentration was higher than Cd at 0.49-1.22 mg & BULL;kg(-1). The Cd bioconcentration factor of B. campestris (0.702-0.822) was higher than that of B. napus (0.246-0.502). Additionally, Cd and Pb transfer factors from the stems to the pods and seeds were 0.34-1.20 and 0.54-4.53, respectively. Combined with a comprehensive analysis of the annual deposition data of Cd and Pb, 16.40 and 345.79 kg & BULL;hm(-2), respectively, HMs in the seeds were not only derived from those in the soil, but were also derived from the atmosphere. Furthermore, the Cd and Pb levels in rapeseed oil, meal, and straw met the requirements stipulated in the standards for food safety, feeds hygiene, and organic fertilizer in China. Rapeseed-maize rotation yielded a profit of 15,550 CNY & BULL;a(-1)& BULL;hm(-2), thereby increasing the economic output by 133.8%. A cluster analysis revealed that B. campestris SYH and ZS100 and B. napus ZY-821 showed the greatest comprehensive benefits. In conclusion, rapeseed cultivation is a viable and extendable approach that can achieve the safe utilization of typical HMs-contaminated farmland caused by atmospheric deposition in Northern China.

TI  - Estimating Monthly Surface Air Temperature Using MODIS LST Data and an Artificial Neural Network in the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature (Ta) datasets with high spatial and temporal resolutions are needed in a wide range of applications, such as hydrology, ecology, agriculture, and climate change studies. Nonetheless, the density of weather station networks is insufficient, especially in sparsely populated regions, greatly limiting the accuracy of estimates of spatially distributed Ta. Due to their continuous spatial coverage, remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) data provide the possibility of exploring spatial estimates of Ta. However, because of the complex interaction of land and climate, retrieval of Ta from the LST is still far from straightforward. The estimation accuracy varies greatly depending on the model, particularly for maximum Ta. This study estimated monthly average daily minimum temperature (Tmin), average daily maximum temperature (Tmax) and average daily mean temperature (Tmean) over the Loess Plateau in China based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data (MYD11A2) and some auxiliary data using an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The data from 2003 to 2010 were used to train the ANN models, while 2011 to 2012 weather station temperatures were used to test the trained model. The results showed that the nighttime LST and mean LST provide good estimates of Tmin and Tmean, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 1.04 & DEG;C and 1.01 & DEG;C, respectively. Moreover, the best RMSE of Tmax estimation was 1.27 & DEG;C. Compared with the other two published Ta gridded datasets, the produced 1 km x 1 km dataset accurately captured both the temporal and spatial patterns of Ta. The RMSE of Tmin estimation was more sensitive to elevation, while that of Tmax was more sensitive to month. Except for land cover type as the input variable, which reduced the RMSE by approximately 0.01 & DEG;C, the other vegetation-related variables did not improve the performance of the model. The results of this study indicated that ANN, a type of machine learning method, is effective for long-term and large-scale Ta estimation.

TI  - Recognizing the transformation characteristics of resource-based cities using night-time light remote sensing data: Evidence from 126 cities in China
T2  - RESOURCES POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The most important step in the growth and transformation of resource-based cities is to identify transformational traits scientifically and determine future transformation and upgrading directions. However, there is a lack of quantitative identification of the critical time points for resource-based city transformation. Our study identified one-hundred and twenty-six resource-based cities at the prefecture level using the remote sensing data of nighttime light from 2000 to 2020 in China. The critical time nodes of the resource-based city transformation were objectively identified from the perspective of nighttime light. The findings reveal that while most resourcebased cities keep expanding, their size falls from 2000 to 2020. The shrinking of resource-based cities also showed a downward trend. While stable resource-based cities first saw a decline and then an increase. The crucial years for continuously expanding cities were mostly 2008-2011, for continuously stable cities occurred mainly in 2017-2020, and continuously shrinking cities occurred mainly in 2011-2014. The results also indicate that a city under continuous expansion (shrinkage) will gradually transform into a city of continuous stability when the expansion (shrinkage) reaches a certain extent. Ultimately, this study provides new insights into how resource-based cities transform and grow.

TI  - Google Earth Engine for archaeologists: An updated look at the progress and promise of remotely sensed big data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A wealth of remotely sensed data has accumulated over the past several decades and now constitutes an analytical resource primed for archaeological applications. To date, remotely sensed big data (RSBD) analytics in archaeology have focused on filling spatial gaps in the distribution of sites and features, characterizing environmental landscapes, and monitoring cultural heritage sites. The scientific promise of these data to expand our understanding of past human-environment interactions has not been fully realized. Limitations of data access, sufficient analytical and computational resources, and methodological awareness and education on the appropriate use of RSBD have limited the adoption and widespread use of RSBD in archaeology, despite its ubiquity in the Earth sciences. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a freely available planetary-scale cloud computing platform that addresses the perennial challenges of data access, analysis, and computing power that are particularly acute among archaeologists aiming to derive insights from RSBD. GEE lowers the barrier to entry for analyzing RSBD, expanding the potential for these data in the automated identification of archaeological features through deep learning; fieldwork planning and archaeological practice; modeling of past environments and environmental variability; and cultural heritage impact and risk assessments. In doing so, it also contributes to open science via increased access, transparency, and reproducibility.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Surface Roughness Parameters Under Simulated Rainfall Using Spectral Reflectance in Optical Domain
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study was to evaluate the possibility of parameterizing the state of soil surface roughness (SSR) based on proximal measurements of spectral reflectance in the VIS-NIR range, which is important for the needs of monitoring the state of soil surfaces. SSR should be constantly monitored as it provides an insight into a range of hydrological and erosive soil processes and improves the interpretation of remote sensing data. SSR and the spectral reflectance of three texturally different soils were measured under simulated rainfall in laboratory condition. The relationship between the SSR parameters and soil spectra was determined using regression random forest models. Various spectral data processing methods were tested and the best wavelengths for SSR description after rainfall were found. Two roughness indices were used to describe the SSR: Height Standard Deviation (HSD) and T-3D (Tortuosity index). Although both shared a significant correlation with SSR, the T-3D index demonstrated a more pronounced rainfall effect and a closer correlation with spectral data than HSD. The best determination of T-3D was obtained with the raw spectra (RAW) (R-2 = 0.71), as well as with spectra transformed with the baseline alignment first derivative (BA1d) method (R-2 = 0.71) or the Savitzky-Golay (SG) method (R-2 = 0.69). Different wavelengths were the best SSR predictors depending on the spectral transformation method (VIPs - Variable Importance in Projection). For both roughness indices, the NIR wavelengths (725-820 nm) yielded the highest VIP Score in models based on RAW spectra, while those in the VIS region (450-772 nm) were most important in models based on transformed spectra.

TI  - MAPPING OF THE ALGAE DISTRIBUTION TO SUPPORT WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT IN THE DAU TIENG RESERVOIR
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last two decades, the development of satellite technology has made it easier and more convenient to apply remote sensing in warning and solving environmental problems, especially the tracking, monitoring, and evaluation of environmental objects. Algae blooms are one of the top environmental issues of concern today. The blooms cause many harmful effects on the water environment and ecosystems in the area, such as reducing dissolved oxygen levels and producing harmful toxins, causing aquatic organisms to lack oxygen and be poisoned and dead. This study presents the research results in monitoring and calculating the concentration of algae in the Dau Tieng Reservoir by remote sensing. By constructing a regression function between monitoring data and qualitative algorithms from Landsat image spectrum reflection, the study conducted quantification and mapping of the distribution of algae concentration in the Dau Tieng Reservoir area. The calculation results show that the qualitative algorithm 3BDA(3) from the spectral bands in the GREEN, RED, and near-infrared NIR wavelength bands shows a reasonable degree of correlation with the monitoring data. Since then, the author has mapped the distribution of algae concentration and the current status of blooming algae on the reservoir at 3-time points. The study's results show the feasibility of applying remote sensing technology in monitoring, evaluating, and analyzing the concentration of algae in Dau Tieng Reservoir. The calculation results are an essential source of advice in managing reservoir water quality to prevent and minimize environmental and ecosystem damage in the area local water bodies.

TI  - De-escalation of surgery for occult breast cancer with axillary metastasis
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Occult breast cancer presenting as axillary metastasis is rare and remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Evidence to guide clinical management is limited, and locoregional treatment remains nonstandardized and highly varied nationally. Historically, occult breast cancer was managed with modified radical mastectomy & PLUSMN; radiotherapy; however, equivalent local control and survival are observed with breast preservation and adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy. Axillary lymph node dissection remains the standard surgical approach to the axilla for occult breast cancer patients. De-escalating axillary surgery in a subset of occult breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with good response to treatment may be appropriate, similar to the management of clinically node-positive patients in a known primary setting. As in other clinically node-positive breast cancer cases, thoughtful integration and tailoring of axillary surgery and regional nodal radiotherapy (for the varying extent of nodal burden) is an area of continued controversy and active investigation.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - CREATING A DISTRIBUTION MODEL OF THREE CRAYFISH SPECIES OF THE GENUS<i> FAXONIUS</i> (DECAPODA, CAMBARIDAE) IN MICHIGAN STREAMS USING PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DATA
T2  - CRUSTACEANA
M3  - Article
AB  - This research seeks to create a predictive model of habitat suitability for use in determining waterbodies vulnerable to introduced species within the state of Michigan. Three members of the genus Faxonius (Decapoda, Cambaridae) were selected as test taxa for the model due to several species' propensity for significantly altering the ecosystems they inhabit in Michigan and elsewhere. Michigan State University and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) conducted extensive field surveys of crayfish species assemblages across 461 stream sites from 2014-2016. This project compares these field data to data from publicly available national datasets with the purpose of revealing ecosystems that are vulnerable to population expansion. We identify patterns in Faxonius habitat at local (100 acres) and landscape (1000 acres) scales by associating crayfish occurrences throughout Michigan with variables characterizing landscape conditions thought to be important factors affecting their spread, growth, and survival. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using variables from Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) and National Land Cover Database (NLCD) successfully identified stream sites and watersheds in Michigan vulnerable to range expansion by Faxonius rusticus (Girard, 1852), Faxonius propinquus (Girard, 1852), and/or Faxonius virilis (Hagen, 1870). We found several habitat variables that influence our predictions. The most important variable describing F. rusticus presence was local (100-acre) scale Open Water land cover class, whereas for F. propinquus, the high-intensity developed land cover class at the local scale was the most important, while it was the shrubland land cover class at the local scale for F. virilis. This research demonstrates a powerful method to identify locations using remote sensing data that can be prioritized for conservation efforts that are threatened by invasive crayfish species.

TI  - Mineralogy, Morphology, and Emplacement History of the Maaz Formation on the Jezero Crater Floor From Orbital and Rover Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - The first samples collected by the Perseverance rover on the Mars 2020 mission were from the Maaz formation, a lava plain that covers most of the floor of Jezero crater. Laboratory analysis of these samples back on Earth would provide important constraints on the petrologic history, aqueous processes, and timing of key events in Jezero crater. However, interpreting these samples requires a detailed understanding of the emplacement and modification history of the Maaz formation. Here we synthesize rover and orbital remote sensing data to link outcrop-scale interpretations to the broader history of the crater, including Mastcam-Z mosaics and multispectral images, SuperCam chemistry and reflectance point spectra, Radar Imager for Mars' subsurface eXperiment ground penetrating radar, and orbital hyperspectral reflectance and high-resolution images. We show that the Maaz formation is composed of a series of distinct members corresponding to basaltic to basaltic-andesite lava flows. The members exhibit variable spectral signatures dominated by high-Ca pyroxene, Fe-bearing feldspar, and hematite, which can be tied directly to igneous grains and altered matrix in abrasion patches. Spectral variations correlate with morphological variations, from recessive layers that produce a regolith lag in lower Maaz, to weathered polygonally fractured paleosurfaces and crater-retaining massive blocky hummocks in upper Maaz. The Maaz members were likely separated by one or more extended periods of time, and were subjected to variable erosion, burial, exhumation, weathering, and tectonic modification. The two unique samples from the Maaz formation are representative of this diversity, and together will provide an important geochronological framework for the history of Jezero crater.Plain Language Summary The Perseverance rover on the Mars 2020 mission is collecting samples from Jezero crater for potential return to Earth via Mars Sample Return, and the first samples collected by the rover were from the Maaz formation, a lava plain that covers much of the crater floor. These igneous samples can be used to date when the lavas crystallized and to better understand their subsequent interactions with water, both of which will be important for reconstructing the history of habitable environments in Jezero crater. In this study we use images and reflectance spectra from the rover and orbiters, along with ground penetrating radar from the rover, to determine the history of the Maaz formation lavas. We find evidence for significant erosion and weathering in between successive flows, suggesting that they were emplaced over a long period of time. Some of the lavas underlie the Jezero delta, and so their age will provide limits on the timing of lake activity in Jezero crater, while others retain craters, so their age will help to better understand crater density-based age estimates for surfaces across Mars.

TI  - Development and Validation of the Climate Capability Scale
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change poses a serious existential threat to life on our planet. If we are to mitigate the most damaging impacts of climate change, there is a need for citizens who are willing and able to make changes to their individual behaviours, but who are also politically engaged and motivated to participate in, and advocate for, systemic change; there is a need for citizens who are Climate Capable. However, there is no scale currently available with which to measure the climate capability of adults and adolescents. Through an iterative process across three studies with 849 UK adults, we developed and validated a 24-item Climate Capability Scale. In a further study, with 458 UK adolescent participants (aged 12-15), we validated the scale for use with adolescents. We demonstrate that the scale is internally consistent, has good test-retest reliability, correlates with measures of related constructs such as environmental worldview and scientific literacy, and predicts self-reported pro-environmental behaviour. The Climate Capability Scale may have particular value in educational and public engagement contexts for measuring the effectiveness of programs and interventions designed to increase Climate Capability, as well as similar approaches to heighten engagement with the climate crisis.

TI  - TerraSAR-X and GNSS Data for Deformation Detection and Mechanism Analysis of a Deep Excavation Channel Section of the China South-North Water-Diversion Project
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to expansive soils and high slopes, the deep excavated channel section of the China South-North Water-Diversion Middle-Route Project has a certain risk of landslide disaster. Therefore, examining the deformation law and mechanism of the channel slope in the middle-route section of the project is an extreme necessity for safe operation. However, the outdated monitoring method limits research on the surface deformation law and mechanism of the entire deep excavation channel section. For these reasons, we introduced a novel approach that combines SBAS-InSAR and GNSS, enabling the surface domain monitoring of the study area at a regional scale as well as real-time monitoring of specific target regions. By using SBAS-InSAR technology and leveraging 11-view high-resolution TerraSAR-X data, we revealed the spatiotemporal evolution law of surface deformations in the channel slopes within the study area. The results demonstrate that the predominant deformation in the study area was uplifted, with limited evidence of subsidence deformation. Moreover, there is a distinct region of significant uplift deformation, with the highest annual uplift rate reaching 19 mm/y. Incorporating GNSS and soil-moisture-monitoring timeseries data, we conducted a study on the correlation between soil moisture and the three-dimensional deformation of the ground surface, revealing a positive correlation between the soil moisture content and vertical displacement of the channel slope. Furthermore, combining field investigations on surface uplift deformation characteristics, we identified that the main cause of surface deformation in the study area was attributed to the expansion of the soil due to water absorption in expansive soils. The research results not only revealed the spatiotemporal evolution law and mechanism of the channel slope deformation in the studied section of the deep excavation channel but also provide successful guidance for the prevention and control of channel slope-deformation disasters in the study area. Furthermore, they offer effective technical means for the safe monitoring of the entire South-North Water-Diversion Middle-Route Project and similar long-distance water-conveyance canal projects.

TI  - Machine Learning Applied to a Dual-Polarized Sentinel-1 Image for Wind Retrieval of Tropical Cyclones
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, three types of machine learning algorithms are applied for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wind retrieval in tropical cyclones (TCs), and the optimal method is confirmed. In total, 30 Sentinel-1 (S-1) images in dual-polarization (vertical-vertical [VV] and vertical-horizontal [VH] were collected during the period from 2016 to 2021, which were acquired in interferometric-wide and extra-wide modes with pixels of 10 m and 40 m, respectively. More than 100,000 sub-scenes with a spatial coverage of 3 km are extracted from these images. The dependences of variables estimated from sub-scenes, i.e., VV-polarized and VH-polarized normalized radar cross-section (NRCS), as well as the azimuthal wave cutoff wavelength, on wind speeds from the stepped-frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) and the soil moisture active passive (SMAP) radiometer are studied, showing the linear relations between wind speed and these three parameters; however, the saturation of VV-polarized NRCS and the azimuthal wave cutoff wavelength is observed. This is the foundation of selecting input variables in machine learning algorithms. Two-thirds of the collocated dataset (20 images) are used for training the process using three machine learning algorithms, i.e., eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Multi-layer Perceptron, and K-Nearest Neighbor, and the coefficients are fitted after training completion through 20 images collocated with SFMR and SMAP data. Another 10 images are taken for validation up to 70 m/s, yielding a 2.53 m/s root mean square error (RMSE) with a 0.96 correlation and 0.12 scatter index (SI) using XGBoost. The result is better than the >5 m/s error achieved using the existing cross-polarized geophysical model function and the other two machine learning algorithms; moreover, the comparison between wind retrievals using XGBoost and Level-2 CyclObs products shows about 4 m/s RMSE and 0.18 SI. This suggests that the machine learning algorithm XGBoost is an effective method for inverting the TC wind field utilizing SAR measurements in dual-polarization.

TI  - CV-CFUNet: Complex-Valued Channel Fusion UNet for Refocusing of Ship Targets in SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, target rotation during the coherent integration time results in a time-varying Doppler frequency shift and a blurred image. Blurred images are not conducive to subsequent information interpretation. This article proposes a complex-valued channel fusion U-shape network (CV-CFUNet) for the 3-D rotation refocusing task of ship targets. The proposed method integrates the refocusing task into a blind inverse problem. To take advantage of the amplitude and phase information of complex SAR images, all elements of CV-CFUNet, including convolutional layer, activation function, feature maps, and network parameters, are extended to the complex domain. The proposed CV-CFUNet is designed by adopting a complex-valued encoder (CV-Encoder), channel fusion module (CFM), and complex-valued decoder (CV-Decoder) to adaptively learn complex features. Experiments on simulated data, GF-3 data, and Sentinel-1 data show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over existing methods in both efficiency and refocusing accuracy.

TI  - High-Resolution National-Scale Mapping of Paddy Rice Based on Sentinel-1/2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice has always been one of the major food sources for human beings, and the monitoring and planning of cultivation areas to maintain food security and achieve sustainable development is critical for this crop. Traditional manual ground survey methods have been recognized as being laborious, while remote-sensing technology can perform the accurate mapping of paddy rice due to its unique data acquisition capabilities. The recently emerged Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform was found to be capable of storing and computing the resources required for the rapid processing of massive quantities of remote-sensing data, thereby revolutionizing traditional analysis patterns and offering unique advantages for large-scale crop mapping. Since the phenology of paddy rice depends on local climatic conditions, and considering the vast expanse of China with its outstanding geospatial heterogeneity, a zoning strategy was proposed in this study to separate the monsoon climate zone of China into two regions based on the Qinling Mountain-Huaihe River Line (Q-H Line), while discrepant basic data and algorithms have been adopted to separately map mid-season rice nationwide. For the northern regions, optical indices have been calculated based on Sentinel-2 images, growth spectral profiles have been constructed to identify phenological periods, and rice was mapped using One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM); for the southern regions, microwave sequences have been constructed based on Sentinel-1 images, and rice was mapped using Random Forest (RF). By applying this methodological system, mid-season rice at 10 m spatial resolution was mapped on the GEE for the entire Chinese monsoon region in 2021. According to the accuracy evaluation coefficients and publicly released local statistical yearbook data, the relative error of the mapped areas in each province was limited to 10%, and the overall accuracy exceeded 85%. The results could indicate that mid-season rice can be mapped more accurately and efficiently on a China-wide scale with relatively few samples based on the proposed zoning strategy and mapping methods. By adjusting the parameters, the time interval for mapping could also be further extended. The powerful cloud-computing competence of the GEE platform was used to map rice on a large spatial scale, and the results can help governments to ascertain the distribution of mid-season rice across the country in a short-term period, which would be well suited to meeting the increasingly efficient and fine-grained decision-making and management requirements.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variation in Vegetation Cover and Its Response to Topography in the Selinco Region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the vegetation cover in the Selinco region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has undergone significant changes due to the influence of global warming and intensified human activity. Consequently, comprehending the distribution and change patterns of vegetation in this area has become a crucial scientific concern. To address this concern, the present study employed MODIS-NDVI and elevation data, integrating methodologies such as trend analysis, Hurst exponent analysis, and sequential cluster analysis to explore vegetation cover changes over the past 21 years and predict future trends, while examining their correlation with topographic factors. The study findings indicate a fluctuating upward trend in vegetation cover, with a notable decrease in 2015. Spatially, the overall fractional vegetation cover (FVC) in the study area showed a basic stability with a percentage of 78%. The analysis of future trends in vegetation cover revealed that the majority of areas (68.26%) exhibited an uncertain trend, followed by stable regions at 15.78%. The proportion of areas showing an increase and decrease in vegetation cover accounted for only 9.63% and 5.61%, respectively. Elevation and slope significantly influence vegetation cover, with a trend of decreasing vegetation cover as elevation increases, followed by an increase, and then another decrease. Likewise, as the slope increases, initially, there is a rise in vegetation cover, followed by a subsequent decline. Notably, significant abrupt changes in vegetation cover are observed within the 4800 m elevation band and the 4 & DEG; slope band in the Selinco region. Moreover, aspect has no significant effect on vegetation cover. These findings offer comprehensive insights into the spatial and temporal variations of vegetation cover in the Selinco region and their association with topographic factors, thus serving as a crucial reference for future research.

TI  - Siam-EMNet: A Siamese EfficientNet-MANet Network for Building Change Detection in Very High Resolution Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As well as very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing technology and deep learning, methods for detecting changes in buildings have made great progress. Despite this, there are still some problems with the incomplete detection of change regions and rough edges. To this end, a change detection network for building VHR remote sensing images based on Siamese EfficientNet B4-MANet (Siam-EMNet) is proposed. First, a bi-branches pretrained EfficientNet B4 encoder structure is constructed to enhance the performance of feature extraction and the rich shallow and deep information is obtained; then, the semantic information of the building is input into the MANet decoder integrated by the dual attention mechanism through the skip connection. The position-wise attention block (PAB) and multi-scale fusion attention block (MFAB) capture spatial relationships between pixels in the global view and channel relationships between layers. The integration of dual attention mechanisms ensures that the building contour is fully detected. The proposed method was evaluated on the LEVIR-CD dataset, and its precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score were 92.00%, 88.51%, 95.71%, and 90.21%, respectively, which represented the best overall performance compared to the BIT, CDNet, DSIFN, L-Unet, P2V-CD, and SNUNet methods. Verification of the efficacy of the suggested approach was then conducted.

TI  - Image similarity-based gap filling method can effectively enrich surface water mapping information
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite monitoring is an effective way to obtain the spatiotemporal information for surface water resources. However, due to problems such as clouds, cloud shadows, and sensor failures, there many gaps in satellite images, posing challenges for the accurate monitoring of surface water changes. Here, a new image-similarity-based gap-filling method using Landsat images, to obtain gapless surface water images, is proposed. The new method, based on a database composed of gapless images, uses the symmetrical difference method to determine the gapless image whose water pixels distribution is most similar to that of the gap image, finally replacing the gapped image pixels with gapless image pixels, to obtain a gap-filled water image. The performance of the new method is evaluated for arid and humid regions via numerical experiments and case verification. Then new method is compared with the existing gap-filling method, using the Aral Sea as an example. The new method's average overall accuracy for surface water in arid areas is about 0.99, and that of surface water in humid areas is about 0.98. It predicted surface water more accurately than other methods, and with high accuracy (R2 = 0.92). This proposed gap-filling method provides an important technical solution to obtaining long-term high-quality observations of surface water. It can also provide a database of image for accurate water resource management.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Pattern and Driving Forces of Fractional Vegetation Coverage in Xiong'an New Area of China from 2005 to 2019
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Xiong'an New Area was officially established in 2018 to construct a new, intelligent, and efficient urban area to alleviate Beijing's non-capital functions. Using Landsat satellite images, we employed the dimidiate pixel model, band operation, and transition matrix to analyze the temporal and spatial variations in FVC (Fractional Vegetation Coverage) within the Xiong'an New Area in 2005, 2013, and 2019, respectively. Urbanization rate, precipitation, temperature, and population were considered potential driving forces, which we analyzed using grey relational analysis and linear regression to explore the correlation between FVC and these factors. The findings are as follows: from 2005 to 2019, overall improvement and significant degradation have been observed. In Baiyangdian, a part of the national key ecological area, water bodies and FVC have increased. Grey relational analysis revealed that precipitation had the highest grey relational value of 0.76. The average correlation among natural factors was 0.67, while that among human factors was 0.60. Generally, the Xiong'an New Area vegetation exhibited instability, while Baiyangdian demonstrated relatively stable FVC. Grey relational analysis indicates a strong potential for social and economic development in the Xiong'an New Area.

TI  - Incorporating Plant Access to Groundwater in Existing Global, Satellite-Based Evaporation Estimates
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is an important water source for evaporation, especially during dry conditions. Despite this recognition, plant access to groundwater is often neglected in global evaporation models. This study proposes a new, conceptual approach to incorporate plant access to groundwater in existing global evaporation models, and analyses the groundwater contribution to evaporation globally. To this end, the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) is used. The new GLEAM-Hydro model relies on the linear reservoir assumption for modeling groundwater flow, and introduces a transpiration partitioning approach to estimate groundwater contributions. Model estimates are validated globally against field observations of evaporation, soil moisture, discharge and groundwater level for the time period 2015-2021, and compared to a regional groundwater model. Representing groundwater access influences evaporation in 22% of the continental surface. Globally averaged, evaporation increases by 2.5 mm year(-1) (0.5% of terrestrial evaporation), but locally, evaporation can increase up to 245.2 mm year(-1) (149.7%). The groundwater contribution to transpiration is highest for tall vegetation under dry conditions due to more frequent groundwater access. The temporal dynamics of the simulated evaporation improve across 75% of the stations where groundwater is a relevant water source. The skill of the model for variables such as soil moisture and runoff remains similar to GLEAM v3. The proposed approach enables a more realistic process representation of evaporation under water-limited conditions in satellite-data driven models such as GLEAM, and sets the ground to assimilate satellite gravimetry data in the future.

TI  - A Light-Weight Cropland Mapping Model Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many applications in agriculture as well as other related fields including natural resources, environment, health, and sustainability, depend on recent and reliable cropland maps. Cropland extent and intensity plays a critical input variable for the study of crop production and food security around the world. However, generating such variables manually is difficult, expensive, and time consuming. In this work, we discuss a cost effective, fast, and simple machine-learning-based approach to provide reliable cropland mapping model using satellite imagery. The study includes four test regions, namely Iran, Mozambique, Sri-Lanka, and Sudan, where Sentinel-2 satellite imagery were obtained with assigned NDVI scores. The solution presented in this paper discusses a complete pipeline including data collection, time series reconstruction, and cropland extent and crop intensity mapping using machine learning models. The approach proposed managed to achieve high accuracy results ranging between 0.92 and 0.98 across the four test regions at hand.

TI  - Seeing the Disturbed Forest for the Trees: Remote Sensing Is Underutilized to Quantify Critical Zone Response to Unprecedented Disturbance
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Understanding the severity and extent of near surface critical zone (CZ) disturbances and their ecosystem response is a pressing concern in the face of increasing human and natural disturbances. Predicting disturbance severity and recovery in a changing climate requires comprehensive understanding of ecosystem feedbacks among vegetation and the surrounding environment, including climate, hydrology, geomorphology, and biogeochemistry. Field surveys and satellite remote sensing have limited ability to effectively capture the spatial and temporal variability of disturbance and CZ properties. Technological advances in remote sensing using new sensors and new platforms have improved observations of changes in vegetation canopy structure and productivity; however, integrating measures of forest disturbance from various sensing platforms is complex. By connecting the potential for remote sensing technologies to observe different CZ disturbance vectors, we show that lower severity disturbance and slower vegetation recovery are more difficult to quantify. Case studies in montane forests from the western United States highlight new opportunities, including evaluating post-disturbance forest recovery at multiple scales, shedding light on understory vegetation regrowth, detecting specific physiological responses, and refining ecohydrological modeling. Learning from regional CZ disturbance case studies, we propose future directions to synthesize fragmented findings with (a) new data analysis using new or existing sensors, (b) data fusion across multiple sensors and platforms, (c) increasing the value of ground-based observations, (d) disturbance modeling, and (e) synthesis to improve understanding of disturbance.

TI  - Spatial estimation of daily precipitation in Thailand based on infrared satellite images using artificial neural networks
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation data highly benefits water management and flood warning. In Thailand, an agricultural country, the number of rain gauge stations is relatively small compared to the country's area. To deal with the problem, many spatial interpolation methods have been adopted. They utilized only geological data from stations with known rainfall values to estimate values at other locations. Characteristics of clouds captured in infrared satellite images could be used to infer rainfall. In this study, infrared satellite satellite images from every 30 min were integrated with geological data to spatially estimate daily precipitation. Under different assumptions, three estimation models, namely AveragedIR-ANN, IRs-ANN, and LocalIRs-CNN, were proposed. All three models used artificial neural networks as the estimator. The AveragedIR-ANN model used the average of 48 black body temperature (TBB) values to present IR images at the target location as an input. Meanwhile, the 48 TBB values were directly fed into the IRs-ANN. Not only the TBB values at the target location, but the LocalIRs-CNN also used the TBB values around the target location as inputs. Experiments were performed on 24 days per year between 2016 and 2019 with multiple tries. The results show that the LocalIRs-CNN outperformed by minimizing the median highest root mean square error. The model was suggested for northern, western, and central Thailand.

TI  - Long-Term Monitoring of Tree Population Dynamics in Desert Ecosystems: Integrating Field and Satellite Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Arid environments are characterized by rare rain events that are highly variable, as a result of which plant populations often exhibit episodic recruitment and mortality dynamics. However, direct records and observations of such events are rare because of the slow development of woody species. In this study, we described how a decrease in annual precipitation affected acacia tree population dynamics in two hydrological regime types: small wadis and salt flats. This study combines 15 years of continuous, yearly field monitoring of individual acacia trees and data from a historical Corona satellite image, which has extended the time scope of the research. Results indicate that the annual mortality of acacia trees in small wadis reflects the cumulative effective rain events in the preceding five years, whereas the population on the salt flats was not affected by annual rainfall fluctuations. Moreover, in small wadis, rain events of less than 8 mm did not increase acacia tree survival rates. The mortality pattern and dynamics of each plot was unique, suggesting unsynchronized mortality and recruitment episodes on a regional scale. Mortality in all plots was documented both in "old" trees (i.e., recognized in 1968) and "new" trees (not recognized in 1968), but varied highly between plots. More than 50% of the dead trees recorded at the sites had died during the previous dry period (2000-2010). Combining field monitoring and historical satellite image data provided a unique database of acacia population dynamics. This record revealed the response of the acacia population to climate fluctuations and a period of episodic mortality.

TI  - A questionnaire survey on the prevention of HPV infection among females and males who came of age in Japan under various scenarios of HPV vaccine recommendation
T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) temporarily suspended recommendation for HPV vaccinations for girls in June 2013. It resumed its recommendation in November 2021. To compensate for eight years of lost overage, a 'catch-up HPV vaccination' program began in April 2022. To determine intervention needs in regards to HPV vaccine hesitancy, from October 13 2021 to April 31 2022, we surveyed 12-28 year-old vaccine-eligible males and females (281 males, 583 females). We investigated the gender and 'vaccine generational' differences in attitudes, perceptions, and future intentions regarding HPV vaccination. Two generations were defined by the vaccine recommendation environment they grew up in. The 'vaccine generation' was born in FY 1994-1999; the 'vaccine-suspension generation' born in FY 2000-2009. Knowledge regarding the HPV vaccine correlated significantly with being female, of the vaccination generation, a medical student, and having received the COVID-19 vaccine. There was a significant 'generational' difference in terms of approval of the MHLW's recommendation resumption. The attitudes, perceptions, and future intentions of Japan's two generation groups are unique and should be dealt with accordingly. HPV vaccination promotion should consider the strong gender differences we identified. As an extension of the anti-cervical cancer program, HPV vaccinations for boys should begin immediately. Our study of their unique outlooks will contribute to the discussion surrounding that implementation.

TI  - Exploring Random Forest Machine Learning and Remote Sensing Data for Streamflow Prediction: An Alternative Approach to a Process-Based Hydrologic Modeling in a Snowmelt-Driven Watershed
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Physically based hydrologic models require significant effort and extensive information for development, calibration, and validation. The study explored the use of the random forest regression (RFR), a supervised machine learning (ML) model, as an alternative to the physically based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for predicting streamflow in the Rio Grande Headwaters near Del Norte, a snowmelt-dominated mountainous watershed of the Upper Rio Grande Basin. Remotely sensed data were used for the random forest machine learning analysis (RFML) and RStudio for data processing and synthesizing. The RFML model outperformed the SWAT model in accuracy and demonstrated its capability in predicting streamflow in this region. We implemented a customized approach to the RFR model to assess the model's performance for three training periods, across 1991-2010, 1996-2010, and 2001-2010; the results indicated that the model's accuracy improved with longer training periods, implying that the model trained on a more extended period is better able to capture the parameters' variability and reproduce streamflow data more accurately. The variable importance (i.e., IncNodePurity) measure of the RFML model revealed that the snow depth and the minimum temperature were consistently the top two predictors across all training periods. The paper also evaluated how well the SWAT model performs in reproducing streamflow data of the watershed with a conventional approach. The SWAT model needed more time and data to set up and calibrate, delivering acceptable performance in annual mean streamflow simulation, with satisfactory index of agreement (d), coefficient of determination (R2), and percent bias (PBIAS) values, but monthly simulation warrants further exploration and model adjustments. The study recommends exploring snowmelt runoff hydrologic processes, dust-driven sublimation effects, and more detailed topographic input parameters to update the SWAT snowmelt routine for better monthly flow estimation. The results provide a critical analysis for enhancing streamflow prediction, which is valuable for further research and water resource management, including snowmelt-driven semi-arid regions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid land-use transition on the landscape is accelerating the overall land cover change by altering naturally productive land into more complex land-uses. This study explored the spatial and temporal dynamics of land use and land cover (LULC) as landscape exploration though satellite imagery in the southwest of Bangladesh from 2000 to 2020. The goal of this study was to quantify the overall trend for different LULC changes using satellite imagery from Landsat TM and Landsat OLI/TIRS. Sequential K-means-based unsupervised and more accurate maximum likelihood classification (MLC) algorithm-based supervised methods were used to analyze land-use change for each year. The trend of land-use changes and transition results between 2000 and 2020 showed a massive increase in built-up (2010.654 ha/year) land-use; 525546.18 ha of forest increase (1.7%) in two decades, whereas 13351.59 ha (1.10%) of forest or plantation area was transformed into the built-up area. Remote sensing (RS) based land dynamics is always land cover analysis, especially for the vast area of interest.

TI  - Identifying Migration Routes of Wild Asian Elephants in China Based on Ecological Networks Constructed by Circuit Theory Model
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Humans overlap with Asian elephants, resulting in frequent costly human-elephant conflicts, which disturb and even threaten local residents. In this study, we treat provincial and national nature reserves where Asian elephants still exist and other alternative habitats suitable for Asian elephants in southern Yunnan, China, as ecological patches. By using this approach, we can treat the terrain and surface state factors that hinder the migration of Asian elephants as a form of ecological resistance surface. We can then use a circuit theory model and remote sensing data to construct an ecological network, which allows us to identify ecological corridors and ecological pinch points. Herein, the possible migration routes of wild Asian elephants were identified. The main results are as follows: (1) In the study area, dense forests with steep slopes and high altitudes, cultivated land, and building land have greater migration resistance, while the gently undulating shrubs, bamboo forests, and grasslands far away from the city have less migration resistance. (2) There are three ecological corridor groups in the study area, mainly composed of shrub and grassland. The ecological corridors identified in this paper are the most likely migration routes of wild Asian elephants in China, and areas with higher simulated current densities reflect a higher probability of Asian elephants passing through. (3) According to the analysis, the ecological pinch points in the study area are 602 km(2 )in total, and woodland and grassland account for 89.2% of the total ecological pinch area. The areas where the pinch points are located have a high probability of Asian elephants passing through and a narrow space. Our findings can provide suggestions and solutions for the current conservation of wild Asian elephant species, alleviate human-elephant conflicts, promote the harmonious coexistence between humans and nature, and provide reference for biological protection and biological reserve planning.

TI  - Validation of MODIS Temperature and Emissivity Products Based on Ground-Based Mid-Wave Hyperspectral Imaging Measurement in the Northwestern Plateau Region of Qinghai, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The climatic fluctuations in northern China exhibit remarkable variability, making it imperative to harness the power of MODIS data for conducting comprehensive investigations into the influences of desertification, desert expansion, and snow and ice melting phenomena. Consequently, the rigorous evaluation of MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and land surface emissivity (LSE) products takes on a momentous role, as this provides an essential means to ensure data accuracy, thereby instilling confidence in the robustness of scientific analyses. In this study, a high-resolution hyperspectral imaging instrument was utilized to measure mid-wave hyperspectral images of grasslands and deserts in the northwest plateau region of Qinghai, China. The measured data were processed in order to remove the effects of sensor noise, atmospheric radiation, transmission attenuation, and scattering caused by sunlight and atmospheric radiation. Inversion of the temperature field and spectral emissivity was performed on the measured data. The inverted data were compared and validated against MODIS land surface temperature and emissivity products. The validation results showed that the absolute errors of emissivity of grassland backgrounds provided by MCD11C1 in the three mid-wave infrared bands (3.66-3.840 & mu;m, 3.929-3.989 & mu;m, and 4.010-4.080 & mu;m) were 0.0376, 0.0191, and 0.0429, with relative errors of 3.9%, 2.1%, and 4.8%, respectively. For desert backgrounds, the absolute errors of emissivity were 0.0057, 0.0458, and 0.0412, with relative errors of 0.4%, 4.9%, and 3.9%, respectively. The relative errors for each channel were all within 5%.

TI  - Potential of Multi-temporal InSAR for Detecting Retrogressive Thaw Slumps: A Case of the Beiluhe Region of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost degradation due to climate warming is severely reducing slope stability by increasing soil pore water pressure and decreasing shear strength. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) are among the most dynamic landforms in permafrost areas, which can result in the instability of landscape and ecosystem. However, the spatiotemporal characteristics of surface deformation of RTSs are still unclear, and the potentials of deformation properties in mapping large-scale RTSs need to be further assessed. In this study, we applied a multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) method to map the spatiotemporal variations in surface deformation of RTSs in the Beiluhe region of the Tibetan Plateau by using 112 scenes of Sentinel-1 SAR data acquired from 2017 to 2021. The deformation rates of RTSs ranged from - 35 to 20 mm/year, and three typical motion stages were inferred by analyzing the deformation variation trend of the headwall of RTSs: stable, abrupt thaw, and linear subsidence. A total of 375 RTSs were identified in the Mati Hill region by combining InSAR-based deformation results with visual interpretation of optical remote sensing images. Among them, 76 RTSs were newly developed, and 26% more than the inventory derived from the optical images alone. This study demonstrated that the combination of InSAR-derived deformation with optical images has significant potential for detecting RTSs with high accuracy and efficiency at the regional scale.

TI  - Effect of Water Vapor Transport on a Typical Rainstorm Process in the Arid Region of Southern Xinjiang: Observations and Numerical Simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are frequent and intensive periods of heavy rain in the arid areas of southern Xinjiang. This study uses a typical rainstorm process in the South Xinjiang Basin to investigate the weather, physical mechanisms, mesoscale characteristics, and income and expenditure characteristics of water vapor sources, analyzing them using the observation data from southern Xinjiang regional automatic stations, ERA5 reanalysis data, multi-source satellite data, and WRF numerical simulation results. The study results show that torrential rain processes occur in the double-body distribution of the South Asian High in the upper troposphere, which is "high in the east and low in the west," with "two ridges and one trough" in the middle layer. The development and movement of the low vortex, the configuration of low-level convergence and high-level divergence, and vertical upward movement provide favorable dynamic conditions for heavy rain. Additionally, the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Aral Sea, the Arabian Sea, and the Bay of Bengal are important water vapor sources for this rainstorm. The water vapor reaches the South Xinjiang Basin along westward, southwest, and eastward paths. It is mainly imported into the South Xinjiang Basin from 500 to 300 hPa on the southern border and 700-500 hPa on the west, north, and east borders, and exported from 500 to 300 hPa on the eastern border. The simulation results show that the change in water vapor content significantly influences the precipitation intensity and range. The water vapor transport at the southern boundary contributes the most precipitation during the rainstorm. As the water vapor in the rainstorm area increases (decreases), the ascending motion is strengthened (weakened), the low-level convergence and high-level divergence are strengthened (weakened), the water vapor transport to the middle and high levels increases (decreases), and the precipitation increases (decreases).

TI  - Transient Deformation Excited by the 2021 M7.4 Maduo (China) Earthquake: Evidence of a Deep Shear Zone
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We use Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data to investigate the mechanisms of coseismic and postseismic deformation due to the 2021 M7.4 Maduo (China) earthquake. We present a refined coseismic slip model constrained by the rupture trace and precisely located aftershocks. The InSAR time series corrected for the atmospheric and decorrelation noise reveal postseismic line of sight displacements up to similar to 0.1 m. The displacements are discontinuous along the fault trace, indicating shallow afterslip and velocity-strengthening friction in the top 2-3 km of the upper crust. The magnitude of shallow afterslip is however insufficient to compensate for the coseismic slip deficit, implying substantial off-fault yielding. The observed surface deformation does not exhibit obvious features that could be attributed to poroelastic effects. We developed a fully coupled model that accounts for both stress-driven creep on a deep localized shear zone and viscoelastic relaxation in the bulk of the lower crust. The mid- to near-field data can be reasonably well explained by deep afterslip and/or non-Maxwellian visco-elasticity. Our results suggest a power-law stress exponent of similar to 4-4.5 assuming a power-law rheology, and transient and steady-state viscosities of 1018 and 1019 Pa s, respectively, assuming a bi-viscous (Burgers) rheology. However, a good fit to the GNSS data cannot be achieved assuming the bulk viscoelastic relaxation alone, and requires a contribution of deep afterlip and/or a localized shear zone extending through much of the lower crust.Plain Language Summary A large earthquake occurred in the north-east Tibetan Plateau (Qinghai Province, China) on 21 May 2021. We use data collected by orbiting satellites to measure subtle (millimeter to centimeter-scale) displacements of the Earth's surface that occurred in 1 year following the Maduo earthquake. The observed rates and spatial patterns of surface displacements are used to infer the mechanisms of stress relaxation and mechanical properties of rocks at depth. We find evidence of continued slip on the fault that produced the Maduo earthquake, both near the surface, and below the seismogenic zone. Our results suggest that major faults that cut through the Tibetan Plateau are associated with deep roots that extend into the lower crust. The observed shallow slip is insufficient to compensate for the near-surface slip deficit that accrued during the earthquake. This suggests that some amount of the near-surface coseismic shear was distributed over a wider zone around the earthquake rupture.

TI  - Better monitoring of forests according to FAO's definitions through map integration: Significance and limitations in the context of global environmental goals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - National monitoring of forests is essential for tracking progress towards various global environmental goals, including those of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the Paris Agreement. Inconsistent national definitions of "forest", however, can complicate the tracking of global progress towards achieving these goals. The FAO's (Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN) definition of "Forest" is well-known and broad enough to be applicable globally, but it is difficult for countries to produce national forest maps according to this definition using only a single source of remote sensing data. Here, we developed an approach to integrate multiple existing land use/land cover (LULC) maps and generate an integrated map of forests and "Other land with tree cover" that is more consistent with FAO definitions. The proposed approach is based on merging thematic information from the global "PALSAR-2 Forest/Non-forest map", a global forest/non-forest map, with that of a national map containing more detailed LULC classes. By applying the map integration approach at the national level in the Philippines as a case study, we identified 5.937 & PLUSMN; 0.217 Mha of "Missing forest" that were not included in the country's national LULC map, mainly forest patches in areas that were predominantly "Brush/shrub", "Grassland", or "Marshland/swamp" lands. We also identified 4.294 & PLUSMN; 0.258 Mha of land cor-responding to FAO's definition of "Other land with tree cover" that were previously unmapped; specifically, patches of tree cover on predominantly agricultural and urban lands. Based on these additional areas of "Forest" and "Other land with tree cover" identified, we further estimated an additional 145,480 GgCO2/year of carbon sinks. Our approach is generalizable enough to potentially be applied in other countries for more standardized forest and ecosystem services monitoring.

TI  - Analysis of urban heat islands with landsat satellite images and GIS in Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan City
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are growing geographically in response to the enormous increase in urban population; consequently, comprehending growth and environmental changes is critical for long-term planning. Urbanization transforms naturally permeable surfaces into impermeable surfaces, causing an increase in urban land surface temperature, leading to the phenomenon known as urban heat islands. The urban heat islands are noticeable across Malaysia's rural communities and villages, particularly in Kuala Lumpur. These effects must be addressed to slow, if not halt, climate change and meet the Paris Agreement's 2030 goal. The study posits an application of thermal remote sensing utilizing a space-borne satellite-based technique to demonstrate urban evolution for urban heat island analysis and its relationship to land surface temperature. The urban heat island (UHI) was analyzed by converting infrared radiation into visible thermal images utilizing thermal imaging from remote sensing techniques. The heat island is validated by reference to the characteristics of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which define the land surface temperature (LST) of distinct locations. Based on the digital information from the satellite, the highest temperature difference between urban and rural regions for a few chosen cities in 2013 varied from 10.8 to 25.5 degrees C, while in 2021, it ranged from 16.1 to 26.73 degrees C, highlighting crucial temperature changes. The results from ANOVA test has substantially strengthened the credibility of the significant temperature changes. Some notable reveals are as follows: The Sungai Batu area, due to its rapid development and industry growth, was more vulnerable to elevated urban heat due to reduced vegetation cover; therefore, higher relative vulnerability. Contrary, the Bukit Ketumbar area, which region lies in the woodland region, experienced the lowest, with urban heat islands reading from 2013 at -0.3044 and 0.0154 in 2021. It shows that despite having urban heat islands increase two-fold from 2013 to 2021, increasing the amount of vegetation coverage is a simple and effective way of reducing the urban heat island effect, as evidenced by the low urban heat islands in the Bukit Ketumbar woodland region. The study findings are critical for advising municipal officials and urban planners to decrease urban heat islands by investing in open green spaces.

TI  - FCD-AttResU-Net: An improved forest change detection in Sentinel-2 satellite images using attention residual U-Net
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest Change Detection (FCD) is a critical component of natural resource monitoring and conservation strate-gies, enabling informed decision-making. Various methods utilizing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) have been developed for detecting and categorizing changes in forest cover using remote sensing (RS) data. One prominent AI-powered approach is the U-Net, a deep learning (DL) architecture famous for its segmentation proficiency. However, the standard U-Net architecture fails to effectively capture intricate spatial dependencies and long-range contextual information present in remote sensing imagery. To address this research gap, we introduce an attention-residual-based novel DL model which leverages the U-Net architecture and Sentinel-2 satellite images to map alterations in forest vegetation cover in the tropical region. Our novel model enhances the U-Net architecture by seamlessly integrating the strengths of the U-Net, harnessing attention mechanisms strategically to amplify crucial features, and leveraging cutting-edge residual connections to facilitate the smooth flow of information and gradient propagation. These meticulous design choices enabled the precise feature extraction, resulting in improved computational performance of the proposed method compared to the Standard U-Net, Deeplabv3+, Deep Res-U-Net, and Attention U-Net. The classification results demonstrate the enhanced efficiency of our model, achieving a Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) of 0.9330 on our test dataset. This performance surpasses the Attention U-Net (0.9146), Standard U-Net (0.9029), Deeplabv3+ (0.9247), and Deep Res-U-Net (0.9282). The comparative analysis of ground truth reproductions unveiled the superior detection capabilities of our model in accurately identifying forest and non-forest polygons, surpassing both the standard U-Net, and the U-Net augmented with attention mechanism, along with other state-of-the-art techniques, thereby highlighting its enhanced efficacy. The model's broad applicability can support forest managers and ecologists in rapidly evaluating the long-term ramifications of infrastructure initiatives, such as roads, on tropical forests, including those in Brunei.

TI  - Exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution in schools in Africa: Current status, knowledge gaps, and a call to action
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Review
AB  - Chronic exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution is linked to adverse human health impacts worldwide, and in children, these include increased respiratory symptoms, reduced cognitive and academic performance, and absences from school. African children are exposed to high levels of air pollution from aging diesel and gasoline second-hand vehicles, dusty roads, trash burning, and solid-fuel combustion for cooking. There is a need for more empirical evidence on the impact of air pollutants on schoolchildren in most countries of Africa. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review on schoolchildren's exposure to indoor and outdoor PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 & mu;m and PM10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 & mu;m) in Africa. Following PRISMA guidelines, our search strategy yielded 2975 records, of which eight peer-reviewed articles met our selection criteria and were considered in the final analysis. We also analyzed satellite data on PM2.5 and PM10 levels in five African regions from 1990 to 2019 and compared schoolchildren's exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 levels in Africa with available data from the rest of the world. The findings showed that schoolchildren in Africa are frequently exposed to PM2.5 and PM10 levels exceeding the recommended World Health Organization air quality guidelines. We conclude with a list of recommendations and strategies to reduce air pollution exposure in African schools. Education can help to produce citizens who are literate in environmental science and policy. More air quality measurements in schools and intervention studies are needed to protect schoolchildren's health and reduce exposure to air pollution in classrooms across Africa.

TI  - Hydrocarbon production induced land deformation over Permian Basin; analysis using persistent scatterer interferometry and numerical modeling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Permian Basin, encompassing Southeastern New Mexico and Western Texas, has been an important source of oil and natural gas for over a century for the United States. With recent advancements in petroleum extraction methods, such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, production has increased exponentially. Such rapid developments, along with the disposal of wastewater back into the subsurface, have caused significant changes in the stress regime of the region's subsurface, resulting in various geohazards including land subsidence. In this work, we used the Sentinel-1C-band SAR dataset acquired between 2016 and 2021 to measure the basin-wide deformation over the entire Permian Basin. We utilized Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique to produce the time-series deformation at millimeter-level accuracy. The average monthly production and injection volumes and well depths over the Delaware Basin in New Mexico were calculated for each well and the impact of the hydrocarbon activities on the deformation was modeled using a distributed point source model from fluid volume and well depth data. The results show that the Permian Basin was deforming at a rate of 3-4 cm/yr., with two large pockets of deformation to the north of the Grisham Fault Zone (GFZ) in the Delaware Basin. The region south of the GFZ shows complex deformation features with linear patterns, indicating the presence of faults hindering fluid flow. Some areas in the Delaware Basin also show an uplift, especially along the Texas side of the border driven by shallow wastewater injection. The Midland Basin is also affected by subsidence with several localized subsidence zones identified in the region. Further, the Midland Basin experienced an increase in intensity and the spatial distribution of the deformation over the last few years. Given both production and injection well data, the modeled deformation results agree with the observed except in two pockets. When only production data is used for the modeling, the modeled deformation shows better agreement with the observed, especially in the interior of New Mexico. The modeling results suggest that the deep wastewater injection has minimal impact on surface deformation in the region. Additionally, it is also possible that the region has undergone inelastic deformation. While we used an elastic model in this preliminary study, a more accurate study requires regional poroelastic modeling to study the interaction between the solid subsurface and fluid hydrocarbons in detail.

TI  - Gridded Precipitation Datasets and Gauge Precipitation Products for Driving Hydrological Models in the Dead Sea Region, Jordan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The consistency of hydrological process modeling depends on reliable parameters and available long-term gauge data, which are frequently restricted within the Dead Sea/Jordan regions. This paper proposes a novel method of utilizing six satellite-based and reanalysis precipitation datasets, which are assessed, evaluated, and corrected, particularly for the cases of ungauged basins and poorly monitored regions, for the first time. Due to natural processes, catchments fluctuate dramatically annually and seasonally, making this a challenge. This variability, which is significantly impacted by topo-geomorphological and climatic variables within the basins themselves, leads to increased uncertainty in models and significant restrictions in terms of runoff forecasting. However, quality evaluations and bias corrections should be conducted before the application of satellite data. Moreover, the hydrological HEC-HMS model was utilized to predict the runoff under different loss methods. Furthermore, this loss method was used with an integrated model that might be efficiently employed when designing hydraulic structures requiring high reliability in predicting peak flows. The models' performance was evaluated using R-squared (R-2), the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). In addition, these statistical metrics were implemented to quantitatively evaluate the data quality based on the observed data collected between 2015 and 2020. The results show that AgERA5 exhibited better agreement with the gauge precipitation data than other reanalysis precipitation and satellite-based datasets. The results demonstrate that the data quality of these products could be affected by observational bias, the spatial scale, and the retrieval method. Moreover, the SC loss method demonstrated satisfactory values for the R-2, RMSE, NSE, and bias compared to the IC and GA loss, indicating its effectiveness in predicting peak flows and designing hydraulic structures that require high reliability. Overall, the study suggests that AgERA5 can provide better precipitation estimates for hydrological modeling in the Dead Sea region in Jordan. Moreover, integrating the SC, IC, and GA loss methods in hydraulic structure design can enhance prediction accuracy and reliability.

TI  - Spatio-temporal prediction and mapping of landslides using MTInSAR-learning logistic regression and weight of evidence modeling in urban environments: a case study for the Buyukcekmece-Kucukcekmece region, Istanbul, Turkiye
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The megacity Istanbul (Turkiye) is rapidly urbanizing with a high population growth. Similar to this, the region of Istanbul Metropole between the Buyukcekmece and Kucukcekmece lakes is being built up to a large extent. Landslides in this region, however, cause major socio-economic damage due to geological, geomorphological, tectonic, climatic, groundwater, and anthropological factors. The aim of the study is to carry out a spatio-temporal susceptibility modeling of landslides using the multi-temporal InSAR (MTInSAR)-learned logistic regression (LR) and weight of evidence (WofE) methods. First, spatial and temporal change information in landslide motions was learned using MTInSAR analysis of ALOS Palsar-1 SAR pictures for this purpose. Then, LR and WofE susceptibility modeling were performed using the previously learned information. The accuracy, model fit, and prediction power of susceptibility modeling and assessment findings were compared and evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), statistical metrics, and spatial percentage proportions. Furthermore, the effects of geospatial predictor variables on the occurrence of landslides were investigated. The obtained findings demonstrated that the applied MTInSAR-based susceptibility modeling approach has a good forecast capability of landslide probability. Landslide susceptibility maps have a high degree of goodness-of-fit at the MTInSAR-learned training dataset and landslide-based validation dataset. The AUC, statistical metrics, and spatial percentage proportions have demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of the suggested technique in urban contexts and landslide-prone locations.

TI  - Uncertainty of Satellite-Derived Glacier Flow Velocities in a Temperate Alpine Setting (Juneau Icefield, Alaska)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cross-correlation of image-pairs derived from both optical and synthetic aperture radar satellite imagery is the most common technique for measuring glacier flow velocity and quantifying the dynamics and discharge of glaciers. While the technique has been shown to be effective on polar ice sheets, the accuracy of satellite-derived velocities in temperate alpine regions is poorly constrained. Flow velocities were measured in situ using an RTK-GPS along four profiles on Taku, Matthes, Vaughan-Lewis, and Llewellyn Glaciers in southeast Alaska from 2016 through 2018. These GNSS-measured velocities were correlated against spatially coincident and contemporaneous satellite-derived velocity datasets, including both versions 1 and 2 of ITS_LIVE and velocities determined by offset tracking of SAR data in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and GAMMA (RETREAT dataset). Significant gaps in velocity maps derived from optical imagery (Landsat/Sentinel-2) were observed and determined to be due to low coherence rather than cloud contamination. Cross-correlation of SAR data (Sentinel-1) in SNAP and RETREAT achieved better accuracy compared to optical, although a strong dichotomy in performance was observed. SAR-derived velocities in the accumulation zone and transient snowline area showed overall poor correlation to GNSS-measured velocities that were likely due to significant shifts in the backscatter amplitude of the homogenous, snow-covered surface, although both SAR-derived SNAP and RETREAT velocities were anomalously accurate where GNSS velocities were below 0.10 m/day along the glacier margins. SNAP and RETREAT achieved the most accurate results in the study in the ablation zone of the Llewellyn Glacier where stable backscatter targets on the glacier surface (crevasses, supraglacial debris) facilitated high coherence in the cross-correlation procedure. SAR data are likely the most suitable for the derivation of satellite-derived velocities on temperate alpine glaciers, particularly in slow-moving and ablation zones, but should be subject to scrutiny for fast-flowing glaciers and those with an active hydrologic surface system.

TI  - Exploring the Impact of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on Temperature Distribution Using Remote Sensing: A Case Study in Kuching City
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Malaysia's location in Southeast Asia exposes it to various weather patterns influenced by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), monsoons, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). To overcome the limitations of previous studies due to insufficient spatial information, this study utilizes remote sensing (RS) data from Landsat and MODIS satellites, along with the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), to analyze the spatial distribution of temperature affected by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This study employs radiometric and atmospheric corrections on remote sensing (RS) data, converting them to surface temperature data. Our analysis reveals a correlation coefficient of 0.73 (MODIS) and 0.71 (Landsat) between the ONI and RS temperature data. During El Nino events, Landsat recorded temperature increases of 0-1.6 & DEG;C, while MODIS showed increases of 2.2-2.8 & DEG;C. The spatial information obtained assists in identifying affected areas and facilitating the implementation of mitigation measures by the government. By utilizing RS data, this research enhances our understanding of the ENSO-temperature relationship, surpassing previous limitations and providing valuable insights into climate dynamics.

TI  - Unveiling the Dynamics of Thermal Characteristics Related to LULC Changes via ANN
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous and unplanned urbanization, combined with negative alterations in land use land cover (LULC), leads to a deterioration of the urban thermal environment and results in various adverse ecological effects. The changes in LULC and thermal characteristics have significant implications for the economy, climate patterns, and environmental sustainability. This study focuses on the Province of Naples in Italy, examining LULC changes and the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) from 1990 to 2022, predicting their distributions for 2030. The main objectives of this research are the investigation of the future seasonal thermal characteristics of the study area by characterizing land surface temperature (LST) through the UTFVI and analyzing LULC dynamics along with their correlation. To achieve this, Landsat 4-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery were utilized. LULC classification was performed using a supervised satellite image classification system, and the predictions were carried out using the cellular automata-artificial neural network (CA-ANN) algorithm. LST was calculated using the radiative transfer equation (RTE), and the same CA-ANN algorithm was employed to predict UTFVI for 2030. To investigate the multi-temporal correlation between LULC and UTFVI, a cross-tabulation technique was employed. The study's findings indicate that between 2022 and 2030, there will be a 9.4% increase in built-up and bare-land areas at the expense of the vegetation class. The strongest UTFVI zone during summer is predicted to remain stable from 2022 to 2030, while winter UTFVI shows substantial fluctuations with a 4.62% decrease in the none UTFVI zone and a corresponding increase in the strongest UTFVI zone for the same period. The results of this study reveal a concerning trend of outward expansion in the built-up area of the Province of Naples, with central northern regions experiencing the highest growth rate, predominantly at the expense of vegetation cover. These predictions emphasize the urgent need for proactive measures to preserve and protect the diminishing vegetation cover, maintaining ecological balance, combating the urban heat island effect, and safeguarding biodiversity in the province.

TI  - Monitoring of Ambient Air Quality Patterns and Assessment of Air Pollutants' Correlation and Effects on Ambient Air Quality of Lahore, Pakistan
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrialization, explosive population growth, anthropogenic activities, and vehicular exhaust deteriorate ambient air quality across the world. The current study aims at assessing the impacts on ambient air quality patterns and their co-relations in one of the world's most polluted cities, i.e., Lahore, Pakistan, during a strict, moderate, and post-COVID-19 period of 28 months (March 2020-June 2022). The purpose of this study is to monitor and analyze the relationship between criteria air pollutants (SO2, particulate matter (PM 10 and 2.5), CO, O-3, and NO2) through a Haz-Scanner 6000 and mobile van (ambient air quality monitoring station) over nine towns in Lahore. The results showed significantly lower concentrations of pollutants during strict lockdown which increased during the moderate and post-COVID-19 lockdown periods. The post-COVID-19 period illustrates a significant increase in the concentrations of SO2, PM10, PM2.5, CO, O-3, and NO2, in a range of 100%, 270%, 500%, 300%, 70%, and 115%, respectively. Major peaks (pollution concentration) for PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 were found during the winter season. Multi-linear regression models show a significant correlation between PM with NO2 and SO2. The ratio of increase in the PM concentration with the increasing NO2 concentration is nearly 2.5 times higher than SO2. A significant positive correlation between a mobile van and Haz-Scanner was observed for CO and NO2 data as well as ground-based observation and satellite data of SO2, NO2, and CO. During the strict COVID-19 lockdowns, the reduction in the vehicular and industrial exhaust significantly improved the air quality of nine towns in Lahore. This research sets the ground for further research on the quantification of total emissions and the impacts of vehicular/industrial emissions on human health.

TI  - Multi-Year Cereal Crop Classification Model in a Semi-Arid Region Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 7-8 Data
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study developed a multi-year classification model for winter cereal in a semi-arid region, the Kairouan area (Tunisia). A random forest classification model was constructed using Sentinel 2 (S2) vegetation indices for a reference agricultural season, 2020/2021. This model was then applied using S2 and Landsat (7 and 8) data for previous seasons from 2011 to 2022 and validated using field observation data. The reference classification model achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 89.3%. Using S2 data resulted in higher overall classification accuracy. Cereal classification exhibited excellent precision ranging from 85.8% to 95.1% when utilizing S2 data, while lower accuracy (41% to 91.8%) was obtained when using only Landsat data. A slight confusion between cereals and cereals growing with olive trees was observed. A second objective was to map cereals as early as possible in the agricultural season. An early cereal classification model demonstrated accurate results in February (four months before harvest), with a precision of 95.2% and an OA of 87.7%. When applied to the entire period, February cereal classification exhibited a precision ranging from 85.1% to 94.2% when utilizing S2 data, while lower accuracy (42.6% to 95.4%) was observed in general with Landsat data. This methodology could be adopted in other cereal regions with similar climates to produce very useful information for the planner, leading to a reduction in fieldwork.

TI  - Proof of evidence of changes in global terrestrial biomes using historic and recent NDVI time series.
T2  - Heliyon
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Climate change affects plant dynamics and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. This study aims to investigate temporal changes in global vegetation coverage and biomes during the past three decades. We compared historic annual NDVI time series (1982, 1983, 1984 and 1985) with recent ones (2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018), captured from NOAA-AVHRR satellite observations. To correct the NDVI time series for missing data and outliers, we applied the Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) algorithm. The NDVI time series were decomposed in their significant amplitude and phase given their periodic fluctuation, except for ever green vegetation. Our findings show that the average NDVI values in most biomes have increased significantly (F-value<0.01) by 0.05 ndvi units over during the past three decades, except in tundra, and deserts and xeric shrublands. The highest rates of change in the harmonic components were observed in the northern hemisphere, mainly above 30° latitude. Worldwide, the mean annual phase reduced by 9° corresponding to a 9 days shift in the beginning of the growing season. Annual phases in the recent time series reduced significantly as compared to the historic time series in the five major global biomes: by 14.1, 14.8, 10.6, 9.5, and 22.8 days in boreal forests/taiga; Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrubs; temperate conifer forests; temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands; and deserts, and xeric shrublands, respectively. In tropical and subtropical biomes, however, changes in the annual phase of vegetation coverage were not statistically significant. The decrease in the level of phases and acceleration of growth and changes in plant phenology indicate the increase in temperature and climate changes of the planet.

TI  - Decoupling of Ecological and Hydrological Drought Conditions in the Limpopo River Basin Inferred from Groundwater Storage and NDVI Anomalies
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts are projected to increase in intensity and frequency with the rise of global mean temperatures. However, not all drought indices equally capture the variety of influences that each hydrologic component has on the duration and magnitude of a period of water deficit. While such indices often agree with one another due to precipitation being the major input, heterogeneous responses caused by groundwater recharge, soil moisture memory, and vegetation dynamics may lead to a decoupling of identifiable drought conditions. As a semi-arid basin, the Limpopo River Basin (LRB) is a severely water-stressed region associated with unique climate patterns that regularly affect hydrological extremes. In this study, we find that vegetation indices show no significant long-term trends (S-statistic 9; p-value 0.779), opposing that of the modeled groundwater anomalies (S-statistic -57; p-value 0.05) in the growing season for a period of 18 years (2004-2022). Although the Mann-Kendall time series statistics for NDVI and drought indices are non-significant when basin-averaged, spatial heterogeneity further reveals that such a decoupling trend between vegetation and groundwater anomalies is indeed significant (p-value < 0.05) in colluvial, low-land aquifers to the southeast, while they remain more coupled in the central-west LRB, where more bedrock aquifers dominate. The conclusions of this study highlight the importance of ecological conditions with respect to water availability and suggest that water management must be informed by local vegetation species, especially in the face of depleting groundwater resources.

TI  - The development of a global LAI and FAPAR product using GCOM-C/ SGLI data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched the Global Change Observation Mission - Climate (GCOM-C) satellite on December 23rd, 2017. As a part of the standard products of JAXA's GCOM-C satellite, we developed the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) product. In comparison to other global LAI and FAPAR products by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS), our products have the following advantageous features: high spatial and temporal resolution (250 m and daily); the retrieval algorithm (look-uptable) is based on "the Forest Light Environmental Simulator" (FLiES) which is a full 3-D canopy radiative transfer model as well as a vegetation landscape model and a global forest landscape map created for this study. The algorithm and ancillary data sets are completely independent of the existing products that are more or less influenced by the MODIS LAI/FAPAR, providing an alternate and independent source of LAI and FAPAR. The dataset has been created since April 2018 and is freely available on JAXA's G-Portal site (https://gportal.jaxa.jp/ gpr). As a result of accuracy assessment with in-situ data, the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) for total LAI and FAPAR were 0.776 and 0.112, respectively. We also compared our LAI and FAPAR estimates with three existing global datasets (PROBA-V/OLCI, MODIS and VIIRS product). The spatial distribution of LAI and FAPAR showed different characteristics among the datasets although their temporal trends were similar. The differences in estimation results among datasets due to differences in the retrieval algorithms, base map (or land cover data) and input data need to be evaluated in the future.

TI  - The role of<i> Actinomyces</i> spp. and related organisms in cervicofacial infections: Pathomechanism, diagnosis and therapeutic aspects
T2  - ANAEROBE
M3  - Article
AB  - Members of the Actinomyces genus and Actinomyces-like organisms (ALOs; namely Actinotignum, Arcanobacterium, Schaalia and Varibaculum) are Gram-positive, non-spore-forming rods that are commensal members of the human oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, female genital tract and skin flora. Cervicofacial actinomycosis or "lumpy jaw syndrome" - the chronic, suppurative granulomatous disease caused by Actinomyces spp. And ALOs - is characterized by an initially slow and unspecific disease-presentation, which often mimics other pathologies, followed by the formation of painful abscesses and severe tissue destruction. Actinomycosis has been described as a rare disease, however, reliable epidemiological data are lacking. In addition, there is increasing awareness regarding the role of Actinomyces spp. in the development of osteoradionecrosis and medication-related osteo-necrosis of the jaw. The aim of this narrative review is to succinctly summarize the current advances regarding the microbiological, clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of cervicofacial actinomycosis, in addition to the roles of Actinomyces species and ALOs as members of the oral microbiota and in dental biofilm, in other dental infections (caries, root canal infection, periapical infection, periodontitis) and osteonecrosis of the jaw, in the context of recent taxonomic changes affecting the genus. Our paper aims to be a blueprint for dentists, other physicians, microbiologists and researchers regarding the multifaceted field of cervicofacial actinomycosis.

TI  - Crop-Planting Area Prediction from Multi-Source Gaofen Satellite Images Using a Novel Deep Learning Model: A Case Study of Yangling District
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Neural network models play an important role in crop extraction based on remote sensing data. However, when dealing with high-dimensional remote sensing data, these models are susceptible to performance degradation. In order to address the challenges associated with multi-source Gaofen satellite data, a novel method is proposed for dimension reduction and crop classification. This method combines the benefits of the stacked autoencoder network for data dimensionality reduction, and the convolutional neural network for classification. By leveraging the advantages of multi-dimensional remote sensing information, and mitigating the impact of dimensionality on the classification accuracy, this method aims to improve the effectiveness of crop classification. The proposed method was applied to the extraction of crop-planting areas in the Yangling Agricultural Demonstration Zone, using multi-temporal spectral data collected from the Gaofen satellites. The results demonstrate that the fusion network, which extracts low-dimensional characteristics, offers advantages in classification accuracy. At the same time, the proposed model is compared with methods such as the decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), hyperspectral image classification based on a convolutional neural network (HICCNN), and a characteristic selection classification method based on a convolutional neural network (CSCNN). The overall accuracy of the proposed method can reach 98.57%, which is 7.95%, 4.69%, 5.68%, 1.21%, and 1.10% higher than the above methods, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed model was verified through experiments. Additionally, the model demonstrates a strong robustness when classifying based on new data. When extracting the crop area of the entire Yangling District, the errors for wheat and corn are only 9.6% and 6.3%, respectively, and the extraction results accurately reflect the actual planting situation of crops.

TI  - Safety of Targeted Axillary Dissection After Neoadjuvant Therapy in Patients With Node-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - JAMA SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE The increasing use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) has led to substantial pathological complete response rates in patients with initially node-positive, early breast cancer, thereby questioning the need for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) is feasible for axillary staging; however, data on oncological safety are scarce.OBJECTIVE To assess 3-year clinical outcomes in patients with node-positive breast cancer who underwent TAD alone or TAD with ALND.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The SenTa study is a prospective registry study and was conducted between January 2017 and October 2018. The registry includes 50 study centers in Germany. Patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer underwent clipping of the most suspicious lymph node (LN) before NST. After NST, the marked LNs and sentinel LNs were excised (TAD) followed by ALND according to the clinician's choice. Patients who did not undergo TAD were excluded. Data analysis was performed in April 2022 after 43 months of follow-up.EXPOSURE TAD alone vs TAD with ALND.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Three-year clinical outcomes were evaluated.RESULTS Of 199 female patients, the median (IQR) age was 52 (45-60) years. A total of 182 patients (91.5%) had 1 to 3 suspicious LNs; 119 received TAD alone and 80 received TAD with ALND. Unadjusted invasive disease-free survival was 82.4%(95% CI, 71.5-89.4) in the TAD with ALND group and 91.2%(95% CI, 84.2-95.1) in the TAD alone group (P =.04); axillary recurrence rates were 1.4%(95% CI, 0-54.8) and 1.8%(95% CI, 0-36.4), respectively (P =.56). Adjusted multivariate Cox regression indicated that TAD alone was not associated with an increased risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.34-2.05; P =.69) or death (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.31-3.70; P =.91). Similar results were obtained for 152 patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer after NST (invasive disease-free survival: HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.27-5.87; P =.77; overall survival: HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.15-3.83; P =.74).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that TAD alone in patients with mostly good clinical response to NST and at least 3 TAD LNs may confer survival outcomes and recurrence rates similar to TAD with ALND.

TI  - Linking shape and growth in young-of-the-year rockfish: an ecological carry-over effect?
T2  - MARINE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological carryover effects occur in any situation in which an individual's previous history and experience (e.g., pelagic larval stages) influence performance in a subsequent state (e.g., benthic or demersal juveniles). Using a combination of geometric morphometrics, otolith microstructure analysis, satellite data, and numerical modeling, we studied the potential carryover effect between environmental conditions, larval growth, and the morphology of rockfish Sebastes oculatus settlers in a fjord-type inlet in southern Chile. We detected two sympatric morphotypes of young-of-the-year rockfish, one with a robust head, taller preoperculum, larger mouth, and frontally inserted pectoral fins, and a second with a slender head, shorter preoperculum and mouth, and distally inserted pectoral fins. Body conditions, otolith size, and age were similar between morphs. When past growth was analyzed, however, different increment width trajectories were found, particularly between 40- and 60-days post-hatch. The combination of otolith growth trajectories from each morph with the spatial heterogeneity of satellite data (seawater temperatures between 9 and 15 & DEG;C, chlorophyll-a between 4 and 10 mg m(-3)), within the inner sea of northern Chilean Patagonia, along with particle tracking and back-tracking hydrodynamical models, suggests that the focal site (i.e., where YOY were collected) was supplied by discrete cohorts of larvae with different patterns of phenotypic variation, which may have traveled through distinct water masses. Therefore, these results suggest ecological carryover effects of the growth history of larval stages on the phenotype of rockfish settlers. The identification of carryover effects at different temporal scales of the life history of demersal fish may lead to a better understanding of the factors affecting variation in individual fitness.

TI  - Outlet glacier flow response to surface melt: based on analysis of a high-resolution satellite data set
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of the Greenland Ice Sheet are affected by surface meltwater reaching the base of the ice, altering ice contact with the bedrock. Lack of understanding of this evolution hampers the ability to predict the effects of increasing temperatures on the Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance. Here we present a unique high-resolution study of ice velocity response to surface melting based on data from a COSMO-SkyMed satellite campaign over Upernavik Isstrom (Northwest Greenland) for two months around the end of the 2014 melt season. We show that the velocity variations, due to both short-term (days) and seasonal variations in surface melt rates, are increasing in relative strength farther from the glacier terminus. Furthermore, we observe how ice dynamic response to frontal retreat, reaching several kilometres inland, can obscure the meltwater-induced velocity change close to the terminus. Future studies should consider the flow velocity dependence on the distance to the terminus, and local geometry, to distinguish subglacial hydrologic system changes from frontal processes and local basal conditions.

TI  - Locoregional Treatment for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Current Status and Future Perspectives
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The locoregional recurrence of breast cancer has been reduced due to the multidisciplinary approach of breast surgery, systemic therapy and radiation. Early detection and better surgical techniques contribute to an improvement in breast cancer outcomes. Purpose of Review: The purpose of this review is to have an overview and summary of the current evidence behind the current approaches to the locoregional treatment of breast cancer and to discuss its future direction. Summary: With improved surgical techniques and the use of a more effective neoadjuvant systemic therapy, including checkpoint inhibitors and dual HER2-directed therapies that lead to a higher frequency of pathologic complete responses and advances in adjuvant radiation therapy, breast cancer patients are experiencing better locoregional control and reduced local and systemic recurrence. De-escalation in surgery has not only improved the quality of life in the majority of breast cancer patients, but also maintained the low risk of recurrence. There are ongoing clinical trials to optimize radiation therapy in breast cancer. More modern radiation technologies are evolving to improve the patient outcome and reduce radiation toxicities.

TI  - Cloud Shadow Detection via Ray Casting with Probability Analysis Refinement Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of aerial images provided by satellites enables continuous monitoring and is a central component of many applications, including precision farming. Nonetheless, this analysis is often impeded by the presence of clouds and cloud shadows, which obscure the underlying region of interest and introduce incorrect values that bias analysis. In this paper, we outline a method for cloud shadow detection, and demonstrate our method using Canadian farmland data obtained from the Sentinel-2 satellite. Our approach builds on other object-based cloud and cloud shadow detection methods that generate preliminary shadow candidate masks which are refined by matching clouds to their respective shadows. We improve on these components by using ray-casting and inverse texture mapping methods to quickly identify cloud shadows, allowing for the immediate removal of false positives during image processing. Leveraging our ray-casting-based approach, we further improve our results by implementing a probability analysis based on the cloud probability layer provided by the Sentinel-2 satellite to account for missed shadow pixels. An evaluation of our method using the average producer (82.82%) and user accuracy (75.55%) both show a marked improvement over the performance of other object-based methods. Methodologically, our work demonstrates how incorporating probability analysis as a post-processing step can improve the generation of shadow masks.

TI  - Estimation of High-Resolution Soil Moisture in Canadian Croplands Using Deep Neural Network with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a crucial hydrologic factor that affects the global cycle of energy, carbon, and water, as well as plant growth and crop yield; therefore, an accurate estimate of SM is important for both the global environment and agriculture. Satellite-based SM data have been provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite missions, but these data are based on passive microwave sensors, which have limited spatial resolution. Thus, detailed observations and analyses of the local distribution of SM are limited. The recent emergence of deep learning techniques, such as rectified linear unit (ReLU) and dropout, has produced effective solutions to complex problems. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to accurately estimate hydrologic factors, such as SM and evapotranspiration, but studies of SM estimates derived from the joint use of DNN and high-resolution satellite data, such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, are lacking. In this study, we aim to estimate high-resolution SM at 30 m resolution, which is important for local-scale SM monitoring in croplands. We used a variety of input data, such as radar factors, optical factors, and vegetation indices, which can be extracted from Sentinel-1 and -2, terrain information (e.g., elevation), and crop information (e.g., cover type and month), and developed an integrated SM model across various crop surfaces by using these input data and DNN (which can learn the complexity and nonlinearity of the various data). The study was performed in the agricultural areas of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Canada, and the in situ SM data for these areas were obtained from the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) Real-time In Situ Soil Monitoring for Agriculture (RISMA) network. We conducted various experiments with several hyperparameters that affected the performance of the DNN-based model and ultimately obtained a high-performing SM model. The optimal SM model had a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.0416 m(3)/m(3) and a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.9226. This model's estimates showed better agreement with in situ SM than the SMAP 9 km SM. The accuracy of the model was high when the daily precipitation was zero or very low and also during the vegetation growth stage. However, its accuracy decreased when precipitation or the vitality of the vegetation were high. This suggests that precipitation affects surface erosion and water layer formation, and vegetation adds complexity to the SM estimate. Nevertheless, the distribution of SM estimated by our model generally reflected the local soil characteristics. This work will aid in drought and flood prevention and mitigation, and serve as a tool for assessing the potential growth of crops according to SM conditions.

TI  - Water quality assessment for organic matter load in urban rivers considering land cover dynamics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The strategy of considering a model that is comparable to the Soil Conservation Service Curve-Number (SCS-CN) method that employs land use maps to estimate the effects of land use on the water quality has considerable potential for application. This paper presents the LUPC (Land Use Pollutant Contribution) Model to estimate water pollution from the watershed land use obtained by satellite image classification (Sentinel-2). It defines that each land use produces a specific pollutant load per unit area, called Pollutant Standard Index (PSI), which undergoes degradation and/or retention until it reaches the river. This decay estimate is based on a Kernel Function. Organic matter (OM) was the pollutant chosen for the definition of the LUPC model and fractions of labile and refractory organic matter (LOM, ROM). The model was applied to the Barigui River basin, and five samples were collected at 12 points along the river. Water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV-Visible absorbance in addition to chemical and biological oxygen demand (COD and BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), and nitrogen and phosphorus fractions were the reference for modeling purposes. The results indicate that organic loads can be estimated from watershed characteristics, despite influence from seasonal influences captured by the PSI values and the basin shape parameter. Considering its versatile response, the LUPC model can be used for integrated water resources and land use planning and management and be indicator of the potential pollution of rivers by OM.

TI  - A GRASS GIS Scripting Framework for Monitoring Changes in the Ephemeral Salt Lakes of Chotts Melrhir and Merouane, Algeria
T2  - APPLIED SYSTEM INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated classification of satellite images is a challenging task that enables the use of remote sensing data for environmental modeling of Earth's landscapes. In this document, we implement a GRASS GIS-based framework for discriminating land cover types to identify changes in the endorheic basins of the ephemeral salt lakes Chott Melrhir and Chott Merouane, Algeria; we employ embedded algorithms for image processing. This study presents a dataset of the nine Landsat 8-9 OLI/TIRS satellite images obtained from the USGS for a 9-year period, from 2014 to 2022. The images were analyzed to detect changes in water levels in ephemeral lakes that experience temporal fluctuations; these lakes are dry most of the time and are fed with water during rainy periods. The unsupervised classification of images was performed using GRASS GIS algorithms through several modules: 'i.cluster' was used to generate image classes; 'i.maxlik' was used for classification using the maximal likelihood discriminant analysis, and auxiliary modules, such as 'i.group', 'r.support', 'r.import', etc., were used. This document includes technical descriptions of the scripts used for image processing with detailed comments on the functionalities of the GRASS GIS modules. The results include the identified variations in the ephemeral salt lakes within the Algerian part of the Sahara over a 9-year period (2014-2022), using a time series of Landsat OLI/TIRS multispectral images that were classified using GRASS GIS. The main strengths of the GRASS GIS framework are the high speed, accuracy, and effectiveness of the programming codes for image processing in environmental monitoring. The presented GitHub repository, which contains scripts used for the satellite image analysis, serves as a reference for the interpretation of remote sensing data for the environmental monitoring of arid and semi-arid areas of Africa.

TI  - External validation in an Australian population of the EORTC-DeCOG nomogram predicting recurrence, distant metastasis and overall mortality in melanoma patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Calculating an accurate prognosis for melanoma patients who have a positive sentinel node (SN) biopsy is important both for them and for their treating doctors to guide decision-making, particularly when adjuvant systemic therapy is being considered. The recently published EORTC-DeCOG nomograms aim to provide this via an online portal that predicts 5-year rates for recurrence, distant metastasis and overall mortality. The present study provides external validation of these nomograms.Methods/Materials: De-identified data from patients with a positive SN biopsy between 2003 and 2015 were extracted from the prospectively maintained Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA) research database. ROC-curves with C-statistics, regression co-efficients and Decision Curve Net Benefit analyses were performed using the integrated private validation portal on the nomograms' hosting platform (Evidencio).Results: Complete data were available for 352 patients. The respective C-statistics for re-currence, distant metastasis and overall mortality nomogram validations were 0.68, 0.69 and 0.66.Conclusion: The performance of the nomograms in predicting recurrence and distant me-tastasis was similar in the MIA and the development populations, suggesting that they are robust. However, the overall mortality nomogram performance was significantly poorer in the MIA population (C-statistic 0.66) than in the original EORTC-DeCOG derivation cohort (C-statistic 0.70) and may therefore be less reliable for clinical use.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Deep Learning Approach to Increase the Value of Satellite Data for PM<sub>2.5</sub> Monitoring in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Limitations in the current capability of monitoring PM2.5 adversely impact air quality management and health risk assessment of PM2.5 exposure. Commonly, ground-based monitoring networks are established to measure the PM2.5 concentrations in highly populated regions and protected areas such as national parks, yet large gaps exist in spatial coverage. Satellite-derived aerosol optical properties serve to complement the missing spatial information of ground-based monitoring networks. However, satellite remote sensing AODs are hampered under cloudy/hazy conditions or during nighttime. Here we strive to overcome the long-standing restriction that surface PM2.5 cannot be obtained with satellite remote sensing under cloudy/hazy conditions or during nighttime. In this work, we introduce a deep spatiotemporal neural network (ST-NN) and demonstrate that it can artfully fill these observational gaps. We quantified the quantitative impact of input variables on the results using sensitivity and visual analysis of the model. This technique provides ground-level PM2.5 concentrations with a high spatial resolution (0.01 & DEG;) and 24-h temporal coverage, hour-by-hour, complete coverage. In central and eastern China, the 10-fold cross-validation results show that R-2 is between 0.8 and 0.9, and RMSE is between 6 and 26 (& mu;g m(-3)). The relative error varies in different concentration ranges and is generally less than 20%. Better constrained spatiotemporal distributions of PM2.5 concentrations will contribute to improving health effects studies, atmospheric emission estimates, and air quality predictions.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Forested Landslides: A Case Study in Jiuzhaigou County, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide detection and distribution mapping are essential components of geohazard prevention. For the extremely difficult problem of automatic forested landslide detection, airborne remote sensing technologies, such as LiDAR and optical cameras, can obtain more accurate landslide monitoring data. In practice, however, airborne LiDAR data and optical images are treated independently. The complementary information of the remote sensing data from multiple sources has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this deficiency, we investigate how to use LiDAR data and optical images together to develop an automatic detection model for forested landslide detection. First, a new dataset for detecting forested landslides in the Jiuzhaigou earthquake region is compiled. LiDAR-derived DEM and hillshade maps are used to mitigate the influence of forest cover on the detection of forested landslides. Second, a new deep learning model called DemDet is proposed for the automatic detection of forested landslides. In the feature extraction component of DemDet, a self-supervised learning module is proposed for extracting geometric features from LiDAR-derived DEM. Additionally, a transformer-based deep neural network is proposed for identifying landslides from hillshade maps and optical images. In the data fusion component of DemDet, an attention-based neural network is proposed to combine DEM, hillshade, and optical images. DemDet is able to extract key features from hillshade images, optical images, and DEM, as demonstrated by experimental results on the proposed dataset. In comparison to ResUNet, LandsNet, HRNet, MLP, and SegFormer, DemDet obtains the highest mean accuracy, mIoU, and F1 values, namely 0.95, 0.67, and 0.777. DemDet is therefore capable of autonomously identifying the forest-covered landslides in the Jiuzhaigou earthquake zone. The results of landslide detection mapping reveal that slopes along roads and seismogenic faults are the most crucial areas requiring geohazard prevention.

TI  - The Stability Analysis of Mt. Gongga Glaciers Affected by the 2022 Luding M<sub>S</sub> 6.8 Earthquake Based on LuTan-1 and Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 5 September 2022, an M-S 6.8 earthquake occurred in Luding county, Sichuan province, China, with the epicenter located approximately 20 km from the main peak of Mount (Mt.) Gongga. The dynamic situation of Mt. Gongga glaciers has received widespread attention. In this study, Mt. Gongga was selected as the study area, and L-band LuTan-1 (LT-1) satellite data were used for differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) processing to obtain the coseismic landform in Luding. Based on Sentinel-1A images, pixel offset tracking (POT) technology was used to obtain the surface movement velocities of the glaciers before, during, and after the earthquake. The results showed that the overall preseismic movement of the glaciers was fast in the area where the ice cascade of the Hailuogou Glacier reached a maximum average deformation rate of 0.94 m/d. Moreover, time-series monitoring of the postseismic glaciers showed that the surface flow velocities of some glaciers in the study area increased after the earthquake. The flow velocity at the main peak of Mt. Gongga and the tongue of the Mozigou Glacier accelerated for a period after the earthquake. The study concluded that the earthquake was one of the direct causes of the increase in glacier flow velocity, which returned to a stable state more than 70 days after the earthquake. The relevant monitoring results and research data can provide a reference for earthquake-triggered glacial hazards and indicate the effectiveness of LT-1 in identifying and monitoring geological hazards.

TI  - Long-Term Ecological Environment Quality Evaluation and Its Driving Mechanism in Luoyang City
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality of the ecological environment determines human well-being, and the degree of ecological environment quality has a significant impact on regional sustainable development. Currently, the assessment content of ecological environment quality in Luoyang is relatively single-indicator-based and is insufficient to comprehensively reflect the changes in the ecological environment quality of Luoyang city. Therefore, the study aims to use the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI), a comprehensive evaluation model, with Landsat remote sensing images and statistical yearbooks as the data sources, to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamic changes in the ecological environment quality of Luoyang city from 2002 to 2022 through trend analysis and mutation testing; the study employs geographical detectors to analyze the driving factors about the changes in ecological environment quality. The study found that: (1) the average RSEI value in Luoyang city has increased by 0.102 in the past 20 years, indicating an overall improvement in the ecological environment quality of Luoyang city. (2) The northern region of the study area has lower RSEI values, while the southern region has better ecological environment quality, which corresponds to the fact that the northern part of Luoyang city has intensive human activities, while the southern part is characterized by higher vegetation coverage in mountainous areas. (3) The proportion of areas with medium and above ecological environment quality grades have increased from 47.2% to 67.5%, indicating a positive trend in future ecological environment quality changes. (4) The population change was the strongest single factor influencing the ecological environment quality change in Luoyang city. The interaction between temperature and GDP was relatively the strongest. The current ecological environment status in the study area is the result of the combined effects of natural and anthropogenic factors. The research conclusions contribute to improving regional ecological environment quality and are of great significance for the regional ecological environment planning and the achievement of sustainable development goals.

TI  - A method to estimate leaf area index from VIIRS surface reflectance using deep transfer learning
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) retrieval methods based on traditional neural networks require a large number of training samples constructed from remote sensing data or simulation data using radiative transfer models. Furthermore, the training samples for the neural networks are sensor-specific. Therefore, the existing training samples for a sensor cannot be directly applied to estimate LAI values from remote sensing data acquired by another sensor. In addition, a large number of currently available LAI ground measurements (considered as "true values") are not used to construct training datasets of the neural networks to further improve the accuracy of the retrieved LAI values. In this study, a method based on deep transfer learning is proposed to retrieve LAI values from the Visual Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) surface reflectance data based on the existing training dataset established from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data and the fused LAI values of the MODIS and Carbon cYcle and Change in Land Observational Products from an Ensemble of Satellites (CYCLOPES) LAI products. A transferable model is constructed by using a deep belief network (DBN) composed of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a back propagation (BP) network. The DBN is pretrained by the existing training dataset, and the hyperparameters of the DBN are determined by using a Bayesian optimization algorithm. Then, the RBM parameters of the pretrained DBN are frozen, and the BP parameters are fine-tuned by a small sample dataset composed of the LAI ground mea-surements and the corresponding VIIRS surface reflectance data. Finally, the VIIRS surface reflectance data are inputted into the fine-tuned DBN to estimate LAI values. The retrieved LAI values were cross-compared with the MODIS and VIIRS LAI products and were directly evaluated with LAI ground measurements at the Ground-Based Observations for Validation (GBOV) and Implementing Multi-Scale Agricultural Indicators Exploiting Sentinels (IMAGINES) sites. The results demonstrate that the retrieved LAI values at these sites with different vegetation types show reasonable seasonality and the spatial distributions of the retrieved LAI values are similar to those of the MODIS and VIIRS LAI products. The direct validation results show that the LAI values retrieved by the DBN with fine-tuned BP parameters (RMSE over the USA: 0.48, RMSE over Europe: 0.71) are obviously superior to the LAI values retrieved by the DBN without fine-tuned BP parameters (RMSE over the USA: 0.70, RMSE over Europe: 0.98). This study demonstrates that deep transfer learning can effectively retrieve LAI values from the VIIRS surface reflectance data with limited LAI ground measurement samples and the existing training dataset.

TI  - Spatial Distribution and Driving Mechanisms of Rural Settlements in the Shiyang River Basin, Western China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of the rural revitalization strategy, an accurate grasp of the spatial differentiation characteristics and influencing factors of rural settlements in underdeveloped arid inland river basins is urgently required. Taking the Shiyang River Basin as an example, rural settlements from 2000 to 2019 were examined via visual interpretation using satellite remote sensing data and official statistical data. Following the logic of "state characteristics-evolutionary patterns-influence factors-layout optimization", the average nearest index, the gravity-center migration model, spatial statistical analysis, and other methods were used in combination with GIS. The spatiotemporal pattern evolution characteristics of rural settlements in the past 20 years were analyzed. The results revealed the following: (1) The distribution pattern of rural settlements in the study area is sheet-like and strip-shaped. The projects in the southeast are mostly distributed in a patchy pattern with high density, while the characteristics in the west and north are exactly opposite. The objects in the south are distributed in an alluvial area of rivers, while settlements in the north are located in an oasis area. (2) From 2000 to 2019, the scale of rural settlements in the Shiyang River Basin, where there is a simultaneous occurrence of newly-built and disappearing phenomena, shows an expansion trend that first increased quickly and then slowed down. Spatially, rural settlements in the basin show a clustering trend toward the southwest. (3) The distribution characteristics of rural settlements are close to water and roads, and they are greatly influenced by urban-rural integration and ecological migration. The results will provide a scientific basis for accelerating the modernization of rural areas and the construction of new rural areas according to local conditions.

TI  - Improved On-Orbit MTF Measurement Method Based on Point Source Arrays
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The modulation transfer function (MTF) is a key characteristic used to assess the performance of optical remote sensing satellite sensors. MTF detection can directly measure a sensor's two-dimensional (2D) point spread function (PSF); therefore, it has been applied to various high-resolution remote sensing satellites (e.g., Pleiades) using point sources. However, current point source methods mainly use 2D Gaussian functions to fit the discrete digital number (DN) of the point source on the image to extract the center of the point source and fit the PSF after encrypting multiple point sources; thus, noise robustness is poor and measurement accuracy varies widely. In this study, we developed a noise-resistant on-orbit MTF detection method based on the object space constraint among point source arrays. Utilizing object space constraint relationships among points in a point source array, a homography transformation model was established, enabling accurate extraction of sub-pixel coordinates for each point source response. Subsequently, aligning the luminosity distribution of all point sources concerning a reference point source, the encrypted PSF was obtained and then fitted to obtain the MTF. To validate the method, Gaofen-2 (GF-2) satellite images were used to conduct an in-orbit imaging experiment on the point source array of the Chinese Zhongwei remote sensing satellite calibration site. Compared with the Gaussian model methods, the proposed method yielded more accurate peak positions for each point source. Standard deviations of peak position constant ratios in along- and cross-track directions improved by 2.8 and 4.8 times, respectively. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the collinearity test results increased by 92%, and the noise resistance of the MTF curve improved by two times. Dynamic MTF values at the Nyquist frequency for the GF-2 panchromatic band in along- and cross-track directions were 0.0476 and 0.0705, respectively, and MTF values in different directions were well distinguished.

TI  - Using the InVEST-PLUS Model to Predict and Analyze the Pattern of Ecosystem Carbon storage in Liaoning Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of carbon storage, balancing land development and utilization with ecological protection, and promoting urban low-carbon sustainable development are important topics under China's "dual carbon strategy" (Carbon emissions stabilize and harmonize with natural carbon absorption). However, existing research has paid little attention to the impact of land use changes under different spatial policies on the provincial-scale ecosystem carbon storage. In this study, we established a carbon density database for Liaoning Province and obtained the spatial and temporal distribution of carbon storage over the past 20 years. Then, based on 16 driving factors and multiple spatial policies in Liaoning Province, we predicted land use and land cover changes (LUCC) under three scenarios for 2050 and analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and response mechanisms of carbon storage under different scenarios. The results showed that (1) LUCC directly affected carbon storage, with a 35.61% increase in construction land and a decrease in carbon storage of 0.51 Tg over the 20-year period. (2) From 2020 to 2050, the carbon storage varied significantly among the natural trend scenario (NTS), ecological restoration scenario (ERS), and economic priority scenario (EPS), with values of 2112.05 Tg, 2164.40 Tg, and 2105.90 Tg, respectively. Carbon storage in the ecological restoration scenario exhibited positive growth, mainly due to a substantial increase in forest area. (3) The spatial pattern of carbon storage in Liaoning Province was characterized by "low in the center, high in the east, and balanced in the west". Therefore, Liaoning Province can consider rationally formulating and strictly implementing the spatial policy of ecological protection in the future land planning so as to control the disorderly growth of construction land, realize the growth of ecological land area, effectively enhance carbon storage, and ensure the realization of the goal of "dual carbon strategy".

TI  - Advances in satellite remote sensing monitoring of Antarctic Ice Sheet mass changes
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Review
AB  - The Antarctic Ice Sheet's mass balance has a significant impact on global sea level change. Improving the precision of mass balance estimation over the entire Antarctic Ice Sheet is critical for predicting global sea level rise. The advancement of satellite technology, particularly polar observation satellites, will help us understand and protect the ice sheet. Studying the Antarctic Ice Sheet's response to the global climate change and its feedback mechanism is also critical for increasing the scientific understanding of Antarctica. This review paper summarizes the development of various Antarctic monitoring satellites as well as remote sensing data products that are currently available. At the same time, it discusses techniques for satellite monitoring and estimation methods for mass balance in Antarctica. Finally, recommendations for satellite observation techniques and methodology development are provided to improve the capability of long-term monitoring and prediction of ice sheet changes.

TI  - Study on the Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Urban Vegetation Phenology by Local Climate Zone and Urban-Rural Gradient Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding variations in the temporal and spatial distribution of vegetation phenology is essential for adapting to and mitigating future climate change and urbanization. However, there have been limited vegetation phenology studies within small-scale areas such as urban environments over the past decades. Therefore, the present study focuses on Jinan city, Shandong Province, China as the study area and employs a more refined local climate zone (LCZ) approach to investigate spatial and temporal variations in vegetation phenology. The three phenological indicators used in this study from 2007 to 2018, namely, the start of growing season (SOS), the end of growing season (EOS), and the length of growing season (LOS), were provided by MODIS satellite data. The SOS, EOS, and LOS were superimposed on the LCZ and urban-rural gradient to analyze the changes in vegetation phenology, and the applicability of these two analysis methods in the study of urban vegetation phenology was compared by the honest significant difference test. We found that the SOS, EOS, and LOS of vegetation in the study area generally showed an advance, delay, and extension trend, respectively. The means of the SOS and EOS along different LCZ types varied noticeably more than those along urban-rural gradients. In 2016, 77.5%, 80.0%, and 75.8% of LCZ pairs indicated statistically significant differences for SOS, EOS, and LOS, respectively. This study provides a new perspective for the study of urban vegetation phenology which can help in management of urban-scale environments, identification of areas rich in biodiversity, and conservation and restoration of biodiversity in urban areas.

TI  - First Look of Surface Vegetation from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard <i>Fengyun-4B</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - For many years, the status of surface vegetation has been monitored by using polar-orbiting satellite imagers such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, limited availability of clear-sky samples makes the derived vegetation index dependent on multiple days of observations. High-frequency observations from the geostationary Fengyun (FY) satellites can significantly reduce the influence of clouds on the synthesis of terrestrial normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In this study, we derived the land surface vegetation index based on observational data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the FY-4B geostationary satellite. First, the AGRI reflectance of visible band and near-infrared band is corrected to the land surface reflectance by the 6S radiative transfer model. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model is then used to normalize the AGRI surface reflectance at different observation angles and solar geometries, and an angle -independent reflectance is derived. The AGRI surface reflectance is further corrected to the MODIS levels according to the AGRI spectral response function (SRF). Finally, the daily AGRI data are used to synthesize the surface vegetation index. It is shown that the spatial distribution of NDVI images retrieved by single-day AGRI is consistent with that of 16-day MODIS data. At the same time, the dynamic range of the revised NDVI is closer to that of MODIS.

TI  - An Approach for Monitoring Shallow Surface Outcrop Mining Activities Based on Multisource Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring mine activities can help management track the status of mineral resource exploration and mine rehabilitation. It is crucial to the sustainable development of the mining industry and the protection of the geological environment in mining areas. To monitor the mining activities of shallow surface outcrops in the arid and semi-arid regions of northwest China, this paper proposes a remote sensing monitoring approach of mining activities based on deep learning and integrated interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique. This approach uses the DeepLabV3-ResNet model to identify and extract the spatial location of the mine patches and then uses object-oriented analysis and spatial analysis methods to optimize the mine patch boundaries. SBAS-InSAR technique is used to obtain the time-series deformation information of the mine patches and is combined with the multi-temporal optical imagery to analyze the mining activities in the study area. The proposed approach has a recognition accuracy of 95.80% for the identification and extraction of mine patches, with an F1-score of 0.727 at the pixel level, and the average area similarity for all patches is 0.78 at the object-oriented level. The proposed approach possesses the capability to analyze mining activities, indicating promising prospects for engineering applications. It provides a reference for monitoring mining activities using multisource satellite remote sensing.

TI  - Validation of the Ocean Wave Spectrum from the Remote Sensing Data of the Chinese-French Oceanography Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the launch of CFOSAT on 29 October 2018, more than three years of observational data of ocean wave spectra with a frequency range of 0.02-0.26 Hz and a horizontal resolution of 70-90 km have been obtained. This study compares wave spectra retrieved from 6 degrees, 8 degrees, and 10 degrees incidence angle beams and their combination provided by CFOSAT with corresponding data from 98 buoys from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) in order to validate the remote sensing wave spectral accuracy from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022. The correlation coefficient of frequency spectra (Rs) between CFOSAT and buoys is used to represent the accuracy of the spectral form; the root mean square (RMS) of the significant wave height (SWH) is used to represent the accuracy of the total energy. The results indicate that CFOSAT can retrieve reliable wave frequency spectral forms with a high significant wave height (Rs > 0.8 when SWH > 3 m; RS < 0.4 when SWH < 1 m). The low-frequency noise in the swell part causes the main error, the RMS of the swell height is 0.4 m whereas the RMS of wind wave height is 0.24 m, and the mask filter used for spectral partitioned provided by CFOSAT can eliminate the low-frequency noise and improve the Rs of 10 degrees beam wave spectra from 0.59 to 0.64. For the wind wave spectra, the correct spectra have been achieved and the mask filter cannot improve the accuracy. The wave spectra from the 10 degrees beam without mask filtering provides the best estimation of total energy, the RMS of SWH is 0.23 m, after the mask filtering, the best estimation of spectral form can be achieved, the Rs is 0.64. The novelty of this study is that we found the strong correlation between SWH and Rs, where the scatter of SWH and Rs can be fitted as: Rs =1 - exp(-0.89.SWH + 0.20); according to this approximate formula, we can estimate the reliability of wave spectra provided by CFOSAT according to the SWH in any region, which is important for wave spectral assimilation in the numerical model. The validation of wave direction indicates that the accuracy of wave spectra in the directional component is poor; further research is needed on the causes of directional errors. Generally, this study is not only an evaluation of the quality of the CFOSAT spectral data, but also an important reference for a series of research requiring the CFOSAT spectral data.

TI  - Mapping Irrigated Croplands from Sentinel-2 Images Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial distribution of irrigated croplands is crucial for food security and water use. To map land cover classes with high-spatial-resolution images, it is necessary to analyze the semantic information of target objects in addition to the spectral or spatial-spectral information of local pixels. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) can characterize the semantic features of objects adaptively. This study uses DCNNs to extract irrigated croplands from Sentinel-2 images in the states of Washington and California in the United States. We integrated the DCNNs of 101 layers, discarded pooling layers, and employed dilation convolution to preserve location information; these are models which were used based on fully convolutional network (FCN) architectures. The findings indicated that irrigated croplands may be effectively detected at various phases of crop growth in the fields. A quantitative analysis of the trained models revealed that the three models in the two states had the lowest values of Intersection over Union (IoU) and Kappa, i.e., 0.88 and 0.91, respectively. The deep models' temporal portability across different years was acceptable. The lowest values of recall and OA (overall accuracy) from 2018 to 2021 were 0.91 and 0.87, respectively. In Washington, the lowest OA value from 10 to 300 m resolution was 0.76. This study demonstrates the potential of FCNs + DCNNs approaches for mapping irrigated croplands across large regions, providing a solution for irrigation mapping. The spatial resolution portability of deep models could be improved further by designing model architectures.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Evolutionary Characteristics of Vegetation in Different Geomorphic Zones of Loess Plateau and Its Driving Factor Analysis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on MODIS NDVI and a meteorological dataset, this study analyzed the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of vegetation cover in different geomorphic zones of Loess Plateau (LP) from 2000 to 2020 with trend analysis, partial correlation, residual analysis and the CA-Markov method and discussed the driving factors. The research results show that: (1) There are spatial differences in vegetation coverage in different geomorphic regions. The Loess Hills and Forests zone (LF) exhibits the highest coverage, with a multi-year average of 86.64%, and the Arid Grassland (AG) has the poorest vegetation with only 8.53%. Overall, there has been significant improvement in vegetation coverage over the past two decades, although certain geomorphic zones, particularly the Highland Steppe zone (HS) and Alluvial Plains zone (AP), show signs of degradation. (2) Relative humidity has the greatest impact on vegetation among the three climate factors, i.e., relative humidity, precipitation and temperature. Relative humidity predominantly promotes vegetation in all geomorphic zones. Temperature generally inhibits vegetation growth, except in the Wind Sandy zone (WA) and AG. The impact of precipitation on vegetation depends on the region. A lag effect is observed, with temperature and humidity showing a one-month lag and precipitation showing a two-month lag on vegetation response. (3) Human activities play a crucial role in promoting vegetation, particularly in the WA zone, in which the percentage of area where human activities contribute to vegetation has changed from 13.80% to 86.85%, an increase of 73.05%, while the HS experiences an inhibitory effect due to overgrazing and water resource overutilization. Similarly, the AP zone's vegetation growth is hindered by urban development and land use changes. (4) Land use change significantly impacts vegetation dynamics on the LP. Over the past two decades, the area of forest lawn increased by 122,800 km(2), which is 1.5 times more than the area of reduction. However, conversion to building land has hindered vegetation growth in certain regions. A comprehensive strategy is required to conserve land resources and promote healthy vegetation growth on the LP.

TI  - Exploring Relationships between Boltzmann Entropy of Images and Building Classification Accuracy in Land Cover Mapping
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images are important data sources for land cover mapping. As one of the most important artificial features in remote sensing images, buildings play a critical role in many applications, such as population estimation and urban planning. Classifying buildings quickly and accurately ensures the reliability of the above applications. It is known that the classification accuracy of buildings (usually indicated by a comprehensive index called F1) is greatly affected by image quality.However, how image quality affects building classification accuracy is still unclear. In this study, Boltzmann entropy (an index considering both compositional and configurational information, simply called BE) is employed to describe image quality, and the potential relationships between BE and F1 are explored based on images from two open-source building datasets (i.e., the WHU and Inria datasets) in three cities (i.e., Christchurch, Chicago and Austin). Experimental results show that (1) F1 fluctuates greatly in images where building proportions are small (especially in images with building proportions smaller than 1%) and (2) BE has a negative relationship with F1 (i.e., when BE becomes larger, F1 tends to become smaller). The negative relationships are confirmed using Spearman correlation coefficients (SCCs) and various confidence intervals via bootstrapping (i.e., a nonparametric statistical method). Such discoveries are helpful in deepening our understanding of how image quality affects building classification accuracy.

TI  - Improving Nitrogen Status Diagnosis and Recommendation of Maize Using UAV Remote Sensing Data
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective in-season crop nitrogen (N) status diagnosis is important for precision crop N management, and remote sensing using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is one efficient means of conducting crop N nutrient diagnosis. Here, field experiments were conducted with six N levels and six maize hybrids to determine the nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) and yield, and to diagnose the N status of the hybrids combined with multi-spectral data. The NNI threshold values varied with hybrids and years, ranging from 0.99 to 1.17 in 2018 and 0.60 to 0.71 in 2019. A proper agronomic optimal N rate (AONR) was constructed and confirmed based on the measured NNI and yield. The NNI (R-2 = 0.64-0.79) and grain yield (R-2 = 0.70-0.73) were predicted well across hybrids using a random forest model with spectral, structural, and textural data (UAV). The AONRs calculated using the predicted NNI and yield were significantly correlated with the measured NNI (R-2 = 0.70 and 0.71 in 2018 and 2019, respectively) and yield (R-2 = 0.68 and 0.54 in 2018 and 2019, respectively). It is concluded that data fusion can improve in-season N status diagnosis for different maize hybrids compared to using only spectral data.

T2  - BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between clawless body mass (CBM) and total mercury concentration (THg) in male and female crayfish captured from three different sites in the Columbia River Basin: the Spokane River, Boise River and Hangman Creek. It was found that the allometric relationships for THg in male and female crayfish did not differ from one another at any of the three locations (Spokane River: ANCOVA, F-1,F-49 = 0.001, p = 0.63; Hangman Creek: ANCOVA, F-1,F-73 = 0.007, p = 0.93; Boise River: ANCOVA, F-1,F-38 = 0.02, p = 0.88. Furthermore, the slopes of the CBM and THg regression lines were not significantly different from one site to the next (ANCOVA, F-2,F-166 = 1.5 p = 0.24), despite considerable differences in mean mass-adjusted THg across locations (Spokane River: 26.8 & PLUSMN; 2.6; Hangman Creek: 75.2 & PLUSMN; 2.1; Boise River: 99.0 & PLUSMN; 2.9). For signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) from the Columbia River Basin, size and sex standardization can be accomplished with a single linear relationship.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node imaging is important for breast tumor staging and prediction of postoperative metastasis. However, clinical sentinel lymph node imaging has limitations such as low specificity, low contrast, and short retention time. The combination of bio-conjugates chemistry and luminescence technology may achieve the specific targeting effect. In this research, we designed a dual-targeting composite nanoprobe (similar to 50 nm) using a metal-organic framework (MOF) as carrier, loaded with lanthanide and ICG, and combined with hyaluronic acid and folic acid to detect metastatic lymph nodes. The coupled hyaluronic acid and folic acid can target to the tumor cells and dentritic cells with a dual-targeting effect. The FA-HA/ZIF-8@ICG nanoprobes can accumulate rapidly in sentinel lymph node with a stronger luminescence intensity (1.6 times) than that of normal popliteal lymph nodes in vivo, thus distinguish metastatic sentinel lymph node from normal effectively. Furthermore, due to the MOF carrier, the integrated lanthanide and near-infrared dye by transferring the absorbed excitation energy from ICG to Nd3+ can enhance the signal-to-background ratio of NIR II imaging and have long retention time in vivo imaging. Finally, the FA-HA/ICG@Ln@ZIF-8 nanoplatform increased the penetration depth and contrast of imaging, prolonged the retention time, and achieved the sentinel lymph nodes surgical resection. This study has important implications for lymph node imaging and surgical navigation.

TI  - Air Temperature Monitoring over Low Latitude Rice Planting Areas: Combining Remote Sensing, Model Assimilation, and Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature (Ta) is essential for studying surface processes and human activities, particularly agricultural cultivation, which is strongly influenced by temperature. Remote sensing techniques that integrate multi-source data can estimate Ta with a high degree of accuracy, overcoming the shortcomings of traditional measurements due to spatial heterogeneity. Based on in situ measurements in Guangdong Province from 2012 to 2018, this study applied three machine learning (ML) models and fused multi-source datasets to evaluate the performance of four data combinations in Ta estimation. Correlations of covariates were compared, focusing on rice planting areas (RA). The results showed that (1) The fusion of multi-source data improved the accuracy of model estimations, where the best performance was achieved by the random forest (RF) model combined with the ERA5 combination, with the highest R-2 reaching 0.956, the MAE value of 0.996 & DEG;C, and the RMSE of 1.365 & DEG;C; (2) total precipitation (TP), wind speed (WD), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land surface temperature (LST) were significant covariates for long-term Ta estimations; (3) Rice planting improved the model performance in estimating Ta, and model accuracy decreased during the crop rotation in summer. This study provides a reference for the selection of temperature estimation models and covariate datasets. It offers a case for subsequent ML studies on remote sensing of temperatures over agricultural areas and the impact of agricultural cultivation on global warming.

TI  - Semantic Segmentation of China's Coastal Wetlands Based on Sentinel-2 and Segformer
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Concerning the ever-changing wetland environment, the efficient extraction of wetland information holds great significance for the research and management of wetland ecosystems. China's vast coastal wetlands possess rich and diverse geographical features. This study employs the SegFormer model and Sentinel-2 data to conduct a wetland classification study for coastal wetlands in Yancheng, Jiangsu, China. After preprocessing the Sentinel data, nine classification objects (construction land, Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), Suaeda salsa (S. salsa), Phragmites australis (P. australis), farmland, river system, aquaculture and tidal falt) were identified based on the previous literature and remote sensing images. Moreover, mAcc, mIoU, aAcc, Precision, Recall and F-1 score were chosen as evaluation indicators. This study explores the potential and effectiveness of multiple methods, including data image processing, machine learning and deep learning. The results indicate that SegFormer is the best model for wetland classification, efficiently and accurately extracting small-scale features. With mIoU (0.81), mAcc (0.87), aAcc (0.94), mPrecision (0.901), mRecall (0.876) and mFscore (0.887) higher than other models. In the face of unbalanced wetland categories, combining CrossEntropyLoss and FocalLoss in the loss function can improve several indicators of difficult cases to be segmented, enhancing the classification accuracy and generalization ability of the model. Finally, the category scale pie chart of Yancheng Binhai wetlands was plotted. In conclusion, this study achieves an effective segmentation of Yancheng coastal wetlands based on the semantic segmentation method of deep learning, providing technical support and reference value for subsequent research on wetland values.

TI  - Chaos Untold The Use of Gnosticism in the Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO)
T2  - NOVA RELIGIO-JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND EMERGENT RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the utilization of the concept "Gnosticism" in a form of Satanism that has come to be known as "Chaos Gnosticism," or "Gnostic Satanism." The topic of the study is the Swedish expression of this phenomenon attached to Current 218 and the Temple of Black Light, previously named the Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO). The group is known as one of the more radical and violent forms of Satanism. The aim here is to show how MLO relates to ancient Gnostic myths and how the particular and at times sinister worldview of MLO is legitimized by the use of Gnosticism. We also argue that the way the concept "Gnosticism" is understood within the group is reminiscent of the way it is constructed in certain scholarly circles. This brings to attention the relationship between modern academic publications and the construction of new religious movements.

TI  - The Mediterranean Killifish <i>Aphanius fasciatus</i> (Valenciennes, 1821) (Teleostei: Cyprinodontidae) as a Sentinel Species for Protection of the Quality of Transitional Water Environments: Literature, Insights, and Perspectives
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Transitional waters are fragile ecosystems with high ecological values, representing the breeding and resting sites for rare and threatened species. They warrant particular attention in regards to protection, as they experience numerous anthropogenic threats. The present review aims to analyze the recent literature on Aphanius fasciatus, currently considered one of the most strictly estuarine-dependent fish species, thus affected by the degradation of lagoon habitats, and to discuss its suitability as a sentinel species for protection of the quality of transitional water environments. The analysis and discussion highlight the potential applicability of the molecular, cellular, and physiological responses of this species as diagnostic tools for detecting the subtle effects induced by environmental pollution on the biota in transitional water environments. Moreover, the suitability of the responses of this species is suggested in the wider framework of the One Health perspective, which considers human and animal health and the environmental state to be highly interconnected, sharing common aspects. To date, omics technologies show great potential in reacquiring novel knowledge on the responses of the organisms to environmental changes and to the alterations of the environmental health status. Therefore, considering the relevant potential of this organism as a sentinel species, many efforts are required in the near future to improve the quantity and quality of the omics tools that refer to A. fasciatus.

TI  - Compatible Blood Units in Sickle Cell Disease with Multiple Alloantibodies - a Case Study
T2  - TRANSFUSIONSMEDIZIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients with the chronic need of transfusions, such as patients with sickle cell disease, have a higher risk of alloimmunization, for example patients with Duffy Null Fy(a- b-) Genotype. In the case of alloantibody formation, the supply of compatible red cell units for patients is more difficult. In this regard, anti-Fy-3 antibody is an antibody formed in individuals with Duffy null genotype (Fya-, Fyb-). This alloantibody can bind both Duffy A and Duffy B antigens. The Duffy null phenotype, Fy(a-b-), is very rare in Caucasians but occurs in 68% of blacks [1].Our patient is of African descent and has the allele FY*02 N.01 (Duffy Null). During a sickle cell crisis, a positive crossmatch as well as alloantibodies, anti-M and anti-Jk (b)) were present. The anti-M titer was 64 and the anti-Jk(b) titer was 32. Genotyping revealed the Duffy null genotype. Furthermore, genotyping showed that the patient was M-negative and Jk(b)-negative, which supported the diagnosis of anti-M and anti-Jk(b) antibodies. The patient received a transfusion of antigen-compatible red cells, hemoglobin levels increased, and her condition improved. No further signs of hemolysis occurred. Additional diagnostics confirmed the suspected alloantibodies anti-M- and anti-Jk(b). In addition, an anti-Fy-3 antibody was suspected.This case highlights that genotyping of blood group antigens can provide additional information to serological findings. This information supports the prevention of alloimmunization in frequently transfused patients.

TI  - Quantifying the Potential Contribution of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation to Coastal Carbon Capture in a Delta System from Field and Landsat 8/9-Operational Land Imager (OLI) Data with Deep Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) are highly efficient at carbon sequestration and, despite their relatively small distribution globally, are recognized as a potentially valuable component of climate change mitigation. However, SAV mapping in tidal marshes presents a challenge due to optically complex constituents in the water. The emergence and advancement of deep learning-based techniques in the field of habitat mapping with remote sensing imagery provides an opportunity to address this challenge. In this study, an analytical framework was developed to quantify the carbon sequestration of SAV habitats in the Atchafalaya River Delta Estuary from field and remote sensing observations using deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) techniques. A U-Net-based model, Wetland-SAV Network, was trained to identify the SAV percent cover (high, medium, and low) as well as other estuarine habitat types from Landsat 8/9-OLI data. The areal extent of SAV was up to 8% of the total area (47,000 ha). The habitat areas and habitat-specific carbon fluxes were then used to quantify the net greenhouse gas (GHG) flux of the study area for with/without SAV scenarios in a carbon balance model. The total net GHG flux was in the range of -0.13 +/- 0.06 to 0.86 +/- 0.37 x 10(5) tonne CO(2)e y(-1) and increased up to 40% (-0.23 +/- 0.10 to -0.90 +/- 0.39 x 10(5) tonne CO(2)e y(-1)) when SAV was accounted for within the calculation. At the hectare scale, the inclusion of SAV resulted in an increase of similar to 60% for the net GHG sink in shallow areas adjacent to the emergent marsh where SAV was abundant. This is the first attempt at remotely mapping SAV in coastal Louisiana as well as a first quantification of net GHG flux at the scale of hectares to thousands of hectares, accounting for SAV within these sub-tropical coastal delta marshes. Remote sensing and deep learning models have high potential for mapping and monitoring SAV in turbid sub-tropical coastal deltas as a component of the increasing accuracy of net GHG flux estimates at small (hectare) and large (coastal basin) scales.

TI  - High-Resolution Daily Spatiotemporal Distribution and Evaluation of Ground-Level Nitrogen Dioxide Concentration in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region Based on TROPOMI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study utilized TROPOMI remote sensing data, MODIS remote sensing data, ground observation data, and other ancillary data to construct a high-resolution spatiotemporal distribution and evaluation of ground-level NO2 concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region using the Geographic Temporal Neural Network Weighted Regression (GTNNWR) model. Through this model, we obtained the daily distribution of ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region at a resolution of 500 m for the period of 2019-2022. The research results exhibited higher accuracy and more detailed features compared to other models, enabling a more accurate reflection of the spatial distribution and temporal variations of ground-level NO2 concentrations in the region, while retaining more details and trends and excluding the influence of noisy data. Furthermore, we conducted an evaluation analysis considering important events such as public health incidents and the Winter Olympics. The results demonstrated that the GTNNWR model outperformed the Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Geographic Neural Network Weighted Regression (GNNWR) models in performance metrics such as R2, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, showcasing greater reliability when considering spatiotemporal heterogeneity and spatiotemporal non-stationarity. This study provides crucial data support and reference for atmospheric environmental management and pollution prevention and control in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.

TI  - Maize Yield Forecasting and Associated Optimum Lead Time Research Based on Temporal Remote Sensing Data and Different Model
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - For the inadequate generalization ability of the quantitative evaluation model of crop yield, the lag of forecasting time and the difficulty of establishing the optimum lead yield estimation time, this paper takes Sentinel-2 remote sensing data and the measured maize yield as the data source to research the establishment of county-scale maize yield estimation and optimum lead yield estimation time. Based on the time-series image data of maize growth-satges through building the correlation between maize yield measured data and vegetation index, the time-series maize yield estimation model was established by MLRM (multivariable linear regression model), GPR (Gaussian process regression model) and LSTM (Long short-term memory artificial neural network model). The experimental results show that LSTM is superior to GPR and MLRM in terms of the accuracy, and reliability of the yield prediction model, the capture of the abnormal yield value, and the optimum lead yield estimation time in the time series yield estimation model established with NDVI, GNDVI and GN (NDVI and GNDVI combination) as parameters. At the same time, based on the LSTM estimation model, the NDVI time-series image data up to tasseling stage were used as parameters and the yield prediction results showed that the R-2 (determination coefficient) was 0. 83, RMSE(root mean square error) was 0. 26 t . ha(-1) RPD(relative percent deviation) was 3. 52; The GNDVI time-series image data up to tasseling stage were used as parameters, and the yield prediction results showed that the R-2 was 0. 79, RMSE was 0. 30 t . ha(-1), RPD was 2. 87; The GN time-series image data up to tasseling stage were used as parameters, and the yield prediction results showed that the R-2 was 0. 83, RMSE was 0. 27 t . ha(-1) RPD was 3. 05. Using the NDVI time-series image data as the LSTM model parameter has the optimal yield estimation, and the maize yield could be predicted 2 months in advance compared with the maize harvest stage. As a result, we developed a crop yield forecasting method in this study to predict crop yield for county-scale. It has practical significance for maize yield forecasting and provides a relevant reference for similar crop yield estimation research.

TI  - Global Digital Elevation Model Comparison Criteria: An Evident Need to Consider Their Application
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - From an extensive search of papers related to the comparison of Global Digital Elevation Models (hereinafter GDEMs), an analysis is carried out that aims to answer several questions such as: Which GDEMs have been compared? Where have the comparisons been made? How many comparisons have been made? How have the assessments been carried out? Which is the GDEM option with the lowest RMSE? Analysis shows that SRTM and ASTER are the most popular GDEMs, that the countries where more comparisons have been made are Brazil, India, and China, and that the main type of reference data for evaluations is the use of points surveyed by GNSS techniques. A variety of criteria have been found for the comparison of GDEMs, but the most used are the RMSE and the standard deviation of the elevation error. There are numerous criteria with a more user-centric character in thematic areas, such as morphometry, geomorphology, erosion, etc. However, in none of the thematic areas does there exist a standard method of comparison. This limits the possibilities of establishing a ranking of GDEMs based on their user-focused quality. In addition, the methods and reference data set are not adequately explained or shared, which limits the interoperability of the studies carried out and the ability to make robust comparisons between them.

TI  - Evaluation of the Use of the 12 Bands vs. NDVI from Sentinel-2 Images for Crop Identification
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, machine learning applied to remote sensing data is used for crop detection. This makes it possible to not only monitor crops but also to detect pests, a lack of irrigation, or other problems. For systems that require high accuracy in crop identification, a large amount of data is required to generate reliable models. The more plots of and data on crop evolution used over time, the more reliable the models. Here, a study has been carried out to analyse neural network models trained with the Sentinel satellite's 12 bands, compared to models that only use the NDVI, in order to choose the most suitable model in terms of the amount of storage, calculation time, accuracy, and precision. This study achieved a training time gain of 59.35% for NDVI models compared with 12-band models; however, models based on 12-band values are 1.96% more accurate than those trained with the NDVI alone when it comes to making predictions. The findings of this study could be of great interest to administrations, businesses, land managers, and researchers who use satellite image data mining techniques and wish to design an efficient system, particularly one with limited storage capacity and response times.

TI  - Effects of Groundwater Depth on Vegetation Coverage in the Ulan Buh Desert in a Recent 20-Year Period
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - As a typical desert in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Ulan Buh Desert has a dry climate and scarce precipitation all year round. Groundwater has become the main factor limiting the growth of vegetation in this region. It is of great significance to study the influence of groundwater depth on the spatial distribution pattern of vegetation in this region. Based on the PIE-Engine platform and using long-term time-series Landsat data, this paper analyzed the spatial-temporal distribution characteristics and trends in vegetation coverage in the Ulan Buh Desert in the last 20 years using a pixel dichotomy model and the image difference method. The Kriging interpolation method was used to interpolate the groundwater depth data from 106 monitoring wells in the Ulan Buh Desert over the past 20 years, and the spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater depth in the Ulan Buh Desert were analyzed. Finally, the correlation coefficient between changes in vegetation coverage and changes in groundwater depth was calculated. The results showed the following: (1) The vegetation coverage in the Ulan Buh Desert was higher in the periphery and lower in the center of the desert. The overall vegetation level showed an increasing trend year by year; the growth rate was 4.73%/10 years, and the overall vegetation cover showed an improving trend. (2) The overall groundwater depth in the Ulan Buh Desert was deep in the southwest and shallow in the northeast. In the past 20 years, the groundwater depth in the Ulan Buh area has become shallower, and the ecological condition has gradually improved. (3) On the whole, the vegetation coverage varied with the groundwater depth, and the shallower the groundwater depth, the greater the vegetation coverage. When the groundwater depth increased to more than 4 m, the change in the groundwater depth had a significant effect on the vegetation coverage. However, when the groundwater depth was greater than 6 m, the change in the groundwater depth had no significant effect on the change in vegetation coverage.

TI  - Crop classification in high-resolution remote sensing images based on multi-scale feature fusion semantic segmentation model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The great success of deep learning in the field of computer vision provides a development opportunity for intelligent information extraction of remote sensing images. In the field of agriculture, a large number of deep convolutional neural networks have been applied to crop spatial distribution recognition. In this paper, crop mapping is defined as a semantic segmentation problem, and a multi-scale feature fusion semantic segmentation model MSSNet is proposed for crop recognition, aiming at the key problem that multi-scale neural networks can learn multiple features under different sensitivity fields to improve classification accuracy and fine-grained image classification. Firstly, the network uses multi-branch asymmetric convolution and dilated convolution. Each branch concatenates conventional convolution with convolution nuclei of different sizes with dilated convolution with different expansion coefficients. Then, the features extracted from each branch are spliced to achieve multi-scale feature fusion. Finally, a skip connection is used to combine low-level features from the shallow network with abstract features from the deep network to further enrich the semantic information. In the experiment of crop classification using Sentinel-2 remote sensing image, it was found that the method made full use of spectral and spatial characteristics of crop, achieved good recognition effect. The output crop classification mapping was better in plot segmentation and edge characterization of ground objects. This study can provide a good reference for high-precision crop mapping and field plot extraction, and at the same time, avoid excessive data acquisition and processing.

TI  - Suppression of weed communities by granivores over time in an agroecosystem
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Invertebrate granivore communities can consume numerous weed seeds in cropland, but how this granivory influences weed recruitment over time in continuous no-till systems is unknown. Weed and surface-active granivore communities were determined in soybeans (Glycine max) over 3 years in eastern South Dakota. We examined seed removal rates of sentinel redroot pigweed, green foxtail, and lambsquarters (Chenopodium album) seeds and applied gut content analysis of granivores to determine which species consume immuno-marked seeds of green foxtail (Setaria viridis). Weed stands with low diversity and high biomass production were associated with granivore community complexity. In turn, granivore community complexity was associated with weed communities with low diversity and high biomass in the subsequent growing season. Fall seed consumption, as measured by seed removal rates and gut content analysis of foxtail seed markers, was positively correlated with weed recruitment in the subsequent growing season. Seed specialists behaved differently toward focal weed species than the granivore community at large. Gryllus pennsylvanicus abundance was correlated with higher green foxtail consumption and removal rates. None of the other dominant green foxtail consumers revealed a similar set of responses. We propose a feedback mechanism whereby granivore community complexity in cropland leads to larger but fewer weeds over multiple years. Weed communities with these characteristics then lead to more complex granivore communities. If these relationships persist over time with minimal disturbance in continuous no-till cropping systems without pesticides, this feedback loop could reduce weed cover.

TI  - Validation Analysis of Drought Monitoring Based on FY-4 Satellite
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts are natural disasters that have significant implications for agricultural production and human livelihood. Under climate change, the drought process is accelerating, such as the intensification of flash droughts. The efficient and quick monitoring of droughts has increasingly become a crucial measure in responding to extreme drought events. We utilized multi-imagery data from the geostationary meteorological satellite FY-4A within one day; implemented the daily Maximum Value Composite (MVC) method to minimize interference from the clouds, atmosphere, and anomalies; and developed a method for calculating the daily-scale Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI), which is a dryness index. Three representative drought events (Yunnan Province, Guangdong Province, and the Huanghuai region) from 2021 to 2022 were selected for validation, respectively. We evaluated the spatial and temporal effects of the TVDI with the Soil Relative Humidity Index (SRHI) and the Meteorological Drought Composite Index (MCI). The results show that the TVDI has stronger negative correlations with the MCI and SRHI in moderate and severe drought events. Meanwhile, the TVDI and SRHI exhibited similar trends. The trends of drought areas identified by the TVDI, SRHI, and MCI were consistent, while the drought area identified by the TVDI was slightly higher than the SRHI. Yunnan Province has the most concentrated distribution, which is mostly between 16.93 and 25.22%. The spatial distribution of the TVDI by FY-4A and MODIS is generally consistent, and the differences in severe drought areas may be attributed to disparities in the NDVI. Furthermore, the TVDI based on FY-4A provides a higher number of valid pixels (437 more pixels in the Huanghuai region) than that based on MODIS, yielding better overall drought detection. The spatial distribution of the TVDI between FY-4A and Landsat-8 is also consistent. FY-4A has the advantage of acquiring a complete image on a daily basis, and lower computational cost in regional drought monitoring. The results indicate the effectiveness of the FY-4A TVDI in achieving daily-scale drought monitoring, with a larger number of valid pixels and better spatial consistency with station indices. This study provides a new solution for drought monitoring using a geostationary meteorological satellite from different spatial-temporal perspectives to facilitate comprehensive drought monitoring.

TI  - Multi-Difference Image Fusion Change Detection Using a Visual Attention Model on VHR Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images with complex objects and rich textural information, multi-difference image fusion has been proven as an effective method to improve the performance of change detection. However, errors are superimposed during this process and a single spectral feature cannot fully utilize the correlation between pixels, resulting in low robustness. To overcome these problems and optimize the performance of multi-difference image fusion in change detection, we propose a novel multi-difference image fusion change detection method based on a visual attention model (VA-MDCD). First, we construct difference images using change vector analysis (CVA) and spectral gradient difference (SGD). Second, we use the visual attention model to calculate multiple color, intensity and orientation features of the difference images to obtain the difference saliency images. Third, we use the wavelet transform fusion algorithm to fuse two saliency images. Finally, we execute the OTSU threshold segmentation algorithm (OTSU) to obtain the final change detection map. To validate the effectiveness of VA-MDCD on VHR images, two datasets of Jilin 1 and Beijing 2 are selected for experiments. Compared with classical methods, the proposed method has a better performance with fewer missed alarms (MA) and false alarms (FA), which proves that the method has a strong robustness and generalization ability. The F-measure of the two datasets is 0.6671 and 0.7313, respectively. In addition, the results of ablation experiments confirm that the three feature extraction modules of the model all play a positive role.

TI  - The Impact of Land Use Changes on Carbon Flux in the World's 100 Largest Cities
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has become an important player in the global carbon cycle, and land use change is the second largest source of carbon emissions. However, despite great advances in remote sensing and satellite imagery, there is no reliable estimate of the impact of land use change on changes in land carbon stock in global cities. This paper quantified the impact of land use change on land carbon flux in the world's 100 largest cities by using annual land cover data based on LandSat 8 images and land carbon stock parameters provided by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). It was found that significant urban expansion could be observed in 83 cities, while 29 cities showed a deforestation trend, and croplands in 42 cities have shrunk. Carbon stock reduced by more than 112 million tons in the 100 selected cities from 2013 to 2022 due to land cover change. A total of 39 cities showed significant negative trends in land carbon stock that were mainly caused by urban sprawl and shrinkage in forest or cropland, among which Kolkata, Chongqing, Seoul, Guangzhou, and Hefei showed the greatest decline. Because of the growth of forest and cropland, or reduction in barren land and grassland, 28 cities showed clear positive trends in land carbon stock. In order to increase urban land carbon stock, the urban planning of most cities should focus on the protection of forests or afforestation that replace barren land or grassland and should avoid mindless urban expansion.

TI  - A Deep Learning-Based Algorithm for Identifying Precipitation Clouds Using Fengyun-4A Satellite Observation Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate identification of precipitation clouds from satellite observations is essential for the research of quantitative precipitation estimation and precipitation nowcasting. In this study, we proposed a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based algorithm for precipitation cloud identification (PCINet) in the daytime, nighttime, and nychthemeron. High spatiotemporal and multi-spectral information from the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite is utilized as the inputs, and a multi-scale structure and skip connection constraint strategy are presented in the framework of the algorithm to improve the precipitation cloud identification. Moreover, the effectiveness of visible/near-infrared spectral information in improving daytime precipitation cloud identification is explored. To evaluate this algorithm, we compare it with five other deep learning models used for image segmentation and perform qualitative and quantitative analyses of long-time series using data from 2021. In addition, two heavy precipitation events are selected to analyze the spatial distribution of precipitation cloud identification. Statistics and visualization of the experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline models in this task, and adding visible/near-infrared spectral information in the daytime can effectively improve model performance. More importantly, the proposed model can provide accurate and near-real-time results, which has important application in observing precipitation clouds.

TI  - A novel approach to detect the spring corn phenology using layered strategy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and continuous crop phenology information at a regional scale is important for agronomic management and yield estimation. However, detecting continuous crop phenology remains challenging due to the low sensitivity of remote sensing signals to certain phenological stages and the limited of availability remote sensing images. Therefore, this study developed a layered strategy to detect continuous crop phenology. First, a novel Phenology Separability Index (PSI) is established to select features from the Gaussian probability density distribution. PSI quantifies the capability of optical vegetation indexes (VIs), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signals, and meteorological factors to distinguish between various phenological stages. Then, the multi-temporal sample is established to enhance training sample representation and quantity. Finally, a random forest model is trained using features extracted from multi-temporal samples to improve detection accuracy. This model effectively reduces phenological stage confusion due to redundant features and limited samples. In addition, this study validated its extensibility by mapping crop phenology in the cities of Acheng, Zhaozhou, Lishu, and Buxin and assessed its uncertainty using the Sobol approach. Results indicated that growing degree day has the highest separability among meteorological factors, surpassing both SAR singles and optical VIs. Moreover, the proposed layered strategy was robust, explaining 96% of spatial variation in crop phenology at the regional scale. The accuracy of the layered strategy method (total RMSE = 8.74 days) surpassed that of the multi-temporal sample method (total RMSE = 15.76 days) and the traditional method with a single-temporal sample (total RMSE = 17.21 days). In addition, this study indicated that optical VIs are prone to confuse with the early or late phenological stage of corn, whereas SAR singles are highly sensitive to jointing date.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Classification in the Northern Region of Mozambique Based on Landsat Time Series and Machine Learning
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate land use and land cover (LULC) mapping is essential for scientific and decision-making purposes. The objective of this paper was to map LULC classes in the northern region of Mozambique between 2011 and 2020 based on Landsat time series processed by the Random Forest classifier in the Google Earth Engine platform. The feature selection method was used to reduce redundant data. The final maps comprised five LULC classes (non-vegetated areas, built-up areas, croplands, open evergreen and deciduous forests, and dense vegetation) with an overall accuracy ranging from 80.5% to 88.7%. LULC change detection between 2011 and 2020 revealed that non-vegetated areas had increased by 0.7%, built-up by 2.0%, and dense vegetation by 1.3%. On the other hand, open evergreen and deciduous forests had decreased by 4.1% and croplands by 0.01%. The approach used in this paper improves the current systematic mapping approach in Mozambique by minimizing the methodological gaps and reducing the temporal amplitude, thus supporting regional territorial development policies.

TI  - Communicating without words: Measuring nonverbal communication between veterinarians and farmers during routine herd health consultations
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Uptake of advice and the ability to facilitate change on-farm are key elements for successful veterinary practice. However, having the necessary clinical skills and knowledge is not enough to achieve this: effective communication skills are essential for veterinarians to realize their advisory role by exploring and understand-ing the farmer's worldview. Research of verbal aspects of veterinarian communication supports the use of a relationship-centered communication style; we next need to study how veterinarian-farmer nonverbal com-munication (NVC) can influence interactions and their outcomes, which has been examined in medical and companion animal practice. In this study, we considered which aspects of NVC should be measured, and how, to provide an essential first step toward understanding the significance of NVC for veterinarians working in dairy practice, which should be of interest to researchers, veterinary educators, and practitioners. Eleven video recordings of routine consultations in the UK were analyzed for farmer and veterinarian NVC. The NVC attributes with established links to positive patient and client outcomes from medical and social science studies were chosen, and a methodology developed for their measurement, by adapting measures typically used in NVC research. Each consultation was segmented into intervals defined by the main activity and location on farm: introduction, fertility examination, discussion, and closing. This approach allowed us to analyze the content more consistently, establish which aspects of NVC featured within each interval, and whether the activity and location influenced the observed NVC. We measured 12 NVC attributes, including body orienta-tion, interpersonal distance, head position, and body lean, which have been shown to influence empathy, rapport, and trust: key components of relationship-centered communication. Future research should seek to establish the significance of NVC in effective com-munication between veterinarian and farmer, building on our findings that show it is possible to measure nonverbal attributes. Veterinarians may benefit from becoming skilled nonverbal communicators and have more effective conversations during routine consulta-tions, motivating farmers to make changes and improve herd health.

TI  - Mapping of Evapotranspiration and Determination of the Water Footprint of a Potato Crop Grown in Hyper-Arid Regions in Saudi Arabia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal quantification of a crop's evapotranspiration (ET) and water footprint (WF) is essential for sustainable agriculture. Therefore, this study was conducted to estimate the ET and WF of an irrigated potato crop using satellite imagery of Landsat and Sentinel-2 sensors. The Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) algorithm was used to evaluate the crop water use (ETa) for potato fields belonging to the Saudi Agricultural Development Company, located in the Wadi-Ad-Dawasir region, Saudi Arabia. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and land surface temperature (LSD) were computed for Landsat and Sentinel-2 datasets, which were used as inputs for mapping the potato tuber yield and, subsequently, the WF. The results indicated that the NDVI showed the best accuracy for the prediction of the potato tuber yield (R-2 = 0.72, P > F = 0.021) followed by the SAVI (R-2 = 0.64, P > F = 0.018), compared to the field harvested actual yield (Y-A). A comparison between the satellite-based ETa and the actual amount of water applied (W-A) for irrigation showed a good correlation (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 4.4%, MBE = 12.9%). The WF of the potatoes in the study area was estimated at values between 475 and 357 m(3) t(-1) for the early (September-December) and late (December-April) growing periods, re-spectively. A major portion (99.2%) of the WF was accounted for from irrigation with variations of 18.5% and 3.5% for early-and late-planted potatoes, respectively, compared to the baseline (crop planted in season). In conclusion, the results showed the possibility of satisfactorily estimating the WF using the SSEB algorithm by integrating the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets. In general, the high rates of ET in the early planting season led to higher WF values compared to the in-season and late planting dates; this will help in selecting suitable planting dates for potato crops in the study area and areas with similar environments, which enhances the opportunities for sustainable management of irrigation water.

TI  - The Role of Wildfires in the Interplay of Forest Carbon Stocks and Wood Harvest in the Contiguous United States During the 20th Century
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires and land use play a central role in the long-term carbon (C) dynamics of forested ecosystems of the United States. Understanding their linkages with changes in biomass, resource use, and consumption in the context of climate change mitigation is crucial. We reconstruct a long-term C balance of forests in the contiguous U.S. using historical reports, satellite data, and other sources at multiple scales (national scale 1926-2017, regional level 1941-2017) to disentangle the drivers of biomass C stock change. The balance includes removals of forest biomass by fire, by extraction of woody biomass, by forest grazing, and by biomass stock change, their sum representing the net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Nationally, the total forest NEP increased for most of the 20th century, while fire, harvest and grazing reduced total forest stocks on average by 14%, 51%, and 6%, respectively, resulting in a net increase in C stock density of nearly 40%. Recovery from past land-use, plus reductions in wildfires and forest grazing coincide with consistent forest regrowth in the eastern U.S. but associated C stock increases were offset by increased wood harvest. C stock changes across the western U.S. fluctuated, with fire, harvest, and other disturbances (e.g., insects, droughts) reducing stocks on average by 14%, 81%, and 7%, respectively, resulting in a net growth in C stock density of 14%. Although wildfire activities increased in recent decades, harvest was the key driver in the forest C balance in all regions for most of the observed timeframe.Plain Language Summary We estimate past forest fires in four regions of the contiguous United States from 1926 to 2017 using historical statistics and satellite data. We compare the biomass removed from forests by wildfires, wood harvest, and forest grazing to identify which of these indicators had the strongest impact on forest biomass. Fire suppression and biomass recovery from past harvest in the twentieth century led to biomass regrowth. Forest regrowth was stronger in the East of the United States than in the West. Recently, wildfires have increased in the West. Higher tree mortality, drought, windthrow, and insects counteracted forest growth in the West. We conclude that fire suppression contributed to forest regrowth in the past, but harvest had the strongest impact in all regions. We show that the connection between wildfires, harvest, and grazing is an important factor for biomass change in forests and needs to be investigated over long time periods.

TI  - Medical Applications and Advancement of Near Infrared Photosensitive Indocyanine Green Molecules
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Review
AB  - Indocyanine green (ICG) is an important kind of near infrared (NIR) photosensitive molecules for PTT/PDT therapy as well as imaging. When exposed to NIR light, ICG can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can kill cancer cells and pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, the absorbed light can also be converted into heat by ICG molecules to eliminate cancer cells. In addition, it performs exceptionally well in optical imaging-guided tumor therapy and antimicrobial therapy due to its deeper tissue penetration and low photobleaching properties in the near-infrared region compared to other dyes. In order to solve the problems of water and optical stability and multi-function problem of ICG molecules, composite nanomaterials based on ICG have been designed and widely used, especially in the fields of tumors and sterilization. So far, ICG molecules and their composite materials have become one of the most famous infrared sensitive materials. However, there have been no corresponding review articles focused on ICG molecules. In this review, the molecular structure and properties of ICG, composite material design, and near-infrared light- triggered anti-tumor, and antibacterial, and clinical applications are reviewed in detail, which of great significance for related research.

TI  - Evaluation of Laboratories Supporting Invasive Bacterial Vaccine-Preventable Disease (IB-VPD) Surveillance in the World Health Organization African Region, through the Performance of Coordinated External Quality Assessment
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: Laboratories supporting the invasive bacteria preventable disease (IB-VPD) network are expected to demonstrate the capacity to identify the main etiological agents of pediatric bacterial meningitis (PBM) (Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) on Gram stains and in phenotypic identification. Individual reports of sentinel site (SSL), national (NL) and regional reference (RRL) laboratories participating in the World Health Organization (WHO)-coordinated external quality assessment, distributed by the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment (EQA) Services (UK NEQAS) for Microbiology between 2014 and 2019 were analyzed. (2) Methods: The panels consisted of (1) unstained bacterial smears for Gram staining, (2) viable isolates for identification and serotyping/serogrouping (ST/SG) and (3) simulated cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) samples for species detection and ST/SG using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). SSLs and NLs tested for Gram staining and species identification (partial panel). RRLs, plus any SSLs and NLs (optionally) also analyzed the simulated CSF samples (full panel). The passing score was >75% for NLs and SSLs, and >90% for RRLs and NLs/SSLs testing the full panel. (3) Results: Overall, 63% (5/8) of the SSLs and NLs were able to correctly identify the targeted pathogens, in 2019; but there were challenges to identify Haemophilus influenzae either on Gram stains (35% of the labs failed 2014), or in culture. Individual performance showed inconsistent capacity, with only 39% (13/33) of the SSLs/NLs passing the EQA exercise throughout all surveys in which they participated. RRLs performed well over the study period, but one of the two failed to reach the minimal passing score in 2016 and 2018; while the SSLs/NLs that optionally tested the full panel scored between 75% and 90% (intermediate pass category). (4) Conclusions: We identified a need for implementing a robust quality management system for timely identification of the gaps and then implementing corrective and preventive actions, in addition to continuous refresher training in the SSLs and NLs supporting the IB-VPD surveillance in the World Health Organization, Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO).

TI  - Prediction of soil salinity in the Upputeru river estuary catchment, India, using machine learning techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a widespread phenomenon leading to land degradation, particularly in regions with brackish inland aquaculture ponds. However, because of the high geographical and temporal fluctuation, monitoring vast areas provides substantial challenges. This study uses remote sensing data and machine learning techniques to predict soil salinity. Four linear models, namely linear regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), ridge, and elastic net regression, and three boosting algorithms, namely XGB regressor, LightGBM, and CatBoost regressor, were used to predict soil salinity. Cross-validation was performed by splitting the data into 30% for model testing and 70% for model training. Multiple metrics such as determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to compare the performances of these algorithms. By comparison, the CatBoost regressor model performed better than the other models in both testing (MAE = 0.42, MSE = 0.28, RMSE = 0.53, R-2 = 0.92) and training (MAE = 0.49, MSE = 0.36, RMSE = 0.60, R-2 = 0.90) phases. Hence, the CatBoost regressor model was recommended for monitoring soil salinity in India's massive inland aquaculture zone.

TI  - In search of ancient pre-Roman imperial roads: state of research and some methodological recommendations
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, there has been a considerable growth of scientific interest in the question of travel and mobility in the ancient Mediterranean and Near East. As far as the southern Levant is concerned, this interest has yielded much research about travel and mobility in Late Antique Palestine (including the Roman imperial road network), leaving the question of pre-Roman travel and mobility a much-understudied field of study. However, recent archaeological discoveries have revolutionized our state of knowledge about material remains of pre-Roman roads, which were once believed to not have been preserved. Namely, remains of several pre-Roman roads have been discovered on the ground in modern Jordan and Israel: the Aroer Ascent, "Glueck's Road," Naqeb Dahal, the Wadi Zarqa-Main road, the Callirrhoe-Machaerus road, and the Masada-Hebron road. In this context, the aim of this paper was, first, to study the spatial and archaeological features of the archaeologically attested ancient pre-Roman roads, and second, to evaluate all of the available types of remote data as tools serving in the detection of artifacts (especially archival cartographic, aerial, and satellite data; archaeological data; and least-cost simulations of Geographic Information Systems [GIS]). As a result, several conclusions are suggested. First, old topographic maps are a very promising source of data for potential new discoveries since they contain both explicit and implicit hints at the existence of ancient roads. Second, information about archaeological data and the Roman imperial road network may also offer important reference points if the quality of databases is improved in the future. Third, the use of GIS simulations based on 30 m digital elevation models has very substantial limitations. In particular, the use of least cost paths and corridors for simulating short-distance travel has turned out to be fruitless. At the same time, the use of least cost corridors for predicting long-distance travel offers some promising results.

TI  - A Systematic Review on Advancements in Remote Sensing for Assessing and Monitoring Land Use and Land Cover Changes Impacts on Surface Water Resources in Semi-Arid Tropical Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This study aimed to provide a systematic overview of the progress made in utilizing remote sensing for assessing the impacts of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on water resources (quality and quantity). This review also addresses research gaps, challenges, and opportunities associated with the use of remotely sensed data in assessment and monitoring. The progress of remote sensing applications in the assessment and monitoring of LULC, along with their impacts on water quality and quantity, has advanced significantly. The availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, the integration of multiple sensors, and advanced classification techniques have improved the accuracy of land cover mapping and change detection. Furthermore, the study highlights the vast potential for providing detailed information on the monitoring and assessment of the relationship between LULC and water resources through advancements in data science analytics, drones, web-based platforms, and balloons. It emphasizes the importance of promoting research efforts, and the integration of remote sensing data with spatial patterns, ecosystem services, and hydrological models enables a more comprehensive evaluation of water quantity and quality changes. Continued advancements in remote sensing technology and methodologies will further improve our ability to assess and monitor the impacts of LULC changes on water quality and quantity, ultimately leading to more informed decision making and effective water resource management. Such research endeavors are crucial for achieving the effective and sustainable management of water quality and quantity.

TI  - Comparing harmonic regression and GLAD Phenology metrics for estimation of forest community types and aboveground live biomass within forest inventory and analysis plots
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat multispectral time series is a valuable source of moderate spatial resolution data to support forest mapping and monitoring tasks. Using United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots within the states of Michigan, Oregon, and West Virginia, two methods to summarize time series observations, harmonic regression coefficients and Global Land Analysis & Discovery (GLAD) Phenology metrics, are compared for predicting forest community type, total aboveground live biomass (AGLBM), and species-specific AGLBM. Harmonic regression coefficients, which provided mean overall accuracies (OAs) between 62.8% and 73.1% and map image classification efficacies (MICEs) varying between 0.455 and 0.566 for the three studied states and calculated using multiple model replicates, generally provided better predictive performance for differentiating forest community types in comparison to GLAD phenology metrics. However, differences were not always statistically significant. DTM-derived terrain variables improved classification performance in some landscapes when using machine learning, random forest classification (for example, the highest obtained mean OA of 78.5% (MICE = 0.557) was obtained for West Virginia when using the combined harmonic regression and terrain variables). For the regression-based estimation of total and speciesspecific AGLBM, the spectral data used and the incorporation of terrain variables had less of an impact on model performance. Further, the regression models in Oregon provided larger mean R-squared values (0.452 to 0.490) in comparison to those in Michigan and West Virginia, where all R-squared values were lower than 0.200, suggesting that AGLBM prediction may be more or less challenging in different landscapes depending on forest characteristics, terrain, management practices, and disturbance histories.

TI  - A remote sensing approach to estimate variable crop coefficient and evapotranspiration for improved water productivity in the Ethiopian highlands
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Proper and reasonable estimation of actual evapotranspiration is critical for the design, operation, and management of irrigation systems. However, the density of climatic stations is low in many parts of Ethiopia to estimate spatially reasonable reference evapotranspiration (ETo), and the lack of spatial variability of crop coefficient (Kc) is clear barrier to the proper management of irrigation water. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to estimate reasonable crop evapotranspiration (ETc) by deriving spatially and temporally varying crop coefficients using remote sensing products in 10 wheat plots at the Koga irrigation scheme. The moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) potential evapotranspiration was calibrated at two class-I climate stations (Bahir Dar and Dangila) based on Penman-Monteith estimates and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was derived from Sentinel 2B, which was later used to derive Kc. The correlation between reference evapotranspiration from MODIS Penman Monteith was acceptable for both Dangila (R-2 = 0.64) and Bahir Dar (R-2 = 0.74) stations. The MODIS calibration constant for Koga irrigation schemes was 0.27 and 1.99 (regression slope and constant) on an 8-day basis. Similarly, a strong correlation (R-2 = 0.95) was found between Sentinel-based NDVI and FAO crop coefficient, which indicated an alternative pathway for estimating crop coefficient. The value of Kc varies in space (across the 10 plots) from 0.16 to 0.42 at the initial stage and from 1.20 to 1.32 at the mid-stage. Similarly, the mean value of Kc varies in time from 0.29 at the initial stage to 1.26 at the mid-stage. On the other hand, evaluation of MODIS and WaPOR ETc found a significant difference (p < 0.05) with the calibrated MODIS-Sentinel 2B derived ETc. This indicated the need to calibrate both MODIS and WaPOR for the proper estimation of crop water needs. Underestimation of ET was observed from MODIS, and the reverse is true for WaPOR. Our findings showed that calibrating and integrating MODIS with Sentinel 2B would be a feasible approach to estimate Kc and hence ETc that varies in time and space. This would assist water managers in estimating crop water needs for better productivity in the region.

TI  - Frequency Ratio Model as Tools for Flood Susceptibility Mapping in Urbanized Areas: A Case Study from Egypt
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of flash floods is a natural yet unavoidable occurrence over time. In addition to harming people, property, and resources, it also undermines a country's economy. This paper attempts to identify areas of flood vulnerability using a frequency ratio approach. The frequency ratio (FR) model was used to produce flood prediction maps for New Cairo City, Egypt. Using field data and remote sensing data, 143 spatial flooded point sites were mapped to build a flood inventory map. The primary driving criteria for flash floods were determined to be elevation, slope, aspect, Land Use Land Cover (LULC), lithology, stream distance, stream density, topographic wetness index (TWI), surface runoff, and terrain ruggedness index (TRI), in that order of importance. A flood susceptibility map (FSM) has been created using the FR model, which combines geographical flooded sites and environmental variables. Our findings from FSM, roughly a fifth of the city is very highly susceptible to flooding (19.32%), while the remaining 40.09% and 13.14% of the study area rank very low and low risk, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) technique was also used to validate the FSM, and the resulting results showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 90.11%. In conclusion, decision makers can employ models to extract and generate flood risk maps in order to better understand the effects of flash floods and to create alternative measures to prevent this hazard in similar regions. The results of this study will aid planners and decision makers in developing some likely actions to reduce floods vulnerability in this area.

TI  - Sentinel satellite data monitoring of air pollutants with interpolation methods in Guayaquil, Ecuador
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Ecuador, there is a limitation on air quality monitoring due to the cost of monitoring networks. Although air quality monitoring stations are instruments for air measurement, they do not cover an entire city due to their scope. Satellite remote sensing is now an effective tool to study atmospheric pollutants and has been applied to continuously assess a region and overcome the limitations of fixed stations. Despite the application of satellite data for air quality monitoring, there are some limitations, such as measurement frequency, cloud cover and wide spatial resolution, which do not allow the assessment of air pollution in cities. Therefore, downscaling, applying interpolation methods, is essential for continuous air quality monitoring at smaller scales. For this research, Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) data from the Sentinel-5 satellite percussor was used in the city of Guayaquil for January-December 2020, which is considered before, during and after the COVID-19 quarantine. This mid-size port city does not have a permanent monitoring network, which prevents us from knowing the air quality. Due to the limitation of pixel size, this study used satellite data to apply interpolation techniques and reduce pixels to assess air quality. Two categories of interpolation were selected: deterministic and stochastic. The empirical Bayesian kriging (EBK) interpolation obtained a R2 of 0.9546, which was superior to the other methods applied. Therefore, the EBK method had the best accuracy for tropospheric NO2 concentration. Finally, the method used in this research can help monitor air quality in cities lacking continuous monitoring networks, as the reduction of the pixel size gives us a better pattern of pollutants.

TI  - Sustainable Development Goal 6 Assessment and Attribution Analysis of Underdeveloped Small Regions Using Integrated Multisource Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data scarcity is a key factor impacting the current emphasis on individual indicators and the distribution of large-scale spatial objects in country-level SDG 6 research. An investigation of progress assessments and factors influencing SDG implementation in cities and counties indicates that smaller-scale regions hold greater operational significance for achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development from the bottom up; thus, urgent attention should be given to data deficiencies and inadequate analyses related to SDG impact attribution. This study, conducted in the National Innovative Demonstration Zone for Sustainable Development of Lincang City, investigates multisource data sources such as integrated statistics, survey data, and remote sensing data to analyze the progress and status of SDG 6 achievement from 2015-2020, and employs the LMDI decomposition model to identify influential factors. The assessment results demonstrate that the SDG 6 composite index in Lincang increased from 0.47 to 0.61 between 2015 and 2020. The SDG 6 indicators and SDG 6 composite index have significant spatial heterogeneity. The water resources indexes in wealthy countries are high, the water environment and water ecology indexes in developing countries are comparatively high, and the SDG 6 composite index is high in undeveloped counties. Technological and economic advances are the main positive drivers impacting the SDG 6 composite index, and the relative contributions of technology, economy, structure, and population are 61.84%, 54.16%, -4.03%, and -11.96%, respectively. This study shows that integrated multisource data can compensate for the lack of small-scale regional statistical data when quantitative and comprehensive multi-indicator evaluations of the SDGs are conducted. And, policies related to SDG 6.1.1, SDG 6.2.1, and SDG 6.3.1 can be a priority for implementation in undeveloped regions with limited funding.

TI  - Spatial Flood Forecasting Modeling under Lack of Data Using RS and Optimized Support Vector Machine: A Case Study of the Zahedan Watershed
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This research was conducted with the aim of producing flood susceptible area maps of the Zahedan catchment in Iran during lack of data using remote sensing. To determine the factors to be included in the model, factors identified in previous studies were prepared using remote sensing and were evaluated by the information gain ratio (IGR) method and the multicollinearity diagnostic test, and ultimately 10 factors with the highest IGR values were chosen as the most effective factors in the region. The flood inventory map was produced by processing the Sentinel-1 satellite data. The gathered data were used to map flood susceptibility maps with the SVM model optimized with IWO and ACO. The prediction accuracy of the models was evaluated in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). While both optimization algorithms are effective in improving the performance of SVM, the hybrid of SVM with IWO shows the best performance in terms of statistical measures and Friedman test results. The results of the study confirm the good performance of the proposed models in spatial prediction of flood susceptible areas. Since over half of the urban lands of the city of Zahedan are at moderate to very high risk of flooding, this area needs more attention in terms of flood prevention and control measures.

TI  - Sexual Fluidity: Implications for Population Research
T2  - DEMOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - For the first time ever, national censuses have begun ask ing adults to report their sexual ori entations. However, because such sur veys provide only cross-sectional snap shots of pop ulations, these data obscure one key complex ity: that sexual ity can be fluid, with sexual self-identifi cation evolv ing over time. Drawing on unique, restricted-use data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health, the cur rent study docu ments the prev a lence, corre lates, and empiri cal con se quences of sexual fluid ity in the con temporary United States. Overall, about 1 in 11 Ameri can adults changed sexual iden tities over five annual sur veys, includ ing 6% of cisgender men, 11% of cisgender women, and 35% of gen der minor ities. Fluidity was par ticu larly pro nounced among young adults and among those who had ever iden tified as bisexual or "something else." Despite the fre quency and pattern ing of sexual flu id ity, account ing for flu id ity did lit-tle to change observed patterns of dis ad van tage on three mea sures of sexual minor ity well-being: mental health, finan cial inse curity, and sub stance use. Given these facts, I argue that demo graphic research should fore ground the complexities inherent in quan-ti fy ing sex u al ity, focus ing less on how many people "are" a given sexual ori entation and more on the social dynamics that con tinue to pro duce sexual minor ity dis ad van tage.

TI  - Assessing the Impacts of COVID-19 on SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO Trends in Durban Using TROPOMI, AIRS, OMI, and MERRA-2 Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research report investigated the impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on CO, SO2, and NO2 trends in Durban from 2019 to 2021. The COVID-19 lockdown restrictions proved to decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally; however, the decrease in GHG emissions was for a short period only. Space-borne technology has been used by researchers to understand the spatial and temporal trends of GHGs. This study used Sentinel-5P to map the spatial distribution of CO, SO2, and NO2. Use was also made of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) to understand the temporal trends of CO, SO2, and NO2, respectively. To validate the results of this study, we used the Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) test. This study indicated that there were no significant changes in all the investigated gases. Therefore, this study failed to reject the null hypothesis of the SQMK test that there was no significant trend for all investigated gasses. Increasing trends were observed for CO, SO2, and NO2 trends during winter months throughout the study period, whereas a decreasing trend was observed in all investigated gases during the spring months. This shows that meteorological factors play a significant role in the accumulation of air pollutants in the atmosphere. Most importantly, this study has noted that there was an inverse relationship between the trends of all investigated gases and the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.

TI  - Atypical late presentation of muscular metastasis of melanoma in the contralateral limb
T2  - BMJ CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A man in his 50s presented to plastic surgery again with a lesion on his left upper arm. He had previously been treated for a malignant melanoma (MM) on his right arm over 5 years earlier. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) had been negative, and he had completed the recommended 5 years follow-up period. Imaging was suspicious for an intramuscular soft tissue malignancy within the triceps muscle. After discussion with the regional sarcoma service, a core biopsy was performed. Histopathology suggested a diagnosis of metastatic MM, which was confirmed after surgical excision. This case highlights a rare example of an isolated muscular metastasis of MM, which presented at a distant site, over 5 years from the original treatment. This case highlights the unpredictable nature of MM, reminding clinicians of the need for a low threshold for investigation of soft tissue masses in patients with a history of cutaneous malignancy.

TI  - Assessment of the Ecological Condition of Informal Settlements Using the Settlement Surface Ecological Index
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - To manage urban ecological ecosystems adequately, understanding the urban areas' biophysical characteristics is required. This study developed a settlement surface ecological index (SSEI) using tree, soil, impervious surface and grass covers, land surface temperature (LST), and soil moisture derived from Satellite Pour L'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 7 and Landsat 8 satellite images. The assessment of the SSEI was conducted over twelve sites of 300 m by 300 m. The selected sites contained formal and informal settlements of varying building densities. The SSEI values ranged from -0.3 to 0.54. Seven assessed areas are in the worst ecological condition with an SSEI below zero. Only three settlement types had an SSEI index value of 0.2 and above, and two of these areas were informal settlements. The formal low-density settlement with higher tree coverage displayed the highest index value of 0.54, slightly higher than the medium-density informal settlement. Overall, there is no significant difference in the SSEI values between the surface ecological condition of formal and informal settlements. The results achieved in this study can be used to understand urban ecology better and develop urban greening strategies at a city or settlement level.

TI  - Gaia and Religious Pluralism in Bruno Latour′s ′New-Materialism′
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In his works on ecological philosophy, Bruno Latour develops an interesting perspective on religion and pluralism. He proposes a new worldview, in which religion is reinterpreted in view of a Gaian philosophy. He extends ' pluralism ' beyond the anthropocentrism that dominates modern humanism. In his book Facing Gaia Latour includes nonhuman beings in a larger community and works towards a larger concept of eco-humanism. In this paper, I try to reconstruct his position by showing that the philosophical foundation for his interpretation of religion could be called ' terrarism ' and is to be classified as a form of new materialism. This new interpretation of materialism has postmodernist origins (inspired by Gilles Deleuze), but it is not identical to it, because Latour distances himself from ' postmodernism '. He wants to positively contribute to a new ontology. My point is that Latour ' s ' terrarist ' grounding of religious pluralism obstructs any foundation of transcendence and, finally, congests a really pluralistic ecumene because he still adheres to the postmodernist idea that we should renounce to a unitary principle of being. His ideas on eco-humanism and pluralistic ecumene could gain momentum if we opened ourselves to a more holistic and spiritual way of thinking, retaking Lovelock ' s conception of Gaia. However, Latour ' s new-materialistic interpretation of ' animism ' can be seen as a positive contribution to a new perspective of the world that definitively sets ' materialism ' aside.

TI  - Impact of Green Energy Transportation Systems on Urban Air Quality: A Predictive Analysis Using Spatiotemporal Deep Learning Techniques
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Transitioning to green energy transport systems, notably electric vehicles, is crucial to both combat climate change and enhance urban air quality in developing nations. Urban air quality is pivotal, given its impact on health, necessitating accurate pollutant forecasting and emission reduction strategies to ensure overall well-being. This study forecasts the influence of green energy transport systems on the air quality in Lahore and Islamabad, Pakistan, while noting the projected surge in electric vehicle adoption from less than 1% to 10% within three years. Predicting the impact of this change involves analyzing data before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdown led to minimal fossil fuel vehicle usage, resembling a green energy transportation scenario. The novelty of this work is twofold. Firstly, remote sensing data from the Sentinel-5P satellite were utilized to predict air quality index (AQI) trends before, during, and after COVID-19. Secondly, deep learning models, including long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM, and machine learning models, including decision tree and random forest regression, were utilized to forecast the levels of NO2, SO2, and CO in the atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that implementing green energy transportation systems in urban centers of developing countries can enhance air quality by approximately 98%. Notably, the bidirectional LSTM model outperformed others in predicting NO2 and SO2 concentrations, while the LSTM model excelled in forecasting CO concentration. These results offer valuable insights into predicting air pollution levels and guiding green energy policies to mitigate the adverse health effects of air pollution.

TI  - Safety and tolerability of KAN-101, a liver-targeted immune tolerance therapy, in patients with coeliac disease (ACeD): a phase 1 trial
T2  - LANCET GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Coeliac disease management is limited to strict adherence to a gluten-free diet with no approved therapies. This first-in-human phase 1 study evaluated the safety and tolerability of KAN-101, a liver-targeting glycosylation signature conjugated to a deaminated gliadin peptide designed to induce immune tolerance to gliadin.Methods Adults (aged 18-70 years) with biopsy-confirmed, HLA-DQ2.5 genotype coeliac disease were enrolled from clinical research units and hospitals in the USA. Part A of the trial was an open-label, single ascending dose study of intravenous KAN-101 using sentinel dosing in evaluation of the following cohorts: 0 center dot 15 mg/kg, 0 center dot 3 mg/kg, 0 center dot 6 mg/kg, 1 center dot 2 mg/kg, and 1 center dot 5 mg/kg. Following safety monitoring committee review of the 0 center dot 3 mg/kg dose level in part A, part B was initiated as a randomised, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study. In part B, interactive response technology was used to randomly assign (5:1) patients to receive intravenous KAN-101 (0 center dot 15 mg/kg, 0 center dot 3 mg/kg, or 0 center dot 6 mg/kg) or placebo following a 1:1 assignment of the first two eligible patients in each cohort for sentinel dosing. Patients in part B received three administrations of KAN-101 or placebo followed by a 3-day oral gluten challenge (9 g per day) 1 week after completing dosing. Study personnel and patients were masked to treatment assignments in part B, and not in part A. The primary endpoint was the incidence and severity of adverse events with escalating doses of KAN-101, assessed in all patients who received any amount of study drug based on dose level received. The secondary endpoint was assessment of plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of KAN-101 following single and multiple doses, assessed in all patients who received at least one dose and had one or more values for drug concentration. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, NCT04248855, and is completed.Findings Between Feb 7, 2020, and Oct 8, 2021, 41 patients were enrolled at ten US sites. 14 patients were assigned to part A (four 0 center dot 15 mg/kg, three 0 center dot 3 mg/kg, three 0 center dot 6 mg/kg, three 1 center dot 2 mg/kg, one 1 center dot 5 mg/kg) and 27 patients to part B (six 0 center dot 15 mg/kg with two placebo, seven 0 center dot 3 mg/kg with two placebo, and eight 0 center dot 6 mg/kg with two placebo). Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 11 (79%) of 14 patients in part A and 18 (67%) of 27 in part B (placebo two [33%] of six patients; KAN-101 16 [76%] of 21 patients), were grade 2 or lower, and were mild to moderate in severity. The most commonly observed adverse events were nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, consistent with symptoms had by patients with coeliac disease on gluten ingestion. No grade 3-4 adverse events, serious adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, or deaths occurred. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed KAN-101 was cleared from systemic circulation within roughly 6 h with a geometric mean half-life of 3.72 min (CV% 6 center dot 5%) to 31.72 min (83.7%), and no accumulation with repeated dosing.Interpretation KAN-101 has an acceptable safety profile in patients with coeliac disease with no dose-limiting toxicities and no maximum tolerated dose was observed. Rapid systemic clearance of KAN-101 was observed and no accumulation on repeated dosing. A future study will evaluate the safety and efficacy, including biomarker responses with a gluten challenge, of KAN-101 at doses 0 center dot 6 mg/kg and greater in patients with coeliac disease.Funding Kanyos Bio.Copyright (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.

TI  - Automatic Detection and Dynamic Analysis of Urban Heat Islands Based on Landsat Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Given rapid global urban development, increases to impervious surfaces, urban population growth, building construction, and energy consumption result in the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. However, the spatial extent of UHIs is not clearly mapped in many UHI studies based on a remote sensing approach. Therefore, we developed a method to extract the spatial extent of the UHI during the period from 2000 to 2021 in Nanjing, China, and explored the impact of urban two- and three-dimensional expansion on UHI spatial extent and UHI intensity. After cropland effects (i.e., bare soil) were eliminated, our proposed method combines the Getis-Ord-Gi* and the standard deviation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI STD) to extract the UHI area from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 images using land surface temperature (LST) spatial autocorrelation characteristics and the seasonal variation of vegetation. Our results show the following: (1) Bare farmland has a large influence on the extraction results of UHI-combined with the seasonal variation characteristics of NDVI STD, the impact of bare soil on UHI extraction was highly reduced, strongly improving the accuracy of UHI extraction. (2) The dynamics of the UHI area are consistent with the changes in the built-up area in Nanjing at both spatial and temporal scales, but with the increase of the urban green ratio, the UHI area of mature urban areas trends to decrease due to the cooling effect of green space. (3) The accumulation of population and GDP promote the vertical expansion of urban buildings. When the two-dimensional expansion of the city reaches saturation, the UHI intensity is primarily affected by three-dimensional urban expansion.

TI  - Application of a temporal decorrelation model using Sentinel-1 SAR data to Detect volcanic ash deposits related to the 2020 Taal volcano eruption
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic ash deposits affect buildings, vegetation, and population. After a volcanic eruption, it is critical to detect the areas affected by ash deposits to achieve an advisable management of the emergency. Optical sensors have been widely used to carry out this task, but they are limited by solar illumination and weather conditions. As an alternative, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are not affected by those limitations. Recently, a Temporal Decorrelation Model (TDM) that uses SAR data was proposed for detecting and mapping ash deposits, but it has only been applied to L-band data. Today there is available a huge quantity of C-band data acquired by the Sentinel-1 constellation. In this study we applied the TDM to Sentinel-1 data in order to assess its perfor-mance for detecting volcanic ash deposits after an eruption. We selected the eruption of Taal vol-cano in The Philippines on January 12, 2020, as our case study. We computed more than 4000 in-terferometric pairs from a dataset of 93 images acquired before, during, and after the eruption. Our results show that TDM can be applied to C-band data, despite the higher temporal decorrela-tion suffered by them. Our final probability map is consistent with the field evidence reported by the Philippines Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHILVOLCS) and the isopachs map re-ported in the literature. This new application provides a novel framework for the coherence ex-ploitation of C-Band data. Also, this approach could be applied to detection and monitoring of other natural disasters.

TI  - High-Frequency Ultrasound-Guided Temporal Fat Transplantation: A Safe and Visualized Approach
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Autologous fat injection is one of the most popular methods for the treatment of temporal depression; however, accurate puncture into the target layer without vascular compromise is hard to achieve. With the aid of high-frequency ultrasonography, the authors performed autologous fat transplantation after visualization in five cases, with satisfactory results. The authors observed the course of superficial temporal vessels, the orbitozygomatic artery, and sentinel veins preoperatively, and used high-frequency ultrasonography to guide lipotransfer into the desired layer intraoperatively, to avoid intravascular injection. With the aid of high-frequency ultrasonography, the authors can easily prevent vascular complications and personalize surgical procedures, as anatomical variations of vasculature can also be detected by means of this method.

TI  - Evaluating the Impact of Seismic Activity on the Slope Stability of the Western Coast of Lefkada Island Using Remote Sensing Techniques, Geographical Information Systems, and Field Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The current research aims to examine the long-term evolution of the western cliffs of Lefkada Island following the occurrence of the last two strong earthquakes, on 14 August 2003 and 17 November 2015, respectively. Medium resolution satellite data (Landsat) and very high-resolution data (Ikonos, Pleiades, and airphotos) were processed in Google Earth Engine and Erdas imagine software, respectively. The study area covers a 20 km-long region of the western cliffs of Lefkada Island, extending from Egremni beach to the South to Komilio beach to the North. Relief, vegetation, and inclination changes were detected in the ArcGis environment. The results were associated with in situ data provided through the installation of a sediment trap. The analysis of the results proved that seismicity is the main factor that formed the western coastline of Lefkada Island, affecting the integrity of the cliffs. Specifically, large earthquakes cause immediate vegetation and topographic (inclination changes, mass movements) modifications in the western cliffs of the island. Meanwhile, small earthquakes (magnitudes < 4.1) contribute to the cliff's evolution during the inter-seismic era. The intensity of these aforementioned changes was closely related to the seismic activity that occurred in the vicinity of the study area. In addition, it was found that precipitation and wind do not exert a similar influence on the cliff's evolution.

TI  - Glacier Change and Its Influencing Factors in the Northern Part of the Kunlun Mountains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The glaciers in northwest China are mainly distributed in the northern part of the Himalayas, the Kunlun Mountains, and the Tianshan Mountains. Glaciers are an important freshwater resource in the northern part of the Kunlun Mountains, and the melting of glaciers and snow provides an assured source of water for rivers on the southern edge of the Tarim Basin. Based on the first glacier inventory dataset on China (1968), the second glacier inventory dataset on China (2009), and the glacier inventory dataset on Western China in 2018, this study used DEM data, Landsat remote sensing images, and ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis data to investigate glacier change and its influencing factors with respect to the northern part of the Kunlun Mountains. The results showed that there were 9273 glaciers in the northern part of the Kunlun Mountains in 2018, with an area of about 11,762.72 km(2), an ice inventory of about 1168.53 km(3), and an average length per glacier of about 1.68 km. The glaciers were mainly distributed at altitudes of 5300-6100 m (7574.66 km(2)). From 1968 to 2018, the number of glaciers in the northern stretch of the Kunlun Mountains increased by 343, while the glacier area decreased by 2452.80 km(2) (-0.14%/a). From 2009 to 2018, the glacier area at the altitude of 4900 m to 6100 m decreased in the northern section of the Kunlun Mountains, and the glacier area at the remaining altitude increased slightly (10.67 km(2)). From 1968 to 2018, the glacier area and glacier length in all river basins decreased. The relative rate of glacier area change in the Qarqan River basin from 2009 to 2018 was five times that of 1968-2009, and this needs significant attention. From 1968 to 2018, both temperature and precipitation increased to varying degrees, and the increase in precipitation was beneficial to the accumulation of glaciers. Therefore, the increase in temperature was the main cause of glacier change in the northern section of the Kunlun Mountains.

TI  - Scale Analysis of Typhoon In-Fa (2021) Based on FY-4A Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) Observed and All-Sky-Simulated Brightness Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the Final Operational Global Analysis (FNL) data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the ERA5 reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, the all-sky brightness temperatures of the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) onboard the Fengyun-4A satellite (FY-4A) are simulated, which are then used to investigate Typhoon In-Fa (2021). The results show that the all-sky simulations based on ERA5 and FNL for FY-4A GIIRS channels 27 (716.25 cm(-1)), 90 (755.625 cm(-1)), and 417 (960 cm(-1)) can reproduce well the structure and intensity of Typhoon In-Fa. But the FNL simulations overestimate the typhoon intensity with more high ice clouds around the typhoon center. Fourier analysis of Typhoon In-Fa at severe tropical storm (STS) and typhoon (TY) stages is conducted. The results reveal that the dominant features of Typhoon In-Fa are primarily large-scale, with a relatively small proportion of observations and simulations dedicated to small-scale features at the STS stage. However, the proportion of large-scale features decreases while the amount of small-scale information increases during the TY stage. The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of FY-4A GIIRS all-sky simulations based on the ERA5 and FNL data, as well as to prepare for future all-sky data assimilations.

TI  - Fusion of Remotely-Sensed Fire-Related Indices for Wildfire Prediction through the Contribution of Artificial Intelligence
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are a natural phenomenon, which nowadays, due to the synergistic effect of increased human intervention and the escalation of climate change, are displaying an ever-increasing intensity and frequency. The underlying mechanisms present increased complexity, with the phenomenon itself being characterized by a significant degree of stochasticity. For the above reasons, machine learning models and neural networks are being implemented. In the current study, two types of neural networks are implemented, namely, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBF). These neural networks utilize information from the Fire Weather Index (FWI), Fosberg Fire Weather Index (FFWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), aiming to predict ignitions in a region of Greece. All indices have been developed through the Google Earth Engine platform (GEE). In addition, a new index is proposed named "Vegetation-Enhanced FWI" (FWIveg) in order to enhance the FWI with vegetation information from the NDVI. To increase the robustness of the methodology, a genetic algorithm-based approach was used in order to obtain algorithms for the calculation of the new index. Finally, an artificial neural network was implemented in order to predict the Mati wildfire in Attica, Greece (23 July 2018) by applying the new index FWIveg, aiming to assess both the effectiveness of the new index as well as the ability to predict ignition events using neural networks. Results highlight the effectiveness of the two indices in providing joint information for fire prediction through artificial intelligence-based approaches.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF GROUND DEFORMATION IN SOUTHERN SUMATRA USING INSAR AND GNSS DATA PROCESSING
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Great Sumatran Fault has different slip rate and therefore it is segmented from north to the south. The southern part of Sumatra had significant tectonic earthquakes due to subducting and faulting mechanism. Ground deformation is one indicator to understand the potential tectonic hazard and can be observed. This paper aims to explain the strategies of InSAR and GNSS data processing to estimate ground deformation in southern part of Sumatra. Sentinel-1 SAR data from 2018 to 2020 are collected and processed to reveal time series using LiCSBAS tool. In addition, continuous GNSS data that are available also processed using GAMIT software. It is found that the southern part of Sumatra at least has 2 different blocks with different velocity. The western block of eastern block moves towards South-East with velocity 2-4 mm/year. The velocity displacement shown by this method can easily observe changes in direction and speed over time, as well as tectonic events such as the Banten Earthquake that occurred in 2019.

TI  - Evaluation of the Relationship between Spatio-Temporal Variability of Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Fire Occurrence and Burnt Area in Mount Kenya Forest Reserve and National Park
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change, vegetation dynamics, human activities and forest management influence the occurrence of fires. This study investigated the spatio-temporal variability of the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and its influence on fire occurrence in three different land use types in Mount Kenya Forest Reserve and National Park (MKFRNP): National Park (NP), Forest Stations (FS) and Farmlands (FL). The study used MODIS satellite data to obtain the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the VCI, the number of fires and the burnt area. The specific objectives of this research were (i) to examine the spatio-temporal variability of VCI, fire occurrence and burnt area in MKFRNP from 2003 to 2018 and (ii) to explore the relationship between VCI, fire occurrence and burnt area in different areas of the MKFRNP (NP, FS and FL). The findings show that even though fires occur throughout the year in MKFRNP, most of the fires occur during dry seasons. The relationship between spatio-temporal fire occurrence and VCI distribution is different for each land use type. In the FL, the probability of fire ignition and the number of fires per month was more or less the same irrespective of the VCI because of the traditional use of fire as a land management tool. However, the probability of fire ignition and the number of fires per month is high in the NP and FS when the VCI is below 50% (drought), especially in the dry seasons, when and where the impact of meteorological conditions and climate have much more impact than human activities. In addition to the efforts already made by communities, KFS and KWS in the fire fighting and monitoring system, satellite data can be useful to acquire accurate and timely information on the VCI and the likely spatio-temporal occurrence of fires in order to be prepared in the most fire-prone periods and improve fire management, the planning of resources and fire suppression activities in MKFRNP.

TI  - Towards the invasion of wild and rural forested areas in Gabon (Central Africa) by the Asian tiger mosquito <i>Aedes albopictus</i>: Potential risks from the one health perspective
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSince its first record in urban areas of Central-Africa in the 2000s, the invasive mosquito, Aedes albopictus, has spread throughout the region, including in remote villages in forested areas, causing outbreaks of Aedes-borne diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya. Such invasion might enhance Ae. albopictus interactions with wild animals in forest ecosystems and favor the spillover of zoonotic arboviruses to humans.The aim of this study was to monitor Ae. albopictus spread in the wildlife reserve of La Lope National Park (Gabon), and evaluate the magnitude of the rainforest ecosystem colonization. MethodologyFrom 2014 to 2018, we used ovitraps, larval surveys, BG-Sentinel traps, and human landing catches along an anthropization gradient from La Lope village to the natural forest in the Park. ConclusionsWe detected Ae. albopictus in gallery forest up to 15 km away from La Lope village. However, Ae. albopictus was significantly more abundant at anthropogenic sites than in less anthropized areas. The number of eggs laid by Ae. albopictus decreased progressively with the distance from the forest fringe up to 200m inside the forest. Our results suggested that in forest ecosystems, high Ae. albopictus density is mainly observed at interfaces between anthropized and natural forested environments. Additionally, our data suggested that Ae. albopictus may act as a bridge vector of zoonotic pathogens between wild and anthropogenic compartments.Author summarySince its first record in urban areas of Central Africa in the 2000s, the anthropophilic and invasive mosquito, Aedes albopictus, has continued to spread across remote rural areas and has promoted outbreaks of Aedes-borne diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Such invasion might enhance Ae. albopictus interactions with wild animals in forests neighboring villages and favor the spillover of zoonotic arboviruses to humans.In this study, we reported the sustained spread of the Ae. albopictus in the wildlife reserve of La Lope National Park (LNP, Gabon), and we evaluated the magnitude of its colonization of this rainforest ecosystem. Using various sampling methods between 2014 and 2018, we detected Ae. albopictus presence in wild forest galleries up to 15 km away from La Lope, the main inhabited village within the park limits. We demonstrated that Ae. albopictus can invade forest ecosystems where the human presence is low or absent. These data indicate that Ae. albopictus may interact with wild animals and act as a bridge vector of zoonotic pathogens between the wild and anthropogenic compartments. However, our results showed that Ae. albopictus population density is higher at interfaces between the village and the forest. This suggests that this species might be present at the interface between anthropized and wild environments where the probability of contact with wild animals is increased, and consequently the likelihood of contributing to sylvatic and bridge transmission of pathogens. Our results also suggested that the presence of humans facilitates the colonization of natural forested habitat by this invasive species.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of antibody level against Lyme disease bacteria in roe deer: Tale of a sentinel?
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the risk of exposure to infectious disease agents can be tracked through variations in antibody prevalence in vertebrate host populations. However, information on the temporal dynamics of the immune status of individuals is critical. If antibody levels persist a long time after exposure to an infectious agent, they could enable the efficient detection of the past circulation of the agent; if they persist only a short time, they could provide snap shots of recent exposure of sampled hosts. Here, we explored the temporal dynamics of seropositivity against Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) in individuals of a widespread medium-sized mammal species, the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), in France. Using a modified commercially available immunoassay we tested 1554 blood samples obtained in two wild deer populations monitored from 2010 to 2020. Using multi-event capture-mark-recapture models, we estimated yearly population-, age-, and sex-specific rates of seroconversion and seroreversion after accounting for imperfect detection. The yearly seroconversion rates indicated a higher level of exposure in early (2010-2013) than in late years (2014-2019) to infected tick bites in both populations, without any detectable influence of sex or age. The relatively high rates of seroreversion indicated a short-term persistence of antibody levels against Bbsl in roe deer. This was confirmed by the analysis of samples collected on a set of captive individuals that were resampled several times a few weeks apart. Our findings show the potential usefulness of deer as a sentinel for tracking the risk of exposure to Lyme disease Bbsl, although further investigation on the details of the antibody response to Bbsl in this incompetent host would be useful. Our study also highlights the value of combining long-term capture-mark-recapture sampling and short-time analyses of serological data for wildlife populations exposed to infectious agents of relevance to wildlife epidemiology and human health.

TI  - Deforestation and Its Effect on Surface Albedo and Weather Patterns
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is an important environmental problem and a key promoter of regional climate change through modifying the surface albedo. The objective of this research was to characterize the impact of deforestation and land use changes on surface albedo (& alpha;) and climate patterns in a tropical highland region of Mexico, between the years 2014 and 2021. The main land cover types are coniferous forests (CF), oak and gallery woodlands (OGW), and annual agriculture (AA), which represent more than 88% of the regional territory. We used 2014 and 2021 Landsat 8 OLI images with topographic and atmospheric correction in order to develop an inventory of albedo values for each land cover type in both time scenarios. Albedo images were generated by using the equation proposed by Liang in 2001, which is based on the reflectance of the bands 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. Differences in albedo values were calculated between the years 2014 and 2021, and those differences were correlated with variations in climate parameters, for which we used climate data derived from the WRF model. In addition, the different land use changes found were classified in terms of triggers for increasing or decreasing surface albedo. We used the Mann-Whitney U Test to compare the 2021 - 2014 climatic deviations in two samples: Sample A, which included sites without albedo change in 2021; and Sample B, including sites with albedo change in 2021. Results showed that between 2014 and 2021, at least 38 events of land use change or deforestation occurred, with albedo increments between 1 and 11%, which triggered an average increment of 2.16% (p < 0.01; Mann-Whitney U Test) of the regional surface albedo in comparison to the 2014 scenario. In this period, the albedo for CF, OGW, and AA also increased significantly (p < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U Test) by +79, +12, and +9%, respectively. In addition, the regional albedo increment was found to be significant and negatively correlated (p < 0.01 Spearman's coefficient) with relative humidity (RH), maximum temperature (Tmax), and minimum temperature (Tmin), and correlated (p < 0.01) positively with diurnal temperature range (DTR). The Mann-Whitney U Test revealed that 2021 climatic variations in Sample B sites are statistically different (p < 0.05) to 2021 climatic variations in Sample A sites, which demonstrates that albedo changes are linked to a decrease in minimum temperature and relative humidity and an increase in DTR. Conversion of CF and OGW into AA, perennial agriculture (PA), or grassland (GR) always yielded an albedo increment, whilst the conversion of AA to irrigation agriculture (IA) or PA triggered a decrease in albedo, and finally, the pass from GR or AA to protected agriculture (PA) caused albedo to increase or decrease, depending on the greenhouse covers materials. Reducing deforestation of CF and OGW, conversion of AA or GR into PA, and selecting adequate greenhouse covers could help to mitigate regional climate change.

TI  - Quantification of Mountainous Hydrological Processes in the Aktash River Watershed of Uzbekistan, Central Asia, over the Past Two Decades
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of hydrological processes is critical to water resource management, water supply planning, ecological protection, and climate change impact assessment. Mountains in Central Asia are the major source of water for rivers and agricultural practices. The disturbance of mountain forests in the region has altered the hydrological processes and accelerated soil erosion, mudflow, landslides, and flooding. We used the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model calibrated and validated with remote sensing data to quantify the mountainous hydrological processes in the Aktash River watershed (ARW) of Uzbekistan, Central Asia. Simulations showed that the daily surface runoff and streamflow closely responded to daily precipitation. Groundwater discharge reached its maximum in winter because of snowmelt. The wet months were from July to December, and the dry months were from January to June. The magnitudes of the seasonal hydrological processes were in the following order: fall > summer > winter > spring for precipitation and surface runoff; summer > spring > fall > winter for evapotranspiration (ET); winter > spring > fall > summer for snowmelt; fall > winter > summer > spring for water yield and streamflow; and winter > fall > spring > summer for groundwater discharge. The Mann-Kendall statistical test revealed a significant increasing trend for the annual precipitation (t = 0.45, p < 0.01) and surface runoff (t = 0.41, p < 0.02) over the past 17 years from 2003 to 2019. Compared to rangeland, forested land decreased monthly and annual average surface runoff by 20%, and increased monthly and annual average groundwater recharge by about 5%. Agricultural land had much higher unit-area values (mm/km(2)/y) of ET, groundwater recharge, and water yield than those of urban, forest, and range lands. Our research findings provide useful information to farmers, foresters, and decision makers for better water resource management in the ARW, Central Asia, and other mountain watersheds with similar conditions.

TI  - Improving SAR wind retrieval through automatic anomalous pixel detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations are increasingly in demand and valuable for monitoring the ocean and coastal winds in near-real-time and analyzing the data historically. However, soared up human activities, man-made constructions, and marine traffics negatively interfere and affect the reliability of observations and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of using satellite winds for many applications, such as offshore wind energy, even though Sentinel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is freely and easily accessible. In this paper, we presented a novel methodological framework for localization and suppression of anomalous pixels (APs), which deteriorate the confidence and accuracy of the retrieved SAR wind speeds. The backbone of the implementation relied on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm, one of the automatic target recognition algorithms. We used a large dataset of SAR subscenes to model different sea clutter conditions after removing the potential targets. We selected the suitable distribution model that maintains a constant probability of false alarm (pfa) for the entire SAR scene. The proper pfa was optimized in various SAR scenes ranging from scenes with a considerable number of APs, such as ships and wind park clusters, to scenes with no visible APs under different wind speed conditions. The pfa optimization process prevented real wind pixels from being misidentified as APs. Applying CFAR to the logarithmic scale of raw digital numbers (log-DNs) domain with a pfa of about 3.17 x 10-5, we extracted SAR wind speeds around each ocean buoy before and after CFAR process, comparing them with their corresponding in situ wind measurements. This led to significant improvement in the quality and accuracy of SAR wind data retrieval, especially in regions with numerous man-made constructions and high marine traffics. We tested and validated our approach in the North Sea and two regions along the eastern coast of the U.S. The enclosed region, serving as a marine route for harbors in Delaware Bay, showed a substantial improvement in RMSE and BIAS after applying our approach, reducing RMSE from 2.4 m/s to 1.6 m/s and the BIAS from -1.5 m/s to -0.3 m/s. The open ocean region demonstrated stable RMSE and BIAS, indicating preservation of real wind data, as only APs affecting SAR wind speed were considered during the process.

TI  - Predicting the Surface Soil Texture of Cultivated Land via Hyperspectral Remote Sensing and Machine Learning: A Case Study in Jianghuai Hilly Area
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil reflectance spectra and hyperspectral images have great potential to monitor and evaluate soil texture in large-scale scenarios. In hilly areas, sand, clay, and silt have similar spectral characteristics in visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) reflection spectra. Soil texture spectra belong to mixed spectra despite some differences in particle size, mineral composition, and water content, making their distinction difficult. The accurate identification of the content within different particle sizes is difficult as it involves capturing spectral reflection features. Therefore, this study aimed to predict soil texture content through machine learning and unmixing the soil texture's spectra while also comparing their respective modelling performances. Taking typical cultivated land in the Jianghuai hills as an example, the GaoFen-5 Advanced Hyperspectral Imaging (GF-5 AHSI) laboratory spectra of soil samples were used to predict sand, silt, and clay particle contents using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The entire spectra of VNIR-SWIR regions were smoothed, and the dimensions were reduced via principal component analysis (PCA). The prediction models of sand, silt, and clay particle content were constructed, and inversion maps were generated using AHSI. The results showed that the PCA-CNN model achieved a higher prediction precision than the PCA-PLSR in both ASD and GF-5 data. Clay content exhibited the highest predictive performance with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.948 and 0.908 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 26.51 g/kg and 31.24 g/kg, respectively, which represented a 39.0% and 79.8% increase in R-2 and a 57% and 57.1% decrease in RMSE compared to that of the PCA-PLSR. This method indicates that the PCA-CNN model can effectively achieve nonlinear interactions between multiple spectral components and better model and fit spectral mixing processes; moreover, it provides an alternative method for investigating the spatial distribution of soil texture.

TI  - A Control Algorithm for Tapering Charging of Li-Ion Battery in Geostationary Satellites
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, as the satellite data service market has grown significantly, satellite demand has been rapidly increasing. Demand for geostationary satellites with weather observation, communication broadcasting, and GPS missions is also increasing. Completing the charging process of the Li-ion battery during the sun period is one of the main tasks of the electrical power system in geostationary satellites. In the case of the electrical power system of low Earth orbit satellites, the Li-ion battery is connected to the DC/DC converter output, and the charging process is completed through CV control. However, in the case of the regulated bus of the DET type, which is mainly used in the electrical power system of geostationary satellites, a Li-ion battery is connected to the input of the DC/DC converter. Therefore, a method other than the CV control of the DC/DC converter is required. This paper proposes a control algorithm for tapering charging of the Li-ion battery in the regulated bus of the DET type for Li-ion battery charge completion operation required by space-level design standards. In addition, the proposed control algorithm is verified through an experiment on a geostationary satellite's ground electrical test platform. The experiment verified that it has a power conversion efficiency of 99.5% from the solar array to the battery. It has 21 tapering steps at the equinox and 17 tapering steps at the solstice.

TI  - Native predators can learn new prey cues to overcome naivete and hunt novel alien prey
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological invasions continue to rise globally, increasing the frequency of novel ecological interactions and the potential for naivete. Native predators can defend against invasion by alien prey species through biotic resistance, but initial predator naivete towards novel alien prey can allow prey to establish. Here we test if predator naivete can be overcome via a learned association between novel prey cues and a food reward, and if this conditioning increases predator motivation to hunt novel alien prey. We exposed free-living native bush rats (Rattus fuscipes) to repeated bouts of novel alien cockroach (Nauphoeta cinerea) odour and food rewards over an 11-day training period. We then conducted a simulated invasion, comparing the survival rates of sentinel cockroach prey in sites with trained and untrained rats. Cockroaches in sites with trained rats were 46 % more likely to be found and consumed over the invasion period than prey in sites with untrained rats. Also, the number of food rewards taken during training was correlated with the number of prey consumed on the first night of the invasion. Our results suggest that predators can overcome their naivete to novel prey through learning and that pre-exposing free-living predators to novel prey cues can subsequently increase predation rates on novel alien prey.

TI  - Focal Mechanism and Regional Fault Activity Analysis of 2022 Luding Strong Earthquake Constraint by InSAR and Its Inversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 5 September 2022, an Ms6.8 magnitude earthquake occurred in Luding County, Sichuan Province, China. Based on Sentinel-1 SAR images, this paper uses the D-InSAR approach to obtain the displacement field of the earthquake, invert the coseismic sliding distribution, and then calculate the static coulomb stress changes of the coseismic deformation on the aftershock distribution and surrounding faults. Further, the seismic structure is analyzed and discussed. The InSAR coseismic deformation field demonstrates that the maximum LoS displacement of the surface deformation caused by the Luding earthquake is about 15 cm. The Luding Ms 6.8 earthquake is dominated by the Moxi fault, which is a left-lateral strike-slip fault that ruptures along the NNW-SSE trend at about 160.3 degrees, and the dip is 81 degrees. The fault depth is mainly 5 similar to 15 km, the maximum sliding amount is about 174.8 cm, and the corresponding depth is 8.5 km. The seismic moment tensor obtained by inversion is 1.06 x 10(19) Nm, Mw = 6.65. The Coulomb stress generated by the Luding earthquake on the northern end of the Anninghe fault zone exceeded the trigger threshold. The risk of the Anninghe fault's future earthquake was greater, and continuous monitoring and risk assessment were required.

TI  - Unraveling the Ecological Tapestry: A Comprehensive Assessment of Changtang Nature Reserve's Ecological and Environmental Using RSEI and GEE
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Changtang Nature Reserve, located in the hinterland of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, plays a crucial role in researching ecological and environmental assessment on the plateau. However, the severe natural conditions in the Changtang Plateau have resulted in the absence of meteorological observation stations within the reserve, thereby leading to a lack of fundamental ecological and environmental research data. Remote sensing technology presents an opportunity for ecological monitoring in the Changtang Nature Reserve. In this study, remote sensing ecological indices (RSEI) were utilized to evaluate the ecological environment of the reserve from 2000 to 2020. The MODIS data reconstructed using the Savitzky-Golay filter on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform were employed. Principal component analysis was then conducted to construct the RSEI. The results reveal that the overall ecological environment quality in the Changtang Nature Reserve between 2000 and 2020 was relatively poor. Over the past two decades, the mean RSEI of the reserve exhibited a fluctuating trend of decrease and increase, indicating a deteriorating and subsequently improving ecological environment quality. Specifically, during the period of 2000-2010, the RSEI mean decreased from 0.3197 to 0.2269, suggesting degradation of the ecological environment, and the proportion of areas classified as fair and poor increased by 51.99%, while the proportion of areas classified as good and excellent decreased by 32.69%. However, from 2010 to 2020, it increased from 0.2269 to 0.3180, indicating an improvement in the ecological environment, and the proportion of areas classified as good and excellent increased by 6.11%, while the proportion of areas classified as fair and poor decreased by 2.91%. Spatially, the core zone demonstrated higher ecological environment quality compared to the experimental and buffer zones. The findings of this study provide comprehensive and accurate information about the ecological environment, which supports management, decision-making, and emergency response efforts in the Changtang Nature Reserve. Moreover, it offers a scientific basis for conservation and sustainable development strategies in the reserve. The quantitative assessment of the ecological environment dynamics contributes to the understanding of the reserve's ecological dynamics and facilitates informed decision-making for effective conservation and management practices.

TI  - Automated glacier extraction using a Transformer based deep learning approach from multi-sensor remote sensing imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers serve as sensitive indicators of climate change, making accurate glacier boundary delineation crucial for understanding their response to environmental and local factors. However, traditional semi-automatic remote sensing methods for glacier extraction lack precision and fail to fully leverage multi-source data. In this study, we propose a Transformer-based deep learning approach to address these limitations. Our method employs a U-Net architecture with a Local-Global Transformer (LGT) encoder and multiple Local-Global CNN Blocks (LGCB) in the decoder. The model design aims to integrate both global and local information. Training data for the model were generated using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, Sentinel-2 multispectral data, High Mountain Asia (HMA) Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission(SRTM) DEM. The ground truth was obtained for a glaciated area of 1498.06 km2 in the Qilian mountains using classic band ratio and manual delineation based on 2 m resolution GaoFen (GF) imagery. A series of experiments including the com-parison between different models, model modules and data combinations were conducted to evaluate the model accuracy. The best overall accuracy achieved was 0.972. Additionally, our findings highlight the significant contribution of Sentinel-2 data to glacier extraction.

TI  - Landsat-7 ETM+, Landsat-8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 MSI Surface Reflectance Cross-Comparison and Harmonization over the Mediterranean Basin Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Mediterranean area, vegetation dynamics and phenology analysed over a long time can have an important role in highlighting changes in land use and cover as well as the effect of climate change. Over the last 30 years, remote sensing has played an essential role in bringing about these changes thanks to many types of observations and techniques. Satellite images are to be considered an important tool to grasp these dynamics and evaluate them in an inexpensive and multidisciplinary way thanks to Landsat and Sentinel satellite constellations. The integration of these tools holds a dual potential: on the one hand, allowing us to obtain a longer historical series of reflectance data, while on the other hand making data available with a higher frequency even within a specific timeframe. The study aims to conduct a comprehensive cross-comparison analysis of long-time-series pixel values in the Mediterranean regions. For this scope comparisons between Landsat-7 (ETM+), Landsat-8 (OLI), and Sentinel-2 (MSI) satellite sensors were conducted based on surface reflectance products. We evaluated these differences using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Major Axis linear regression (RMA) analysis on points extracted from over 15,000 images across the Mediterranean basin area from 2017 to 2020. Minor but consistent differences were noted, necessitating the formulation of suitable adjustment equations to better align Sentinel-2 reflectance values with those of Landsat-7 or Landsat-8. The results of the analysis are compared with the most-used harmonization coefficients proposed in the literature, revealing significant differences. The root-mean-square deviation, the mean difference and the orthogonal distance regression (ODR) slope show an improvement of the parameters for both models used (OLS and RMA) in this study. The discrepancies in reflectance values leads to corresponding variations in the estimation of biophysical parameters, such as NDVI, showing an increase in the ODR slope of 0.3. Despite differences in spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics, we demonstrate that integration of these datasets is feasible through the application of band-wise regression corrections for a sensitive and heterogeneous area like those of the Mediterranean basin area.

TI  - Advances in Earth observation and machine learning for quantifying blue carbon
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (mangroves, seagrasses and saltmarshes) are highly productive coastal habitats, and are considered some of the most carbon-dense ecosystems on Earth. They are an important nature-based solution for both climate change mitigation and adaptation. Quantifying blue carbon stocks and assessing their dynamics at large scales through remote sensing remains challenging due to difficulties of cloud coverage, spectral, spatial and temporal limitations of multispectral sensors and speckle noise of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Recent advances in airborne and space-borne multispectral and SAR imagery and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, sensor platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), combined with novel machine learning techniques have offered different users with a wide-range of spectral, spatial, and multi-temporal information for quantifying blue carbon from space. However, a large number of challenges are posed by various traits such as atmospheric correction, water penetration, and water column transparency issues in coastal environments, the multi-dimensionality and size of the multispectral and LiDAR data, the limitation of training samples, and backscattering mechanisms of SAR imagery in the acquisition process. As a result, existing methodologies face major difficulties in accurately estimating blue carbon stocks using these datasets. In this context, emerging and innovative machine learning and artificial intelligence methodologies are often required for robustness and reliability of blue carbon estimates, particularly those using open-source software for signal processing and regression tasks. This review provides an overview of Earth Observation data, machine learning and state-of-theart deep learning techniques that are currently being used to quantify above-ground carbon, below-ground carbon, and soil carbon stocks of mangroves, seagrasses and saltmarshes ecosystems. Some key limitations and future directions for the potential use of data fusion combined with advanced machine learning, deep learning, and metaheuristic optimisation techniques for quantifying blue carbon stocks are also highlighted. In summary, the quantification of blue carbon using remote sensing and machine learning approaches holds great potential in contributing to global efforts towards mitigating climate change and protecting coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Genomic Analysis of <i>Yersinia pestis</i> Strains from Brazil: Search for Virulence Factors and Association with Epidemiological Data
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Yersinia pestis, the etiological agent of the plague, is considered a genetically homogeneous species. Brazil is currently in a period of epidemiological silence but plague antibodies are still detected in sentinel animals, suggesting disease activity in the sylvatic cycle. The present study deployed an in silico approach to analyze virulence factors among 407 Brazilian genomes of Y. pestis belonging to the Fiocruz Collection (1966-1997). The pangenome analysis associated several known virulence factors of Y. pestis in clades according to the presence or absence of genes. Four main strain clades (C, E, G, and H) exhibited the absence of various virulence genes. Notably, clade G displayed the highest number of absent genes, while clade E showed a significant absence of genes related to the T6SS secretion system and clade H predominantly demonstrated the absence of plasmid-related genes. These results suggest attenuation of virulence in these strains over time. The cgMLST analysis associated genomic and epidemiological data highlighting evolutionary patterns related to the isolation years and outbreaks of Y. pestis in Brazil. Thus, the results contribute to the understanding of the genetic diversity and virulence within Y. pestis and the potential for utilizing genomic data in epidemiological investigations.

TI  - Low-grade Hidradenocarcinomas A Clinicopathologic Study of an Unusual Carcinoma That Can Mimic its Benign Counterpart
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hidradenocarcinomas are rare cutaneous adnexal malignancies with sweat gland differentiation that can show a broad spectrum of histomorphologic appearances, ranging from low to high grade. The diagnosis of low-grade hidradenocarcinoma can be challenging and may be mistaken for benign hidradenomas, especially on superficial and partial samples. We performed a retrospective analysis of 16 low-grade hidradenocarcinomas, obtained from 4 large academic institutions. All neoplasms presented clinically as nodular lesions that ranged in size from 1.5 to 6.0 cm. All patients were adults and their age ranged from 33 to 74 years of age. All cases shared features similar to hidradenomas in the surface and mid portion of the tumors and all tumors had 1 or more histomorphologic clues to malignancy, including the presence of an asymmetric and infiltrative growth pattern (especially at the base of the tumors), perineurial invasion, and a desmoplastic stromal reaction. In the tumors evaluated for immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were positive for p63, EMA, AE1/AE3, MNF116, and CK7. Three patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, and 2 cases showed metastatic disease to regional lymph nodes. All cases (including the 2 cases that had regional lymph node metastasis), showed no local recurrence or distant metastasis observed after a complete re-excision of the tumors (follow-up range from 6 to 72 mo). Our study highlights the salient clinical and histopathologic features of low-grade hidradenocarcinomas and emphasizes the potential diagnostic pitfalls in distinguishing this entity from other neoplasms. Our results indicate that a combination of thorough histopathologic inspection is necessary to support the diagnosis of this rare neoplasm. These tumors can be exceedingly difficult to diagnose and awareness of the subtle features of low-grade hidradenocarcinoma is of importance are as it remains a diagnostic challenge for practicing pathologists.

TI  - The Presence of a Sentinel' Vessel as an Anatomical Reference during Hamstring Tendon Harvesting-A Prospective Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The identification of the branch of the inferior medial genicular artery (bIMGA) in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions (ACLRs) has previously been considered a landmark by some surgeons, but its consistency remains debated. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the variability in the appearance and location of bIMGA and to assess its validity as a reliable landmark during hamstring tendon harvesting procedures. Methods: This prospective, single-center study comprised 213 patients who underwent ACLR over a period of two years. The surgical procedures were conducted by the same surgical team, maintaining uniformity in the approach. The study sought correlations between patient demographics, level of activity, and the potential for successful identification of the bIMGA. Results: A statistically significant association between patient activity levels and successful identification of the bIMGA (p = 0.035) was observed. No significant correlations were found concerning patient demographic characteristics. bIMGA demonstrated a substantial degree of anatomical variability, rendering its consistent identification in the surgical field challenging. Conclusions: Given the observed variability and the associated difficulty in its identification, the use of the bIMGA as a dependable anatomical reference during ACL graft harvesting is not recommended. This study confirms the inconsistency of bIMGA as a traditional landmark, underscoring the need for research aimed at identifying more consistent and reliable anatomical references to enhance the precision of surgical interventions in ACLR.

TI  - Effect of Spatial and Spectral Scaling on Joint Characterization of the Spectral Mixture Residual: Comparative Analysis of AVIRIS and WorldView-3 SWIR for Geologic Mapping in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A geologic map is both a visual depiction of the lithologies and structures occurring at the Earth's surface and a representation of a conceptual model for the geologic history in a region. The work needed to capture such multifaced information in an accurate geologic map is time consuming. Remote sensing can complement traditional primary field observations, geochemistry, chronometry, and subsurface geophysical data in providing useful information to assist with the geologic mapping process. Two novel sources of remote sensing data are particularly relevant for geologic mapping applications: decameter-resolution imaging spectroscopy (spectroscopic imaging) and meter-resolution multispectral shortwave infrared (SWIR) imaging. Decameter spectroscopic imagery can capture important mineral absorptions but is frequently unable to spatially resolve important geologic features. Meter-resolution multispectral SWIR images are better able to resolve fine spatial features but offer reduced spectral information. Such disparate but complementary datasets can be challenging to integrate into the geologic mapping process. Here, we conduct a comparative analysis of spatial and spectral scaling for two such datasets: one Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Classic (AVIRIS-classic) flightline, and one WorldView-3 (WV3) scene, for a geologically complex landscape in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, California. To do so, we use a two-stage framework that synthesizes recent advances in the spectral mixture residual and joint characterization. The mixture residual uses the wavelength-explicit misfit of a linear spectral mixture model to capture low variance spectral signals. Joint characterization utilizes nonlinear dimensionality reduction (manifold learning) to visualize spectral feature space topology and identify clusters of statistically similar spectra. For this study area, the spectral mixture residual clearly reveals greater spectral dimensionality in AVIRIS than WorldView (99% of variance in 39 versus 5 residual dimensions). Additionally, joint characterization shows more complex spectral feature space topology for AVIRIS than WorldView, revealing information useful to the geologic mapping process in the form of mineralogical variability both within and among mapped geologic units. These results illustrate the potential of recent and planned imaging spectroscopy missions to complement high-resolution multispectral imagery-along with field and lab observations-in planning, collecting, and interpreting the results from geologic field work.

TI  - Christian Denominations on the Territory of Ukraine in the First Half of the 20th Century (1900-1939)
T2  - OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON RELIGION IN EASTERN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the state of Christian denominations in the territory of Ukraine in the first half of the 20th century. It has been established that the Christian religion occupied an important place in the life of Ukrainian society. However, the period of prosperity and oppression simultaneously fell in the first 40 years of the 20th century. The confessional policy of the Soviet Union, which came to replace the tsarist authorities, gave a limited privileged position for some Christian churches while creating harsh conditions for other denominations. As a rule, these were Protestant movements, but the Orthodox Church also experienced oppression and persecution during the formation of the Soviet regime. This tended to exacerbate inter-confessional disputes and to create various methods for the eradication of a religious worldview on the territory of Ukraine.

TI  - Balancing Differences through Highlighting the Common: Religious Education Teachers' Perceptions of the Diversity of Islam in Islamic Religious Education in Finnish State Schools
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Muslims are Finland's largest and fastest-growing religious minority. In Finnish state schools, the number of pupils studying Islamic religious education (IRE) has almost doubled in a decade, and IRE has its own national curriculum, which is based on the general principles of Islam. Pupils are diverse in terms of their languages, cultures, ethnicities and in their religious and worldview backgrounds, religious diversity being reflected in the religious education curriculum content in which the diversity of Islam is addressed. In this study, we examine the diversity of Islam in IRE. The research results are based on interviews with IRE teachers (N = 17) working in comprehensive schools in the capital region of Finland, and we use data-driven content analysis to explore teachers' perceptions. This study shows that IRE teachers use balancing pedagogical tools in order to deal with the diversity of Islam. According to the findings of our study, dealing with this diversity in religious education requires a dialogicity that both highlights and blurs differences related to diversity. Religion-related dialogue in IRE provides an arena for a balanced discussion about religious differences as well as what they have in common.

TI  - Greening rate in North Korea doubles South Korea
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - South and North Korea have experienced contrasting economic developments since the 1950s while sharing similar climates. Previous studies revealed an overall long-term greening trend across the Korean Peninsula based on greenness data from coarse-resolution satellite images. However, there has been no comprehensive comparison of the greenness patterns and the driving mechanisms between two countries due to the limitations of coarse-resolution satellite data. Here, we performed cross-calibration among Landsat sensors and adopted a phenology-based approach to generate Landsat annual maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVImax) time series for each pixel from 1986 to 2017. We found that over 1986-2017, the greening rate in North Korea was almost twice that of South Korea. Cropland in South Korea is the main source of the greening discrepancy. The expansion of agricultural facilities in the stable cropland area and urbanization in the cropland loss area of South Korea contributed 57% to the significant negative NDVImax trend, which was dominant over the forest NDVImax increase resulting from rising temperatures, CO2 fertilization effects and afforestation projects. However, in North Korea, CO2 fertilization effects in the stable cropland area and transition from grassland to cropland promoted an increase in NDVImax, despite decreasing NDVImax in forest areas due to deforestation. Our results highlight the need for delineating fine-scale land-use changes to advance our understanding of regional vegetation dynamics.

TI  - CP-GEP (Merlin) gene expression profiling: can my melanoma patient forgo sentinel lymph node biopsy?
T2  - ITALIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma risk stratification is crucial for both patients and physicians. Patients want to understand what to expect after diagnosis, and physi-cians need to decide on an appropriate treatment plan. Traditionally, risk stratification has been based on Breslow thickness and sentinel lymph node (SLN) status. However, the introduction of CP-GEP (Merlin) has provided a molecular test that can be performed on primary melanoma diagnostic biopsy tissue, offering additional risk stratification beyond established variables. In this review, we assess the utility of CP-GEP test-ing compared to clinicopathologic variables and SLN status and propose a multilayered approach to selecting patients for adjuvant therapy using CP-GEP technology.

TI  - Applying Remote Sensing Methods to Estimate Alterations in Land Cover Change and Degradation in the Desert Regions of the Southeast Iberian Peninsula
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous drylands worldwide have experienced degradation of both soil and vegetation in proximity to watering areas. Degradation can be observed in satellite imagery as fading radial brightness belts extending away from the water sources. The main objective of this study was to examine the spatio-temporal patterns of land degradation and rehabilitation in the drylands of the southeast Iberian Peninsula. The brightness index of tasseled cap was discovered to be the best form of spectral transformation for enhancing the contrast between the bright-degraded areas near the points and the darker surrounding areas far from and in between these areas. To comprehend the spatial structure present in spaceborne imagery of two desert sites and three key time periods, semi-variograms were created (mid-late 2000s, around 2015 and 2020). To assess spatio-temporal land-cover patterns, a kriging was used to smooth the brightness index values extracted from 30 m spatial resolution images. To assess the direction and intensity of changes between study periods, a change detection analysis based on kriging prediction maps was performed. These findings were linked to the socioeconomic situation prior to and following the EU economic crisis. The study discovered that degradation occurred in some areas as a result of the region's agricultural activities being exploited.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose:To describe the clinical characteristics and multimodal imaging features of a distinctive subtype of active idiopathic multifocal choroiditis (iMFC) lesions with grey-yellow chorioretinal lesions surrounded by smaller satellite dots, a presentation referred to as "chrysanthemum lesions."Methods:Retrospective, observational, multicenter case series of eyes with active iMFC and chrysanthemum lesions. Multimodal imaging features were reviewed and presented.Results:Twenty-five eyes from 20 patients (12 women and 8 men), with a mean age of 35.8 & PLUSMN; 17.0 years (range, 7-78 years) were included. Chrysanthemum lesions were equally located in the macula (48.0%) or the mid/far periphery (52.0%). The number of lesions per eye varied from 1 (16.0%) to more than 20 (56.0%). On optical coherence tomography, chrysanthemum lesions showed typical features of iMFC, including subretinal hyperreflective material splitting the retinal pigment epithelium/Bruch membrane. Chrysanthemum lesions were hypoautofluorescent on fundus autofluorescence imaging, hyperfluorescent on fluorescein angiography, hypofluorescent on indocyanine green angiography, and associated with choriocapillaris flow signal deficit on optical coherence tomography angiography.Conclusion:Active iMFC may present with findings resembling chrysanthemum lesions. The distinctive lesion morphology on ophthalmoscopic examination, the large number of lesions, and the high prevalence of exclusive midperipheral and far peripheral involvement may represent a distinctive phenotype of iMFC.

TI  - Exploring the land-use urban heat island nexus under climate change conditions using machine learning approach: A spatio-temporal analysis of remotely sensed data
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization strongly correlates with land use land cover (LULC) dynamics, which further links to changes in land surface temperature (LST) & urban heat island (UHI) intensity. Each LULC type influences UHI differently with changing climate, therefore knowing this impact & connection is critical. To understand such relations, long temporal studies using remote sensing data play promising role by analysing the trend with continuity over vast area. Therefore, this study is aimed at machine learning centred spatio-temporal analysis of LST and land use indices to identify their intra-urban interaction during 1991-2021 (summer) in Imola city (specifically representing small urban environment) using Landsat-5/8 imageries. It was found that LST in 2021 increased by 38.36% from 1991, whereas average Normalised Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) increased by 43.75%, associating with increased thermal stress area evaluated using ecological evaluation index. Major LULC transformations included green area into agricultural arable-land and built-up. Finally, the modelled output shows that built-up & vegetation index have strongly impacted LST. This study, help to understand the relative impact of land-use dynamics on LST at intra-urban level specifically with respect to the small urban settings. Further assisting in designing and regenerating urban contexts with stable configuration, considering sustainability and liveable climate, for benefit of health of public and fragile population in particular.

TI  - The Application of FY-3D/E Meteorological Satellite Products in South China Sea Summer Monsoon Monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the vertical atmospheric sounding system carried by the FY-3D meteorological satellite (FY-3D/ VASS) and the new wind radar instrument carried by the FY-3E meteorological satellite (FY-3E/WindRAD), a study of the potential application of research on the changes of temperature, humidity, and ocean wind vector (OWV) during the onset of the South China Sea summer monsoon (SCSSM) was conducted. The applications of these satellite datasets in SCSSM monitoring were evaluated, and the SCSSM onset process in 2022 was analyzed. The results showed that the mean bias of the FY-3D/VASS temperature and specific humidity at 850 hPa, compared with that of the fifth-generation ECMWF reanalysis, were -0.6 K and -0.53 g kg-1, respectively, and the pseu-do-equivalent potential temperature (& theta; se ) was slightly lower, by 1 - 2 K; the distribution of & theta;se was consistent with the seasonal advancement of the SCSSM. Compared with Metop-C/ASCAT, the mean bias of FY-3E/WindRAD zonal wind was positive, and that of meridional wind was negative. The correlation coefficient, mean bias, mean absolute error, and root-mean-square error of the wind speed were 0.79, -0.45, 1.56, and 2.03 m s-1, respectively. The distributions of OWV were consistent, and the region and intensity of strong wind speed were close to each other. The temperature, humidity, and wind reversal during the onset of the SCSSM in 2022 were well monitored by the FY-3D/E-derived & theta;se and OWV dual indices, which are consistent with the SCSSM onset date, the third pentad in May, issued officially by the National Climate Center, China Meteorological Administration. Before the SCSSM's onset in 2022, the tropical storms' pumping effect in early May increased the westerly wind over the tropical ocean north of the equator. After the storm weakened, the southwesterly wind passed across the Indochina Peninsula and reached the South China Sea, causing the SCSSM's onset.

TI  - Current and future land fire risk mapping in the southern region of Sumatra, Indonesia, using CMIP6 data and GIS analysis
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land fires lead to a deterioration of environmental quality and have perilous social and economic aspects. One method for mitigating this hazard is to determine the range of fire risk areas. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the current and potential future fire risk in the Ogan Komering Ilir, southern Sumatra region of Indonesia, using CMIP6 data and geospatial technology. In order to analyze fire risk areas, the Landsat 8 satellite image from 2021 (as a baseline period) was used. Variables like the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the land surface temperature (LST) were extracted from the satellite image. Then, the standard precipitation index (SPI) was determined using rainfall data from meteorological stations. For future period prediction (periods 2021-2040 and 2041-2060), this study used future climate data from the CMIP6. By overlaying these variables, current and future fire risk zone maps were produced. The results obtained showed that in the current period, around 726.4 km(2) (4.2%) of the area was at high fire risk, then 5,621.3 km(2) (32.7%) and 10,835.3 km(2) (63.1%) were at moderate and low fire risk zones, respectively. Furthermore, for the future period, this study estimated there was an increase in high fire risk areas of about 14% during 2021-2040 and 30% during 2041-2060. This was recorded in the southern and northern parts of the study area. Fire risk areas were strongly associated with NDMI, NDVI, and LST. The study's findings may be useful for land fire management in fire-prone areas.

TI  - Estimation of the Error in the Calculation of the Pressure-Strain Term: Application in the Terrestrial Magnetosphere
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Calculating the pressure-strain terms has recently been performed to quantify energy conversion between the bulk flow energy and the internal energy of plasmas. It has been applied to numerical simulations and satellite data from the Magnetospheric MultiScale Mission. The method requires spatial gradients of the velocity and the use of the full pressure tensor. Here we present a derivation of the errors associated with calculating the pressure-strain terms from multi-spacecraft measurements and apply it to previously studied examples of magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause and the magnetotail. The errors are small in a dense magnetosheath event but much larger in the more tenuous magnetotail. This is likely due to larger counting statistics in the dense plasma at the magnetopause than in the magnetotail. The propagated errors analyzed in this work are important to understand uncertainties of energy conversion measurements in space plasmas and have applications to current and future multi-spacecraft missions.

TI  - A Systematic Review of New Imaging Technologies for Robotic Prostatectomy: From Molecular Imaging to Augmented Reality
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - New imaging technologies play a pivotal role in the current management of patients with prostate cancer. Robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is a standard of care for localized disease and through the already imaging-based console subject of research towards combinations of imaging technologies and RARP as well as their impact on surgical outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the currently available literature for new imaging technologies for RARP. On 24 January 2023, we performed a systematic review of the current literature on Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science according to the PRISMA guidelines and Oxford levels of evidence. A total of 46 studies were identified of which 19 studies focus on imaging of the primary tumor, 12 studies on the intraoperative tumor detection of lymph nodes and 15 studies on the training of surgeons. While the feasibility of combined approaches using new imaging technologies including MRI, PSMA-PET CT or intraoperatively applied radioactive and fluorescent dyes has been demonstrated, the prospective confirmation of improvements in surgical outcomes is currently ongoing.

TI  - Seasonal water storage and release dynamics of <i>bofedal</i> wetlands in the Central Andes
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical high-Andean wetlands, locally known as 'bofedales', are key ecosystems sustaining biodiversity, carbon sequestration, water provision and livestock farming. Bofedales' contribution to dry season baseflows and sustaining water quality is crucial for downstream water security. The sensitivity of bofedales to climatic and anthropogenic disturbances is therefore of growing concern for watershed management. This study aims to understand seasonal water storage and release characteristics of bofedales by combining remote sensing analysis and ground-based monitoring for the wet and dry seasons of late 2019 to early 2021, using the glacierised Vilcanota-Urubamba basin (Southern Peru) as a case study. A network of five ultrasound loggers was installed to obtain discharge and water table data from bofedal sites across two headwater catchments. The seasonal extent of bofedales was mapped by applying a supervised machine learning model using Random Forest on imagery from Sentinel-2 and NASADEM. We identified high seasonal variability in bofedal area with a total of 3.5% and 10.6% of each catchment area, respectively, at the end of the dry season (2020), which increased to 15.1% and 16.9%, respectively, at the end of the following wet season (2021). The hydrological observations and bofedal maps were combined into a hydrological conceptual model to estimate the storage and release characteristics of the bofedales, and their contribution to runoff at the catchment scale. Estimated lag times between 1 and 32 days indicate a prolonged bofedal flow contribution throughout the dry season (about 74% of total flow). Thus, our results suggest that bofedales provide substantial contribution to dry season baseflow, water flow regulation and storage. These findings highlight the importance of including bofedales in local water management strategies and adaptation interventions including nature-based solutions that seek to support long-term water security in seasonally dry and rapidly changing Andean catchments.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Prostate Cancer: An Overview of Diagnostic Performance, Oncological Outcomes, Safety, and Feasibility
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for prostate cancer (PCa) represents an innovative technique aimed at improving nodal staging accuracy. The routinary adoption of this procedure in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) might be crucial to identify candidates who could effectively benefit from extensive pelvic lymph nodal dissection (ePLND). Despite some promising results, SNB for PCa is still considered experimental due to the lack of solid evidence and procedural standardization. In this regard, our narrative review aimed to analyze the most recent literature in this field, providing an overview of both the diagnostic accuracy measures and the oncological outcomes of SNB.

TI  - A Neural Network Model for Estimating Carbon Fluxes in Forest Ecosystems from Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are among the main places on Earth where carbon is collected and accumulated. However, instrumental assessment of carbon fluxes is possible only for small areas. When solving the scaling problem, machine learning methods are used, which allow transforming the Earth's surface reflectance intensities in different spectral ranges into ground-based in situ observations. We suggest a regression neural network model of the multilayer perceptron type for assessment of carbon fluxes. The model is trained on FLUXNET network data for a station located in a boreal coniferous forest (56.4615 & DEG; N, 32.9221 & DEG; E). Using the vegetation indices NDVI and EVI measured by the MODIS spectroradiometer onboard the Aqua satellite, the air temperature at an altitude of 2 m, and total precipitation as input data, the model estimates the gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (TER), and some other parameters which characterize water and energy fluxes. The statistical assessments for the test dataset show high correlation coefficients (R) and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (NSE): R > 0.9 and NSE & GE; 0.87 for GPP and TER; R = 0.4 and NSE = 0.15 for NEE.

TI  - Species Composition and Population Dynamics of Culicidae during their Peak Abundance Period in Three Peri-Urban Aquatic Ecosystems in Northern Spain
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - For a better understanding of the transmission cycles of mosquito-borne diseases, it is essential to explore the species composition and population dynamics, mainly during their peak abundance period. These investigations do not normally include peri-urban areas, despite their significant epidemiological interest. To address these gaps, an entomological survey was carried out in 2016 and 2017 in three aquatic ecosystems located on the outskirts of the city of Logrono, in northern Spain: the Iregua River and La Grajera (La Rioja) and Las Canas Reservoirs (Navarra). Mosquitoes were captured using BG-Sentinel traps baited with CO2 and BG-lure, as well as through the human landing collection method. In total, 6793 mosquito specimens were captured, representing 24 taxa within six genera. A specific PCR based on the ITS2 gene was used to differentiate members of the Anopheles claviger complex, and all individuals were identified as An. claviger sensu stricto. La Grajera had the most diverse culicid fauna, with 19 taxa, followed by Las Canas (n = 15) and the Iregua River (n = 13). The composition and abundance of Culicidae varied across the aquatic ecosystem. We observed that the different hydrological management practices of each environment could play a key role in determining the abundance of mosquito genera. The overall risk of mosquito bites in the study area is expected to be relatively low and will depend on the freshwater ecosystem and the time of year.

TI  - Trace elements and lipidomic datasets of stranding samples in the blubber of Turpsios truncatus from the Yucatan coast: Association with biological features
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The Yucatan coastal zone is an area that contributes to many anthropogenic activities resulting in substantial contamination (metals, pesticides) in aquatic organisms. The dolphin is an excellent sentinel animal used in studying contamination in this area. Some substances found in dolphins have been identified as toxic causing alterations in the properties of membranes and produce lipid peroxidation especially heavy metals. The dataset presented here is associated with the research article paper entitled "Trace element and lipidomic analysis of bottlenose dolphin blubber from the Yucatan coast: Lipid composition relationships". In this article, we presented the trace element concentrations found in blubber and their comparison with other studies performed in mammal marine organisms. Lipidomic characterization of bottlenose dolphin blubber and their association with trace elements and the differences related to biological characteristics were presented. This data provides a correlation analysis between trace element concentrations, lipid species and body length and the lipid differences related to biological characteristics such as growth stage, stranding code, and the presence of stomach contents. We used Spearman correlation analysis to identify the association with body length, trace elements and lipids. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine differences in lipids related to stranding code (3: moderate decomposition, 4: advanced decomposition), growth stage (juveniles and adults) and whether they showed presence of stomach contents or not. The data indicates that Cr, Cd and Zn concentrations were higher compared to concentrations found in blubbler of T. truncatus from other studies (See Table 3). Cr, Co, As and Cd were found in higher concentration in larger organisms compared to smaller ones. The results of correlation between lipids and body length showed a decrease in some ceramides (CER, DCER, HCER), sterols (CE), glycerolipids (TAG, DAG) and phosphatidylethanolamines (LPE, PE) in larger dolphins (Table 4). Dolphins with advanced decomposition (code 4) showed lower concentrations of phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) compared with organisms with moderate decomposition (code 3). Organisms with empty stomachs showed higher concentrations of phosphoethanolamines suggesting a preferential metabolism of energy-rich lipids over structural lipids. The information in these datasets may contribute to understanding the potential associations of trace elements, lipids and their associations with biological characteristics.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

TI  - A Clustering Approach for the Analysis of InSAR Time Series: Application to the Bandung Basin (Indonesia)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture (InSAR) time series measurements are widely used to monitor a variety of processes including subsidence, landslides, and volcanic activity. However, interpreting large InSAR datasets can be difficult due to the volume of data generated, requiring sophisticated signal-processing techniques to extract meaningful information. We propose a novel framework for interpreting the large number of ground displacement measurements derived from InSAR time series techniques using a three-step process: (1) dimensionality reduction of the displacement time series from an InSAR data stack; (2) clustering of the reduced dataset; and (3) detecting and quantifying accelerations and decelerations of deforming areas using a change detection method. The displacement rates, spatial variation, and the spatio-temporal nature of displacement accelerations and decelerations are used to investigate the physical behaviour of the deforming ground by linking the timing and location of changes in displacement rates to potential causal and triggering factors. We tested the method over the Bandung Basin in Indonesia using Sentinel-1 data processed with the small baseline subset InSAR time series technique. The results showed widespread subsidence in the central basin with rates up to 18.7 cm/yr. We identified 12 main clusters of subsidence, of which three covering a total area of 22 km(2) show accelerating subsidence, four clusters over 52 km(2) show a linear trend, and five show decelerating subsidence over an area of 22 km(2). This approach provides an objective way to monitor and interpret ground movements, and is a valuable tool for understanding the physical behaviour of large deforming areas.

TI  - Assessing the vulnerability of Iran to subsidence hazard using a hierarchical FUCOM-GIS framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In engineering practice, land subsidence is considered a threat to the infrastructure and lifelines massively distributed globally. In this study, a combined methodology of full consistency decision-making (FUCOM) and the geographical information system (GIS) was employed to assess the vulnerability of Iran to subsidence. Accordingly, a new hierarchical FUCOM-GIS framework was developed. The FUCOM was first used to evaluate the weight of various causative factors. Afterward, the GIS was employed to superimpose several layers to produce a land subsidence susceptibility map (LSSM) of Iran. The results revealed water stress, groundwater depletion, soil type, geological time scale, and rainfall amount as the most significant factors causing land subsidence, while the influence of several additional factors was also investigated. The LSSM was validated against interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analyses of the Sentinel-1 for several megacities. Accordingly, Tehran, Qom, Yazd, Isfahan, Kerman, and Mashhad were recognized as the critical regions, delivering a subsidence rate between 15 and 20 cm/yr. Eventually, the assessed hazard for the power transmission lines and substations, as an exemplified lifeline, was confirmed by field reconnaissance. The results revealed the pier sinking, structural members buckling, electric insulators deviation, and cracking as the main damages to the transmission lines.

TI  - Evaluating how well active fault mapping predicts earthquake surface-rupture locations
T2  - GEOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquake surface-fault rupture location uncertainty is a key factor in fault displacement hazard analysis and informs hazard and risk mitigation strategies. Geologists often predict future rupture locations from fault map -ping based on the geomorphology interpreted from remote-sensing data sets. However, surface processes can obscure fault location, fault traces may be mapped in error, and a future rupture may not break every fault trace. We assessed how well geomorphology-based fault mapping predicted surface ruptures for seven earthquakes: 1983 M 6.9 Borah Peak, 2004 M 6.0 Parkfield, 2010 M 7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah, 2011 M 6.7 Fukushima-Hamadori, 2014 M 6.0 South Napa, 2016 M 7.8 Kaikoura, and 2016 M 7 Kumamoto. We trained geo -science students to produce active fault maps using topography and imagery acquired before the earthquakes. A geologic professional completed a "con-trol" map. Mappers used a new "geomorphic indicator ranking" approach to rank fault confidence based on geomorphologic landforms. We determined the accuracy of the mapped faults by comparing the fault maps to published rupture maps. We defined predicted ruptures as ruptures near a fault (50-200 m, depending on the fault confidence) that interacted with the landscape in a similar way to the fault. The mapped faults predicted between 12% to 68% of the principal rupture length for the studied earthquakes. The median sep-aration distances between predicted ruptures and strong, distinct, or weak faults were 15-30 m. Our work highlights that mapping future fault ruptures is an underappreciated challenge of fault displacement hazard analysis-even for experts-with implications for risk management, engineering site assess-ments, and fault exclusion zones.

TI  - Resilience of riparian vegetation productivity to early 21st century drought in northern California, USA
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought and intensive land use can interact as stressors on riparian vegetation, especially along rivers flowing through seasonally dry landscapes. Knowledge of past riparian vegetation response to drought and land use change can provide land managers with a better understanding of changes induced by upstream management actions, climate change, and chronic stressors. To investigate the response of riparian vegetation productivity to drought and land use, we developed a 21-year time series (2000-2020) of growing season vegetation dynamics using near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) derived from satellite data across 30 watershed subbasins that drain into the San Francisco Bay Delta in central California, USA. We observed a strong response of riparian vegetation to drought, but rapid recovery and very few long-term declines in productivity. At a local level, vegetation communities' response to drought and post-drought productivity dynamics were highly variable across biophysical settings and land use gradients. Most of the riparian areas with long-term declines in NIRV were located in the lower elevation Coast Range on the western side of the study area where there is little to no water engineering or agricultural irrigation runoff to subsidize riparian vegetation. Riparian areas with the greatest long-term increase were along rivers draining the higher elevation Sierra Nevada range to the east. Our results suggest that river systems with a high proportion of water originating as snowmelt may be more buffered against long-term drought-driven declines in productivity than those dependent exclusively on winter rainfall. The long-term increase in NIRV in the vast majority of riparian areas within our study area may also have been driven in part by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which have been shown to increase plant water use efficiency.

TI  - Antimicrobial Resistance in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a major Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen causing several serious acute and chronic infections in the nosocomial and community settings. PA eradication has become increasingly difficult due to its remarkable ability to evade antibiotics. Therefore, epidemiological studies are needed to limit the infection and aim for the correct treatment. The present retrospective study focused on PA presence among samples collected at the San Giovanni di Dio and Ruggi D'Aragona University Hospital in Salerno, Italy; its resistance profile and relative variations over the eight years were analyzed. Bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed by VITEK (R) 2. In the 2015-2019 and 2020-2022 timeframes, respectively, 1739 and 1307 isolates of PA were obtained from respiratory samples, wound swabs, urine cultures, cultural swabs, blood, liquor, catheter cultures, vaginal swabs, and others. During 2015-2019, PA strains exhibited low resistance against amikacin (17.2%), gentamicin (25.2%), and cefepime (28.3%); moderate resistance against ceftazidime (34.4%), imipenem (34.6%), and piperacillin/tazobactam (37.7%); and high resistance against ciprofloxacin (42.4%) and levofloxacin (50.6%). Conversely, during the 2020-2022 era, PA showed 11.7, 21.1, 26.9, 32.6, 33.1, 38.7, and 39.8% resistance to amikacin, tobramycin, cefepime, imipenem, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam, respectively. An overall resistance-decreasing trend was observed for imipenem and gentamicin during 2015-2019. Instead, a significant increase in resistance was recorded for cefepime, ceftazidime, and imipenem in the second set of years investigated. Monitoring sentinel germs represents a key factor in optimizing empirical therapy to minimize the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  - Remote sensing assessment of the ecological benefits provided by national key ecological projects in China during 2000-2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a theoretical framework for assessing the ecological benefits provided by key national ecological projects in China over the past 20 years. A dataset consisting of six primary indicators and nine secondary indicators of ecosystem structure, ecosystem quality, and ecosystem services for 2000-2019 was generated using ground survey and remote sensing data. Ecological benefits were quantitatively evaluated following the implementation of these projects in China. Areas with medium, relatively high, and high degrees of ecological restoration accounted for 24.1%, 11.9%, and 1.7% of the national land, respectively. Degrees of ecological restoration were higher in areas with greater numbers of ecological projects. Areas with relatively and absolutely high degrees of ecological restoration were mainly concentrated in the Loess Plateau, the farming-pastoral zone of northern China, the Northeast China Plain, and an area spanning the borders of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Chongqing, and Hunan. The relative contributions of climatic factors and ecological projects to changes in vegetation net primary productivity were 85.4% and 14.6%, respectively, and the relative contributions of climatic factors and ecological projects to changes in water erosion modulus were 69.5% and 30.5%, respectively. The restoration potential of national vegetation coverage was 20%, and the restoration potential percentage of forest and grassland vegetation coverage was 6.4% and 23%, respectively. Climatic conditions can inhibit ecological restoration. Areas with relatively high and high degrees of ecological restoration were mainly distributed in areas with an average annual temperature greater than 0 & DEG;C and annual precipitation greater than 300 mm. Therefore, the limitations associated with climate conditions require consideration during the implementation of national ecological projects. The implementation of combined measures should be emphasized, and the benefits of ecological investment funds should be maximized.

TI  - Expansion of Urban Impervious Surfaces in Lahore (1993-2022) Based on GEE and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces are an essential component of our environment and are mainly triggered by human developments. Rapid urbanization and population expansion have increased Lahore's urban impervious surface area. This research is based on estimating the urban imper-vious surface area (UISA) growth from 1993 to 2022. Therefore, we aimed to generate an accurate urban impervious surfaces area map based on Landsat time series data on Google Earth Engine (GEE). We have used a novel global impervious surface area index (GISAI) for impervious surface area (UISA) extraction. The GISAI accomplished significant results, with an average overall accuracy of 90.93% and an average kappa coefficient of 0.78. We also compared the results of GISAI with Global Human Settlement Layer-Built and harmonized nighttime light (NTL) ISA data products. The accuracy assessment and cross-validation of UISA results were performed using ground truth data on ArcGIS and GEE. Our research findings revealed that the spatial extent of UISA increased by 198.69 km2 from 1993 to 2022 in Lahore. Additionally, the UISA has increased at an average growth rate of 39.74 km2. The GISAI index was highly accurate at extract-ing UISA and can be used for other cities to map impervious surface area growth. This research can help urban planners and policymak-ers to delineate urban development boundaries. Also, there should be controlled urban expansion policies for sustainable metropolis and should use less impermeable materials for future city developments.

TI  - Impact Assessment of Road Construction on Landslide Susceptibility in Mountainous Region using GIS-Based Statistical Modelling
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide susceptibility is crucial for effective hazard management, planning mitigation, and risk reduction strategies. The present study assessed the impact of road construction on landslide susceptibility for the Mandi district. 1723 landslides data for Mandi district was compiled from the various sources with eleven causative factors. The eleven landslide causative factors were selected from numerous hydrological, geological, and topographical factors. The landslide susceptibility analysis was carried out using three bivariate statistical models, namely, Frequency Ratio (FR), Certainty Factor (CF), and Shannon Entropy (SE). Two sets of Landslide Susceptibility Maps were generated to assess the impact of road construction and divided into five landslide susceptibility classes. The SE model had the highest prediction and validation accuracy of (83-86%). The percentage area in high and very high classes of landslide susceptibility increased by 2.67-4.17% due to road construction activities in the study area.

TI  - <i>Acinetobacter</i> Non-<i>baumannii</i> Species: Occurrence in Infections in Hospitalized Patients, Identification, and Antibiotic Resistance
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Acinetobacter species other than A. baumannii are becoming increasingly more important as opportunistic pathogens for humans. The primary aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, species distribution, antimicrobial resistance patterns, and carbapenemase gene content of clinical Acinetobacter non-baumannii (Anb) isolates that were collected as part of a sentinel surveillance program of bacterial infections in hospitalized patients. The secondary aim was to evaluate the performance of MALDI-TOF MS systems for the species-level identification of Anb isolates. Methods: Clinical bacterial isolates were collected from multiple sites across Russia and Kazakhstan in 2016-2022. Species identification was performed by means of MALDI-TOF MS, with the Autobio and Bruker systems used in parallel. The PCR detection of the species-specific blaOXA-51-like gene was used as a means of differentiating A. baumannii from Anb species, and the partial sequencing of the rpoB gene was used as a reference method for Anb species identification. The susceptibility of isolates to antibiotics (amikacin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, colistin, gentamicin, imipenem, meropenem, sulbactam, tigecycline, tobramycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) was determined using the broth microdilution method. The presence of the most common in Acinetobacter-acquired carbapenemase genes (bla(OXA-23)-like, bla(OXA-24/40)-like, bla(OXA-58)-like, blaNDM, blaIMP, and blaVIM) was assessed using real-time PCR. Results: In total, 234 isolates were identified as belonging to 14 Anb species. These comprised 6.2% of Acinetobacter spp. and 0.7% of all bacterial isolates from the observations. Among the Anb species, the most abundant were A. pittii (42.7%), A. nosocomialis (13.7%), the A. calcoaceticus/oleivorans group (9.0%), A. bereziniae (7.7%), and A. geminorum (6.0%). Notably, two environmental species, A. oleivorans and A. courvalinii, were found for the first time in the clinical samples of patients with urinary tract infections. The prevalence of resistance to different antibiotics in Anb species varied from <4% (meropenem and colistin) to 11.2% (gentamicin). Most isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics; however, sporadic isolates of A. bereziniae, A. johnsonii, A. nosocomialis, A. oleivorans, A. pittii, and A. ursingii were resistant to carbapenems. A. bereziniae was more frequently resistant to sulbactam, aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tigecycline than the other species. Four (1.7%) isolates of A. bereziniae, A. johnsonii, A. pittii were found to carry carbapenemase genes (blaOXA-58-like and blaNDM, either alone or in combination). The overall accuracy rates of the species-level identification of Anb isolates with the Autobio and Bruker systems were 80.8% and 88.5%, with misidentifications occurring in 5 and 3 species, respectively. Conclusions: This study provides important new insights into the methods of identification, occurrence, species distribution, and antibiotic resistance traits of clinical Anb isolates.

TI  - Modeling runoff responses to 1.5 °C and 2 °C rise in temperature in snow-fed basin of western Himalayas
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) was employed to study the impact of climate change on the hydrology of the Sindh basin. The model was calibrated for the year 2010 and validated for the years 2011-2016. Daily discharge of the river was predicted under four possible climate change scenarios, Scenario I (T + 2 & DEG;C and P + 10%), Scenario II (T + 1.5 & DEG;C, P-10%), Scenario III (T + 2 & DEG;C, P + 10%) and Scenario IV (T + 1.5 & DEG;C, P-10%). Snow covered area (SCA) was calculated from an 8-day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data product (MOD10A2). The SCA reduced from approximately 90% in January to around 20% in September. The model predicted an increase of 59% in daily runoff during the late Spring and early summer season under scenario III, 45% under Scenario I, 29% under Scenario IV, and 17% under scenario II climatic conditions. The model performance was assessed using volume difference (Dv) and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of determination (R-2). The model accuracy was satisfactory as the estimated and observed discharge matched precisely with an overall Dv of - 4.9% and the R-2 remained above 0.9 for the simulation period. The peak discharge month shifted from August in 2010 to May in the simulated scenarios. A significant decrease has been observed in the river discharge in Autumn under the various climate change scenarios. The results of the study point toward an increase in the frequency and magnitude of the floods in peak snowmelt season while drought-like conditions would occur in the lean season.

TI  - Increasing global oceanic wind speed partly counteracted water clarity management effectiveness: A case study of Hainan Island coastal waters
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A sustainable coastal "blue economy" is one of the most significant opportunities and challenges in the new era. However, the management and conservation of marine ecosystems must recognize the interdependence in the coupled human and natural systems. In this study, we employed satellite remote sensing to map the spatial and temporal distribution of Secchi disk depth (SDD) in Hainan coastal waters, China for the first time, and quantitatively revealed the impacts of environmental investments on the coastal water environment in the context of global climate change. Based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) in situ concurrent matchups (N = 123), a simple green band (555 nm)-based quadratic algorithm was first developed to estimate the SDD for the coastal waters of Hainan Island in China (R2 = 0.70, root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.74 m). The long time-series SDD dataset (2001-2021) for Hainan coastal waters was reconstructed from MODIS observations. Spatially, SDD showed a pattern of high water clarity in eastern and southern coastal waters and low water clarity in the western and northern coastal areas. This pattern is attributed to unbalanced distributions of bathymetry and pollution from seagoing rivers. Seasonally, the humid tropical monsoon climate drove the SDD into a general pattern of high in the wet season and low in the dry season. Annually, the SDD in Hainan coastal waters improved significantly (p < 0.1), benefiting from environmental investments over the last 20 years. However, the increasing global oceanic wind speed in recent years has exacerbated sediment resuspension and deep ocean mixing, counteracting approximately 14.14% of the remedial management's effectiveness in protecting and restoring the coastal ecosystem. This study offers ways to improve the ecological and environmental regulations under global changes and to strengthen the public service capacity for aquatic management authorities with methods that support the sustainable development of coastal areas.

TI  - Increased dust transport from Patagonia to eastern Antarctica during 2000-2020
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Patagonia is an important dust source for Antarctica due to its proximity. However, the changes in the dust transport from Patagonia to Antarctica during the last two decades remain poorly understood. In this study, we used in-situ observations, remote sensing data, and reanalysis data to show changes in the frequency of dust events in Patagonia and their influence on the dust deposition in eastern Antarctica during the austral springs of 2000-2020. An increasing trend in the frequency of Patagonian dust events was observed from 2000 to 2020, with average frequencies of 3.1 and 8.1 in 2000-2006 and 2007-2020, respectively. The increased dust event frequency in Patagonia was caused by an increase in both the mean wind speed, the downslope wind frequency and air temperature and a decrease in the local soil moisture. The increased Patagonian dust event led to an increasing trend in dust deposition in austral spring from the eastern coast of Patagonia to the northeast of the Antarctic Peninsula and northern Weddell Sea, indicating increasing dust transport from Patagonia to eastern Antarctica from 2000 to 2020. This increased dust transport was related to enhanced westerly winds from Patagonia to the northern Weddell Sea. The increased frequency of circulation patterns conducive to dust events also contributed to the increased transport of Patagonian dust to the Weddell Sea and East Antarctica during 2000-2020.

TI  - Mapping Land Use and Land Cover Classes in Sao Paulo State, Southeast of Brazil, Using Landsat-8 OLI Multispectral Data and the Derived Spectral Indices and Fraction Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims to develop a new method to map Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classes in the Sao Paulo State, Brazil, using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. The novelty of the proposed method consists of selecting the images based on the spectral and temporal characteristics of the LULC classes. First, we defined the six classes to be mapped in the year 2020 as forest, forest plantation, water bodies, urban areas, agriculture, and pasture. Second, we visually analyzed their variability spectral characteristics over the year. Then, we pre-processed these images to highlight each LULC class. For the classification, the Random Forest algorithm available on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was utilized individually for each LULC class. Afterward, we integrated the classified maps to create the final LULC map. The results revealed that forest areas are primarily concentrated in the eastern region of Sao Paulo, predominantly on steeper slopes, accounting for 19% of the study area. On the other hand, pasture and agriculture dominated 73% of all Sao Paulo's landscape, reaching 39% and 34%, respectively. The overall accuracy of the classification achieved 89.10%, while producer and user accuracies were greater than 84.20% and 76.62%, respectively. To validate the results, we compared our findings with the MapBiomas Project classification, obtaining an overall accuracy of 85.47%. Therefore, our method demonstrates its potential to minimize classification errors and offers the advantage of facilitating post-classification editing for individual mapped classes.

TI  - Greenway Planning in Ekaterinburg City: Unaccounted Phytopathological Problems of the Urban Strategy Project
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of studying the long-term dynamics of the phytopathological state of alien woody and shrubby plants (AWSPs) in Ekaterinburg city (Russia, Ural) are presented for the first time. In view of the active implementation of numerous landscaping programs, including the concept of the Greenway planning of Ekaterinburg city, over the past 20 years, a large number of AWSP seedlings have arrived in the city, which contributes to the penetration of many previously unknown species of alien and pathogenic fungi into the Urals, the number of which increases exponentially. On alien woody substrates, many species of local saprobic fungi exhibit pathogenic properties, which also contribute to a sharp increase in the pathogenic activity of urban mycobiota. Several invasive fungal species cause mass diseases of woody plants and expand their trophic spectrum. Some invasive fungal species are expanding their invasive range into the natural forests. A list of AWSP species resistant to local and alien diseases, which are recommended for the greening of Ekaterinburg, is given. The applicability of the sentinel plantations technique for the early detection and localization of alien phytopathogens is discussed. Recommendations are given for the creation of a four-stage system of phytopathological monitoring of green urban spaces, which will contribute to the protection against penetration and the rapid detection of alien pathogenic fungi before diseases outbreaks.

TI  - Mineral exploration employing drones, contemporary geological satellite remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) procedures: A review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Modern remote sensing using satellites replaced film cameras and balloons used as platforms in aerial photography. Multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensors and geographic information system (GIS) are used in mineral exploration to evaluate mineral potential. Landsat, Advanced space borne thermal reflection and emission radiometer (ASTER), System Pourl' Observation dela Terre (SPOT), Indian remote sensing (IRS), Sentinel-2 and Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) sensor image data were used in the analyses. Image data processing by minimum noise fraction (MNF), principal component analysis (PCA) band rationing (BR) and independent component analysis (ICA) improve data for easy minerals recognition. Earth Resources Data Analysis System (ERDAS) imagine software is for numerical image processing while geological, geophysical and geochemical surveys data are integrated with image data using ArcGIS software to delineate mineral potential zones. The mineral potential map is classified into low, moderate good and excellent zones. Innovations such as cloud computing, big data analytics, drones and machine learning algorithms have been introduced in mineral exploration due to depletion in available mineral reserves. These technologies are useful in mineral exploration in hard to reach areas. The review shows that ASTER sensor has higher capability to detect hydrothermal altered minerals more than Landsat, SPOT, Sentinel-2 sensors. Hyperspectral AVIRIS can identify minerals in hydrothermally altered volcanic areas better than all multispectral sensors due to its narrow bands widths. The review shows that a combination of more than one remote sensor in mineral search gives more credible results than using an individual sensor. Application of satellite remote sensing in geological mapping covers a wider area than aerial photography. However, remote sensing method has a limitation of depth, because the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) measure properties of surface geological features not from the subsurface. Mineral exploration using satellite remote sensing and GIS can be applied in different geological settings.

TI  - The Extended H<sub>∞</sub> Particle Filter for Attitude Estimation Applied to Remote Sensing Satellite CBERS-4
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An extension of the linear H-infinity filter, presented here as the extended H-infinity particle filter (EH infinity PF), is used in this work for attitude estimation, which presents a process and measurement model with nonlinear functions. The simulations implemented use orbit and attitude data from CBERS-4 (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite-4), making use of the robustness characteristics of the H-infinity filter. The CBERS-4 is the fifth satellite of an advantageous international scientific interaction between Brazil and China for the development of remote sensing satellites used for strategic application in monitoring water resources and controlling deforestation in the Legal Amazon. In the extended H-infinity particle filter (EH infinity PF) the nature of the system, composed of dynamics and noises, seeks to degrade the state estimate. The EH infinity PF deals with this by aiming for robustness, using a performance parameter in its cost function, in addition to presenting an advantageous feature of using a reduced number of particles for state estimation. The justification for the application of this method is because the non-Gaussian uncertainties that appear in the attitude sensors impair the estimation process and the EH infinity PF minimizes in signal estimation the worst effects of disturbance signals without a priori knowledge of them, as shown in the results, in addition to presenting good precision within the prescribed requirements, with 100 particles representing a processing time 2.09 times less than the PF with 500 particles.

TI  - A Chromosome-Level Reference Genome for the Black-Legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), a Declining Circumpolar Seabird
T2  - GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Amidst the current biodiversity crisis, the availability of genomic resources for declining species can provide important insights into the factors driving population decline. In the early 1990s, the black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), a pelagic gull widely distributed across the arctic, subarctic, and temperate zones, suffered a steep population decline following an abrupt warming of sea surface temperature across its distribution range and is currently listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Kittiwakes have long been the focus for field studies of physiology, ecology, and ecotoxicology and are primary indicators of fluctuating ecological conditions in arctic and subarctic marine ecosystems. We present a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome and annotation for the black-legged kittiwake using a combination of Pacific Biosciences HiFi sequencing, Bionano optical maps, Hi-C reads, and RNA-Seq data. The final assembly spans 1.35 Gb across 32 chromosomes, with a scaffold N50 of 88.21 Mb and a BUSCO completeness of 97.4%. This genome assembly substantially improves the quality of a previous draft genome, showing an approximately 5x increase in contiguity and a more complete annotation. Using this new chromosome-level reference genome and three more chromosome-level assemblies of Charadriiformes, we uncover several lineage-specific chromosome fusions and fissions, but find no shared rearrangements, suggesting that interchromosomal rearrangements have been commonplace throughout the diversification of Charadriiformes. This new high-quality genome assembly will enable population genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotype-genotype association studies in a widely studied sentinel species, which may provide important insights into the impacts of global change on marine systems.

TI  - Satellite Altimetry for Ocean and Coastal Applications: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - More than 30 years of observations from an international suite of satellite altimeter missions continue to provide key data enabling research discoveries and a broad spectrum of operational and user-driven applications. These missions were designed to advance technologies and to answer scientific questions about ocean circulation, ocean heat content, and the impact of climate change on these Earth systems. They are also a valuable resource for the operational needs of oceanographic and weather forecasting agencies that provide information to shipping and fishing vessels and offshore operations for route optimization and safety, as well as for other decision makers in coastal, water resources, and disaster management fields. This time series of precise measurements of ocean surface topography (OST)-the "hills and valleys" of the ocean surface-reveals changes in ocean dynamic topography, tracks sea level variations at global to regional scales, and provides key information about ocean trends reflecting climate change in our warming world. Advancing technologies in new satellite systems allows measurements at higher spatial resolution ever closer to coastlines, where the impacts of storms, waves, and sea level rise on coastal communities and infrastructure are manifest. We review some collaborative efforts of international space agencies, including NASA, CNES, NOAA, ESA, and EUMETSAT, which have contributed to a collection of use cases of satellite altimetry in operational and decision-support contexts. The extended time series of ocean surface topography measurements obtained from these satellite altimeter missions, along with advances in satellite technology that have allowed for higher resolution measurements nearer to coasts, has enabled a range of such applications. The resulting body of knowledge and data enables better assessments of storms, waves, and sea level rise impacts on coastal communities and infrastructure amongst other key contributions for societal benefit. Although not exhaustive, this review provides a broad overview with specific examples of the important role of satellite altimetry in ocean and coastal applications, thus justifying the significant resource contributions made by international space agencies in the development of these missions.

TI  - Rice-Fallow Targeting for Cropping Intensification through Geospatial Technologies in the Rice Belt of Northeast India
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice-fallow areas have significant potential to sustainably increase agricultural intensification to address growing global food demands while simultaneously increasing farmers' income by harnessing the residual soil moisture in rainfed ecologies. Assam is the largest rice-growing belt in northeast India during kharif; however, for the next rabi season, an average of 58% of the rice areas remain uncultivated and are described as rice-fallow (Kharif, rabi and zaid are the crop seasons in the study area. The kharif season refers to the monsoon/rainy season and corresponds to the major crop season in the region extending from June to October. The rabi season refers to the winter season extending from November to April, and the zaid season is the summer crop season from April to June). Unutilized rice-fallow areas with optimum soil moisture for a second crop were identified over three consecutive years using multiple satellite data (optical and radar) for the state of Assam and an average accuracy of 92.6%. The reasons governing the existence of rice-fallow areas were analyzed, and an average of 0.88 million ha of suitable rice-fallow areas, based on soil moisture availability, were identified. Targeted interventions were carried out in selected locations to demonstrate the potential of sustainable cropping intensification. Maize, with best management practices, and a yield between 5.5 and 6 t/ha, was demonstrated as a successful second crop during the rabi season in selected areas with optimum residual soil moisture after the kharif paddy harvest. This study highlights the significance of geospatial technology to effectively identify and target suitable rice-fallow areas for cropping intensification and to enhance productivity and profitability.

TI  - Early-Season forecasting of citrus block-yield using time series remote sensing and machine learning: A case study in Australian orchards
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of seasonal, locational, and varietal variations in canopy reflectance responses in 315 commercial citrus blocks from three major growing regions in Australia. The dataset includes three different citrus types (Mandarin, Navel, Valencia) and 26 varieties. The aim is to utilize this combined information to better understand yield variation and develop improved forecasting models. Landsat satellite data spanning from October 2006 to February 2021 (1419 tiles) were used to derive reflectance values, and calculate four vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, LSWI, and GCVI), for each citrus block. These indices were then analyzed alongside corresponding yield data, which consisted of 3660 individual yield records dating back to 2007. Two temporal resolutions were incorporated as predictors: spatio-temporal vegetation index time series (TS) aggregated every two months and annual time series of historical block-yield records. Six statistical and machine learning algorithms were calibrated using a leave-one-year-out cross-validation approach (LOYO CV) and validated for one-year forward prediction over a five-year period (2017-2021). The results highlight sig-nificant yield variations across years, alternate bearing patterns, and spatio-temporal changes in reflectance profiles influenced by seasonal conditions, varietal characteristics, and locations. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with a radial basis function kernel consistently outperformed other algorithms, indicating a non-linear relationship between citrus yield and predictors. The SVM model achieved an RMSE of 15.5 T ha-1, R2 of 0.88, MAE of 12.1 T ha-1, and MAPE of 29% in predicting block-yield across farms, varieties, and seasons. These prediction accuracy metrics demonstrate an improvement over current forecasting methods. Notably, the proposed approach utilizes freely available imagery, provides forecasts between two to nine months before harvest, and eliminates the need for infield counting of fruit load for image calibration. This approach provides an improved method for understanding seasonal yield variation and quantifying citrus block-yield, offering valuable insights for growers in harvest logistics, labor allocation, and resource management.

TI  - Risk Assessment and Mapping of Flash Flood Vulnerable Zones in Arid Region, Fujairah City, UAE-Using Remote Sensing and GIS-Based Analysis
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - A flash flood is the most common natural hazard that endangers people's lives, the economy, and infrastructure. Watershed management and planning are essential for reducing flood damages, particularly in residential areas, and mapping flash flood-sensitive zones. Flash flooding is an interface dynamic between geoterrain system factors such as geology, geomorphology, soil, drainage density, slope, and flood, rather than only water movement from higher to lower elevation. Consequently, the vulnerability to flash floods necessitates an awareness of and mapping topographical features. A flash flood vulnerable zones (FFVZ) map is essential for thorough flash flood risk assessment and management to minimize its detrimental effects, particularly in residential areas, especially in cities like Fujairah with seven wadis flowing into the city and even though it has two main dams and fifteen breaker dams. So, in this work, eight satellite image-derived parameters rainfall, elevation, slope, land use/land cover (LULC), drainage density, geology, geomorphology, and soil were combined to predict the flash flood-vulnerable zones using a weighted overlay technique based on geographic information systems (GIS). Each element of the thematic maps is ranked and weighted according to how vulnerable it is to flash floods in the study area, with 55 km(2) being classified as a very highly vulnerable area, 78 km(2) as a high-risk area, 9.3 km(2) as a moderate risk area, 70 km(2) as a low vulnerable area, and 257 km(2) as a very low vulnerable area. In addition, places with a very high vulnerability level include the Fujairah Airport, Fujairah Port, some residential neighborhoods in the city's center, oil storage areas, two hospitals, and universities. Additionally, from 1990 to the present, Landsat and Sentinel 2 data showed consistent changes in vegetation and built-up areas. Therefore, in addition to helping policy and decision-makers make the best choices about the efficacy of the study area's protective structures against the risk of flash floods in the future, the results can also be a valuable source of information.

TI  - Maximizing Solid Organ and Face Transplant Procurement Team Coordination: The Posterior Tibial Artery Flap as an Ideal Sentinel Flap.
T2  - Mayo Clinic proceedings. Innovations, quality & outcomes
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Face transplantation became a reality with the first case performed in 2005. Facial tissue allograft procurement is technically complex and time-intensive. Brain-dead deceased donors are frequently, if not always, multiorgan donors. Every effort should be made during face allograft recovery to minimize any risk to the recovery of lifesaving solid organs. Some programs require the procurement of a myofascial vascularized skin graft to function as a sentinel flap allowing frequent monitoring for rejection without negatively impacting the esthetics of the face graft. Up till now, the flap used has been the radial forearm flap. Procuring the radial forearm flap places the procuring team in close proximity to the head and torso, where the face recovery and the solid organ recovery teams would require unhindered access. Here, we present the posterior tibial artery flap as an alternative flap that would provide benefits to the coordination of the multiple teams working to procure organs from a deceased donor.

TI  - Investigating the Direct and Spillover Effects of Urbanization on Energy-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions in China Using Nighttime Light Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are the main emission sources of the CO2 produced by energy use around the globe and have a great impact on the variation of climate. Although the implications of urbanization and socioeconomic elements for carbon emission have been extensively explored, previous studies have mostly focused on developed cities, and there is a lack of research into naturally related elements due to the limited data. At present, remote sensing data provide favorable conditions for the study of large-scale and long-time series. Also, the spillover mechanism of urbanization effects on the discharge of carbon has not been fully studied. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish the types of influence that various urbanization factors have on emissions of CO2. Firstly, this study quantifies the urban CO2 emissions in China by utilizing nighttime lighting images. Then, the spatio-temporal variations and spatial dependence modes of CO2 emissions are explored for 284 cities in China from 2000-2018. Finally, the study further ascertains that multi-dimensional urbanization, socio-economic and climate variables affect the discharge of carbon using spatial regression models. The results indicate that CO2 emissions have a remarkable positive spatial autocorrelation. Urbanization significantly increases CO(2 )emissions, of which the land urbanization contribution towards CO2 emissions is the most important in terms of spillover effects. Specifically, the data on urbanization's direct effects reveal that CO2 emissions will increase 0.066%when the urbanization level of a city rises 1%, while the spillover effect indicates that an 0.492% emissions increase is associated with a 1% rise of bordering cities' average urbanization level. As for the socio-economic factors, population density suppresses CO(2 )emissions, while technological levels boost CO2 emissions. The natural control factors effect a remarkable impact on CO2 emissions by adjusting energy consumption. This study can provide evidence for regional joint prevention in urban energy conservation, emission reduction, and climate change mitigation.

TI  - Feasibility of Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping With Carbon Nanoparticles in Cervical Cancer: A Retrospective Study
T2  - CANCER CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction This retrospective study aims to investigate the feasibility of using carbon nanoparticles to detect sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in cervical cancer.Methods This study involved 174 patients with cervical cancer. Cervix tissues adjacent to the cancer were injected with 1 mL of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions according to the instructions. The pelvic lymph nodes were then dissected, and the black-stained sentinel lymph nodes were sectioned for pathological examination.Results Of 174 cases, 88.5% of patients (154/174) had at least 1 sentinel lymph node, and 131 patients (75.29%) had bilateral pelvic sentinel lymph nodes. The left pelvic lymph node was the most common sentinel lymph node (34.16%). At least 1 sentinel lymph node was observed in 285 out of 348 hemipelvises, with a detection rate of a side-specific sentinel lymph node of 81.89%. In total, 47 hemipelvises had metastasis of the lymph node, and 33 involved the sentinel lymph node, with a sensitivity of 70.21% and a false-negative rate of 29.79%. There were 238 hemipelvises with no metastasis of the lymph node, as well as negative sentinel lymph nodes, with a specificity of 100% and a negative predictive value of 94.44%. The univariate analysis demonstrated that risk factors included tumor size (OR .598, 95% CI: .369-.970) and deep stromal invasion (OR .381, 95% CI: .187-.779). The deep stromal invasion was the only variable for the false-negative detection of a sentinel lymph node.Conclusion Sentinel lymph node mapping with carbon nanoparticles might be applied to predict the metastasis of pelvic lymph nodes in cervical cancer. However, tumor size and deep stromal invasion might negative influence the detection rate of SLN.

TI  - Urban flood risk assessment using Sentinel-1 on the google earth engine: A case study in Thai Nguyen city, Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud computing architecture on which Google Earth Engine (GEE) is built efficiently handles satellite photos and keeps tabs on data sources. GEE has potential benefits and is being used more often in disaster management. This research aims to aid in flood risk management by developing a framework to rapidly quantify urban flood risk assessment utilizing Sentinel-1 on the GEE and socio-economic data using spatial analytic techniques in GIS. Specifically, this approach only evaluated the flood risk based on the flood events and their impact on social-economic aspects. The flood risk analysis results show that the impact of flood events in Thai Nguyen city is significant. Specifically, 33 educational institutions, 04 medical facilities, 116.46 ha of traffic road, 1406.42 ha of agricultural land, and 762.7 ha of residential land were affected by flood risk. The impact assessment maps provide detailed information on the quantities and locations of the affected areas. These assessments can assist local managers in preventing and minimizing damages, providing necessary information for implementing planning solutions, and appropriate land use in the future.

TI  - Fracture analysis at different scales, a crucial technique for optimizing site selection and quarrying of natural stone, Lashotor limestone quarry, Iran
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lashotor, as one of the most famous Iranian stone quarries, is located in the Isfahan province. The main sedimentary sequence exposed in this area consists of Cretaceous limestones. Various discontinuities in these sequences have greatly affected the quality of the carbonate rocks. Block size in carbonate stone quarries is controlled by the pattern and distribution of different discontinuities including fractures and stylolites. So, focusing on fracture patterns is critical to enhancing extraction in the Lashotor quarry which faces a big problem for extraction of large profitable block size stones regarding their distributed discontinuities. Based on the prepared fracture intensity map using remote sensing data and field study, two areas of high fracture intensity were detected in the NW and SE parts of the study area. So it was suggested that future quarry must be performed within the areas with low fracture intensities. Also, 3DEC modeling was done based on geometrical attitudes of discontinuities and faces considering the dimensions of stairs in the quarry to optimize the natural stone block extraction. According to the 3DEC modeling results, the volume of the blocks in this building stone quarry has been controlled by the pattern and distribution of different discontinuity systems including fractures and stylolites. Finally, changes in the strike of the face (to N-S or NE-SW) concerning the dominant strike of the discontinuities (mainly E-W and NW-SE) can greatly increase the profitability of the natural stone blocks and decrease waste.

TI  - Serological Evidence Supporting the Occurrence of <i>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</i> or a Closely Related Species in Brazilian Dogs
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ehrlichia chaffeensis is a tick-borne bacterium that causes human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis, an emerging life-threatening disease in humans transmitted by Amblyomma americanum. Although most studies have reported bacterial isolations and clinical cases in the United States, their occurrence is not restricted to North America. Some studies in the Southern Cone of South America have molecularly detected a close phylogenetic relative of E. chaffeensis in ticks and wild mammals. Even so, many gaps must be filled to confirm the presence of this agent in the region. To add new data on this issue, we report the first detection of specific anti-E. chaffeensis antibodies in dogs collected from all regions of Brazil. By means of IFA and ELISA with crude and specific antigens of E. chaffeensis, sera from 1134 dogs were analyzed. Serological analyses using ELISA showed nine (0.7%) seropositive dogs, with seven of them exhibiting IFA titers ranging from 160 to 5120. All regions of Brazil had at least one seropositive dog. Our results support the evidence for the occurrence of E. chaffeensis in South America. As dogs have a close relationship with humans, they can be used as an environmental sentinel for these infections because they can act as a bridge to human parasitism or infection with ehrlichial agents.

TI  - Assessment of soil erosion hazard and its relation to land use land cover changes: Case study from alage watershed, central Rift Valley of Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion by water and wind is among the most crucial land degradation processes in Ethiopia. This is also the case for Alage watershed located in the cental Rift Valley system. This study aimed at assessment of soil erosion hazard and its relation to land use land cover change in the watershed during the period from 1984 to 2016 for a better land management. The study is based on application of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) to extract inputs factor values for the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Time-series satellite imageries of Landsat TM 1984, ETM+ 2000 and OLI 2016 were used for land use land cover change detection and determination of cover management (C) factor of the RUSLE. Biophysical data such as rainfall, soil properties, land management practices including soil and water conservation measures within the watershed were collected using field survey and secondary data sources. Slope steepness and slope length factors were derived using Digital Elevaition Model (DEM). Long-term average annual soil loss rates were estimated by the RUSLE integrated with GIS for 1984, 2000 and 2016. Using satellite imageries, the land use land cover and changes within the watershed during the three periods were obtained through a supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithim. The results of land use land cover change indicated that the proportion of rain-fed cropland, bare land and built up areas increased by 17.4%, 5.9% and 2.9% respectively over the three study period. In contrast the proportion of bush/shrub land, irrigated cropland, grass land, forested areas and waterbodies decresaed by 15.5%, 4.7%, 3.4%, 2.3% and 0.3% respectively during the same period. Estimated average annual soil loss rates showed an increasing trend from 24.3 ton ha-1 yr- 1 in 1984 to 38 ton ha-1 yr- 1 in 2016. Increasing trends of average annual soil loss rate is attributed to increased proportion of cropland, bare land and built up areas during those periods leading to decreased protective vegetation cover. Hotspot areas within the watershed require implementation of land management practices to prevent further degradation and expansion of gullies. This study is relevant to demonstrate environmental implication of land use land cover change for future land management practices and land use policy in the Rift Valley of central Ethiopia.

TI  - Remote sensing environmental indicators for monitoring spatial and temporal dynamics of weather and vegetation conditions: applications for Brazilian biomes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) algorithm and the radiation use efficiency (RUE) model were coupled to test large-scale remote sensing environmental indicators in Brazilian biomes. MODIS MOD13Q1 reflectance product and gridded weather data for the year 2016 were used to demonstrate the suitability of the algorithm to monitor the dynamics of environmental remote sensing indicators along a year in the Brazilian biomes, Amazon, Caatinga, Cerrado, Pantanal, Atlantic Forest, and Pampa. Significant spatial and temporal variations in precipitation (P), actual evapotranspiration (ET), and biomass production (BIO) yielded differences on water balance (WB = P-ET) and water productivity (WP = ET/BIO). The highest WB and WP differences were detected in the wettest biomes, Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and Pampa, when compared with the driest biome, Caatinga. Rainfall distribution along the year affected the magnitude of the evaporative fraction (ETf), i.e., the ET to reference evapotranspiration (ET0) ratio. However, there was a gap between ETf and WB, which may be related to the time needed for recovering good soil moisture conditions after rainfalls. For some biomes, BIO related most to the levels of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (Amazon and Atlantic Forest), while for others, BIO followed most the soil moisture levels, depicted by ETf (Caatinga, Cerrado, Pantanal, and Pampa). The large-scale modeling showed suitability for monitoring the water and vegetation conditions, making way to detect anomalies for specific periods along the year by using historical images and weather data, with strong potential to support public policies for management and conservation of natural resources and with possibilities for replication of the methods in other countries.

TI  - Long-term monitoring of forest cover change resulting in forest loss in the capital of Luang Prabang province, Lao PDR
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Loss of forest cover has an important impact on global climate change. This study investigated variation in forest cover in Luang Prabang district, the capital of Luang Prabang province, Lao PDR, using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite imagery over the period 1988-2021. The maximum likelihood classification technique was used to classify Landsat images of the years 1988, 2001, 2011, and 2021 and was evaluated for accuracy using the kappa coefficient for each year (0.860, 0.869, 0.878, and 0.950, respectively). The potential of classification based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) to detect changes in natural forest and cultivated forest cover compared with supervised classification was also evaluated. The natural forest cover of the study area was estimated at 84.09% (687.82 km(2)) of the total land area in 1988. This number decreased to 56.93% (465.69 km(2)) in 2001 and subsequently increased to 60.85% (497.77 km(2)) in 2011 and 66.49% (543.92 km(2)) in 2021. Cultivated forest cover in 1988 was 4.96% (40.58 km(2)) and increased to 16.84% (137.76 km(2)) in 2001, however it decreased to 13.57% (110.97 km(2)) in 2011 and 9.67% (79.10 km(2)) in 2021. Severely reduced forest cover is often associated with the expansion of agriculture on the forest edge. Logging and charcoal production are other problems that contribute to the reduction of forest cover. Overall, our results show the necessity of forest management, rational land-use planning policy, and increased community awareness of conservation and sustainable development of forest resources in the study area in the future.

TI  - Decreasing surface chlorophyll in the tropical ocean as an indicator of anthropogenic greenhouse effect during 1998-2020
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Available satellite data reveal a decreasing trend in surface chlorophyll (SChl) over the entire tropical ocean until 2020. Where contributions by internal variability and external forcing remain unclear. Here, state-of-the-art climate model simulations are analyzed to show that external forcing significantly contributes to the decreasing SChl trend. In contrast, internal variability plays a weak or even offsetting role. As for the underlying processes, anthropogenic greenhouse emissions lead to a remarkable reduction in SChl over the tropical oceans, whereas industrial aerosol load facilitates a considerable increase in SChl in the western tropical Pacific. In addition, the negative phase of the interdecadal Pacific variability during 1998-2020 contributes to an increase in SChl, while the impact from the Atlantic multidecadal variability is relatively weak in facilitating a decrease in SChl. Overall, these results imply that the impact of anthropogenic forcing has emerged as indicated in the tropical marine ecosystem.

TI  - Regional Monitoring of Leaf ChlorophyII Content of Summer Maize by Integrating Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study addresses the problem of restricted ability for large-scale monitoring due to the limited cruising time of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) by identifying an optimal leaf ChlorophyII content (LCC) inversion machine learning model at different scales and under different parameterization schemes based on simultaneous observations of ground sampling, UAV flight, and satellite imagery. The following results emerged: (1) The correlation coefficient between most remote sensing features (RSFs) and LCC increased as the remote scale expanded; thus, the scale error caused by the random position difference between GPS and measuring equipment should be considered in field sampling observations. (2) The LCC simulation accuracy of the UAV multi-spectral camera using four machine learning algorithms was ExtraTree > GradientBoost > AdaBoost > RandomForest, and the 20- and 30-pixel scales had better accuracy than the 10-pixel scale, while the accuracy for three feature combination schemes ranked combination of extremely significantly correlated RSFs > combination of significantly correlated and above RSFs > combination of all features. ExtraTree was confirmed as the optimal model with the feature combination of scheme 2 at the 20-pixel scale. (3) Of the Sentinel-2 RSFs, 27 of 28 were extremely significantly correlated with LCC, while original band reflectance was negatively correlated, and VIs were positively correlated. (4) The LCC simulation accuracy of the four machine learning algorithms ranked as ExtraTree > GradientBoost > RandomForest > AdaBoost. In a comparison of two parameterization schemes, scheme 1 had better accuracy, while ExtraTree was the best algorithm, with 11 band reflectance as input RSFs; the RMSE values for the training and testing data sets of 0.7213 and 1.7198, respectively.

TI  - GLFFNet: A Global and Local Features Fusion Network with Biencoder for Remote Sensing Image Segmentation
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images has been gradually applied to many important scenes. However, with the rapid development of remote sensing data acquisition technology, the existing image data processing methods are facing major challenges. Especially in the accuracy of extraction and the integrity of the edges of objects, there are often problems such as small objects being assimilated by large objects. In order to solve the above problems, based on the excellent performance of Transformer, convolution and its variants, and feature pyramids in the field of deep learning image segmentation, we designed two encoders with excellent performance to extract global high-order interactive features and low-order local feature information. These encoders are then used as the backbone to construct a global and local feature fusion network with a dual encoder (GLFFNet) to effectively complete the segmentation of remote sensing images. Furthermore, a new auxiliary training module is proposed that uses the semantic attention layer to process the extracted feature maps separately, adjust the losses, and more specifically optimize each encoder of the backbone, thus optimizing the training process of the entire network. A large number of experiments show that our model achieves 87.96% mIoU on the Potsdam dataset and 80.42% mIoU on the GID dataset, and it has superior performance compared with some state-of-the-art methods on semantic segmentation tasks in the field of remote sensing.

TI  - How Important Is Satellite-Retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth in Deriving Surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> Using Machine Learning?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 refers to the total mass concentration of tiny particulates in the atmosphere near the surface, obtained by means of in situ observations and satellite remote sensing. Given the highly limited number of ground observation stations of inhomogeneous distribution and an ill-posed remote sensing approach, increasing efforts have been devoted to the application of machine-learning (ML) models to both ground and satellite data. A key satellite-derived parameter, aerosol optical thickness (AOD), has been most commonly used as a proxy of PM2.5, although their correlation is fraught with large uncertainties. A critical question that has been overlooked concerns how much AOD helps to improve the retrieval of PM2.5 relative to its uncertainty incurred concurrently. The question is addressed here by taking advantage of high-density PM2.5 stations in eastern China to evaluate the contributions of AOD, determined as the difference in the accuracy of PM2.5 retrievals with and without AOD for varying densities of PM2.5 stations, using four popular ML models (i.e., Random Forest, Extra-trees, XGBoost, and LightGBM). Our results reveal that as the density of monitoring stations decreases, both the feature importance and permutation importance of satellite AOD demonstrate a consistent upward trend (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the ML models without AOD exhibit faster declines in overall accuracy and predictive ability compared with the models with AOD assessed using the sample-based and station-based (spatial) independent cross-validation approaches. Overall, a 10% reduction in the number of stations results in an increase of 0.7-1.2% and 0.6-1.2% in uncertainty in estimated and predicted accuracies, respectively. These findings attest to the indispensable role of satellite AOD in the PM2.5 retrieval process through ML because it can significantly mitigate the negative impact of the sparse distribution of monitoring sites. This role becomes more important as the number of PM2.5 stations decreases.

TI  - Modelling the impacts of changing land use and climate on sediment and nutrient retention in Lake Tana Basin, Upper Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural ecosystems provide many different services such as carbon sequestration, regulation of climate change, biodiversity, and aesthetic value. Ecosystem functions are significantly impacted by both natural and man-made processes, such as sediment and nutrient deposition. The Lake Tana basin faces significant problems with soil depletion, sedimentation, and degradation. Thus, this study is designed to assess the effects of climate and land use change on the export of sediment and nutrients as well as their retention in the basin. This study used different data sources such as satellite data for land use and land cover and watershed preparation, climate data from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) and Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase five (CMIP5), soil data from Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Electricity (MoWIE), and field data for model calibration. Five different Global Climate Models (GCMs) were employed to produce climate projections using the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) for the basin. The cellular automata (CA) and Markov chain has then been employed for future projections of changes in land use. Finally, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoff (InVEST) sediment delivery ratio (SDR) and nutrient delivery ratio (NDR) models have been applied to assess the changes in sediment and nutrient export between the baseline and future time periods. The findings indicated that between 1990 and 2019, there was a change in land use that led to an increase in sediment exports of 60.5% and a decrease in sediment retention of 12.8%. Projecting into the future, the amount of exported and retained sediment increases under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios in the 2040s by 8.4% and 17.8%, respectively due to the combined effects of climate and land use change. Equally, nitrogen and phosphorus exports rose under land use change scenarios but are projected to decrease under climate and integrated climate and land use change scenarios. Out of the 12 sub-watersheds that were designated, five were found to have a high mean annual rate of sediment and nutrient export and were then ranked in terms of priority level for conservation planning. Hence, this research shows that the integration of spatial data with the InVEST model can be used to aid land use planning and decision-making to combat nutrient and sediment exports and prioritize watersheds.

T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-WESTERN PACIFIC
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Half of diarrhea hospitalizations in children aged <5 years in Vietnam are due to rotavirus. Following introduction of a locally developed and licensed oral rotavirus vaccine, Rotavin-M1, into the routine immunization program in two Vietnamese provinces, Nam Dinh and TT Hue, we describe changes in rotavirus positivity among children hospitalized for diarrhea and calculate vaccine effectiveness against moderate-to-severe rotavirus hospitalizations.Methods Active rotavirus surveillance among children <5 years began in December 2016 at sentinel hospitals in districts where rotavirus vaccine was introduced in December 2017. To estimate reductions in rotavirus detection, we calculated risk ratios comparing rotavirus positivity pre-and post-vaccine introduction. We used a test-negative case- control design to calculate vaccine effectiveness.Findings From December 2016 to May 2021, 7228 children <5 years hospitalized for diarrhea were enrolled. Following introduction, Rotavin-M1 coverage was 77% (1066/1377) in Nam Dinh and 42% (203/489) in TT Hue. In Nam Dinh, rotavirus positivity among children <5 years significantly declined by 40.6% (95% CI: 34.8%-45.8%) during the three-year post-vaccine introduction period. In TT Hue, no change in rotavirus positivity was observed. Among children aged 6-23 months, a 2-dose series of Rotavin-M1 was 57% (95% CI: 39%-70%) effective against moderate-to-severe rotavirus hospitalizations.Interpretation Higher vaccination coverage in Nam Dinh than TT Hue likely contributed to substantial declines in rotavirus positivity observed in Nam Dinh following rotavirus vaccine introduction. Robust vaccine effectiveness was observed through the second year of life. National rotavirus vaccine introduction with high coverage may have substantial impact on reducing rotavirus disease burden in Vietnam.Copyright Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The concept of pelvic sentinel lymph node mapping has been well investigated in endometrial and cervical cancer. A variety of tracers have been used including blue dye, technetium-99-m (Tc-99 m), and fluorescent tracer indocyanine green. Pelvic sentinel lymph node mapping has shown its safety, efficacy, and diagnostic accuracy, with high sensitivity and negative predictive value of more than 90%, in retrospective cohort studies as well as in prospective trials for robotic surgery. The concept of pelvic sentinel lymph node biopsy has been incorporated in several international guidelines in early-stage endometrial cancer and a subgroup of early-stage cervical cancer, although survival data are still needed to confirm its standard use. The application of para-aortic sentinel lymph node mapping is still in a development phase, but its detection rate and diagnostic accuracy seem to be promising in initial studies. Here, an overview is given of the recent developments in the different methodologies used for identifying para-aortic sentinel lymph nodes in endometrial, cervical, and ovarian cancer.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the changes in tussock grass greenness over 18 years (2001-2018) using NDVI data from 10 key areas of the Paramo ecosystem in the Ecuadorian Andes. In addition, the study investigated the influence of hydrometeorological variables (precipitation, soil temperature, and water availability) and climatic indices (AAO, MEI, MJO, NAO, PDO, El Nino 1 + 2, 3, 3.4, and 4) on greenness dynamics. The spatial and temporal variations of NDVI were studied, applying several analysis and indicators, such as: the standard deviation, z-score anomalies, Sen slope, Mann-Kendall test, and time integrated-NDVI (TI-NDVI). Linear and multilinear correlations were used to evaluate the influence of hydrometeorological variables and climatic indices on the greenness of tussock. The findings of the study show that Paramo, located in the Inter-Andean valley above 2 & DEG; S, is the most productive, followed by those located in the Royal Range (eastern cordillera). The anomalies and trends of NDVI on the Royal Range tended to be greening over time. NDVI showed a moderate multilinear correlation with precipitation and soil temperature, and a strong response to water availability. Finally, NDVI was weakly linearly related to the climatic indices, the most representative being the MJO, and slightly related to ENSO events. Understanding the regional and global-scale variables that control tussock grasses' phenology will help to determine how present and future climate changes will impact this ecosystem.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Much attention from scientists around the world is currently focused on monitoring the tropospheric ozone content, because ozone in the troposphere is both a greenhouse and a pollutant gas. It also plays an important role in various chemical and photochemical processes. Various ground-based measurements can be used to assess the quality and validate satellite measurements of the global ozone distribution. Time series of ozone content in the 0-8 km tropospheric layer based on the spectral measurements of the IASI satellite instrument using two different algorithms (IASI_LATMOS and IASI_LISA) and from joint measurements by the IASI and GOME-2 instruments (IASI-GOME2) have been compared with ground-based measurements at NDACC St. Petersburg station measured using a Bruker IFS 125HR (FTIR) Fourier spectrometer over the period 2009-2021. IASI_LISA and IASI-GOME2 data generally overestimate ground-based ozone measurements in the 0-8 km layer by 9.8 and 5.1%, respectively; there are no systematic differences between the IASI_LATMOS and FTIR data. The standard deviations of the differences between ground measurements and the IASI_LISA and IASI_LATMOS data do not exceed 12-13%; for the IASI-GOME2 data they are 24.5%. The data of ground-based and satellite measurements are best correlated in spring and summer. Ground-based and satellite measurements of IASI_LATMOS show the presence of a statistically significant negative trend in the ozone content in the 0-8 km layer in the vicinity of St. Petersburg over the period 2012-2021, which is -0.71 +/- 0.35% per year and -0.60 +/- 0.21% per year, respectively.

TI  - Multi-Featured Sea Ice Classification with SAR Image Based on Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice is a significant factor in influencing environmental change on Earth. Monitoring sea ice is of major importance, and one of the main objectives of this monitoring is sea ice classification. Currently, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are primarily used for sea ice classification, with a single polarization band or simple combinations of polarization bands being common choices. While much of the current research has focused on optimizing network structures to achieve high classification accuracy, which requires substantial training resources, we aim to extract more information from the SAR data for classification. Therefore we propose a multi-featured SAR sea ice classification method that combines polarization features calculated by polarization decomposition and spectrogram features calculated by joint time-frequency analysis (JTFA). We built a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure for learning the multi-features of sea ice, which combines spatial features and physical properties, including polarization and spectrogram features of sea ice. In this paper, we utilized ALOS PALSAR SLC data with HH, HV, VH, and VV, four types of polarization for the multi-featured sea ice classification method. We divided the sea ice into new ice (NI), first-year ice (FI), old ice (OI), deformed ice (DI), and open water (OW). Then, the accuracy calculation by confusion matrix and comparative analysis were carried out. Our experimental results demonstrate that the multi-feature method proposed in this paper can achieve high accuracy with a smaller data volume and computational effort. In the four scenes selected for validation, the overall accuracy could reach 95%, 91%, 96%, and 95%, respectively, which represents a significant improvement compared to the single-feature sea ice classification method.

T2  - BIOSENSORS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in molecular technologies have provided various assay strategies for monitoring biomarkers, such as miRNAs for early detection of various diseases and cancers. However, there is still an urgent unmet need to develop practical and accurate miRNA analytical tools that could facilitate the incorporation of miRNA biomarkers into clinical practice and management. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a cascade amplification method, referred to as the "Cascade Amplification by Recycling Trigger Probe" (CARTP) strategy, to improve the detection sensitivity of the inverse Molecular Sentinel (iMS) nanobiosensor. The iMS nanobiosensor developed in our laboratory is a unique homogeneous multiplex bioassay technique based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection, and was used to successfully detect miRNAs from clinical samples. The CARTP strategy based on the toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction is triggered by a linear DNA strand, called the "Recycling Trigger Probe" (RTP) strand, to amplify the iMS SERS signal. Herein, by using the CARTP strategy, we show a significantly improved detection sensitivity with the limit of detection (LOD) of 45 fM, which is 100-fold more sensitive than the non-amplified iMS assay used in our previous report. We envision that the further development and optimization of this strategy ultimately will allow multiplexed detection of miRNA biomarkers with ultra-high sensitivity for clinical translation and application.

TI  - Characterizing Soil Profile Salinization in Cotton Fields Using Landsat 8 Time-Series Data in Southern Xinjiang, China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a major obstacle to land productivity, crop yield and crop quality in arid areas and directly affects food security. Soil profile salt data are key for accurately determining irrigation volumes. To explore the potential for using Landsat 8 time-series data to monitor soil salinization, 172 Landsat 8 images from 2013 to 2019 were obtained from the Alar Reclamation Area of Xinjiang, northwest China. The multiyear extreme dataset was synthesized from the annual maximum or minimum values of 16 vegetation indices, which were combined with the soil conductivity of 540 samples from soil profiles at 0 similar to 0.375 m, 0 similar to 0.75 m and 0 similar to 1.00 m depths in 30 cotton fields with varying degrees of salinization as investigated by EM38-MK2. Three remote sensing monitoring models for soil conductivity at different depths were constructed using the Cubist method, and digital mapping was carried out. The results showed that the Cubist model of soil profile electrical conductivity from 0 to 0.375 m, 0 to 0.75 m and 0 to 1.00 m showed high prediction accuracy, and the determination coefficients of the prediction set were 0.80, 0.74 and 0.72, respectively. Therefore, it is feasible to use a multiyear extreme value for the vegetation index combined with a Cubist modeling method to monitor soil profile salinization at a regional scale.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Forest Landscape in China's Giant Panda National Park: A Case Study of Jiudingshan Nature Reserve
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous prohibition of commercial logging and intensifying conservation endeavors have encompassed the implementation of the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP) by the Chinese government since 1999. Nevertheless, the efficacy of the commercial logging ban and its effectiveness in halting deforestation remain uncertain. Likewise, the destructive aftermath of the 7.9 magnitude Wenchuan earthquake in 2008 continues to be under scrutiny, necessitating ongoing study and analysis. Thus, there exists a pressing need to comprehensively monitor the spatio-temporal evolution of the forest habitat and assess the ecological status over the past two decades. The Jiudingshan Nature Reserve (JNR) is situated in the upper reaches of the Tuojiang River basin in Sichuan province, China, constituting an integral part of the Giant Panda National Park (GPNP). In this study, we classified land cover types and conducted a meticulous monitoring of forest habitat alterations within JNR, by a multilayer perceptron model (MLP) with a highly learning-sensitive algorithm. To quantify these changes, the Simple Ratio Index (SRI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were computed from Landsat TM/OLI images of four years (i.e., 1997, 2007, 2008, and 2018). Additionally, elevation, slope, aspect, and other topographic data were acquired from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The findings of our study unveil a notable expansion in both the scope and proportion of mixed conifer and broadleaf forest from 1997 to 2004. The growth of coniferous forest and the augmented areas of mixed conifer and broadleaf forest signify a substantial improvement in panda habitat. However, the seismic event of 2008 exhibited a pronounced adverse impact on vegetation, particularly within forested regions. Although there is evidence of forest recovery spanning 21 years, concerns regarding fragmentation linger. It is pivotal to acknowledge the potential long-term adverse implications arising from widespread socio-economic development and a multitude of geohazards. Hence, sustained long-term monitoring coupled with effective management strategies remain pivotal for the preservation and rehabilitation of the Giant Panda National Park (GPNP) and giant panda habitat in the future.

TI  - Fine-Scale Analysis of the Long-Term Urban Thermal Environment in Shanghai Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the spatiotemporal patterns of urban thermal environments is crucial for mitigating the detrimental effects of urban heat islands (UHI). However, the long-term and fine-grained monitoring of UHI is limited by the temporal and spatial resolutions of various sensors. To address this limitation, this study employed the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and a multi-source remote sensing data fusion approach to generate a densely time-resolved Landsat-like Land Surface Temperature (LST) dataset for daytime observations spanning from 2001 to 2020 in Shanghai. A comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns of UHI was conducted. The results indicate that over the past 20 years, the highest increase in average LST was observed during spring with a growth coefficient of 0.23, while the lowest increase occurred during autumn (growth coefficient of 0.12). The summer season exhibited the most pronounced UHI effect in the region (average proportion of Strong UHI and General UHI was 28.73%), while the winter season showed the weakest UHI effect (proportion of 22.77%). The Strong UHI areas gradually expanded outward over time, with a noticeable intensification of heat island intensity in the northwest and coastal regions, while other areas did not exhibit significant changes. Impervious surfaces contributed the most to LST, with a contribution of 0.96 & DEG;C, while water had the lowest contribution (-0.42 & DEG;C). The average correlation coefficients between LST and NDVI, NDWI, and NDBI over 20 years were -0.4236, -0.5128, and 0.5631, respectively.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Methods for Estimating Leaf Area Index and Aboveground Biomass of <i>Cinnamomum camphora</i> Based on UAV Multispectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - UAV multispectral technology is used to obtain leaf area index (LAI) and aboveground biomass (AGB) information on Cinnamomum camphora (C. camphora) and to diagnose the growth condition of Cinnamomum camphora dwarf forests in a timely and rapid manner, which helps improve the precision management of Cinnamomum camphora dwarf forests. Multispectral remote sensing images provide large-area plant spectral information, which can provide a detailed quantitative assessment of LAI, AGB and other plant physicochemical parameters. They are very effective tools for assessing and analyzing plant health. In this study, the Cinnamomum camphora dwarf forest in the red soil area of south China is taken as the research object. Remote sensing images of Cinnamomum camphora dwarf forest canopy are obtained by the multispectral camera of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and support vector regression (SVR) algorithms are used to study the correlation and estimation accuracy between the original band reflectance, spectral indices and LAI and AGB of Cinnamomum camphora. The results of this study showed the following: (1) The accuracy of model estimation based on RF is significantly different for different model inputs, while the other four models have small differences. (2) The accuracy of the XGBoost-based LAI model was the highest; with original band reflectance as the model input, the R2 of the model test set was 0.862, and the RMSE was 0.390. (3) The accuracy of the XGBoost-based AGB model was the highest; with spectral indices as the model input, the R2 of the model test set was 0.929, and the RMSE was 587.746 kg & BULL;hm-2. (4) The XGBoost model was the best model for the LAI and AGB estimation of Cinnamomum camphora, which was followed by GBDT, RF, RFNN, and SVR. This research result can provide a theoretical basis for monitoring a Cinnamomum camphora dwarf forest based on UAV multispectral technology and a reference for rapidly estimating Cinnamomum camphora growth parameters.

TI  - Hybrid model for estimating forest canopy heights using fused multimodal spaceborne LiDAR data and optical imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest canopy height is a key indicator for measuring global forest carbon stocks. Spaceborne LiDAR, a satellite remote sensing technology, plays an essential role in large-scale canopy height estimations. However, there are still some problems with existing methods of the spaceborne LiDAR canopy height estimates: the retrieval accuracy is degraded by the topographic relief and vegetation cover, as well as uneven spatial distribution of mapping height uncertainties. In this paper, we investigated the possibility of fusing multimodal spaceborne LiDAR and optical images to improve these above problems. We proposed a hybrid model fusing spaceborne full-waveform and photon-counting LiDAR data with optical imagery. Specifically, our approach divided the regional extent into multiple fusion patterns based on the spatial distribution of the LiDAR footprints in an object-oriented method. We then constructed canopy height models corresponding to each pattern and finally integrated the model results using a weighting scheme considering geospatial distances. We used GEDI (full-waveform LiDAR), ICESat-2 (photon-counting LiDAR) and Sentinel-2 (optical imagery) products as the input data and validated the model accuracy in four representative biomes of global forest ecosystems (i.e., evergreen broadleaf forests, deciduous broadleaf forests, savannas and coniferous forests). The experimental results demonstrated that fusing multisource spaceborne LiDAR data and optical images can not only enhance the canopy height estimation accuracy (R2 0.65 - 0.90 and RMSE 0.57 - 4.15 m in four biomes) but also maintain stable accuracy under undulating slope and large vegetation cover. Moreover, the uncertainty of canopy height estimation was low (mean error -0.20 - 0.03 m) and uniformly distributed in space (stdev 0.71 - 4.45 m). We also compared the performances with two other advanced canopy height models, as well as two global canopy height products, and our model showed significant advantages in each test region. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of fusing multimodal spaceborne LiDAR data and optical imagery for canopy height estimation accuracy improvement.

TI  - Predict Seasonal Maximum Freezing Depth Changes Using Machine Learning in China over the Last 50 Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal freezing depth change is important in many environmental science and engineering applications. However, such changes are rare at region scales, especially over China, in the long time series. In this study, we evaluated the annual changes in seasonal maximum freezing depth (MFD) over China from 1971 to 2020 using an ensemble-modeling method based on support vector machine regression (SVMR) with 600 repetitions. Remote sensing data and climate data were input variables used as predictors. The models were trained using a large amount of annual measurement data from 600 meteorological stations. The main reason for using SVMR here was because it has been shown to perform better than random forests (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and generalized linear regression (GLR) in these cases. The prediction results were generally consistent with the observed MFD values. Cross validation showed that the model performed well on training data and had a better spatial generalization ability. The results show that the freezing depth of seasonally frozen ground in China decreased year by year. The average MFD was reduced by 3.64 cm, 7.59 cm, 5.54 cm, and 5.58 cm, in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, respectively, compared with the decade before. In the last 50 years, the area occupied by the freezing depth ranges of 0-40 cm, 40-60 cm, 60-80 cm, 80-100 cm, and 120-140 cm increased by 99,300 square kilometers, 146,200 square kilometers, 130,300 square kilometers, 115,600 square kilometers, and 83,800 square kilometers, respectively. In addition to the slight decrease in freezing depth range of 100-120 cm, the reduced area was 29,500 square kilometers. Freezing depth ranges greater than 140 cm showed a decreasing trend. The freezing depth range of 140-160 cm, which was the lowest range, decreased by 89,700 square kilometers. The 160-180 cm range decreased by 120,500 square kilometers, and the 180-200 cm range decreased by 161,500 square kilometers. The freezing depth range greater than 200 cm, which was the highest reduction range, decreased by 174,000 square kilometers. Considering the lack of data on the change in MFD of seasonally frozen ground in China in recent decades, machine learning provides an effective method for studying meteorological data and reanalysis data in order to predict the changes in MFD.

TI  - CO and CH4 atmospheric trends from dense multi-point forest fires around the city of Chongqing using spaceborne spectrometer data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires greatly impact the global terrestrial ecology and atmospheric environment. It is important to improve fire prediction mechanisms and track fire trends. This study evaluates using spaceborne spectrometers (Sentinel -5P TROPOMI and Aqua AIRS) to track atmospheric CO and CH4 changes caused by more than a dozen forest fires around the main urban area of Chongqing, China. These forest fires consisted of dense, multi-point, small-scale outbreaks over a short period (August 17-26, 2022). All the fires were near human living areas, leading to relatively complex atmospheric trends. We obtained the spatial distribution of CO and CH4 and analysed the forest fires' exact occurrence and quenching time at each fire location. Concentration gradients of the CO column are consistent with the rise and fall of the fires observed at all fire points. Large CO plumes from different fire locations observed on August 21, and 22 have concentrations exceeding 0.07 molecules/m2. The average CO concentration data at nine ignition points are summed to reflect the temporal trend of CO in the atmosphere over the entire region. The CO2 column range estimated from the CO column was 0.16-0.63 molecules/m2 on August 22. We also tracked and analysed the atmospheric trend of methane concentration during the fire. Consequently, based on satellite data, tracking the temporal trends of CO and CH4 in the atmosphere caused by dense forest fires in a complex environment is feasible.

TI  - A Spatial-Temporal Bayesian Deep Image Prior Model for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Temporal Mixture Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series remote sensing images are important in agricultural monitoring and investigation. However, most time-series data with high temporal resolution have the problem of insufficient spatial resolution which cannot meet the requirement of precision agriculture. The unmixing technique can obtain the object abundances with richer spatial information from the coarse-resolution images. Although the unmixing technique is widely used in hyperspectral data, it is insufficiently researched for time-series data. Temporal unmixing extends spectral unmixing to the time domain from the spectral domain, and describes the temporal characteristics rather than the spectral characteristics of different ground objects. Deep learning (DL) techniques have achieved promising performance for the unmixing problem in recent years, but there are still few studies on temporal mixture analysis (TMA), especially in the application of crop phenological monitoring. This paper presents a novel spatial-temporal deep image prior method based on a Bayesian framework (ST-Bdip), which innovatively combines the knowledge-driven TMA model and the DL-driven model. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data is used as the object for TMA, while the extracted seasonal crop signatures and the fractional coverages are perceived as the temporal endmembers (tEMs) and corresponding abundances. The proposed ST-Bdip method mainly includes the following contributions. First, a deep image prior model based on U-Net architecture is designed to efficiently learn the spatial context information, which enhances the representation of abundance modeling compared to the traditional non-negative least squares algorithm. Second, The TMA model is incorporated into the U-Net training process to exploit the knowledge in the forward temporal model effectively. Third, the temporal noise heterogeneity in time-series images is considered in the model optimization process. Specifically, the anisotropic covariance matrix of observations from different time dimensions is modeled as a multivariate Gaussian distribution and incorporated into the calculation of the loss function. Fourth, the "purified means" approach is used to further optimize crop tEMs and the corresponding abundances. Finally, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is designed to solve the maximum a posterior (MAP) problem of the model in the Bayesian framework. Experimental results on three synthetic datasets with different noise levels and two real MODIS datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in comparison with seven traditional and advanced unmixing algorithms.

TI  - Real-time remote sensing detection framework of the earth's surface anomalies based on a priori knowledge base
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the suddenness, diversity, randomness and complexity of various earth's surface anomalies caused by natural and human factors, the time-efficiency of traditional satellite remote sensing technology is seriously lagging behind the actual needs of the earth's surface anomalies early warning and emergency handling. Realtime earth's surface anomaly detection has become an important issue for achieving ecological security, human safety and health, and high-quality socioeconomic development. Therefore, this study proposed a real-time detection framework for earth's surface anomalies using a single temporal remote sensing data based on a priori knowledge base. The framework first selected an appropriate remote sensing feature system and constructed a priori knowledge base effectively reflecting the natural evolutionary law of the normal earth's surface. Then, the earth's surface anomalies were identified by comparing the real-time acquired remote sensing data to the priori knowledge base with the designed detection rules. Finally, the intensity of earth's surface anomalies was evaluated comprehensively using pixel- and patch-scale information. The preliminary analysis of several specific cases indicated that the proposed framework was reliable and could effectively identify the earth's surface anomalies with high accuracy. This proposed framework is fully applicable to the real-time detection of most earth's surface anomalies using a single temporal remote sensing data, which is not limited to a single earth's surface anomaly event. Meanwhile, the framework presents great potential for on-orbit processing of the earth's surface anomaly detection and realizing real-time remote sensing services for the early warning of the earth's surface anomalies.

TI  - An Experimental Study of the Accuracy and Change Detection Potential of Blending Time Series Remote Sensing Images with Spatiotemporal Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over one hundred spatiotemporal fusion algorithms have been proposed, but convolutional neural networks trained with large amounts of data for spatiotemporal fusion have not shown significant advantages. In addition, no attention has been paid to whether fused images can be used for change detection. These two issues are addressed in this work. A new dataset consisting of nine pairs of images is designed to benchmark the accuracy of neural networks using one-pair spatiotemporal fusion with neural-network-based models. Notably, the size of each image is significantly larger compared to other datasets used to train neural networks. A comprehensive comparison of the radiometric, spectral, and structural losses is made using fourteen fusion algorithms and five datasets to illustrate the differences in the performance of spatiotemporal fusion algorithms with regard to various sensors and image sizes. A change detection experiment is conducted to test if it is feasible to detect changes in specific land covers using the fusion results. The experiment shows that convolutional neural networks can be used for one-pair spatiotemporal fusion if the sizes of individual images are adequately large. It also confirms that the spatiotemporally fused images can be used for change detection in certain scenes.

TI  - Research on Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Heat Island Variability and Influencing Factors in Urban Center Areas: A Case Study of Beijing's Central Area
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the urban heat island effect and actively exploring effective measures for its mitigation and alleviation can provide important parameters for urban ecological environment monitoring and propose rational strategies to address environmental degradation. This article, with the background of urban renewal projects in Beijing, focuses on the central area of Beijing as the research object. Landsat ETM+/OLI_ TIRS data from 2000 to 2020 are used as the main remote sensing imagery source, combined with functional information data and spatial attribute data of open spaces in the central area. Based on the mono-window (MW) algorithm, this study first quantitatively retrieves and categorizes the summer land surface temperature in Beijing's central area and analyzes its spatiotemporal characteristics using the direction distribution method, revealing regular patterns in the temporal and spatial dimensions. The results show a gradual decrease in the size of the persistent high-temperature concentration area over time. Subsequently, the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model is employed to predict the changing trends of the urban heat island and the occurrence time of the strongest and weakest heat islands. Higher land surface temperature (LST) years are projected for 2025 and 2035, with the lowest year being 2030. Lastly, the correlation coefficient and Moran's index are used to analyze the correlation between the urban heat island and its corresponding influencing factors in different years. The results indicate that population density, nighttime light, and gross domestic product (GDP) have significant positive effects on the heat island intensity from a temporal perspective. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) shows a significant negative relationship with the heat island intensity when analyzed over time. The research findings provide important reference for rational urban planning, layout, and construction, and hold significance for advancing urban renewal efforts.

TI  - Data Fusion for Estimating High-Resolution Urban Heatwave Air Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution air temperature data is indispensable for analysing heatwave-related non-accidental mortality. However, the limited number of weather stations in urban areas makes obtaining such data challenging. Multi-source data fusion has been proposed as a countermeasure to tackle such challenges. Satellite products often offered high spatial resolution but suffered from being temporally discontinuous due to weather conditions. The characteristics of the data from reanalysis models were the opposite. However, few studies have explored the fusion of these datasets. This study is the first attempt to integrate satellite and reanalysis datasets by developing a two-step downscaling model to generate hourly air temperature data during heatwaves in London at 1 km resolution. Specifically, MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and other satellite-based local variables, including normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalised difference water index (MNDWI), elevation, surface emissivity, and ERA5-Land hourly air temperature were used. The model employed genetic programming (GP) algorithm to fuse multi-source data and generate statistical models and evaluated using ground measurements from six weather stations. The results showed that our model achieved promising performance with the RMSE of 0.335 ?& DEG;C, R-squared of 0.949, MAE of 1.115 ?, and NSE of 0.924. Elevation was indicated to be the most effective explanatory variable. The developed model provided continuous, hourly 1 km estimations and accurately described the temporal and spatial patterns of air temperature in London. Furthermore, it effectively captured the temporal variation of air temperature in urban areas during heatwaves, providing valuable insights for assessing the impact on human health.

TI  - Flood Inundation and Depth Mapping Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Combined with High-Resolution Multispectral Imagery
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of flood hazards during emerging public safety crises such as hurricanes or flash floods is an invaluable tool for first responders and managers yet remains out of reach in any comprehensive sense when using traditional remote-sensing methods, due to cloud cover and other data-sourcing restrictions. While many remote-sensing techniques exist for floodwater identification and extraction, few studies demonstrate an up-to-day understanding with better techniques in isolating the spectral properties of floodwaters from collected data, which vary for each event. This study introduces a novel method for delineating near-real-time inundation flood extent and depth mapping for storm events, using an inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral remote-sensing platform, which was designed to be applicable for urban environments, under a wide range of atmospheric conditions. The methodology is demonstrated using an actual flooding-event-Hurricane Zeta during the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. Referred to as the UAV and Floodwater Inundation and Depth Mapper (FIDM), the methodology consists of three major components, including aerial data collection, processing, and flood inundation (water surface extent) and depth mapping. The model results for inundation and depth were compared to a validation dataset and ground-truthing data, respectively. The results suggest that UAV-FIDM is able to predict inundation with a total error (sum of omission and commission errors) of 15.8% and produce flooding depth estimates that are accurate enough to be actionable to determine road closures for a real event.

TI  - WOKE CORPORATIONS AND WORLDVIEW: THE PERILS OF CEOS MAKING MORAL PROCLAMATIONS FROM SHAKY MORAL FOUNDATIONS
T2  - ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - CEOs are increasingly called upon to take public stands on political issues, a phenome-non dubbed "political activism." These stands tend to have either moral foundations or moral implications, yet it is unclear whether stakeholders truly want CEOs to make stands, and, if so, how philosophically grounded they are in their stated positions. This paper explores the philosophical worldview questions relevant to current issues facing organizations, particularly those that have been characterized as "wokeism." It then examines how these worldview positions translate or apply to these issues in ways that seemingly contradict CEOs' stands. Finally, it explores how the concept of the social imaginary, CEOs' political beliefs, mass media's reciprocal effects, and CEO narcissism may influence CEOs to take "woke" political activist positions.

TI  - Feature Enhancement Using Multi-Baseline SAR Interferometry-Correlated Synthesis Images for Power Transmission Tower Detection in Mountain Layover Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection performance of power transmission towers in mountainous areas using SAR amplitude images is obviously influenced by the strong layover background (mainly including vegetation and soil) clutter interference around the towers. In this paper, power transmission tower detection in a mountainous layover area, using single-baseline SAR interferometry coherence images, which show better feature enhancement effectiveness compared to SAR amplitude images, is presented. Moreover, a novel feature enhancement method, that of generating multi-baseline SAR interferometry-correlated synthesis images for power transmission tower detection in a mountain layover area, is proposed. It demonstrates better feature enhancement (layover background cluster suppression) than that using single-baseline SAR interferometry coherence images. Theoretical analysis illustrates that the mountainous layover background clutter interference can be suppressed in the proposed single-baseline/multi-baseline SAR interferometry-correlated synthesis image. Experiments including over 12 repeat-pass TerraSAR-X staring spotlight mode acquisitions were conducted, and the results demonstrate that the detection performance with the use of multi-baseline SAR interferometry-correlated synthesis images showed an improvement of more than 43.6%, compared with the traditional method of using SAR amplitude images when benchmark deep learning-based detectors are used, i.e., Faster RCNN and YOLOv7.

TI  - Improving the capability of water vapor retrieval from Landsat 8 using ensemble machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) facilitates the exchange of water and energy between the Earth's surface and the surrounding atmosphere. PWV can be retrieved by employing the water vapor absorption channels in Landsat 8. Unfortunately, the conventional split-window covariance-variance ratio (SWCVR) method is susceptible to various factors, resulting in low retrieval accuracy and availability. Therefore, we improve the traditional SWCVR model and propose a new PWV retrieval method using ensemble machine learning to address these limitations. The new method uses Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) to establish the model between brightness temperature, GNSS-derived PWV, and related surface parameters. The results of the test set show that the improved SWCVR model has an RMSE, Bias, and availability of 0.4947 g/cm2, 0.0276 g/cm2, and 29.6%, respectively. By contrast, the GBDT model's corresponding values are 0.2870 g/cm2, -0.0094 g/cm2, and 67.9%, respectively. Compared with SWCVR, the GBDT improves the RMSE and availability by 41.99% and 38.3%, respectively. The GBDT algorithm is significantly better than the SWCVR model in low altitude and complex surface coverage areas. From a temporal perspective, the advantages of the GBDT method are more apparent in the summer. Finally, the SWCVR and GBDT models are externally validated using measured PWV data from the sun photometer and radiosonde, and the RMSE is 0.5148 g/cm2 and 0.3775 g/cm2, respectively. Based on the findings, we know that the accuracy of GBDT has significantly improved against the SWCVR.

TI  - Emerging Signal of Englacial Debris on One Clean Surface Glacier Based on High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Data in Northeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau contains a large number of mountain glaciers with clean surfaces, where englacial debris is generally entrained by the ice flow and exposed at the glacier margins. The long-term observation on one of the typical clean surface glaciers (the Qiyi Glacier, northern Tibetan Plateau) suggests an early emergence of englacial debris on its transport pathway, with accelerated surface melting from the mid-2000s onwards. Given that the englacial debris layers of the tongue part of Qiyi Glacier are approximately parallel to the glacier surface, the continuing melting might be expected to result in the rapid expansion of exposed debris. Compared with the clean surface ice, debris cover at the same elevation reduced glacier mass loss by similar to 25.4% during a hydrological year (2020-2021), indicating that the early emergence of englacial debris can protect the glacier from climate warming with prolonged life expectance. As such, future glacial runoff will then reach its peak earlier and be followed by a gentler decreasing trend than model projections with constant clean surface ice. These findings imply that the emerging debris on clean surface glacier may mitigate the glacial-runoff risk, which has so far been neglected in projections of future water supplies.

TI  - Avalanche Susceptibility Mapping by Investigating Spatiotemporal Characteristics of Snow Cover Based on Remote Sensing Imagery along the Pemo Highway-A Critical Transportation Road in Tibet, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pemo Highway is a critical transportation road to Medog County in the Tibet Plateau (TP). Since its completion in 2021, the Pemo Highway has been prone to frequent avalanches due to heavy rainfall and snowfall. Despite the lack of monitoring stations along the highway and limited research conducted in this area, remote sensing imagery provides valuable data for investigating avalanche hazards along the highway. In this paper, we first investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of snow cover along the Pemo Highway over the past two years based on the GEE platform. Second, we integrated snow, topography, meteorology, and vegetation factors to assess avalanche susceptibility in January, February, and March 2023 along the highway using the AHP method. The results reveal that the exit of the Duoshungla Tunnel is particularly susceptible to avalanches during the winter months, specifically from January to March, with a significant risk observed in March. Approximately 3.7 km in the direction of the tunnel exit to Lager is prone to avalanche hazards during this period. The recent "1.17 avalanche" event along the Pemo Highway validates the accuracy of our analysis. The findings of this paper provide timely guidance for implementing effective avalanche prevention measures on the Pemo Highway.

TI  - A Thorough Evaluation of the Passive Microwave Radiometer Measurements onboard Three Fengyun-3 Satellites
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave Radiometer Imager (MWRI) is a key payload of China's second generation polar meteorological satellite, i.e., Fengyun-3 series (FY-3). Up to now, 5 satellites including FY-3A (2008), FY-3B (2010), FY-3C (2013), FY-3D (2018), and FY-3E (2021) have been launched successfully to provide multiwavelength, all-weather, and global data for decades. Much progress has been made on the calibration of MWRI and a recalibrated MWRI brightness temperature (BT) product (V2) was recently released. This study thoroughly evaluates the accuracy of this new product from FY-3B, 3C, and 3D by using the simultaneous collocated Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) measurements as a reference. The results show that the mean biases (MBEs) of the BT between MWRI and GMI are generally less than 0.5 K and the root mean squares (RMSs) between them are less than 1.5 K. The previous notable ascending and descending difference of the MWRI has disappeared. This indicates that the new MWRI recalibration procedure is very effective in removing potential errors associated with the emission of the hot-load reflector. Analysis of the dependence of MBE on the latitude and earth scene temperature shows that MBE decreases with decreasing latitude over ocean. Furthermore, MBE over ocean decreases linearly with increasing scene temperature for almost all channels, whereas this does not occur over land. A linear regression fitting is then used to modify MWRI, which can reduce the MBE over ocean to be within 0.2 K. The standard deviation of error of GMI, FY-3B, and FY-3D MWRI BT data derived by using the three-cornered hat method (TCH) shows that GMI has the best overall performance over ocean except at 10.65 GHz where its standard deviation of error is slightly larger than that of FY-3D. Over land, the standard deviation of error of FY-3D is the lowest at almost all channels except at 89V. MWRI onboard FY-3 series satellites would serve as an important passive microwave radiometer member of the constellation to monitor key surface and atmospheric properties.

TI  - Case Study on the Evolution and Precipitation Characteristics of Southwest Vortex in China: Insights from FY-4A and GPM Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research investigates Southwest Vortex (SWV) events in China's Sichuan Basin using Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) and Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) observations. We selected representative cloud systems and precipitation cases, divided into developing, mature, and dissipating stages. Detailed analysis revealed critical characteristics of precipitation cloud systems at each stage. Our findings reveal that (1) during the SWV's developing and mature stages, a high concentration of water particles and ice crystals stimulates precipitation. In contrast, the dissipating stage is marked by fewer mixed-phase and ice particles, reducing precipitation area and intensity.(2) Near-surface precipitation in all stages is predominantly liquid, with a bright band of around 5.5 km. At the same time, stratiform precipitation is dominant in each life stage. Stratiform precipitation remains dominant throughout the life stages of the SWV, with localized convective activity evident in the developing and mature stages. (3) Mature stage particles, characterized by a configuration of 1.0-1.2 mm Dm and 31-35 dBNW (dBNW = 10log10NW), contribute significantly to near-surface precipitation. The Cloud Top Height (CTH) serves as an indicator of convective intensity and assists in characterizing raindrop concentration. These findings considerably enhance routine observations, advance our understanding of SWV events, and propose a novel approach for conducting refined observational experiments.

TI  - Artificial light at night and social vulnerability: An environmental justice analysis in the US 2012-2019
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Artificial Light at Night (ALAN) is an emerging health risk factor that has been linked to a wide range of adverse health effects. Recent study suggested that disadvantaged neighborhoods may be exposed to higher levels of ALAN. Understanding how social disadvantage correlates with ALAN levels is essential for identifying the vulnerable populations and for informing lighting policy. Methods: We used satellite data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Black Marble data product to quantify annual ALAN levels (2012-2019), and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to quantify social disadvantage, both at the US census tract level. We examined the relationship between the ALAN and SVI (overall and domain-specific) in over 70,000 tracts in the Contiguous U.S., and investigated the heterogeneities in this relationship by the rural-urban status and US regions (i.e., Northeast, Midwest, South, West).Results: We found a significant positive relationship between SVI and ALAN levels. On average, the ALAN level in the top 20% most vulnerable communities was 2.46-fold higher than that in the 20% least vulnerable communities (beta coefficient (95% confidence interval) for log-transformed ALAN, 0.90 (0.88, 0.92)). Of the four SVI domains, minority and language status emerged as strong predictors of ALAN levels. Our stratified analysis showed considerable and complex heterogeneities across different rural-urban categories, with the association between greater vulnerability and higher ALAN primarily observed in urban cores and rural areas. We also found regional differences in the association between ALAN and both overall SVI and SVI domains.Conclusions: Our study suggested ALAN as an environmental justice issue that may carry important public health implications.FundingNational Aeronautics and Space Administration.

TI  - Comparative Study of the Atmospheric Gas Composition Detection Capabilities of FY-3D/HIRAS-I and FY-3E/HIRAS-II Based on Information Capacity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-3E (FY-3E)/Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder-II (HIRAS-II) is an extension Fengyun-3D (FY-3D)/HIRAS-I. It is crucial to fully explore and analyze the detection capabilities of these two instruments for atmospheric gas composition. Based on the observed spectral data from the infrared hyperspectral detection instruments FY-3D/HIRAS-I and FY-3E/HIRAS-II, simulated radiance data and Jacobian matrices are obtained using the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model RTTOV (Radiative Transfer for TOVS (TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder)). By perturbing temperature (T), surface temperature (T-surf), water vapor (H2O), ozone (O-3), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrous oxide (N2O), the brightness temperature differences before and after the perturbations are calculated to analyze the sensitivity of temperature and various atmospheric gas components. The Improved Optimal Sensitivity Profile (OSP) algorithm is used to select the channels for atmospheric gas retrieval. The observation error covariance and background error covariance matrices are calculated, and then the information capacity is calculated, specifically the degrees of freedom for signal(DFS) and the entropy reduction (ER). Based on this, a comparative analysis is conducted on the information capacity of atmospheric water vapor and ozone components contained in the hyperspectral detection data from HIRAS-I and HIRAS-II instruments, respectively, to explore the retrieval capabilities of the two instruments for atmospheric gas components. We selected clear-sky data from the African oceanic region and the Chinese Yangtze River Delta terrestrial region for quantitative analysis of the information capacity of HIRAS-I and HIRAS-II. The results show that FY-3D/HIRAS-I and FY-3E/HIRAS-II exhibit different sensitivities to atmospheric gas components. In different experimental regions, temperature and water vapor show the most dramatic sensitivity changes, followed by ozone, methane, and nitrous oxide, while carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide exhibit the lowest variability. Regarding channel selection, HIRAS-II identifies more gas channels compared to HIRAS-I. The experiments concluded that HIRAS-II has a significantly higher information capacity than HIRAS-I, and the information capacity of atmospheric gas components varies across different experimental regions. Water vapor and ozone exhibit the highest information capacity, followed by nitrous oxide and methane, while carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide demonstrate the lowest capacity. The H2O ER (DFS) contained in FY-3E/HIRAS-II is 1.51 (0.35) higher than that in FY-3D/HIRAS-I, the O-3 ER (DFS) in FY-3E/HIRAS-II is 1.51 (0.36) higher than that in FY-3D/HIRAS-I, while the N2O ER (DFS) in FY-3E/HIRAS-II is 0.17 (0.19) higher and the CH4 ER (DFS) is 0.07 (0.04) higher than that in FY-3D/HIRAS-I.

TI  - Post-Event Surface Deformation of the 2018 Baige Landslide Revealed by Ground-Based and Spaceborne Radar Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 11 October and 3 November 2018, two large landslides occurred in Baige Village, Tibet, China, forcing the Jinsha River to be cut off and form a dammed lake, resulting in massive economic damages and deaths. This paper uses ground-based radar (GBR) and spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technologies to perform dynamic monitoring of the Baige landslide. Firstly, the GBR results suggest that the cumulative deformation from 4 to 10 December 2018 was 1.4 m, and the landslide still exhibits a risk of instability. Secondly, with the Sentinel-1A ascending and descending orbit images from December 2018 to February 2022, the InSAR-stacking technology assisted by the generic atmospheric correction online service (GACOS) and the multidimensional small baseline subset (MSBAS) method are utilized to obtain the annual deformation velocity and cumulative deformation in the satellite radar line of sight (LOS) direction of the landslide. Finally, according to the spatial-temporal deformation characteristics of feature points, combined with optical images, field investigation, and geological conditions, the development trend and inducing factors of the Baige landslide are comprehensively analyzed. It is shown that the Baige landslide is in constant motion at present, and the deformation is spreading from the slope to its right side. This research establishes a framework of combining emergency monitoring (i.e., GBR) with long-term monitoring (i.e., spaceborne InSAR). The framework is more conducive to obtaining the deformation and evolution of landslides, providing a greater possibility for studying the development trend and risk assessment of landslides, and assisting in reducing or even avoiding the losses caused by landslides.

TI  - Carbon Storage Estimation of <i>Quercus aquifolioides</i> Based on GEDI Spaceborne LiDAR Data and Landsat 9 Images in Shangri-La
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of forest carbon storage plays a crucial role in forest management and ecosystem exploration, enabling the evaluation of forest quality, resources, carbon cycle and management. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) satellite provides a means to accurately measure these various forest vertical structure parameters by penetrating the forest canopy. However, the distribution of the footprint along the orbit track is heterogeneous and discontinuous, preventing the acquisition of spatially distributed carbon storage formation at the county level. Consequently, this study integrated GEDI and Landsat 9 data to estimate Quercus aquifolioides carbon storage in Shangri-La. By applying the Kriging interpolation to previously pretreated footprints, surface information from the GEDI L2B footprints was obtained. At the same time, Landsat 9 vegetation indices and band reflectance were extracted to analyze the correlation with the carbon storage of Quercus aquifolioides samples. Then, three methods (support vector machine, bagging, and random forest) were used to create a carbon storage estimation model for Shangri-La. The research results showed that (1) among the models for the selection of GEDI footprint parameters based on semi-variance, the optimal model of the digital_elevation_model was the spherical model, while the best model of percentage tree cover from the MODIS data (modis_treecover) and the foliage height diversity index (fhd_normal) was the exponential model. (2) Analyzing the thirty-three extracted independent variable factors correlated with the carbon storage of Quercus aquifolioides showed that the top five variables with the highest correlation were digital_elevation_model, modis_treecover, fhd_normal, DEM, and band 1 (B1). (3) After variable selection, the R-2 = 0.82 and RMSE = 11.92 t/hm(2) values of the Quercus aquifolioides carbon storage estimation model established via random forest were obtained, and its evaluation precision was superior to that of the support vector machine method and bagging regression. The carbon storage of Quercus aquifolioides was primarily in the range of 8.22 similar to 94.63 t/hm(2), and the mean value was 42.44 t/hm(2), while the total carbon storage was about 5,374,137.62 t. The findings from this paper illustrated the feasibility of obtaining carbon storage data on a county scale by combining GEDI LiDAR data with Landsat 9 optical data. The results also suggested a new perspective for combining GEDI L2B data with other remote sensing images to estimate other forest structure parameters.

TI  - Rapid Detection of Iron Ore and Mining Areas Based on MSSA-BNVTELM, Visible-Infrared Spectroscopy, and Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy and rapidity of total iron content (TFE) analysis can accelerate iron ore production. Although the conventional TFE detection methods are accurate, its detection speed presents difficulties in meeting production requirements. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of TFE detection based on reflectance spectroscopy (wavelength range: 340-2500 nm) and remote sensing. Firstly, spectral experiments were conducted on iron ore using the HR SVC-1024 spectrometer to obtain spectral data for each sample. Then, the spectra were smoothed and dimensionally reduced by using wavelet transform and principal component analysis. To improve the detection accuracy of TFE, a two hidden layer extreme learning machine with variable neuron nodes based on an improved sparrow search algorithm and batch normalization optimization (MSSA-BNVTELM) is proposed. According to the experimental results, MSSA-BNVTELM exhibited superior detection accuracy in comparison to other algorithms. In addition, this research established a remote sensing detection model using Sentinel-2 data and MSSA-BNVTEM to detect the distribution of TFE in the mining area. The distribution of TFE in the mine area was plotted based on the detection results. The results show that the remote sensing of the mine area can be useful for detection of the TFE distribution, providing assistance for the mining plan.

TI  - SAR-optical feature matching: A large-scale patch dataset and a deep local descriptor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Image matching is a key prerequisite for image fusion. Currently, deep learning methods had shown great potential in matching. However, these methods mainly focus on optical images or area-based matching and their performance highly relies on the diversity of the training sets. This paper makes two major contributions to the synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-optical image feature matching task. First, we create a high-quality open SAR and optical patch dataset called SOPatch, which contains more than 650 000 matching patch pairs. SOPatch is generated from a variety of satellite images (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Gaofen-3, etc.) and contains a rich set of features (mountains, lakes, buildings, farmland, bare land, etc.), which can provide robustness to sensor and localization changes and train a model with good generalization ability. Similar to the HPatches (Balntas et al., 2017), we also add position and rotation noise to make the dataset more realistic and robust. Second, a local descriptor for SAR-optical matching called SODescNet is proposed. We first weaken the speckle noise of SAR by multiscale dilated convolution and channel attention mechanisms and then use DenseNet-CSP (cross stage partial) as the backbone for feature description. To reduce the difficulty of network training, we first use a Siamese network for pre-training and then fine-tune it via a pseudo-Siamese network. Extensive experiments show that our SODescNet is comparable or superior to state-of-the-arts.

TI  - High-resolution atmospheric mercury emission from open biomass burning in China: Integration of localized emission factors and multi-source finer resolution remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mercury (Hg) emissions from open biomass burning represent one of the largest Hg inputs to the atmosphere, with considerable effects on the atmospheric Hg budget. However, there is currently large uncertainty in the inventory of Hg emissions from open biomass burning in China due to limitations on the coarse resolution of burned area products, rough biomass data, and the unavailability of suitable emission factors (EFs). In this study, we developed high tempo-spatial resolution (30 m) and long time-series (2000-2019) atmospheric Hg emission inventories from open biomass burning using the Global Annual Burned Area Map (GABAM) product, highresolution biomass map, Landsat-based tree cover datasets as well as local EFs in China. The results showed that the average annual Hg emission from open biomass burning in China amounted to 172.6 kg during 2000-2019, with a range of 63-398.5 kg. The largest Hg emissions were found in cropland (72%), followed by forest (25.9%), and grassland (2.1%). On a regional level, Northeast China (NE) and Southwest China (SW) were the two main contributors, together accounting for more than 60% of total Hg emissions. The temporal distribution of Hg emissions showed that the peaks occurred in 2003 and 2014. This is a comprehensive estimation of Hg emissions from open biomass burning in China by integrating various high-resolution remotely sensed data and nationwide localized EFs, which has important implications for understanding the role of open biomass burning in China in regional and global atmospheric Hg budget.

TI  - Genetic algorithm-based parameter inversion and pipeline subsidence prediction
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To invert mine subsidence parameters and predict the timing of associated risk to underground pipelines passing through mining areas with incoherent subsidence information, this study proposes a model based on combining the advantages of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology, the probability integral method (PIM), segmented Knothe time function, and genetic algorithm. Firstly, InSAR technology is used to analyze a time series of surface deformation in a mining area, circle the range of large-gradient deformation, and distinguish the subsidence edge from the subsidence center. In the case of the subsidence edge (small-scale deformation), InSAR results are retained, whereas in the case of the subsidence center (large-scale deformation), subsidence parameters, such as the subsidence coefficient and influence radius, are obtained via the genetic algorithm. The subsidence of the working face in the mining area is determined by combining InSAR information and the PIM parameter inversion-based basin model. This allows us to obtain continuous surface subsidence information, study surface subsidence trends over time, and predict future pipeline subsidence. The researchers subsequently test the efficacy of this model in the Qinchi mining area in Shanxi Province, China. Sentinel-1A images were used as the data source, combine the PIM and segmentation time function, and use the genetic algorithm to obtain the subsidence mining parameters. The inversion results show that the subsidence coefficient is 0.5917 (with an error of 2%), and the main influence angle tangent value is 1.927 (with an error of 2.18%), indicating high inversion accuracy. Based on this model, the study predict that subsidence in the Qinchi mining area will threaten the structural integrity and operation of the intersecting pipeline by November 2025.

TI  - Retrieving Ocean Surface Winds and Waves from Augmented Dual-Polarization Sentinel-1 SAR Data Using Deep Convolutional Residual Networks
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface winds and waves are very important phenomena that exist in the air-sea boundary layer. With the advent of climate change, cascade effects are bringing more attention to these phenomena as warmer sea surface temperatures bring about stronger winds, thereby altering global wave conditions. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful sensor for high-resolution surface wind and wave observations and has accumulated large quantities of data. Furthermore, deep learning methods have been increasingly utilized in geoscience, especially the inversion of ocean information from SAR imagery. Here, we propose a method to invert various parameters of ocean surface winds and waves using Sentinel-1 SAR IW mode data. To ensure this method is more robust and scalable, we augmented the input data with dual-polarized SAR imagery, an incident angle, and a more constrained homogeneity test. This method adopts a deeper structure in order to retrieve more wind and wave parameters, and the use of residual networks can accelerate training convergence and improve regression accuracy. Using 1600 training samples filtered by a novel homogeneity test and with significant wave heights between 0 and 10 m, results from error parameters including the root mean square error (RMSE), scatter index (SI), and correlation coefficient (COR) show the great performance of this proposed method. The RMSE is 0.45 m, 0.76 s, and 1.90 m/s for the significant wave height, mean wave period, and wind speed, respectively. Furthermore, the temporal variation and spatial distribution of the estimates are consistent with China-France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT) observations, buoy measurements, WaveWatch3 regional model data, and ERA5 reanalysis data.

TI  - Automated in-season mapping of winter wheat in China with training data generation and model transfer
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely information on winter wheat spatial distribution is essential for food security and environmental sustainability. However, high-quality nation-wide winter wheat products at high resolutions are still scarce around the world, and the approaches for winter wheat mapping are generally constrained by the lack of sufficient and representative training data. In this study, a knowledge-based approach based on spectral and polarization information from critical stages of winter wheat, was proposed to extract high-quality training data of winter wheat, thereby supporting winter wheat mapping with machine learning classifiers. Additionally, classification model trained by the generated training data was transferred across years to achieve the in-season mapping of winter wheat. Two-year classification scenarios based on the automated training data generation (ATDG) or model transfer (MT) were designed to evaluate the quality of automatically generated training data, the performance of model transfer, the contribution of optical and radar data, and the earliest timing for winter wheat mapping over China.With the ATDG and MT, the first 10-m resolution maps of winter wheat over China (ChinaWheat10) were produced for three consecutive years (2020 & 2021 by ATDG; 2021 & 2022 by MT). For ATDG and MT, the combined features of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 yielded the highest overall accuracies with the random forest classifier. Specifically, winter wheat mapping with the ATDG achieved the highest F1-score of 0.94 for both 2020 and 2021. The MT reached a comparable F1-score of 0.94 and 0.93 for 2021 and 2022, and winter wheat maps with the F1-score of 0.93 and 0.92 could be produced as early as April (two months ahead of harvesting). Besides well-delineated winter wheat parcels, the estimated areas of ChinaWheat10 aligned well with the agricultural census data at the provincial (R2 & GE; 0.95) and municipal (R2 & GE; 0.91) levels. These findings suggest the proposed approaches have a great potential for accurate, cost-effective and high-resolution in-season mapping of winter wheat over large regions.

TI  - A robust and unified land surface phenology algorithm for diverse biomes and growth cycles in China by using harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) is beneficial to understand ecosystem response to climate change, vegetation and crop type discrimination, and ecological modeling. However, the existing efforts based on coarse resolution data (& GE;500 m) cannot perform well in regions with higher spatial heterogeneity and multi-cropping system, such as China. Given that the majority of 10 m/30 m-based phenological research has focused on North America and Europe, developing spatiotemporally explicit LSP data in China is imperative. More importantly, the existing 30 m LSP products are mainly suitable for vegetation types with a single vegetation cycle, but cannot work well for biomes with complex seasonality (e.g., multiple growth cycles). Here we first harmonized three vegetation indices, i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), and land surface water index (LSWI) from Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2 imagery on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We then developed a new 30 m LSP algorithm that unified different phenological cycle-seeking processes per vegetation type and improved the existing algorithm. Furthermore, we used the algorithm to estimate the LSP product (LSP30CHN) for 2016-2019 across China, suitable for all vegetation types. The validation results showed a reasonably high accuracy (R2 > 0.6, RMSE < 15 days, mostly) of the LSP30CHN data against multisources in-situ observational (e.g., PhenoCam) and satellite-retrieved vegetation phenology data. Moreover, LSP30CHN data showed a consistent pattern but finer spatial details with the 500 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) phenology product (MCD12Q2) at the homogenous area. We also found that phenological differences between LSP30CHN and MCD12Q2 increased with surface fragmentation, suggesting the potential of LSP30CHN to delineate phenological information on more fragmented landscapes. In contrast, the 500 m LSP data cannot provide such details in the regions with mixed cropping structures (e.g., corn, rice, and soybean) and multiple cropping index (e.g., single- and double-cropping systems). This study offers high accuracy of the LSP map for China, valuable for finer phenology-based services such as field-level crop management and agricultural phenology monitoring. It opens up new insights about exploring large-scale refined agricultural management and ecological assessment for other regions with complicated, fragmented landscapes and vegetation seasonality.

TI  - Chromite-Bearing Peridotite Identification, Based on Spectral Analysis and Machine Learning: A Case Study of the Luobusa Area, Tibet, China
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Chromite is a strategic mineral resource for many countries, and chromite deposit occurrences are widespread in the ultramafic rocks of the Yarlung Zangbo ophiolite belt, particularly in the harzburgite unit of the mantle section. Conducting field surveys in complex and poorly accessible terrain is challenging, expensive, and time-consuming. Remote sensing is an advanced method of achieving modern geological work and is a powerful technical means of geological research and mineral exploration. In order to delineate outcrops of chromite-bearing mantle peridotite, the present research study integrates seven image-enhancement techniques, including optimal band combination, decorrelation stretching, band ratio, independent component analysis, principal component analysis, minimum noise fraction, and false color composite, for the interpretation of Landsat8 OLI and WorldView-2 satellite data. This integrated approach allows the effective discrimination of chromite-containing peridotite outcrops in the Luobusa area, Tibet. The interpretation results derived from these integrated image-processing techniques were systematically verified in the field and formed the basis of the feature selection process of different lithologies supported by the support vector machine algorithm. Furthermore, the distribution range of the ferric contamination anomaly is detected through the de-interference abnormal principal component thresholding technique, which shows a high spatial matching relationship with mantle peridotite. This is the first study to utilize Landsat8 OLI and WorldView-2 remote sensing satellite data to explore the largest chromite deposit in China, which enriches the research methods for the chromite deposits in the Luobusa area. Accordingly, the results of this investigation indicate that the integration of information extracted from image-processing algorithms using remote sensing data could be a broadly applicable tool for prospecting chromite ore deposits associated with ophiolitic complexes in mountainous and inaccessible regions such as Tibet's ophiolitic zones.

TI  - A Comprehensive Multi-Metric Index for Health Assessment of the Poyang Lake Wetland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Poyang Lake wetland is home to many unique and threatened species. However, it has been severely degraded in recent decades due to the joint effects of human influence and climate change. Here we establish a wetland health index (WHI) for Poyang Lake, which considers five types of attributes (biological, water quality, sediment, land use and remote sensing, and socio-economic attributes) of the wetland to evaluate wetland conditions. Forty-nine variables across five categories were assembled as candidate metrics for the WHI through field surveys conducted in 2019 at 30 sample sites. Principal component analyses were performed to identify the most important variables in each of the five categories as the primary metrics of each index category (e.g., biological index). Eighteen variables were finally selected from the five categories to construct the WHI. The WHI scores varied from 0.34 to 0.80 at the 30 sample sites, with a mean of 0.55. The Poyang Lake wetland is generally in fair condition according to our WHI scores. Sample sites where connected rivers flow into the lake were assessed to be in a poor condition, highlighting the importance of reducing pollution input from rivers for wetland conservation. Scores of individual indices of the five categories were not highly correlated (0.29 = pairwise Spearman's r = 0.69), suggesting that information provided by each index is different and might be complementary. The composite WHI as well as the individual category indices can provide comprehensive information on wetland conditions that would facilitate the development of more targeted and effective strategies for wetland management.

TI  - Response of Evapotranspiration (ET) to Climate Factors and Crop Planting Structures in the Shiyang River Basin, Northwestern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an essential part of energy flow between the surface of the earth and the atmosphere, simultaneously involving the water, carbon, and energy cycles. It is mainly determined by climate, land use, and land cover changes. Additionally, there is still a need for quantitative characterization of the impacts of climate factors and human activities on ET and regional water resource efficiency in arid and semiarid regions. Based on Landsat-8 remote sensing imagery and land use data, the crop planting structures in the Liangzhou District of the middle reaches of the Shiyang River Basin were identified using a multiband and multi-temporal approach in this study. Subsequently, the ET of major cash crops was inverted using the three-temperature model. This research quantitatively describes the responses of wheat and corn to the climate and human activities over a two-year period. Furthermore, the impact of crop planting structures and climatic factors on ET was elucidated. The results indicate that a combination of multi-temporal green and shortwave infrared 1 bands is the optimal spectral combination to extract the planting structures. Compared to 2019, the wheat area decreased by 23.27% in 2020, while the corn area increased by 5.96%. Both crops exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity in ET during the growing season. The typical daily range of ET for wheat was 0.4-7.2 mm/day, and for corn, it was 1.5-4.0 mm/day. Among the climatic factors, temperature showed the highest correlation with ET (R = 0.80, p = 0.05). Our research findings provide valuable insights for the fine identification of crop planting structures and a better understanding of the response of ET to climatic factors and planting structures.

TI  - Prediction of Seedling Oilseed Rape Crop Phenotype by Drone-Derived Multimodal Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing systems have advanced rapidly, enabling the effective assessment of crop growth through the processing and integration of multimodal data from diverse sensors mounted on UAVs. UAV-derived multimodal data encompass both multi-source remote sensing data and multi-source non-remote sensing data. This study employs Image Guided Filtering Fusion (GFF) to obtain high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSs) and selects three vegetation indices (VIs) based on correlation analysis and feature reduction in HR-MS for multi-source sensing data. As a supplement to remote sensing data, multi-source non-remote sensing data incorporate two meteorological conditions: temperature and precipitation. This research aims to establish remote sensing quantitative monitoring models for four crucial growth-physiological indicators during rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) seedling stages, namely, leaf area index (LAI), above ground biomass (AGB), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), and chlorophyll content (SPAD). To validate the monitoring effectiveness of multimodal data, the study constructs four model frameworks based on multimodal data input and employs Support Vector Regression (SVR), Partial Least Squares (PLS), Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN), and Nonlinear Model Regression (NMR) machine learning models to create winter rapeseed quantitative monitoring models. The findings reveal that the model framework, which integrates multi-source remote sensing data and non-remote sensing data, exhibits the highest average precision (R-2 = 0.7454), which is 28%, 14.6%, and 3.7% higher than that of the other three model frameworks, enhancing the model's robustness by incorporating meteorological data. Furthermore, SVR consistently performs well across various multimodal model frameworks, effectively evaluating the vigor of rapeseed seedlings and providing a valuable reference for rapid, non-destructive monitoring of winter rapeseed.

TI  - Retrieval of Soil Heavy Metal Content for Environment Monitoring in Mining Area via Transfer Learning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring environmental pollution sources is an ongoing issue that must be addressed to reduce risks to public health, food safety, and the environment. However, retrieving topsoil heavy metal content at a low cost for environmental monitoring in mining areas is challenging. Therefore, this study proposes a network model based on transfer learning theory and a back propagation (BP) network optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA), taking the Daxigou mining area in Shaanxi Province, China, as a case study. Firstly, visible and near-infrared spectrum data from Landsat8 satellite images, digital elevation models, and geochemical data from field-collected soil samples were used to extract environmental factor candidates indicating the content and spatial distribution of certain heavy metals, including copper (Cu) and lead (Pb). Secondly, each element was correlated with environmental factors and a multicollinearity test was performed to determine the optimal factor set. Then, the BP network optimized by GA was pre-trained with sample data collected in 2017 and retrained with minimal sample data from 2019 using the parameter transfer learning method, allowing spatial distribution mapping of the Cu and Pb content in topsoil of the Daxigou mining area in 2019. From the validation results using field-collected data, the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean relative error (MRE) values using the proposed model, respectively, reduced by 4.688 mg/kg and 1.533 mg/kg for Cu and reduced by 1.586 mg/kg and 1.232 mg/kg for Pb compared to the traditional GA-BP model. Thus, conclusions can be drawn that our proposed Tr-GA-BP network performs well, requiring 16 training samples collected in 2019. In addition, the content of Cu is the highest; Pb is the second highest in the study area. Both of them were spatially distributed mainly in the exploitation, slag stacking, roadside, etc., consistent with field investigation results.

TI  - Forest Tree Species Diversity Mapping Using ICESat-2/ATLAS with GF-1/PMS Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems depend on species of tree variety. Remote sensing for obtaining large-scale spatial distribution information of tree species diversity is a geoscience research hotspot to overcome the limitations of conventional tree species diversity survey approaches. Airborne LiDAR or synergy with airborne optical imagery has been used to model and estimate tree species diversity for specific forest communities, with many revealing results. However, the data collection for such research is costly, the breadth of monitoring findings is limited, and obtaining information on the geographical pattern is challenging. To this end, we propose a method for mapping forest tree species diversity by synergy satellite optical remote sensing and satellite-based LiDAR based on the spectral heterogeneity hypothesis and structural variation hypothesis to improve the accuracy of the remote sensing monitoring of forest tree species diversity while considering data cost. The method integrates horizontal spectral variation from GF-1/PMS image data with vertical structural variation from ICESat-2 spot data to estimate the species diversity of trees. The findings reveal that synergistic horizontal spectral variation and vertical structural variation overall increase tree species diversity prediction accuracy compared to a single remote sensing variation model. The synergistic approach improved Shannon and Simpson indices prediction accuracy by 0.06 and 0.04, respectively, compared to the single horizontal spectral variation model. The synergistic model, single vertical structural variation model, and single horizontal spectral variation model were the best prediction models for Shannon, Simpson, and richness indices, with R-2 of 0.58, 0.62, and 0.64, respectively. This research indicates the potential of synergistic satellite-based LiDAR and optical remote sensing in large-scale forest tree species diversity mapping.

TI  - Estimation of Time-Series Forest Leaf Area Index (LAI) Based on Sentinel-2 and MODIS
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The LAI is a key parameter used to describe the exchange of material and energy between soil, vegetation and the atmosphere. It has become an important driving datum in the study of carbon and water cycle mechanism models at many regional scales. In order to obtain high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution LAI products, this study proposed a method to combine the high temporal resolution of MODIS LAI products with the high spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 data. The method first used the LACC algorithm to smooth the LAI time-series data and extracted the normalized growth curve of the MODIS LAI of forest and used this curve to simulate the annual variation of the LAI. Secondly, it estimated the LAI at the period of full leaf spread based on the traditional remote sensing statistical model and Sentinel-2 remote sensing data as the maximum value of the forest LAI in the study area and used it to control the LAI growth curve. Finally, the time-series LAI data set was created by multiplying the maximum LAI by the normalized forest LAI growth curve. The results indicate that: (1) the remote sensing statistical estimation model of LAI was developed using the atmospherically resistant vegetation index ARVI (R-2 = 0.494); (2) the MODIS LAI normalized growth curve keeps a good level of agreement with the actual variation. This study provides a simple and efficient method for obtaining effective time-series forest LAI data for the scope of small- and medium-sized areas.

TI  - Estimating rice flower intensity using flower spectral information from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Growth monitoring of rice is of great significance to food security of human society. Rice flowering is an important growing stage for grain formation, and flower intensity is the dominant factor in determining rice yield. The estimation of flower intensity helps us to know the rice yield in advance. This research proposed a series of the flower index (FI) to monitor status of rice flowers by developing flower intensity estimation models using stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and random forest (RF), and their performance was compared to the models developed by vegetation indices (VI) of some key growth stages. The FI that in types of normalization (NDFI), ratio (RFI) and differences (DFI) were tested. The involved FIs in the FI-based models were those in type of difference (DFI) that obtained by difference of reflectance before and after flowering (DR) and their first derivative (DR'). The FIs of ten consecutive days during the flowering were obtained and their correlations with flower intensity showed that FIs of the late flowering (the 8th day, 9th day and 10th day) were more significantly correlated to flower intensity than those at the early or mid-flowering, with the maximum correlation coefficient of 0.702 given by FIs in difference type formed by DR'. The accuracy assessment of flower intensity estimation models showed that FI-based models had the equivalent accuracies to VI-based models, especially for the SMLR model that based on four FIs, which had R2 = 0.707, MAPE =10.54%, rRMSE =11.39%, was comparable to the model that developed by three VIs of the booting, heading and jointing stages (R2 = 0.751, MAPE = 8.99%, rRMSE = 10.31%). The promising results of FIs in estimating flower intensity make the simple data acquisition possible and provide an alternative way to get information about rice yield.

TI  - Assessment of water quality in the Eastern China Seas based on water transparency satellite products.
T2  - Marine Environmental Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality condition is of great significance for protection of marine ecological environment and sustainable development. In this study, from the perspective of water transparency (Zsd), we proposed a new method for evaluating water conditions based on long time series MODIS optical satellite remote sensing data in the Eastern China Seas. The method classifies water quality using transparency and trends, and the water can be divided into High and Increasing (HI) type, High and No change trend (HN) type, High and Decreasing (HD) type, Low and Increasing (LI) type, Low and No change trend (LN) and Low and Decreasing (LD) type, were used to analyze the water quality in the Eastern China Seas and its influencing factors. The results showed that most of the coastal waters of the Eastern China Seas are LN type, while the waters in Jiangsu Coast (near Lianyungang) are LD type in the past 20 years. The offshore waters mostly beyond to HN type, while some areas of the South of South Yellow Sea and the East China Sea shelf generally showed HD type waters. Phytoplankton and suspended sediment are the dominant influence factors of the water condition in the offshore and coastal waters, respectively; and in the Zhejiang-Fujian coast, the water condition is probably modulated by the both of phytoplankton and suspended sediment.

TI  - Analysis of the Income Enhancement Potential of the Terrestrial Carbon Sink in China Based on Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A key focus of international climate action is achieving a terrestrial carbon sink within the framework of carbon neutrality. For certain regions with vital ecological functions and high poverty rates, the generation of surplus ecological carbon income is crucial for mitigating global inequality. While the evaluation of the economic benefits of carbon income still faces limitations in terms of inadequacy and inaccuracy, enhancing green carbon poverty alleviation schemes is urgently needed. This project introduces an analysis framework for assessing the land-based ecological carbon sink and poverty alleviation potential based on a per capita ideal carbon sink income evaluation, which compares the regional economic benefits of a carbon sink under different carbon price benchmarks and explores tailored green poverty alleviation strategies. It indicates that the per capita ideal carbon sink income in China exhibits a seasonal variation, ranging from approximately USD 16.50 to USD 261.41 per person per month on average. Its spatial distribution shows a pattern of lower values in the central region and higher values in the north and south, following a "high differentiation, low clustering" distribution pattern. The per capita carbon sink income can reach 30% to 70% of the per capita GDP, with a peak value of USD 19,138.10 per year, meeting the minimum livelihood guarantee for the needs in economically underdeveloped areas. Simultaneously, the per capita carbon sequestration income within the Chinese carbon market is expected to demonstrate a yearly ascending trajectory, with an approximate growth rate of USD 23.6 per individual annually. The southwest, northeast, and north China regions can be prioritized as key areas for carbon market development, facilitating more comprehensive inter-regional and sustainable carbon trading. This study plays a significant role in disclosing the regional ecological function and economic benefits, promoting the use of "carbon neutrality" as a driving force to alleviate global inequality and contributing to global climate action and poverty eradication strategies.

TI  - Nodular type predominance of head and neck cutaneous malignant melanoma in Asian populations leads to poor outcome and low survival
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous malignant melanomas of the head and neck (HNM) are proposed to have notable histological and clinical differences from those at other sites (other melanoma); however, HNMs among Asians have remained poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological features and prognostic factors of HNM in Asians. Asian melanoma patients who underwent surgical treatment from January 2003 to December 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinicopathological features and risk factors for local recurrence, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis were analyzed. Among 230 patients, 28 (12.2%) were diagnosed with HNM, and 202 (87.8%) with other melanoma. The histologic subtype significantly differed as the nodular type was predominant in HNM whereas the acral lentiginous type was predominant in other melanoma (P < 0.001). HNM was significantly associated with higher local recurrence (P = 0.045), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.048), distant metastasis (P = 0.023), and lower 5-year disease-free survival (P = 0.022) than other melanoma. Ulceration was the risk factor for lymph node metastasis based on multivariable analysis (P = 0.013). A high proportion of HNM present as the nodular subtype in Asians, leading to poor outcomes and low survival. Therefore, more cautious surveillance, evaluation, and aggressive treatment are required.

TI  - Global and Regional Snow Cover Decline: 2000-2022
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover affects the global surface energy balance and, with its high albedo, exerts a cooling effect on the Earth's climate. Decreases in snow cover alter the flow of solar energy from being reflected away from Earth to being absorbed, increasing the Earth's surface temperature. To gain a global understanding of snow cover change, in situ measurements are too few and far between, so remotely sensed data are needed. This research used the medium-resolution sensor MODIS on the Terra satellite, which has been observing global snow cover almost daily since the year 2000. Here, the MOD10C2 eight-day maximum value composite time series data from February 2000 to March 2023 were analyzed to detect global and regional trends in snow cover extent for the first 23 years of the 21st century. Trends in snow cover change during different time periods (seasons and snow-year) were examined using the Mann-Kendall test and the univariate differencing analysis. Both methods produced similar results. Globally, snow cover declined two to ten times as much as it increased, depending on the season of analysis, and annually, global snow cover decreased 5.12% (not including Antarctica or Greenland) based on the Mann-Kendall test at the 95th percentile (p < 0.05). Regionally, Asia had the greatest net area decline in snow cover, followed by Europe. Although North America has the second-largest extent of snow cover, it had the least amount of net decreasing snow cover relative to its size. South America had the greatest local decline in snow cover, decreasing 20.60% of its annual (snow-year) snow cover area. The Australia-New Zealand region, with just 0.34% of the global snow cover, was the only region to have a net increase in snow cover, increasing 3.61% of its annual snow cover area.

TI  - Remote Sensing Estimates of Particulate Organic Carbon Sources in the Zhanjiang Bay Using Sentinel-2 Data and Carbon Isotopes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The source information of coastal particulate organic carbon (POC) with high spatial and temporal resolution is of great significance for the study of marine carbon cycles and marine biogeochemical processes. Over the past decade, satellite ocean color remote sensing has greatly improved our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of ocean particulate organic carbon concentrations. However, due to the complexity of coastal POC sources, remote sensing methods for coastal POC sources have not yet been established. With an attempt to fill the gap, this study developed an algorithm for retrieving coastal POC sources using remote sensing and geochemical isotope technology. The isotope end-member mixing model was used to calculate the proportion of POC sources, and the response relationship between POC source information and in situ remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) was established to develop a retrieval algorithm for POC sources with the following four bands: (R-rs(443)/R-rs(492)) x (R-rs(704)/R-rs(665)). The results showed that the four-band algorithm performed well with R-2, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.78, 33.57% and 13.74%, respectively. Validation against in situ data showed that the four-band algorithm derived calculated the proportion of marine POC accurately, with an MAPE and RMSE of 27.49% and 13.58%, respectively. The accuracy of the algorithm was verified based on the Sentinel-2 data, with an MAPE and RMSE of 28.02% and 15.72%, respectively. Additionally, we found that the proportion of marine POC sources was higher outside the Zhanjiang Bay than inside it using in situ survey data, which was consistent with the retrieved results. Influencing factors of POC sources may be due to the occurrence of phytoplankton blooms outside the bay and the impact of terrestrial inputs inside the bay. Remote sensing in combination with carbon isotopes provides important technical assistance in comprehending the biogeochemical process of POC and uncovering spatiotemporal variations in POC sources and their underlying causes.

TI  - An interactive and iterative method for crop mapping through crowdsourcing optimized field samples
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing appears as an essential approach for crop mapping, yet the interpretation of satellite imageries requires for a large amount of labeled data as ground truth information. Traditional approaches for ground truth data collection are costly, inefficient and are mostly one-off effort, thus the up-to-date ground truth data are extremely scarce in existing crop mapping research and applications. Here, we address the challenge of ground truth data scarcity by implementing an interactive and iterative crowdsourcing framework. We developed a crowdsourcing platform, named as FarmWatch, which helped process one Sentinel-2 imagery for an unsupervised clustering and instantly for a stratified random sampling. Sample tasks and collected information are synchronized across web and mobile applications, which enables the field information to be immediately applied for crop mapping. Results of the iterative process show that: firstly, a total of 95 samples have been collected in the initial round and the overall accuracy of crop mapping was 83.33%; secondly, after four rounds of sample collection (a total of 279 samples), the classification accuracy reached to 96.30% and such accuracy did not improve even though an additional 23 samples were added in the fifth round. Such interactive and iterative mechanism indicates that ground truth data has been sufficiently collected for the current crop mapping activity. It not only promotes the opportunity of up-to-date and in-season crop mapping, but also helps to inform users where to collect field samples and how many samples are basically required for producing an accurate crop map.

TI  - Potato Leaf Area Index Estimation Using Multi-Sensor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Imagery and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Potato holds significant importance as a staple food crop worldwide, particularly in addressing the needs of a growing population. Accurate estimation of the potato Leaf Area Index (LAI) plays a crucial role in predicting crop yield and facilitating precise management practices. Leveraging the capabilities of UAV platforms, we harnessed their efficiency in capturing multi-source, high-resolution remote sensing data. Our study focused on estimating potato LAI utilizing UAV-based digital red-green-blue (RGB) images, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) points, and hyperspectral images (HSI). From these data sources, we computed four sets of indices and employed them as inputs for four different machine-learning regression models: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (HGBR), and Partial Least-Squares Regression (PLSR). We assessed the accuracy of individual features as well as various combinations of feature levels. Among the three sensors, HSI exhibited the most promising results due to its rich spectral information, surpassing the performance of LiDAR and RGB. Notably, the fusion of multiple features outperformed any single component, with the combination of all features of all sensors achieving the highest R-2 value of 0.782. HSI, especially when utilized in calculating vegetation indices, emerged as the most critical feature in the combination experiments. LiDAR played a relatively smaller role in potato LAI estimation compared to HSI and RGB. Additionally, we discovered that the RFR excelled at effectively integrating features.

TI  - Superpixel-Based Style Transfer Method for Single-Temporal Remote Sensing Image Identification in Forest Type Groups
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are the most important carbon reservoirs on land, and forest carbon sinks can effectively reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations and mitigate climate change. In recent years, various satellites have been launched that provide opportunities for identifying forest types with low cost and high time efficiency. Using multi-temporal remote sensing images and combining them with vegetation indices takes into account the vegetation growth pattern and substantially improves the identification accuracy, but it has high requirements for imaging, such as registration, multiple times, etc. Sometimes, it is difficult to satisfy, the plateau area is severely limited by the influence of clouds and rain, and Gaofen (GF) data require more control points for orthophoto correction. The study area was chosen to be Huize County, situated in Qujing City of Yunnan Province, China. The analysis was using the GF and Landsat images. According to deep learning and remote sensing image feature extraction methods, the semantic segmentation method of F-Pix2Pix was proposed, and the domain adaptation method according to transfer learning effectively solved the class imbalance in needleleaf/broadleaf forest identification. The results showed that (1) this method had the best performance and a higher accuracy than the existing products, 21.48% in non-forest/forest and 29.44% in needleleaf/broadleaf forest for MIoU improvement. (2) Applying transfer learning domain adaptation to semantic segmentation showed significant benefits, and this approach utilized satellite images of different resolutions to solve the class imbalance problem. (3) It can be used for long-term monitoring of multiple images and has strong generalization. The identification of needleleaf and broadleaf forests combined with the actual geographical characteristics of the forest provides a foundation for the accurate estimation of regional carbon sources/sinks.

TI  - Spatial distribution of aerosols burden and evaluation of changes in aerosol optical depth using multi-approach observations in tropical region
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding of Aerosol optical depth (AOD) parameter is important for air quality assessment. This study aims to evaluate and validate AOD measurements from combine datasets to improve air quality for a period 2005-2020 using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) at Ilorin site (8.320 degrees N, 4.340 degrees E) in Nigeria. AOD outputs from Community Atmosphere Model Version 6 with chemistry (CAM6-chem) at 1 degrees horizontal resolution and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) are investigated in addition to validation of two satellites AOD retrievals: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR). Result of spatial distribution of AOD shows high values > 1 in the North and Western Sahara compared to Central Africa. Desert dust shows largest contribution in the North and Western Africa that is up to 2 magnitude larger than other aerosol types. Primary organic matter (POM) and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) both presents high burdens with later been dominant at around 10 degrees band, and black carbon (BC) largest burden (2.6 x 10(-5) kgm(-2)) is seen in the model from oil and gas exploration site in Nigeria. Inter-comparison of MERRA/MISR/MODIS and AERONET AOD using linear correlation of the seasonal dependence demonstrated high correlation (r = 0.864 - 0.973) subjected to Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.069 - 0.211), suggesting good agreement between the datasets. When compared to seasonal mean maximum AERONET AOD value of 0.978 MERRA is similar to 5%, MISR similar to 28% and MODIS similar to 29% lower with stronger correlations observed in the wet and pre-harmattan seasons. Similarly, MODEL AOD at 550 nm and dust burden were found to be similar to 34% and similar to 67% lower in context to AERONET AOD annual mean value of 0.627. Positive relationships that indicate an upward slope exist between all the computed datasets with moderate value of AERONET/CAM-chem spearman partial correlation, and MERRA/MODIS and MODIS/MISR showing strong and significant relationship with p-value less than 0.05. Low variance is observed with all measurements except in MERRA.

TI  - Satellite-Based Identification and Characterization of Extreme Ice Features: Hummocks and Ice Islands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite-based techniques for the monitoring of extreme ice features (EIFs) in the Canadian Arctic were investigated and demonstrated using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and electro-optical data sources. The main EIF types include large ice islands and ice-island fragments, multiyear hummock fields (MYHF) and other EIFs, such as fragments of MYHF and large, newly formed hummock fields. The main objectives for the paper included demonstration of various satellite capabilities over specific regions in the Canadian Arctic to assess their utility to detect and characterize EIFs. Stereo pairs of very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery provided detailed measurements of sea ice topography and were used as validation information for evaluation of the applied techniques. Single-pass interferometric SAR (InSAR) data were used to extract ice topography including hummocks and ice islands. Shape from shading and height from shadow techniques enable us to extract ice topography relying on a single image. A new method for identification of EIFs in sea ice based on the thermal infrared band of Landsat 8 was introduced. The performance of the methods for ice feature height estimation was evaluated by comparing with a stereo or InSAR digital elevation models (DEMs). Full polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data were demonstrated to be useful for identification of ice islands.

TI  - The Spatio-Temporal Cloud Frequency Distribution in the Galapagos Archipelago as Seen from MODIS Cloud Mask Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds play an important role in the climate system; nonetheless, the relationship between climate change in general and regional cloud occurrence is not yet well understood. This particularly holds for remote areas such as the iconic Galapagos archipelago in Ecuador. As a first step towards a better understanding, we analyzed the spatio-temporal patterns of cloud cover over Galapagos. We found that cloud frequency and distribution exhibit large inter- and intra-annual variability due to the changing influence of climatic drivers (trade winds, sea surface temperature, El Nino/La Nina events) and spatial variations due to terrain characteristics and location within the archipelago. The highest cloud frequencies occur in mid-elevations on the slopes exposed to the southerly trade winds (south-east slopes). Towards the highlands ( >900 m a.s.l), cloud frequency decreases, with a sharp leap towards high-level crater areas mainly on Isabela Island that frequently immerse into the trade inversion layer. With respect to the diurnal cycle, we found a lower cloud frequency over the islands in the evening than in the morning. Seasonally, cloud frequency is higher during the hot season (January-May) than in the cool season (June-December). However, spatial differences in cloudiness were more pronounced during the cool season months. We further analyzed two periods beyond average atmospheric forcing. During El Nino 2015, the cloud frequency was higher than usual, and differences between altitudes and aspects were less pronounced. La Nina 2007 led to negative anomalies in cloud frequency over the islands, with intensified differences between altitude and aspect.

Results show that overall there is good consistency among these five products. Larger differences are found between GEWEX and CERES (HIRS) after (before) 2000 (RMSE similar to 5 W/m(2)), particularly in the tropical regions. In terms of global mean values, GEWEX shows large differences with the other products from the year 1992 to 2002, and CLARA shows large differences from the year 1979 to 1981, which are more obvious in the global ocean values. Large discrepancies among these products exist at low latitudinal bands, particularly before the year 2000. Australia and Asia (mid-low latitude part) are two typical regions in which larger differences are found.

TI  - Mapping Photovoltaic Panels in Coastal China Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Images and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) panels convert sunlight into electricity, and play a crucial role in energy decarbonization, and in promoting urban resources and environmental sustainability. The area of PV panels in China's coastal regions is rapidly increasing, due to the huge demand for renewable energy. However, a rapid, accurate, and robust PV panel mapping approach, and a practical PV panel classification strategy for large-scale applications have not been established. Here, we developed a new approach that uses spectral and textural features to identify and map the PV panels there were in coastal China in 2021 using multispectral instrument (MSI) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and the Google Earth Engine (GEE), to differentiate PV panels according to their underlying surface properties. Our 10-m-spatial-resolution PV panel map had an overall accuracy of 94.31% in 2021. There was 510.78 km(2) of PV panels in coastal China in 2021, which included 254.47 km(2) of planar photovoltaic (PPV) panels, 170.70 km(2) of slope photovoltaic (SPV) panels, and 85.61 km(2) of water photovoltaic (WPV) panels. Our resultant PV panel map provides a detailed dataset for renewable layouts, ecological assessments, and the energy-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

TI  - Atmospheric and Ionospheric Effects of La Palma Volcano 2021 Eruption
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - On 19 September 2021, La Palma volcano (Canarias Archipelagos) started an eruption that persisted until 13 December 2021. Despite the Volcano Explosive Index (VEI) being estimated equal to 3, corresponding to not so powerful eruption, the long eruption activity posed much scientific interest in this natural hazard event. In this paper, we searched for possible effects of this eruption on the atmosphere and ionosphere, investigating the climatological archive and Swarm magnetic satellite data. In particular, we explored Aerosol, Sulphur Dioxide and Carbon Monoxide concentrations in the atmosphere identifying both the direct emissions from the volcano as well as the plume that drifted toward West-South-West and was reinforced during the eruption period. The vertical profile of temperature from the Saber satellite was analysed to search for the possible presence of acoustic gravity waves induced by volcanic activity. Compared with the year before without eruption in the areas, a lot of Saber profiles present an Energy Potential very much higher than the previous year, proposing the presence of Acoustic Gravity Waves (AGW) induced by volcano eruption activity. We also identified Swarm magnetic disturbances on the day of the eruption and in November. The mechanism of coupling could be different for the latter one, as there is no evidence for AGW. They may be due to a more complex of physical and chemical alterations that propagate from the lower atmosphere to the upper one into the ionosphere.

TI  - Evaluation of the Radiometric Calibration of ZY1-02E Thermal Infrared Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the launch of the ZY1-02E satellite, the thermal infrared sensor aboard the satellite experienced alterations in the space environment, leading to varying degrees of attenuation in some components. The laboratory calibration accuracy could not satisfy the demands of quantitative production, and a certain degree of deviation was observed in on-orbit calibration. To accurately characterize the on-orbit radiation properties of thermal infrared remote sensing payloads, an absolute radiometric calibration campaign was carried out at the Ulansuhai Nur and Baotou calibration sites in Inner Mongolia in July 2022. This paper outlines the processes of onboard calibration and vicarious calibration for the ZY1-02E satellite, comparing the outcomes of onboard calibration with those of vicarious calibration. The onboard calibration method involved internal calibration, while the vicarious calibration method utilized an on-orbit absolute radiometric calibration technique based on various natural features that were not constrained by satellite-Earth spectrum matching requirements. Calibration coefficients were acquired, and the absolute radiometric calibration results of on-orbit vicarious and onboard calibration were compared, analyzed, and verified using the radiance computed from measured data and the reference sensor data. The accuracy of on-orbit absolute vicarious calibration was determined, and the causes for the decline in the radiation calibration accuracy on the orbiting satellite were examined. The findings revealed that the vicarious calibration results exhibited a lower percentage of radiance deviation compared with the onboard calibration results, meeting the quantitative requirements of remote sensing data. These results were significantly better than those obtained from onboard blackbody calibration, offering a data foundation for devising satellite calibration plans and enhancing calibration algorithms. In the future, the developmental trend of on-orbit radiometric calibration technology will encompass high-precision and slow-attenuation onboard calibration techniques, as well as high-frequency and simplified-step vicarious calibration methods.

TI  - Automatic Identification of Thaw Slumps Based on Neural Network Methods and Thaw Slumping Susceptibility
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Thaw slumping is a periglacial process that occurs on slopes in cold environments, where the ground becomes unstable and the surface slides downhill due to saturation with water during thawing. In this study, GaoFen-1 remote sensing and fused multi-source feature data were used to automatically map thaw slumping landforms in the Beilu River Basin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The bi-directional cascade network structure was used to extract edges at different scales, where an individual layer was supervised by labeled edges at its specific scale, rather than directly applying the same supervision to all convolutional neural network outputs. Additionally, we conducted a 5-year multi-scale feature analysis of small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar deformation, normalized difference vegetation index, and slope, among other features. Our study analyzed the performance and accuracy of three methods based on edge object supervised learning and three preconfigured neural networks, ResNet101, VGG16, and ResNet152. Through verification using site surveys and multi-data fusion results, we obtained the best ResNet101 model score of intersection over union of 0.85 (overall accuracy of 84.59%).The value of intersection over union of the VGG and ResNet152 are 0.569 and 0.773, respectively. This work provides a new insight for the potential feasibility of applying the designed edge detection method to map diverse thaw slumping landforms in larger areas with high-resolution images.

TI  - Mapping depth-integrated microphytobenthic biomass on an estuarine tidal flat using Sentinel satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Microphytobenthos (MPB) are central to benthic tidal flat ecological networks. Large-scale information on total MPB biomass is difficult to obtain from traditional in-situ measurements. Here, we assessed the effectiveness of using surface sediment properties as proxies for predicting the total (depth-integrated) MPB biomass with Sentinel satellite data. First, the best subset regression was applied to the in-situ data to determine the properties that best predict the biomass decay rate with depth (sampling every cm up to 10 cm depth). Then, data from a controlled laboratory experiment were used to analyse the spectral response to different sediment properties (i.e., variations in sediment grain size, organic matter and water content). Subsequently, an algorithm was developed to obtain the spatial distribution of the sediment properties and the depth-integrated total MPB biomass from remote sensing data. Finally, we presented a case study in which the seasonal dynamics of total (depth-integrated) MPB biomass were obtained from Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) satellite data using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results showed that (1) the vertical distribution of MPB biomass on a tidal flat could be predicted by the surface MPB biomass, median grain-size (D50) and water content (W0) of the sediment (top 1 cm); (2) the near infrared (NIR) band absorption depth was a key feature in estimating D50 and W0; and (3) the seasonal variation in the total (depth-integrated) MPB biomass was prominent in Chongming Dongtan, Changjiang Estuary. We concluded that the depth-integrated exponential decay algorithm was useful for estimating total MPB biomass and, combined with mappable sediment-surface data, could help map the total MPB biomass in estuarine tidal flats at a large scale.

TI  - Mapping Cropland Soil Nutrients Contents Based on Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing and Machine Learning
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are primary indicators of soil nutrients in agriculture. Accurate management of these nutrients is essential for ensuring food security. High-resolution, multi-spectral remote sensing images can provide crucial information for mapping soil nutrients at the field scale. This study compares the capabilities of ZH-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data, along with different spectral indices, in mapping soil nutrients (total N and Olsen-P) using two machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF) and XGBoost (XGB). Two agricultural fields in Suihua City were selected as the study areas for this investigation. The results showed that Sentinel-2 data performed best in computing the total N content in soil using the RF model (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 0.10 g/kg). However, for the soil Olsen-P content, the XGBoost model performed better with ZH-1 data (R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 9.79 mg/kg) than the RF model. This study demonstrates that both ZH-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data perform well in terms of accurately mapping soil total N and Olsen-P contents using machine learning. Due to its higher spectral and spatial resolution, ZH-1 remote sensing data provides more detailed information on soil nutrient content during Olsen-P inversion and exhibits comparable accuracy.

TI  - Satellite-derived sediment distribution mapping using ICESat-2 and SuperDove
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearshore sediment distribution is a significant component of fundamental geographic data, but the inherent optical properties of the water column make the large-scale observation of sediment particularly difficult. The development of satellite-based imaging sensors has enabled earth observation to capture more types and finer granularities of ground information, making it possible to obtain the target sediment distribution on a large scale. We use the proposed wavelet clustering algorithm to separate noise points and signal photons from ICESat-2 and then combine multispectral images and a quasi-analytical algorithm to calculate substrate reflectance to reduce the influence of the inherent properties of the water body. Furthermore, a new deep learning model, TSDANet, is being built to combine substrate reflectance and multispectral image data from SuperDove for nearshore sediment identification. We use field data to validate the method through a large number of experiments. The experiments demonstrate that the wavelet clustering algorithm has a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.90 and 0.95 for signal point extraction over a large scale of high and low photon densities compared with a digital elevation model, respectively. Compared to single-source data, the TSDANet sediment classification kappa improves by 6.44% on average and 8.28% at its maximum. The results indicate that the identification and classification of sediment using ICESat-2 and SuperDove data is a new and highly feasible method.

TI  - Effects of Multi-Growth Periods UAV Images on Classifying Karst Wetland Vegetation Communities Using Object-Based Optimization Stacking Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining machine learning algorithms with multi-temporal remote sensing data for fine classification of wetland vegetation has received wide attention from researchers. However, wetland vegetation has different physiological characteristics and phenological information in different growth periods, so it is worth exploring how to use different growth period characteristics to achieve fine classification of vegetation communities. To resolve these issues, we developed an ensemble learning model by stacking Random Forest (RF), CatBoost, and XGBoost algorithms for karst wetland vegetation community mapping and evaluated its classification performance using three growth periods of UAV images. We constructed six classification scenarios to quantitatively evaluate the effects of combining multi-growth periods UAV images on identifying vegetation communities in the Huixian Karst Wetland of International Importance. Finally, we clarified the influence and contribution of different feature bands on vegetation communities' classification from local and global perspectives based on the SHAP (Shapley Additive explanations) method. The results indicated that (1) the overall accuracies of the four algorithms ranged from 82.03% to 93.37%, and the classification performance was Stacking > CatBoost > RF > XGBoost in order. (2) The Stacking algorithm significantly improved the classification results of vegetation communities, especially Huakolasa, Reed-Imperate, Linden-Camphora, and Cephalanthus tetrandrus-Paliurus ramosissimus. Stacking had better classification performance and generalization ability than the other three machine learning algorithms. (3) Our study confirmed that the combination of spring, summer, and autumn growth periods of UAV images produced the highest classification accuracy (OA, 93.37%). In three growth periods, summer-based UAVs achieved the highest classification accuracy (OA, 85.94%), followed by spring (OA, 85.32%) and autumn (OA, 84.47%) growth period images. (4) The interpretation of black-box stacking model outputs found that vegetation indexes and texture features provided more significant contributions to classifying karst wetland vegetation communities than the original spectral bands, geometry features, and position features. The vegetation indexes (COM and NGBDI) and texture features (Homogeneity and Standard Deviation) were very sensitive when distinguishing Bermudagrass, Bamboo, and Linden-Camphora. These research findings provide a scientific basis for the protection, restoration, and sustainable development of karst wetlands.

TI  - Rapid Vegetation Growth due to Shifts in Climate from Slow to Sustained Warming over Terrestrial Ecosystems in China from 1980 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) is a key biophysiological parameter of terrestrial ecosystems. However, due to a lack of data with adequate spatial resolution and in long enough time series, there have been limitations in exploring the spatiotemporal changes of vegetation and response to climate change. In this study, a 1 km spatial resolution and 8-day period length dataset (FPAR(ANN)) was developed covering the years 1980 to 2018 and evaluated on spatiotemporal change consistency by validating with Gross Primary Production (GPP) observations from the Chinese Flux Observation and Research Network (ChinaFLUX), and comparison with other FPAR products. FPAR(ANN) provided a comparable performance in capturing seasonal change observed through GPP, according to the coefficient of determination (R-2): 0.50, 0.51, 0.70 and 0.74 averaged for all sites, forest sites, grassland sites and cropland flux sites, respectively. The new data had more spatial similarity to the MODIS FPAR product (FPAR(MCD15A2)) with a greater R-2 (0.77) and a lower RMSE (0.12) than other products. With a newly developed dataset, combined with FPAR(ANN) (1980-2003) and FPAR(MCD15A2) (2004-2018), an overall increasing trend in FPAR was found for over 81% of the vegetated area of China from 1980 to 2018. FPAR increased more rapidly for over 83.7% of the area in the 2010s, and at a slower pace for over 62.1% of the area in the early 2000s, which was attributed to a decadal shifting of climate change. This study implies the new dataset is useful in quantifying vegetation changes and would be an important data source for future study of the carbon cycle, soil erosion, or evapotranspiration, with great application potential.

TI  - Robust Downlink Transmission Design in IRS-Assisted Cognitive Satellite and Terrestrial Networks
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cognitive satellite and terrestrial network (CSTN) is considered as a promising technology to provide ubiquitous connectivity for various users within wide-coverage. This paper proposes a robust downlink transmission scheme for multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) assisted CSTN. Here, the satellite network adopts multigroup multicast transmission scheme to serve many earth stations, while the terrestrial network exploits space division multiple access and multi-IRS-enhanced non-orthogonal multiple access technology to communicate with many terrestrial users. By assuming that these two networks share the same frequency band having only the angular information based imperfect channel state information of each user, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total transmit power subject to the constraints of quality-of-service requirement for each user, per-antenna transmit power budgets of satellite and BS, and unit-modulus requirement for each reflecting element. To tackle this mathematically intractable problem, we then employ angular discretization together with the successive convex approximation method to obtain the active beamforming (BF) vectors of satellite and BS, the passive BF vector of IRS, and the power allocation coefficients. Moreover, we propose a generalized zero forcing BF and alternative optimization to obtain the suboptimal solutions of the optimization problem with low computational complexity. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed two schemes over the benchmarks.

TI  - Monitoring and Comparative Analysis of Hohhot Subway Subsidence Using StaMPS-PS Based on Two DEMS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The subway alleviates the traffic pressure in the city but also brings the potential risk of land subsidence. The land subsidence caused by the subway is a global problem that seriously affects the safety of subway operations and surrounding buildings. Therefore, it is very important to carry out long-term deformation monitoring on the subway system. StaMPS-PS is a time-series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique that serves as an effective means for monitoring urban ground subsidence. However, the accuracy of external (Digital Elevation Models) DEM will affect the accuracy of StaMPS-PS monitoring, and previous studies have mostly used SRTM-1 arc DEM (30 m) as the external DEM. In this study, to obtain a more precise measurement of surface deformation caused by the excavation of the Hohhot subway, a total of 85 scenes of Sentinel-1A data from July 2015 to October 2021, as well as two different resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) (ALOS PALSAR DEM and SRTM-1 arc DEM), were used to calculate and analyze the subsidence along the subway line in Hohhot city. The StaMPS-PS monitoring results showed the ALOS PALSAR DEM, as an external DEM, had higher accuracy, and there was regional subsidence in both the construction processes of Line 1 and Line 2 of the Hohhot subway, with a maximum subsidence rate of -21.1 mm/year. The dynamic changes in subway subsidence were fitted using the Peck formula and the long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The Peck formula results showed the width and maximum subsidence of the settlement troughs gradually expanded during the construction of the subway. The predicted values of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the LSTM model were less than 4 mm and 10%, respectively, consistent with the measured results. Furthermore, we discussed the factors that affect settlement along the subway line and the impact of two external DEMs on StaMPS-PS. The study results provide a scientific method for DEM selection and subsidence analysis calculations in the StaMPS-PS monitoring of urban subway subsidence.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Observation of Water Color Variations in Inland Water across Guangzhou and Shenzhen after the Establishment of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Guangzhou and Shenzhen are two core cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). It is increasingly important to regulate water quality in urban development. The Forel-Ule Index (FUI) can be obtained by optical data and is an important indicator. Therefore, we used Sentinel-2 to calculate the FUI of 41 lakes and reservoirs in Guangzhou and Shenzhen from January to December in 2016-2021, and analyzed their spatio-temporal variations, including spatial distributions, seasonal variations, and inter-annual variations. We also performed a correlation analysis of driving factors. In Guangzhou, the FUI was low in the north and west, and high in the south and east. In Shenzhen, the FUI was high in the west and low in the east. Moreover, 68% of the lakes and reservoirs in Guangzhou exhibited seasonal variations, with a low FUI in summer and autumn, and high levels in spring and winter. Shenzhen had the lowest FUI in autumn. Furthermore, 36% of the lakes and reservoirs in Guangzhou exhibited increasing inter-annual variations, whereas Shenzhen exhibited stable and decreasing inter-annual variations. Among the 41 lakes and reservoirs analyzed herein, the FUI of 10 water areas were positively correlated with precipitation, while the FUI of 31 water areas were negatively correlated with precipitation. Increased precipitation leads to an increase in external pollutants and sediment, as well as the resuspension of substances in the water, resulting in more turbid water. Therefore, an increase in precipitation is positively correlated with the FUI, whereas a decrease in precipitation is negatively correlated with the FUI. These findings can be used to design suitable management policies to maintain and control the local water quality.

TI  - Downstream Channel Evolution and Its Causes in the Yuan River during the Qing Dynasty
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The determination of channel evolutions and the causes is important for reconstructing the evolutionary history of river landforms. This study aimed to elucidate the downstream channel evolution of the Yuan River in Hunan Province, China, during the Qing Dynasty via Landsat 8 satellite image data and relevant literature. The objective was to establish the modes of channel evolution and discuss the significance of historical climate change. The downstream paleochannel of the Yuan River was identified in the Late Ming Dynasty and Early Qing Dynasty (1600-1644 AD), the Kangxi-Qianlong periods of the Qing Dynasty (1661-1796 AD), the Late Qing Dynasty (1840-1912 AD), and the World War II (1939-1945 AD), and three main modes of river evolution were determined. Using remote sensing data and the ancient literature, the evolution characteristics of the paleochannel in the Lower Yuan River were analyzed and its distribution across historical periods was comprehensively revealed. The findings reveal a strong correlation between channel evolution, flood events, and climate change. Numerous flood events that occurred from the Late Qing Dynasty to the World War II caused a high rate of channel evolution, demonstrating the combined effects of climate change and human activities. These findings will help adopt robust and resilient hydrological management methods in the future of a changing climate.

TI  - Urban Vulnerability Analysis Based on Micro-Geographic Unit with Multi-Source Data-Case Study in Urumqi, Xinjiang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study introduces a novel approach to urban public safety analysis inspired by a streetscape analysis commonly applied in urban criminology, leveraging the concept of micro-geographical units to account for urban spatial heterogeneity. Recognizing the intrinsic uniformity within these smaller, distinct environments of a city, the methodology represents a shift from large-scale regional studies to a more localized and precise exploration of urban vulnerability. The research objectives focus on three key aspects: first, establishing a framework for identifying and dividing cities into micro-geographical units; second, determining the type and nature of data that effectively illustrate the potential vulnerability of these units; and third, developing a robust and reliable evaluation index system for urban vulnerability. We apply this innovative method to Urumqi's Tianshan District in Xinjiang, China, resulting in the formation of 30 distinct micro-geographical units. Using WorldView-2 remote sensing imagery and the object-oriented classification method, we extract and evaluate features related to vehicles, roads, buildings, and vegetation for each unit. This information feeds into the construction of a comprehensive index, used to assess public security vulnerability at a granular level. The findings from our study reveal a wide spectrum of vulnerability levels across the 30 units. Notably, units X1 (Er Dao Bridge) and X7 (Gold Coin Mountain International Plaza) showed high vulnerability due to factors such as a lack of green spaces, poor urban planning, dense building development, and traffic issues. Our research validates the utility and effectiveness of the micro-geographical unit concept in assessing urban vulnerability, thereby introducing a new paradigm in urban safety studies. This micro-geographical approach, combined with a multi-source data strategy involving high-resolution remote sensing and field survey data, offers a robust and comprehensive tool for urban vulnerability assessment. Moreover, the urban vulnerability evaluation index developed through this study provides a promising model for future urban safety research across different cities.

TI  - InSAR coseismic deformation monitoring and source characteristics of the 2022 Qinghai Menyuan M<sub>W</sub>6.6 earthquake
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - ..... Using the Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) technology, coseismic deformation field of the 2022 Qinghai Menyuan M(S)6.9 earthquake was obtained by processing the Sentinel-1A satellite ascending and descending images. The interferograms exhibit an obviously deformed area of 30 km x 20 km in range on both sides of the west Lenglongling fault, from which the maximum coseismic displacement of the line of sight is inferred at 50 cm. Based on the finite fault dislocation, a geodetic inversion for the fault slip model was carried out. The resolved slip distribution shows that the 2022 Menyuan earthquake's rupture on the Lenglongling fault is dominated by left-lateral strike-slip with the rupture length of similar to 23 km and at depth above similar to 10 km. The rupture plane features an elongated ellipses in which the maximum rupture of similar to 3.9 m is located nearly at the center of the ellipse at a depth of 5 similar to 6 km. The earthquake gives an average stress drop of similar to 5.9 MPa and the scalar moment of 1.0x10(19) N.m, corresponding moment magnitude of M(W)6.6. Coseismic static Coulomb stress disturbances induced by the 1927 Gulang earthquake, 1986 and 2016 Menyuan earthquakes on the fault of this earthquake are calculated. The result shows that the western segment of the Lenglongling fault has been hastened by the Coulomb stress of these previous earthquakes with the cumulative stress increase of similar to 0.12 MPa. Among them, the stress loading of the 1927 Gulang earthquake is the most significant and may have prompted this event. The 2022 Menyuan earthquake leads to a change of the stress level in the surrounding Tuolaishan fault, causing Coulomb stress increases that exceeding the seismic threshold on the segment of similar to 30 km in length, which suggests a higher risk of potential earthquake along the Tuolaishan fault.

TI  - Study on the Spatial and Temporal Evolution of Ecosystem Service Values and Driving Mechanism in the Yan River Basin from 1990 to 2020
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological and environmental degradation are among the major challenges facing humanity today. The analysis of ecosystem service value assessments can therefore serve as a means to guide ecosystem restoration, as well as provide indications for sustainable land use and land management decisions. The present study examines changes in land use and the associated ecosystem service values in the Yan River Basin in China for the period of 1990-2020. Based on high-resolution Landsat satellite data, we obtained detailed land type distribution data for the basin, allowing the analysis of the internal structure and the degree of influence of the land use by using information entropy and elasticity coefficient. We also explored the spatiotemporal differentiation of ESVs by applying the method of equivalent factors and hotspot analysis. Finally, we identified possible drivers for development patterns observed in the watershed using geodetector models. During the study period, the area of arable land dropped continuously, while the scope of forest land, grassland, and construction land increased. The land type layout developed in the direction of reduced uniformity. ESVs measured in monetary terms first rose and later fell, but nevertheless increased by 1.152 billion yuan overall. The decrease was mainly due to the accelerated urbanization construction in the later stage. Spatially, ESV distribution coincided with the land-use pattern, showing a growing pattern from north to south. The changes were due not to the role of a single factor but the joint interactions between multiple factors such as human activities, natural factors, and landscape patterns. The results can provide a basis for constructive suggestions to connect and promote the basin's natural and socio-economic surroundings, and also reflect the effectiveness of the policy of systematically stopping cultivation and planting trees and grass on stunted cultivated land.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring and Spatial Pattern Analysis of Non-Grain Production of Cultivated Land in Anhui Province, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, non-grain production of cultivated land (NGPCL) has become increasingly prominent in China, seriously affecting food production and threatening the country's food security. However, there is a lack of large-scale and high-precision methods for remote sensing identification of NGPCL. From the perspective of effective management of cultivated land resources, the characteristics of the spatial patterns of NGPCL, both on a large scale and at a patch scale, need to be further studied. For solving this problem, this paper uses the Google Earth engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and multi-source remote sensing data with a machine learning algorithm to determine the occurrence of NGPCL in Anhui province in 2019, and then uses nine selected landscape pattern indexes to analyze the spatial patterns of NGPCL from two aspects, specifically, economic development level and topography. The results show that: (1) terrain features, radar features, and texture features are beneficial to the extraction of NGPCL; (2) the degree of separation obtained by using an importance evaluation approach shows that spectral features have the highest importance, followed by index features with red edges, texture features, index features without red edges, radar features, and terrain features; and (3) the cultivated land in Anhui province in 2019 is mainly planted with food crops, and the phenomenon of NGPCL is more likely to occur in areas with high economic development levels and flat terrain. Aided by the GEE cloud platform, multi-source remote sensing data, and machine learning algorithm, the remote sensing monitoring approach utilized in this study could accurately, quickly, and efficiently determine NGPCL on a regional scale.

TI  - Effects of Topography on Vegetation Recovery after Shallow Landslides in the Obara and Shobara Districts, Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intense rainfall-induced shallow landslides can have severe consequences, including soil erosion and vegetation loss, making in-depth research essential for disaster risk management. However, vegetation recovery processes after shallow landslides and their influencing multivariate factors are not well known. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the vegetation recovery processes after shallow landslides and the impact of topography on this recovery. We focus on two regions in Japan: the Shobara district in Hiroshima Prefecture and the Obara district in Aichi Prefecture. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from long-term Landsat images, as well as aerial photographs and environmental datasets, are used to measure vegetation recovery. Then, statistical analysis and the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages (SARIMA) model were employed to investigate the dynamic response of vegetation under different combinations of environmental conditions using NDVI and EVI time series. Historical aerial photographs and vegetation index trend analysis suggest that vegetation in the study areas will take more than ten years to return to a stable state. The results also demonstrate the influence of atmospheric and land cover conditions when monitoring vegetation response using NDVI and EVI. In Obara, concave and convergent terrain positively influenced NDVI, while non-steep, low-elevation, and north-facing terrain positively influenced EVI. In Shobara, gentle and northwest-facing slopes were positively correlated with NDVI, and gentle and west-facing slopes were positively correlated with EVI. SARIMA modeling found that NDVI is more suitable for modeling the middle and late stages of vegetation recovery within 10-25 years after the landslide. In comparison, EVI is better for modeling the early stage of vegetation recovery within 10 years after the landslide.

TI  - Fusing Social Media, Remote Sensing, and Fire Dynamics to Track Wildland-Urban Interface Fire
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire is one of the main hazards affecting large areas and causes great damage all over the world, and the rapid development of the wildland-urban interface (WUI) increases the threat of wildfires that have ecological, social, and economic consequences. As one of the most widely used methods for tracking fire, remote sensing can provide valuable information about fires, but it is not always available, and needs to be supplemented by data from other sources. Social media is an emerging but underutilized data source for emergency management, contains a wealth of disaster information, and reflects the public's real-time witness and feedback to fires. In this paper, we propose a fusion framework of multi-source data analysis, including social media data and remote sensing data, cellphone signaling data, terrain data, and meteorological data to track WUI fires. Using semantic web technology, the framework has been implemented as a Knowledge Base Service and runs on top of WUIFire ontology. WUIFire ontology represents WUI fire-related knowledge and consists of three modules: system, monitoring, and spread, and tracks wildfires happening in WUIs. It provides a basis for tracking and analyzing a WUI fire by fusing multi-source data. To showcase the utility of our approach in a real-world scenario, we take the fire in the Yaji Mountain Scenic Area, Beijing, China, in 2019 as a case study. With object information identified from remote sensing, fire situation information extracted from Weibo, and fire perimeters constructed through fire spread simulation, a knowledge graph is constructed and an analysis using a semantic query is carried out to realize situational awareness and determine countermeasures. The experimental results demonstrate the benefits of using a semantically improved multi-source data fusion framework for tracking WUI fire.

TI  - A Deep-Learning Reconstruction of Tropical Cyclone Size Metrics 1981-2017: Examining Trends
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Observed climate records of length, homogeneity, and reliability are the basis of climatological studies on tropical cyclones (TCs). However, such data are scarce for TC size in terms of wind field, particularly over the western North Pacific (WNP). This study demonstrates that deep learning can practically bridge this data gap when applied to satellite data. Using transfer learning, deep learning algorithms were developed to estimate reliable TC sizes from infrared imagery for the WNP TCs. The algorithms were then applied to a homogeneous satellite database to reconstruct a new historical dataset of TC sizes, named DeepTCSize, which covers 37 years (1981-2017) over the WNP. DeepTCSize includes multiple TC size quantities, such as wind radii of 17, 26, and 33 m s-1 and maximum winds (i.e., R17, R26, R33, and RMW), which have high correlations (R 5 0.85, 0.84, 0.79, and 0.76, respectively) with postseason quality-controlled best track data. Comparisons with ocean wind observations were made and this further revealed that DeepTCSize has good quality and is free from spurious error trends, providing an advantage over the historical "best estimates" of TC sizes currently available in the best track archives for the WNP. The new reconstructed TC sizes dataset for the WNP TCs shows significant expanding trends in the annual-mean outer circulations (at a rate of 2% decade -1 for R17 and a rate of 2% decade -1 for R26), which are mainly associated with weaker storms, as well as a weak contracting trend in the annual mean inner-core size (RMW).

TI  - Prevalence of HIV among inmates in four states of north India: findings from the 16th round of HIV sentinel surveillance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRISONER HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposePrisoners are at a higher risk of HIV infection compared to the general population. The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of HIV and related risk behaviours among inmates of the Central Prisons in four states of North India. Design/methodology/approachThe HIV sentinel surveillance was conducted in seven Central Prisons in four states of North India from February to April 2019. Four hundred inmates were included from each prison. The interviews were conducted at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre located within the prison premises. The Ethics Committee of the National AIDS Control Organization, New Delhi, granted ethical approval before the start of the surveillance. FindingsOverall, 2,721 inmates were enrolled in this study. The mean (SD) age was 38.9 (13.9) years. One-third of prison inmates had comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS. The proportion of convict (54%) and undertrial (46%) inmates was almost equal. The overall prevalence of HIV infection among inmates was 0.96% (95% CI 0.65-1.40). The odds of being HIV positive were significantly higher in never married inmates, undertrials, inmates who were in the prison for more than three months to one year, inmates incarcerated for multiple times, inmates with history of injecting drug use and inmates with history of intercourse with a commercial sex worker. Originality/valueThe findings from the very first HIV sentinel surveillance in central prisons in North India have been presented in this paper. This has huge implications for future policy decisions.

TI  - Frozen Sections in Decision-Making Regarding the Axillary Procedures in Breast Conserving Surgery for Intraductal Carcinoma at Preoperative Diagnosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary evaluation is unnecessary for pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); however, it is performed because of the risk of upstaging to invasive cancer. We assessed the role of intraoperative frozen section (IOF) biopsy in reducing invasive cancer upstaging and axillary evaluation in preoperative DCIS patients. Methods: We reviewed patients with preoperative DCIS who underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with IOF biopsy. Positive IOF biopsy findings were defined as the presence of invasive or micro-invasive cancer. The IOF biopsy and permanent pathology findings were compared. Results: Seventy-eight patients underwent BCS with IOF biopsy. Six patients showed positive IOF biopsy findings; five of these patients showed concordant permanent pathology findings. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was positive in one patient. Thirteen patients with invasive breast cancer were missed by IOF biopsy; they underwent SLNB during the second surgery. None of them had metastatic lymph nodes. The sensitivity and specificity of IOF biopsy were 27.7% and 98.3%, respectively, with 82.1% accuracy. None of the other factors showed statistically significant relationships with the permanent pathology findings, except for the IOF biopsy findings. Conclusion: IOF evaluation can aid in detecting the invasiveness of tumors in patients with preoperative DCIS.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Most cities in the world suffer from excessive population and unplanned urban growth. The objective of the present study was to investigate the spatiotemporal changes of built-up areas and their growth in the proposed Greater Silchar City (GSC) (Assam, India). The obtained LANDSAT satellite data from 1991 to 2021 for the GSC have divided into non-built-up and built-up land use categories, and recode tools in Erdas Imagine 2014 software have been used to improve the accuracy of the output. The study area has been classified into 8 spatial directions and 11 concentric circles with radial distances of 1 km and resulted from intersected areas consisting of 60 gradient zones. The study used Shannon entropy model for detailed urban sprawl study of every nook and corner. FRAGSTATS v4.2 tools have been used to analyse landscape metrics in respective spatial directions. The built-up area growth of the city was 15.18 km(2) during the mentioned period. The landscape metrics and LU/LC results show the maximum built-up growth has taken place in South to South-West direction (3243.87 ha) and the area within a 2-3-km radius (221.85 ha) of the central business district, which is the periphery of the existing Silchar municipal limits. The entropy values indicated that the GSC has compacted infill growth form in the core area, while the dispersed urban sprawl trends followed with increasing distance from the city centre. Moreover, the research findings will provide a conceptual model for assessing urban growth trends for other cities as well.

AB  - Donald L. Morton, MD, epitomized one of America's dream scenarios: a person evolving from the humblest of origins to become an international celebrity in his profession, leading the world in the discipline of surgical oncology. His pioneering accomplishments in various roles have been well documented. Scientists, clinicians, students, and patients benefited from his contributions to the management of malignant diseases, particularly melanoma. His many attributes in pursuing the goal to cure malignant diseases are well known. Browsing the scientific literature reveals an almost unmatched publication record and continuous National Institutes of Health funding. He revealed dozens of original concealed ideas, not least of which is the tumor-draining regional lymph node, now called the sentinel lymph node (SLN). When others gave up on the original promise of immunotherapy, he saw the future, the clinical promise which has lately materialized in the control of previously untreatable malignancies. He regarded the fellowship-training of more than 100 surgical oncologists as one of his biggest achievements. In this article, we celebrate the human side of a man with creative courage and far-reaching insight.

TI  - Wave retrieval from quad-polarized Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR image using an improved tilt modulation transfer function
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - An accurate Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) is essential for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) wave spectra retrieval. This study aimed to investigate the performance of a quad-polarized wave retrieval algorithm based on fully polarimetric SAR image data using the improved tilt MTF and considering the influence of wind speed. The tilt MTF is the key factor in the wave retrieval scheme from quad-polarized (Vertical-Vertical (VV), Horizontal-Horizontal (HH), Vertical- Horizontal (VH), and Horizontal-Vertical (HV)) SAR images. In this study, the waves were inverted from more than 1300 Gaofen-3 (GF-3) images acquired in quad-polarization strip mode with a spatial resolution of 16 m and a swath coverage of 50 km. The winds were retrieved using the Geophysical Model Function (GMF) C-band SAR model for Gaofen-3 (CSARMOD-GF), which is suitable for re-calibrated GF-3 images in VV-polarization. The comparison of the wind speed yielded a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.73 m/s and a Correlation Coefficient (COR) of 0.94. The validation of the Significant Wave Height (SWH) simulated using the Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model against Haiyang-2B (HY-2B) altimeter data yielded an RMSE of 0.56 m and a COR of 0.87. The results reveal that the SAR-derived wind and SWAN-simulated SWH are suitable for analysis of SAR wave retrieval. The full polarimetric technique was applied to the collected images, and the statistical analysis yielded a RMSE of 0.51 m, a COR of 0.75, and a Scatter Index (SI) of 0.44 compared with the SWHs retrieved using the simulations from the SWAN model. The non-polarized contribution in the Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS; unit: dB) caused by wave breaking swb0 was calculated using a theoretical approach that employs the VV-polarized calibrated NRCS svv0 and HH-polarized calibrated NRCS. The effect of wave breaking on the SAR retrieval waves was studied. The bias (SAR-derived minus SWAN-simulated SWH) increased as the (swb 0 /svv 0 ) ratio (>0.4) increased, and the accuracy improved when the ratio was less than 0.4. This behavior is reasonable since the wave breaking inevitably affects the tilt modulation. Therefore, wave breaking should be considered in SAR wave retrieval using the approach proposed in this paper under extreme sea states, such as typhoons and hurricanes.

TI  - Characterizing subsidence in used and restored peatland with Sentinel SAR data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatland is a fragile ecosystem in the tropical region which is prone to subsidence. Until now, there is still lack of procedure to rapidly assess a tropical peatland subsidence in a large area. Our objective was to compare subsidence in a used and restored zone in a peatland hydrological unit using synthetic aperture radar data from Sentinel-1A products (SAR data) in South Sumatra, Indonesia from the period of 2014-2021. The subsidence rate of used peatland estimated by the D-InSAR procedure were in the range of 28-80 cm year(-1) in the early period of its utilization and becoming less for the consecutive year (16-48 cm year(-1)). Meanwhile, the subsidence rate based on the field surveys was in the range of 4-50 cm year(-1) in the early period of peatland utilization. The subsidence rate in the used peatland zone (agriculture and plantations) was higher than that in the restoration zone for all SAR data pairs used in our study. The SAR data is a potential tool for the assessment, monitoring and differentiating subsidence rates among different peatland uses in a large area. This tool will help the Directorate of Peat Ecosystem Degradation Control, Directorate General of Environmental Pollution and Degradation Control, and Ministry of Environment and Forestry to plan for better peatland management and restoration.

TI  - Displacements of Fushun west opencast coal mine revealed by multi-temporal InSAR technology
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this paper, the Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) technology is adopted to monitor the Line of Sight (LOS) displacement of Fushun West Opencast Coal Mine (FWOCM) and its surrounding areas in northeast China using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired from 2018 to 2022. The spatial-temporal evolution of urban subsidence and the south-slope landslide are both analyzed in detail. Comparison with ground measurements and cross-correlation analysis via cross wavelet transform with monthly precipitation data are also conducted, to analyze the influence factors of displacements in FWOCM. The monitoring results show that a subsidence basin appeared in the urban area near the eastern part of the north slope in 2018, with settlement center located at the intersection of E3000 and fault F1. The Qian Tai Shan (QTS) landslide on the south slope, which experienced rapid sliding during 2014 to 2016, presents seasonal deceleration and acceleration with precipitation, with the maximum displacement in vicinity of the Liushan paleochannel. The results of this paper have fully taken in account for the complications of large topographic relief, geological conditions, spatial distribution and temporal evolution characteristics of surface displacements in opencast mining area. The wide range and long time series dynamic monitoring of opencast mine are of great significance to ensure mine safety production and geological disaster prevention in the investigated mining area.

TI  - Evaluate and analyze land cover change dynamics, driving force and their implications to biodiversity in the western escarpment of the Rift valley
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) changes are caused by natural and human alterations of the landscape that could largely affect forest biodiversity and the environment. The study aimed to analyze LULC change dynamics and driving forces in the western escarpment of the rift valley of the Gamo Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Digital satellite images, which are downloaded from USGS, were analyzed using ERDAS Imagine (14) and Arc GIS 10.2 software and supervised image classification was used to generate LULC classification, accuracy assessment, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Drivers of LULC change were identified and analyzed. Four land classes were identified such as forest, farmland, settlement, and water-wetlands. Settlement and farmlands have increased by 8% and 6%, respectively. On the other hand, both forest and water-wetlands decreased by aerial coverage of 9% and 5%, respectively. The overall accuracy of the study area was 92.86%, 94.22%, and 94.3% with a kappa value of 0.902, 0.92, and 0.922, respectively. NDVI values ranged between -0.42 and 0.73. Agricultural expansion (31.4%), expansion of settlement (25.7%) and Fuelwood collection and Charcoal production (22.9%) were the main driving forces that affected the biodiversity of the vegetation in the study area. Integrated land use and policy to protect biodiversity loss, forest degradation and climate changes are deemed necessary.

TI  - Assessing global trends in Mars magma compositions using ground truth
T2  - METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global magmatic trends inferred from gamma-ray, visible/near-infrared, and thermal infrared spectrometers on Mars-orbiting spacecraft have been used to constrain planetary petrogenetic processes and global thermal evolution models. Inferred magmatic trends include temporal variations in the relative proportions of low-Ca and high-Ca pyroxenes, and in the abundances of potassium (and total alkalis), silica, FeO* (total iron expressed as FeO), and thorium. These patterns are evaluated for consistency with the compositions of surface igneous rocks of different ages analyzed by Mars rovers and of martian meteorites. Trends of decreasing low-Ca pyroxene/total pyroxene ratios and of decreasing potassium (and total alkalis), with time are generally supported by surface rock analyses. However, significant differences in the GRS-measured silica in Amazonian volcanoes and in martian meteorites of equivalent age result from contamination by silica-rich dust and are problematic for a silica trend. Comparison of FeO* in Noachian and Amazonian surface data shows no decrease. An inferred temporal trend in thorium is in conflict with the complex enrichment and depletion patterns of incompatible trace elements in martian meteorites of various ages. A dearth of analyses of Hesperian-age surface rocks precludes a firm evaluation of inferred Noachian-Hesperian trends and Hesperian-Amazonian trends, but abundant Noachian rocks and a few Hesperian rocks at rover sites, and Amazonian martian meteorites, collectively representing at least 16 surface locations, afford useful comparisons with orbital remote-sensing data.

TI  - Ephemeral prediction of aerosol optical depth associated with precipitation: A data-driven approach
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The study investigates the influence of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in coastal areas where the aerosols have an extensive range owing to wind movements together with precipitation, for a period from June 2016 to Dec 2020. Therefore, the consequences of climate change at the microscale are determined in this research using AOD for the southern coastal area, while the studies are more prevalent only in the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The entire investigation used data from NASA's VIIRS Deep Blue Aerosol satellite. The study examined whether precipitation played a role in AOD prevalence analysis. Four models with variables, namely AOD550, AOD ocean, precipitation, temperature and sea surface temperature, were implemented in this study. Machine learning algorithms were adopted for the prediction analysis, namely artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) including Polykernel, Radial Basis kernel Function and Pearson VII Universal Kernel (PUK). The results show that precipitation (similar to 0.03) had a negative correlation with AOD550 land but a positive relationship with AOD ocean (0.554). The main conclusions were that ANN does not agree well with the AOD prediction, although R2 and RMSE performed better than average, ANN proved to overperform during the testing phase of all the ratio splits of 60-40%, 70-30%, 80-20%, 90-10%, 98-2% and 99-1%. However, SVM offers more reliability with fewer data variability than ANN thus providing a better result for 98-2% (31 days) and 99-1% (16 days) prediction. The PUK function out-performed the overall SVM function for all 4 models with an RMSE of +/- 0.005 during training and +/- 0.0035 during testing, whose R-2 value was also around +/- 0.90 during training and 1 during testing.

TI  - Far beyond the Sun - II. Probing the stellar magnetism of the young Sun ι Horologii from the photosphere to its corona
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensiv e multiwav elength campaign has been carried out to probe stellar activity and variability in the young Sun-like star iota-Horologii. We present the results from long-term spectropolarimetric monitoring of the system by using the ultra-stable spectropolarimeter/velocimeter HARPS at the ESO 3.6-m telescope. Additionally, we included high-precision photometry from the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and observations in the far-and near-ultra violet spectral regions using the STIS instrument on the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ). The high-quality data set allows a robust characterization of the star's rotation period, as well as a probe of the variability using a range of spectroscopic and photometric activity proxies. By analysing the gradient of the power spectra (GPS) in the TESS light curves, we constrained the faculae-to-spot driver ratio (S-fac/ S-spot) to 0.510 +/- 0.023, which indicates that the stellar surface is spot dominated during the time of the observations. We compared the photospheric activity properties derived from the GPS method with a magnetic field map of the star derived using Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) from simultaneous spectropolarimetric data for the first time. Different stellar activity proxies enable a more complete interpretation of the observ ed variability. F or e xample, we observ ed enhanced emission in the HST transition line diagnostics C IV and C III , suggesting a flaring event. From the analysis of TESS data acquired simultaneously with the HST data, we investigate the photometric variability at the precise moment that the emission increased and derive correlations between different observables, probing the star from its photosphere to its corona.

TI  - Resveratrol as sensitizer in colorectal cancer plasticity
T2  - CANCER AND METASTASIS REVIEWS
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Despite tremendous medical treatment successes, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Chemotherapy as monotherapy can lead to significant side effects and chemoresistance that can be linked to several resistance-activating biological processes, including an increase in inflammation, cellular plasticity, multidrug resistance (MDR), inhibition of the sentinel gene p53, and apoptosis. As a consequence, tumor cells can escape the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents. This underscores the need for cross-target therapeutic approaches that are not only pharmacologically safe but also modulate multiple potent signaling pathways and sensitize cancer cells to overcome resistance to standard drugs. In recent years, scientists have been searching for natural compounds that can be used as chemosensitizers in addition to conventional medications for the synergistic treatment of CRC. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic phytoalexin found in various fruits and vegetables such as peanuts, berries, and red grapes, is one of the most effective natural chemopreventive agents. Abundant in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that resveratrol, in interaction with standard drugs, is an effective chemosensitizer for CRC cells to chemotherapeutic agents and thus prevents drug resistance by modulating multiple pathways, including transcription factors, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-plasticity, proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, cell cycle, and apoptosis. The ability of resveratrol to modify multiple subcellular pathways that may suppress cancer cell plasticity and reversal of chemoresistance are critical parameters for understanding its anti-cancer effects. In this review, we focus on the chemosensitizing properties of resveratrol in CRC and, thus, its potential importance as an additive to ongoing treatments.

TI  - Surface soil moisture estimate from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data in agricultural fields in areas of high vulnerability to climate variations: the Marche region (Italy) case study
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Surface soil moisture is a key hydrologic state variable that greatly influences the global environment and human society. Its significant decrease in the Mediterranean region, registered since the 1950s, and expected to continue in the next century, threatens soil health and crops. Microwave remote sensing techniques are becoming a key tool for the implementation of climate-smart agriculture, as a means for surface soil moisture retrieval that exploits the correlation between liquid water and the dielectric properties of soil. In this study, a workflow in Google Earth Engine was developed to estimate surface soil moisture in the agricultural fields of the Marche region (Italy) through Synthetic Aperture Radar data. Firstly, agricultural areas were extracted with both Sentinel-2 optical and Sentinel-1 radar satellites, investigating the use of Dual-Polarimetric Entropy-Alpha decomposition's bands to improve the accuracy of radar data classification. The results show that Entropy and Alpha bands improve the kappa index obtained from the radar data only by 4% (K = 0.818), exceeding optical accuracy in urban and water areas. However, they still did not allow to reach the overall optical accuracy (K = 0.927). The best classification results are reached with the total dataset (K = 0.949). Subsequently, Water Cloud and Tu Wien models were implemented on the crop areas using calibration parameters derived from literature, to test if an acceptable accuracy is reached without in situ observation. While the first model's accuracy was inadequate (RMSD = 12.3), the extraction of surface soil moisture using Tu Wien change detection method was found to have acceptable accuracy (RMSD = 9.4).

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundPtosis causes an extra folding of tissues lateral to the eyebrows. Different techniques aimed to correct this with varying outcomes and limitations. We analyzed the long-term results of an office-based technique for deep-plane subgaleal lift under local anesthesia and assessed patient satisfaction.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the long-term outcome of a modified temporal brow lift technique in patients with lateral eyebrow ptosis. The incision lines were marked 3-5 mm behind the temporal lines, and then at the deep temporal fascia layer was dissected. The three key steps in the procedure included (1) detecting the sentinel vein by transillumination; (2) cutting the lateral orbital ligament; and (3) releasing the superior temporal septum by blunt and sharp dissections. Finally, the tissues were fixed to the deep temporal fascia. After 1 and 12-15 months, the distance between the lateral brow and lateral canthus was measured.ResultsWe operated on 44 Iranian women (ranging from 28 to 51 years) between 2019 and 2021. The mean post-surgical brow elevation was 11.5 mm (95% CI 10.8-12.2; 133.4% improvement) after 1 month and 7.2 mm (6.4-8.1; 88.2% improvement) after 12-15 months. Minor complication (i.e., the stitch abscess) was observed in 6.8% of patients (three patients). Major complications included a complete relapse (two patients; 4.5%) and alopecia (one patient; 2.3%). Overall, 88.6% of patients (39 patients) were satisfied with the outcome.ConclusionsLateral brow ptosis could be corrected with a modified temporal lift technique using transillumination for the detection of the sentinel vein and preservation of the temporal branch of the facial nerve. The durability of this procedure could be enhanced with a complete release of septal adhesions and proper fixations.Level of evidence: level IV, therapeutic study.

TI  - Spatiotemporal characteristics and remote sensing estimation of colored dissolved organic matter around the Leizhou Peninsula
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is an important optically active substance in marine environment. Its biochemical conservatism makes it an important indicator to offshore pollution process. Monitoring the content, composition, and diffusion process of CDOM is a good approach to analyze the terrestrial input, optical properties, and ecological environment of offshore areas. The spatiotemporal characteristics of CDOM around the Leizhou Peninsula were analyzed based on field observation data collected in the autumn 2020 and spring 2021, and an empirical inversion model of the a(g)(355) (absorption coefficient at 355 nm) and spectral slope (S-g) (g stands for gelbstoff/gilvin, which is called CDOM) based on Sentinel-3A ocean and land color instrument (OLCI) images was constructed. The results show (1) the order of average a(g)(355) value around the Leizhou Peninsula was east coast (0.503/m)>Qiongzhou Strait (0.502/m)>west coast (0.365/m); (2) the best band combinations of CDOM inversion in spring and autumn were (B4+B11)/B3 and (B7-B1)/B6 (B stands for the band of spectral images), and the final inversion results are close to the measured results, indicating that the model has good accuracy; (3) the S-g value of the CDOM absorption spectrum was fitted to the hyperbolic-exponential model. The fitting accuracy of the model was higher than those of the exponential model and the hyperbolic model, and the best S-g inversion model was constructed by selecting S-g(275-295) and S-g(250-295) in spring and autumn; (4) the spatial distributions of a(g)(355) and S-g were inverted, and CDOM in the waters around the Leizhou Peninsula originated from terrestrial organic matter carried by coastal aquaculture zones and runoff in the northeast Zhanjiang and the northern Beibu Gulf.

TI  - Hydro-Geomorphological Mapping of Manbhum-Singhbhum Plateau (Part of Singhbhum Protocontinent, India) for Water Resource Development and Landuse Planning
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Hydro-geomorphological maps help to understand the diversity and evolution of landforms and landscapes. The development of geomorphological mapping techniques has been significantly advanced from classical to computer-based digital mapping through methodological development. Manbhum-Singhbhum Plateau is located in the eastern section of the Precambrian-origin Indian Chota Nagpur Plateau. Digital geomorphological mapping with hydrological aspects and investigation of groundwater changes are highly required for the planning and hazard management of any region. In this connection, the main objectives of this study are (1) to classify the landforms by applying the algorithms of Wood & Jennes, 2006, (2) to comprehend the relationship between lithology with structures and landforms through the evolution of time and (3) to investigate groundwater storage changes and recent landcover patterns through google earth engine (GEE) using advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER), Terra Climate and Landsat 8 datasets. The result showed that the maximum area of the entire plateau is covered by high ridges and midslope drainage with shallow valleys (36.98%) followed by canyons with incised streams (17.24%). The smallest area coverage is under the upper slope zones with mesas (1.46%). Local midslope ridges and hills in the plains are covered around 6.47%, whereas plains occupy 11.81% of the Manbhum-Singhbhum Plateau. Results have also been verified by collected waypoints. Furthermore, groundwater storage changes showed a negative trend (- 2.5 to - 3.7 cm) in the entire region, while high ridge areas with steep slopes face severe conditions. This research is most helpful for proper landuse planning and applied geomorphological issues.

TI  - The synergistic use of WorldView-3 and EO1-Hyperion data for the identification of lineaments and hydrothermal alteration minerals in the Chadormalu iron oxide-apatite deposit area, Central Iran
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Hyperspectral and high spatial resolution sensors allow for better discrimination of geological features and combining the products of these two kinds of sensors hypothetically improves this task. We evaluated the synergies of WorldView-3 (WV-3) and Hyperion datasets by fusing them to get a spatially enhanced hyperspectral dataset for mapping hydrothermal alteration minerals of Chadormalu iron oxide-apatite deposit area, in Central Iran. Due to the fact that faults and hydrothermal alteration minerals are inseparable phenomena for mineral exploration, lineaments of the study area were extracted manually and automatically using ALOS World 3D-30 m (AW3D30) and WV-3 data respectively. Subsequently, the alteration minerals were mapped by the use of Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) partial unmixing method on the WV-3, Hyperion, and their fused dataset. Results revealed that fusion of Hyperion and WV-3 data provides higher model accuracies than using solely one sensor dataset. Hyperion and Hyperion- WV-3 fused datasets reached 59.15% and 66. 41% overall accuracies as comparing to WV-3 MTMF mineral map for concentrations greater than 50%. This study introduced two prospecting areas of iron ore by matching the lineaments and alteration mineral maps. Furthermore, it was revealed that WV-3 data can discriminate the rock units and their approximate geometry in messy and stripy active open-pit which are concordant with the 1:1000 lithological map. Importantly, ground truthing and field validation, reflectance spectroscopy, TSG analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) supported the results of this research. Findings of this research stated the potential use of WV-3 and Hyperion data as well as their fusion for lineament and mineralogical discriminations to further develop new hyperspectral image processing approach and making synthetic high spatio-spectral dataset.

TI  - Evaluation of metal pollution related to human health risk in freshwater snail <i>Viviparus contectus</i> (Millet, 1813) as a potential bioindicator species in Lake Habitat (Turkey)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Freshwater mollusks are employed as bioindicators for the assessment of water quality in biomonitoring studies since the water quality of natural resources is crucial for humans. The freshwater snail species known as Viviparus contectus (Viviparidae: Gastropoda) is one that people eat. Here, the levels of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Pb, As, Zn, and Cu) in water and V. contectus samples were determined. An Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES, Spectro Arcos, vertical plasma) was used for the analysing the heavy metal concentrations in water and freshwater snail samples. The results of the current investigation demonstrated that freshwater snails accumulated metals in their water and soft tissues in the following orders: Pb > Cr = Zn = Cu = Cd = As and Zn > Cu > Pb > Cd > As = Cr. Autumn was the time of year when higher amounts of heavy metals (As, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Hg) were found. Pb content in the freshwater snail samples was strongly impacted by seasonal fluctuations (P 0.05). For adults, the EDI (estimated daily intake) values were lower than the TDI (tolerable daily intake) values, and the HI (hazard index) values were below 1. Freshwater snail samples had Zn and Pb levels that were over the FAO/WHO, Turkish Food Codex, JECFA, and EC limit values. Except for Pb, the water study shows mean metal concentrations below the USEPA, Turkish Pollution Control Regulation, and World Health Organisation maximum allowed levels. Aquatic ecosystems were negatively impacted by anthropogenic activities overall, and this study can provide a helpful data set for investigations on metallic contamination in water bodies and biomonitoring in freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Regenerative sustainability. A relational model of possibilities for the emergence of positive tipping points
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global environmental change problems are relational problems, so individual and collective actions aimed at dealing with them need to address fundamental changes about how we relate to social and biophysical systems. In this contribution, I suggest that current attempts to theorise and act on sustainability transformations would benefit from a relational perspective characterising individuals, organisations and societies as coupled social-ecological systems set in the context of accelerating global environmental change. Using a whole-life-systems' non-exemptionalist worldview, a conceptual model is presented to help explore the theoretical possibilities for creating regenerative sustainability pathways. Learning to restore and improve the life-support conditions that ensure long-term sustainability will require enacting positive synergies between social and biophysical capitals as well as reframing anthropocentric conceptions of agency and of individual emancipation. In particular, regenerative sustainability pathways entail synergising different kinds and levels of agency in non-dualistic ways and tackle at the same time transformations in: social and institutional arrangements (S), energy and natural resources (E), information and knowledge systems (I) and accumulated environmental change (C) -the SEIC model.

TI  - A review on common root rot of wheat and barley in Australia
T2  - PLANT PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Common root rot (CRR) caused by the soilborne pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana (teleomorph Cochliobolus sativus) is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. Identification of CRR is difficult and time-consuming for human assessors due to the non-distinctive above-ground symptoms, with browning of subcrown internodes and roots the most distinguishing symptom of infection. CRR disease has been recognized as a significant disease for cereal crops in many countries. In 2009, CRR in Australia was estimated to cause $30 million average annual yield loss for wheat and $13 million for barley. Recent evidence indicates CRR may be more prevalent than expected in Australian wheat cropping areas due to lack of research on this disease. Low levels of B. sorokiniana survive in the soil for up to 10 years and attack plants at early stages of growth. Therefore, mitigating CRR in wheat and barley may not be practical at the late stages of infection due to lack of effective methods; however, early detection might be viable to alleviate the impact of this disease. A comprehensive overview of CRR caused by B. sorokiniana, including disease background, worldwide economic losses, management methods, potential CRR detection using multispectral and hyperspectral sensors and the research focus over the past 50 years is provided in this article. This review paper is expected to provide thorough supplemental information for current studies about CRR and proposes recommendations for whole-of-field disease scouting methods to farmers, enabling reduced time and cost for CRR management and increasing wheat and barley production worldwide.

TI  - The Use of Wearable Activity Monitors to Measure Upper Limb Physical Activity After Axillary Lymph Node Dissection and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background. We suspect that morbidity from both sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been inadequately evaluated to date. Current methodologies are subjective and susceptible to bias. Objective assessment using wearable activity monitors (WAMs) would allow quantitative analysis of recovery by measuring physical activity (PA) and could provide evidence for axillary de-escalation.Patients and Methods. A prospective, single center, observational study was conducted from February 2020 to May 2022. Consecutive patients undergoing breast and/or reconstructive surgery and axillary surgeries were identified from the operating schedules. Patients wore WAMs for an average of 3 days prior to surgery and up to 2 weeks following surgery. In total, 56 patients with breast cancer were recruited, of whom 35 underwent SLNB and 21 ALND.Results. Patients who underwent ALND experienced significantly worse PA compared with those who underwent SLNB in week 2 (median 66.4% versus 72.7%, p = 0.015). Subgroup analysis revealed significantly lower PA in simple mastectomy (Mx)-ALND versus Mx-SLNB (median 90.3% versus 70.5%, p = 0.015) in week 2. The PA for SLNB did not return to baseline at 2 weeks after surgery.Conclusions. Compared with SLNB, ALND results in a lower PA level in week 2. The findings also indicate that SLNB has a protracted effect on PA levels, which extend to 2 weeks postoperatively. Monitoring recovery objectively following breast cancer surgery provides patients and surgeons with more information regarding the predicted outcomes of their surgery, which can drive the development of a personalized rehabilitation program.

TI  - Atmospheric data support a multi-decadal shift in the global methane budget towards natural tropical emissions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We use the GEOS-Chem global 3-D model and two inverse methods (the maximum a posteriori and ensemble Kalman filter) to infer regional methane (CH4) emissions and the corresponding stable-carbon-isotope source signatures from 2004-2020 across the globe using in situ and satellite remote sensing data. We use the Siegel estimator to determine linear trends from the in situ data. Over our 17-year study period, we estimate a linear increase of 3.6 Tg yr(-1) yr(-1) in CH4 emissions from tropical continental regions, including North Africa, southern Africa, tropical South America, and tropical Asia. The second-largest increase in CH4 emissions over this period (1.6 Tg yr(-1) yr(-1)) is from China. For boreal regions we estimate a negative emissions trend of -0.2 Tg yr(-1) yr(-1), and for northern and southern temperate regions we estimate trends of 0.03 Tg yr(-1) yr(-1) and 0.2 Tg yr(-1) yr(-1), respectively. These increases in CH4 emissions are accompanied by a progressively isotopically lighter atmospheric d(13)C signature over the tropics, particularly since 2012, which is consistent with an increased biogenic emissions source and/or a decrease in a thermogenic/pyrogenic emissions source with a heavier isotopic signature. Previous studies have linked increased tropical biogenic emissions to increased rainfall. Over China, we find a weaker trend towards isotopically lighter d(13)C sources, suggesting that heavier isotopic source signatures make a larger contribution to this region. Satellite remote sensing data provide additional evidence of emissions hotspots of CH4 that are consistent with the location and seasonal timing of wetland emissions. The collective evidence suggests that increases in tropical CH4 emissions are from biogenic sources, with a significant fraction from wetlands. To understand the influence of our results on changes in the hydroxyl radical (OH), we also report regional CH4 emissions estimates using an alternative scenario of a 0.5 % yr(-1) decrease in OH since 2004, followed by a larger 1.5 % drop in 2020 during the first COVID-19 lockdown. We find that our main findings are broadly insensitive to those idealised year-to-year changes in OH, although the corresponding change in atmospheric CH4 in 2020 is inconsistent with independent global-scale constraints for the estimated annual-mean atmospheric growth rate.

TI  - A pan-sharpening network using multi-resolution transformer and two-stage feature fusion
T2  - PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening is a fundamental and crucial task in the remote sensing image processing field, which generates a high-resolution multi-spectral image by fusing a low-resolution multi-spectral image and a high-resolution panchromatic image. Recently, deep learning techniques have shown competitive results in pan-sharpening. However, diverse features in the multi-spectral and panchromatic images are not fully extracted and exploited in existing deep learning methods, which leads to information loss in the pan-sharpening process. To solve this problem, a novel pan-sharpening method based on multi-resolution transformer and two-stage feature fusion is proposed in this article. Specifically, a transformer-based multi-resolution feature extractor is designed to extract diverse image features. Then, to fully exploit features with different content and characteristics, a two-stage feature fusion strategy is adopted. In the first stage, a multi-resolution fusion module is proposed to fuse multi-spectral and panchromatic features at each scale. In the second stage, a shallow-deep fusion module is proposed to fuse shallow and deep features for detail generation. Experiments over QuickBird and WorldView-3 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches visually and quantitatively with fewer parameters. Moreover, the ablation study and feature map analysis also prove the effectiveness of the transformer-based multi-resolution feature extractor and the two -stage fusion scheme.

TI  - Effects of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Eruption on MODIS-Retrieved Sea Surface Temperatures
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai (HTHH) volcano on 15 January 2022 injected a great amount of H2O and a moderate amount of SO2 into the stratosphere, producing a pronounced and persistent sulfate aerosol layer centered around the mid-stratosphere, mostly confined to Southern Hemisphere (SH) tropics. These aerosols affect the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals of sea surface temperature (SST) where negative biases reached -0.3 K and an annual mean of -0.1 K north of 40 & DEG;S in the SH. The spatial and temporal evolutions of MODIS SST anomalies are presented. Radiative transfer simulations demonstrate the aerosol effect on MODIS SST retrievals by causing an additional brightness temperature (BT) deficit at 11 & mu;m and a reduction in BT differences since the characteristic of spectral attenuation between 11 and 12 & mu;m is opposite to that of H2O. A correction for HTHH aerosol effects in the retrieval algorithm is therefore desirable.

TI  - Abundance considerations for modeling yield of rapeseed at the flowering stage
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionTo stabilize the edible oil market, it is necessary to determine the oil yield in advance, so the accurate and fast technology of estimating rapeseed yield is of great significance in agricultural production activities. Due to the long flowering time of rapeseed and the characteristics of petal color that are obviously different from other crops, the flowering period can be carefully considered in crop classification and yield estimation. MethodsA field experiment was conducted to obtain the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral images. Field measurements consisted of the reflectance of flowers, leaves, and soils at the flowering stage and rapeseed yield at physiological maturity. Moreover, GF-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images were collected to compare the applicability of yield estimation methods. The abundance of different organs of rapeseed was extracted by the spectral mixture analysis (SMA) technology, which was multiplied by vegetation indices (VIs) respectively to estimate the yield. ResultsFor the UAV-scale, the product of VIs and leaf abundance (AbdLF) was closely related to rapeseed yield, which was better than the VIs models for yield estimation, with the coefficient of determination (R2) above 0.78. The yield estimation models of the product of normalized difference yellowness index (NDYI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and AbdLF had the highest accuracy, with the coefficients of variation (CVs) below 10%. For the satellite scale, most of the estimation models of the product of VIs and rapeseed AbdLF were also improved compared with the VIs models. The yield estimation models of the product of AbdLF and renormalized difference VI (RDVI) and EVI (RDVIxAbdLF and EVIxAbdLF) had the steady improvement, with CVs below 13.1%. Furthermore, the yield estimation models of the product of AbdLF and normalized difference VI (NDVI), visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI), RDVI, and EVI had consistent performance at both UAV and satellite scales. DiscussionThe results showed that considering SMA could improve the limitation of using only VIs to retrieve rapeseed yield at the flowering stage. Our results indicate that the abundance of rapeseed leaves can be a potential indicator of yield prediction during the flowering stage.

T2  - NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Satellite data are frequently attached to discourses of infallibility, objectivity and omnipresence. Yet the value of satellite data in everyday society largely depends on the strength of our interpretations, interpretations which are easily misled. Satellite images can be fabricated, misread and restricted, yet companies like Google encourage users to see themselves as active agents in a collaborative process of accumulating data, obscuring users' true relations with satellite technology and giving them a false sense of power and anonymity. In this sense, satellites constitute a new unconscious terrain of perception. For Geert Lovink, we have reached an age where we can 'read satellites as metaphors, as a new type of technological mirror' and as 'an unconscious apparatus'. This article argues that our lack of conscious awareness around the presence, nature and infrastructure of satellites allows them to thrive under the radar as a new species of unconscious surveillance technology.

TI  - Incidence of inguinofemoral lymph node metastases at the first local recurrence of vulvar cancer: a Dutch nationwide study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundUp to 40% of vulvar cancer patients present with local recurrence within 10 years of follow-up. An inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) is indicated if not performed at primary treatment. The incidence and risk factors for lymph node metastases (LNM) at first local recurrence, however, are unclear. Our aim was to determine the incidence of LNM at first local recurrence, in relation to previous groin treatment and clinicopathological factors.MethodsA multicenter cohort study including vulvar cancer patients with a first macroinvasive local recurrence after primary surgical treatment between 2000 and 2015 was conducted in the Netherlands. Groin status at local recurrence was defined as positive (N+), negative (N-) or unknown (N?) and based on histology, imaging and follow-up. Patient-, tumour- and treatment characteristics of primary and recurrent disease were analysed.ResultsOverall, 16.3% (66/404) had a N+groin status at first local recurrence, 66.4% (268/404) N- and 17.3% (70/404) N?groin status. The incidence of a N+groin status was comparable after previous SLN and IFL, 11.5% and 13.8%, respectively. A N+ groin status was related to tumour size (25 vs.12 mm; P < 0.001), depth of invasion (5 vs. 3 mm; P < 0.001) and poorly differentiated tumours (22.9 vs. 11.9%; P = 0.050) at local recurrence.ConclusionsThe incidence of LNM at first local recurrence in vulvar cancer patients was 16.3%, and independent of previous type of groin surgery. In accordance with primary diagnosis, tumour size, depth of invasion, and tumour grade were significantly associated with a positive groin status.

AB  - This study sought to explore adult biracial individuals and their perceived racial identities and their own military dependent identities in military communities. Utilizing a social constructivist grounded theory methodology, the study participants consisted of 21 Black/White self-identifying biracial former military dependent children. Results show a core category, and two key categories were discovered from the analysis. The core category indicated that biopsychosocial and ecological factors across time influence biracial military identity development. These individuals have an intersecting and outsider identity that influences their community identity. The participants used different coping behaviors to ecological stressors they experienced that shaped their identity. The implications and recommendations for practice, training, and future research are discussed for this study.

TI  - Response of soil oxides in complex terrain region to environment revealed by hyperspectral observations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil oxides are important diagnostic indicators for soil quality assessment, and their content has a positive effect on adsorption of heavy metals, remediation of pollution, and enhancement of organic matter enrichment. Moreover, soil oxides are affected by multiple environmental factors such as soil pH, geomorphological, and elevation, and their distribution is highly regional. In this study, 421 ground soil samples and 2 hyperspectral satellite data were collected. The content distribution of 8 main oxides in soil, including SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, and Corg. were obtained according to the process of data preprocessing, spectral transformation, feature extraction, band combination, and model establishment. The results indicated that the homogenization spectral transformation method is the most suitable; The calculation accuracy of complex spectral characteristic parameters is inferior to that of characteristic bands; The difference model is more suitable for the extraction of soil oxide content in this study area; The average content of SiO2 and CaO shows a decreasing trend with the elevation increasing; The average content of SiO2 and Fe2O3 shows an upward trend with the increase of slope; East is the main geomorphic direction of soil oxide enrichment. SiO2, Al2O3, and MgO are the three soil oxides with the highest correlation. The response relationship between soil oxides, topography and pH is discussed, and the distribution rule of soil oxides and environmental determinants are obtained, which provides a set of technical schemes for digital soil research. This study can extract the content of soil components in a large area, analyze the causes, and provide a new technical scheme for soil investigation and treatment.

TI  - DNN-Based Retrieval of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration From GNSS-R and Its Effects on the Synoptic-Scale Forecasting as Supplementary Observation Source
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using delay-Doppler maps of Global Navigation Satellite Systems Reflectometry (GNSS-R) from the TechDemoSat-1 satellite and considering sea ice and ocean interaction, an innovative method for retrieval of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) based on a deep neural network is proposed. This retrieval method shows the potential of future GNSS-R applications for Arctic missions. Compared with SIC products from Hamburg University, the root mean square errors (RMSE) of retrieved results in March and June 2016 are 0.0284 and 0.0415, respectively. When the retrieved GNSS-R SIC data are added into the assimilation as supplementary passive microwave remote-sensing data, it has a positive influence on improving the accuracy of the Arctic SIC forecast. Especially in some edge regions of sea ice, when compared to only assimilating the remote-sensing data, the regional RMSE of joint assimilation has a maximum decrease of approximately 17% in the 24-hr forecast time, and over 5% in 72-hr.

AB  - There has been considerable interest in use of Miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) as a feedstock for bioenergy production due to its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with cellulosic feedstock production and more recently for alternative uses as a biomass crop. To date, data on Miscanthus production in the US has been based on small scale research plots due to the lack of commercial scale production fields. Research plot yields are often much higher than commercial fields for a variety of reasons including reduced spatial variability and location on better quality farmland. The objectives of this study were to quantify the inputs for production of Miscanthus at the commercial farm scale, evaluating methods to characterize fuel use for establishment and management of Miscanthus production and using satellite data to characterize spatial yield variation of production fields. We logged energy use on agricultural machinery from Miscanthus production planted on more than 1000 ha of land and modeled N2O emissions and changes in soil carbon using DayCent. Although fuel use was higher for land preparation in fields with perennial vegetation, fuel to harvest Miscanthus dominated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (>90%) from agriculture machinery for crop management. The N2O emissions and changes in soil carbon were the largest source and sink of GHG emissions associated with Miscanthus production, respectively. Although similar to 50% of the established lands had Miscanthus yields < 5 Mg/ha, yields needed to be > 5 Mg/ha for Delta SOC to be positive. Given the large impact of yield on Delta SOC, net GHG for Miscanthus production with yields of 5 to 25 Mg/ha ranged similar to 130 to -260 kg CO(2)e/Mg biomass. Use of both energy use for Miscanthus harvest and satellite imagery were good methods to characterize spatial variability of commercial production fields. This demonstrates the potential to use this within field yield data to better understand factors driving subfield yield variability and use of satellite data to quantify early yield predictions.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeElectromagnetic tracking (EMT) accuracy is affected by the presence of surrounding metallic materials. In this work, we propose measuring the magnetic field's variation due to distortion at a witness position to localise the instrument causing distortion based on a pre-trained model and without additional sensors attached to it. MethodsTwo experiments were performed to demonstrate possible applications of the technique proposed. In the first case, the distortion introduced by an ultrasound (US) probe was characterised and subsequently used to track the probe position on a line. In the second application, the measurement was used to estimate the distance of an interventional fluoroscopy C-arm machine and apply the correct compensation model. ResultsTracking of the US probe using the proposed method was demonstrated with millimetric accuracy. The distortion created by the C-arm caused errors in the order of centimetres, which were reduced to 1.52 mm RMS after compensation. ConclusionsThe distortion profile associated with medical equipment was pre-characterised and used in applications such as object tracking and error compensation map selection. In the current study, the movement was limited to one degree of freedom (1 DOF) and simple analytical functions were used to model the magnetic distortion. Future work will explore advanced AI models to extend the method to 6 DOF tracking using multiple witness sensors.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of pre-operative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in predicting axillary lymph node metastasis: variations in intrinsic subtypes, and strategy to improve negative predictive value-an analysis of 2473 invasive breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundThe value and utility of axillary lymph node (ALN) evaluation with MRI in breast cancer were not clear for various intrinsic subtypes. The aim of the current study is to test the potential of combining breast MRI and clinicopathologic factors to identify low-risk groups of ALN metastasis and improve diagnostic performance.Material and methodsPatients with primary operable invasive breast cancer with pre-operative breast MRI and post-operative pathologic reports were retrospectively collected from January 2009 to December 2021 in a single institute. The concordance of MRI and pathology of ALN status were determined, and also analyzed in different intrinsic subtypes. A stepwise strategy was designed to improve MRI-negative predictive value (NPV) on ALN metastasis.Results2473 patients were enrolled. The diagnostic performance of MRI in detecting metastatic ALN was significantly different between intrinsic subtypes (p = 0.007). Multivariate analysis identified tumor size and histologic type as independent predictive factors of ALN metastases. Patients with HER-2 (MRI tumor size & LE; 2 cm), or TNBC (MRI tumor size & LE; 2 cm) were found to have MRI-ALN-NPV higher than 90%, and these false cases were limited to low axillary tumor burden.ConclusionThe diagnostic performance of MRI to predict ALN metastasis varied according to the intrinsic subtype. Combined pre-operative clinicopathologic factors and intrinsic subtypes may increase ALN MRI NPV, and further identify some groups of patients with low risks of ALN metastasis, high NPV, and low burdens of axillary disease even in false-negative cases.

TI  - Autism and Post-Human: A Cyborgian Reading of Sabina Berman's <i>Me Who Dove into the Heart of the World</i>
T2  - CRITIQUE-STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY FICTION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The concept of "cyborg" in Donna Haraway's much-discussed "A Cyborg Manifesto" (1985) is outstanding in its depiction of the hybrid body that is untouched by long-standing polar dichotomy stemming from a hierarchal mode of thinking founded on prehistoric anthropocentricism: a worldview embedded mostly in western cultures which considers (normal(1)) human beings to be superior to nature and has often resulted in victimization of the so-called other. Haraway's cyborg is capable of "becoming" animal or machine and is, hence, better suited to the Posthuman world. Following in Haraway's footsteps, we intend to discuss that autistic people - labeled/stigmatized as intellectually disabled - are able bodies that share close affinities with animals, robots, nature, and environment. To this purpose, Sabina Berman's debut novel Me, Who Dove into the Heart of the World (2012)(2) is examined to help us draw an analogy between a cyborg figure and an autistic body to bring to light the necessity of inclusion of all as prescribed by Posthumanism.

TI  - Omentectomy for oncological surgical staging by transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES): a preliminary study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine the feasibility of performing omentectomy by transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) for surgical staging of ovarian and high-risk endometrial malignancies. MethodsThis descriptive study was realized in a non-university hospital in Switzerland. Eighteen patients with suspicious adnexal masses or high-risk endometrial cancer underwent surgical staging comprising infracolic omentectomy by vNOTES between May 2020 and April 2023. ResultsPatients underwent oncological surgical staging for suspicious adnexal masses in 14 cases (77.8%) and high-risk endometrial cancer in 4 cases (22.2%). vNOTES omentectomies were performed in all patients without complications. Associated procedures included salpingo-oophorectomy (94.4%), hysterectomy (55.6%), peritoneal biopsies (33.3%), pelvic sentinel lymph node biopsies (22.2%), and appendectomy (5.6%). The median time to perform omentectomies was 9 (4-13) min. All oncological staging were completed by vNOTES. No significant intraoperative complications occurred. We observed 1 case (5.6%) of postoperative fever probably associated with vaginal cuff infection (Clavien-Dindo grade II). ConclusionsThis study demonstrated the feasibility of performing vNOTES oncological staging requiring complex extrapelvic procedures such as infracolic omentectomy, supporting its potential role for managing gynecological malignancies such as ovarian and high-risk endometrial cancers. However, before expanding this approach outside study settings, strong evidence of its feasibility, practical benefits, and long-term oncological outcomes are needed.

TI  - Polar ionospheric currents and high temporal resolution geomagnetic field models
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating high resolution models of the Earth's core magnetic field and its time variation in the polar regions requires that one can adequately account for magnetic signals produced by polar ionospheric currents, which vary on a wide range of time and length scales. Limitations of existing ionospheric field models in the challenging polar regions can adversely affect core field models, which in turn has important implications for studies of the core flow dynamics in those regions. Here we implement a new approach to co-estimate a climatological model of the ionospheric field together with a model of the internal and magnetospheric fields within the CHAOS geomagnetic field modelling framework. The parametrization of the ionospheric field exploits non-orthogonal magnetic coordinates to efficiently account for the geometry of the Earth's magnetic field and scales linearly with external driving parameters related to the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field. Using this approach we derive a new geomagnetic field model from measurements of the magnetic field collected by low Earth orbit satellites, which in addition to the internal field provides estimates of the typical current system in the polar ionosphere and successfully accounts for previously unmodelled ionospheric signals in field model residuals. To resolve the ambiguity between the internal and ionospheric fields when using satellite data alone, we impose regularization. We find that the time derivative of the estimated internal field is less contaminated by the polar currents, which is mostly visible in the zonal and near-zonal terms at high spherical harmonic degrees. Distinctive patches of strong secular variation at the core-mantle boundary, which have important implications for core dynamics, persist. Relaxing the temporal regularization reveals annual oscillations, which could indicate remaining ionospheric field or related induced signals in the internal field model. Using principal component analysis we find that the annual oscillations mostly affect the zonal low-degree spherical harmonics of the internal field.

TI  - Diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound for sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer: an updated meta-analysis
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - PurposeThe status of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) is an important factor in determining the stage of breast cancer (BC) and the surgical procedure, and also a biomarker of the BC prognosis. This meta-analysis was performed to investigate the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for SLN metastasis.MethodsA systematic search was conducted for relevant articles published in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, OVID databases, and Cochrane Library from inception to March 2023. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio (PLR; NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curve to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of CEUS in SLN metastasis. Subgroup analysis was also performed to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity.ResultsA total of 12 studies with 1525 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity of CEUS in the diagnosis of SLN metastasis were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84-0.95) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.78-0.92). The PLR, NLR, and DOR were 6.51 (95% CI: 4.09-10.36), 0.11 (95% CI: 0.07-0.18), and 59.43 (95% CI: 33.27-106.17), respectively, and the area under the SROC curve was determined to be 0.95 (95%CI: 0.92-0.96), all showing excellent diagnostic value. In the subgroup analysis, percutaneous CEUS was more sensitive than intravenous CEUS in the diagnosis of SLN metastases (0.92 versus 0.82, p < 0.05).ConclusionCEUS, especially percutaneous CEUS, is a reliable imaging technique for diagnosing SLN metastasis and providing important information in the stage management of breast cancer.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Determining the terrain structure of the Earth, a dynamic planet, creating a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of some parts, and keeping them up to date, are basic necessities for human beings. In this research, DEMs produced using ascending (TRXASC) and descending (TRXDSC) orbit data pairs obtained from the current TerraSAR-X satellite data, and Terra World (TW) DEM (created with the help of data acquired by TanDEM-X), were subjected to point-based accuracy analysis. Standard deviations of the grid point elevation values were calculated using 43,750 digitally-produced grid points, within the study area (5.5x8.5 km2), using different statistical methods. For the accuracy analysis, a 5-metre resolution DEM, created from the aerial photogrammetry technique of the national authority, General Directorate of Mapping (HGM), was used as the DEM basemap. Grid points are also examined according to two basic classes (slope classes and CORINE classes). The deficiency of prior studies using CORINE classes in this context, the preference for segmented-multiple subclasses used for slope classes, and the re accuracy analysis of all statistical analyses, eliminating the gross error points, significantly contributed to the research with original findings.

TI  - Two-Eyed Seeing as a strategic dichotomy for decolonial nursing knowledge development and practice
T2  - NURSING INQUIRY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The profession of nursing has recognized the need for contextual and relational frameworks to inform knowledge development. Two-Eyed Seeing is a framework developed by Mi'kmaw Elders to respectfully engage with Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledges. Some scholars and practitioners, however, are concerned that Two-Eyed Seeing re-instantiates dichotomized notions regarding Western and Indigenous knowledges. As dichotomies and binaries are often viewed as polarizing devices for nursing knowledge development, this paper explores the local worldviews in which Two-Eyed Seeing emerged, proposing that the onto-epistemological and axiological 'roots' of the framework are antithetical to divisiveness, paradoxically asserting space for the dichotomy to stand. Two-Eyed Seeing, if understood as a relational, decolonial praxis, could fundamentally change the way nursing scholarship and practice operate by facilitating space for diverse knowledges, ways of being, doing and relating. In this paper, considerations for nursing scholarship and practice, as well as recommendations to support the uptake of Two-Eyed Seeing are explored. The authors assert that conceptual divisiveness, dichotomization and exclusion can be mitigated if nursing is informed by contextual knowledge, seeks to enact accountable partnerships with Indigenous knowledge holders, and holds the Mi'kmaq worldview upon which the concept developed in positive regard.

TI  - Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) Estimation and Algorithm Development in Northeast Arabian Sea Coastal Water
T2  - THALASSAS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In situ sampling and analysis for water quality and bio-optical parameters carried out in the northeast Arabian Sea, in Diu and Daman coastal waters during February and August 2021. The in situ water samples analysed to estimate chlorophyll, nutrients, Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) in the study area. The bio-optical parameters, normalized water leaving radiance (L-wn) and remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) retrieved with the operation of underwater hyperspectral radiometer (Satlantic/Wetlabs Inc). The objective of the study was to develop POC algorithm in coastal waters of northwest Arabian Sea, utilizing the datasets from sampled Gujarat coastal water stations and the use of underwater hyperspectral radiometer measured remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) data and in situ POC data covering different months and seasons, applying suitably optimal wavelengths-based algorithms and its finalization. In Diu, total 11 stations data collected and produced POC range (44-608 mg m(-3)). These 11 points POC data correlated with R-rs band ratios using 2nd order polynomial function and indicated coefficient of determination (R-2 values 0.37, 0.34 and 0.13). This correlation was also made using 3rd order polynomial fit and indicated R-2 values 0.41, 0.42 and 0.26. The same datasets were observed with 3-Dimensional correlation between R-rs(490/555), R-rs(443/555), R-rs(510/555) and POC using linear, paraboloid, gaussian and Lorentzian function fit, which showed improved R-2 values ranging 0.34 to 0.66. The data from Daman added to Diu data (total 18 points), which resulted with further better correlation (R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 9.12) with higher range of POC upto 2600 mg/m(3). This used multiple linear regression (MLR) between blue and green wavelength channels and band ratios (490, 510, 555, 490/555 and 510/555) derived POC versus the in situ POC data. The Modis-Aqua satellite derived POC data for our in situ stations for the sampling dates ranged 392-411 mg m(-3) as compared to our in situ data range 44-608 mg m(-3). Out of these different POC algorithms inter-comparison and linkage to satellite data, it observed mandatory to have regional POC algorithms with sufficient in situ data points. The coastal water productivity and its variability study is essential in terms of POC mapping and monitoring on monthly and seasonal time scales in regional scale due to the various fluxes, phytoplankton dynamics and sources from rivers, industries, upwelling and coastal ocean processes.

TI  - Ground subsidence associated with mining activity in the Ningdong coal base area, northwestern China revealed by InSAR time series analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ningdong coal base area located in northwestern China is one of the largest coal-producing bases in China. The aim of this work is to investigate a regional-scale mining subsidence over the Ningdong coal base area, by using both conventional and advanced Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) methods. Fifteen L-band SAR images from ALOS-2 satellite and 102 C-band images from Sentinel-1A satellite spanning between November 2014 and July 2019 were used for the analysis. To increase the spatial extent of the displacement signal because of decorrelated effects, we modified the traditional Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method to incorporate the coherence into the inverse problem, hereafter we call it coherence-based SBAS method. Instead of excluding decorrelated pixels present in the interferograms, we keep all the pixels in the time series analysis and down-weighted the decorrelated pixels with coherence. We performed the coherence-based SBAS method to both the two SAR datasets to obtain the subsidence rate maps and displacement time-series over the mining areas, and compared the results with that from the traditional stacking InSAR method. We evaluated the effectiveness of L-band and C-band DInSAR for monitoring mining subsidence by comparing differential interferograms and displacements derived from SBAS method between ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1A data. Compared to C-band, L-band SAR are less affected by phase aliasing due to large displacement gradients. The most significant subsidence was found at Maliantai mine with -264 mm/year detected by SBAS method from Sentinel-1 data. We validated the InSAR displacement accuracy by comparing both ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 results with 18 GPS stations above five active mining regions. The average RMSE between InSAR and GPS measurements is 28.4 mm for Sentinel-1 data and 21 mm for ALOS-2 data. Our results demonstrate that the combined exploitation of L-band and C-band SAR data through both conventional and advanced DInSAR methods could be crucial to monitor ground subsidence in mining areas, which provides insights into subsidence dynamics and determine the characteristic surface response to longwall advance.

TI  - Impact of analysis of the sentinel lymph node by one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) compared to conventional histopathology on axillary and systemic treatment: data from the Dutch nationwide cohort of breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe outcome of the sentinel lymph node in breast cancer patients affects adjuvant treatment. Compared to conventional histopathology, analysis by one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) harvests more micrometastasis, potentially inducing overtreatment. In this study we investigated the impact of OSNA analysis on adjuvant treatment, compared to histopathological analysis.MethodsData from T1-3 breast cancer patients with sentinel nodes analysed between January 2016 and December 2019 by OSNA (OSNA group, n = 1086) from Zuyderland Medical Centre, the Netherlands, were compared to concurrent data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NKR) where sentinel nodes were examined by histology (histology group, n = 35,143). Primary outcomes were micro- or macrometastasis, axillary treatments (axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or axillary radiotherapy (ART)), chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy. Statistics with Pearson Chi-square.ResultsIn the OSNA group more micrometastasis (14.9%) were detected compared to the histology group (7.9%, p < 0.001). No difference in axillary treatment between groups was detected (14.3 vs. 14.4%). In case of mastectomy and macrometastasis, ALND was preferred over ART in the OSNA group (14.9%) compared to the histology group (4.4%, p < 0.001). In cases of micrometastasis, no difference was seen. There was no difference in administration of adjuvant chemotherapy between groups. Endocrine treatment was administrated less often in the OSNA group compared to the histology group (45.8% vs. 50.8%, p < 0.002).ConclusionMore micrometastasis were detected by OSNA compared to histopathology, but no subsequent increase in adjuvant axillary and systematic treatment was noticed. When performing mastectomy and OSNA, there was a preference for ALND compared to ART.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to describe and explain (1) the hero figure and his worldview in the folktales 'The Legend of Sunan Kalijaga' and 'The Legend of Ki Ageng Pandanaran'; and (2) Sunan Kalijaga's struggle and patriotism in the two folktales. This research is an exploratory qualitative research. The data of this research were two folktales of Central Java and informants. Data collection techniques by analysing two folktales and notes on the results of interviews with informants. Data analysis was then employed in the interactive model. The results revealed that the hero figure in the two folktales was Sunan Kalijaga. Sunan Kalijaga faced deteriorating social conditions, that is, the condition of poor people and rulers who acted arbitrarily towards the people by collecting high tributes, who were extravagant, and who only focused on personal wealth and power. In the face of deteriorating social conditions, Sunan Kalijaga had a world view of Islamic religious humanism. Islamic religious humanism means humanising humans according to their role as abdullah and khalifah on earth. In addition, the Islamic struggle and patriotism of Sunan Kalijaga were shown in efforts to spread Islam as a rahmatan lil alamin [religion that aims to give universal love to fellow human beings and the universe and is opposed to violence against fellow humans and the universe] by emphasising tasawuf, makrifat and dakwah.Contribution: This study contributes to conveying the development of Islamic teachings in Indonesia, which were disseminated by Sunan Kalijaga as rahmatan lil alamin, not Islam that developed through methods and teachings of violence.

TI  - Design, Synthesis, and Bioassay for the Thiadiazole-Bridged Thioacetamide Compound as Cy-FBP/SBPase Inhibitors Based on Catalytic Mechanism Virtual Screening
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterialfructose-1,6-/sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (Cy-FBP/SBPase)was an important regulatory enzyme in cyanobacterial photosynthesisand was a potential target enzyme for screening to obtain novel inhibitorsagainst cyanobacterial blooms. In this study, we developed a novelpharmacophore screening model based on the catalytic mechanism andsubstrate structure of Cy-FBP/SBPase and screened 26 S series compounds with different structures and pharmacophore characteristicsfrom the Specs database by computer-assisted drug screening. Thesecompounds exhibited moderate inhibitory activity against Cy-FBP/SBPase,with 9 compounds inhibiting >50% at 100 & mu;M. Among them, compound S5 showed excellent inhibitory activity against both Cy-FBP/SBPaseand Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (IC50 = 6.7 & PLUSMN; 0.7 & mu;M and EC50 = 7.7 & PLUSMN;1.4 & mu;M). The binding mode of compound S5 to Cy-FBP/SBPasewas predicted using the molecular docking theory and validated bysentinel mutation and enzyme activity analysis. Physiochemical, genetranscription level, and metabolomic analyses showed that compound S5 significantly reduced the quantum yield of photosystemII and the maximum electron transfer rate, downregulated transcriptlevels of related genes encoding the Calvin cycle and photosystem,reduced the photosynthetic efficiency of cyanobacteria, thus inhibitedmetabolic pathways, such as the Calvin cycle and tricarboxylic acidcycle, and eventually achieved an efficient algicide. In addition,compound S5 had a high safety profile for human-derivedcells and zebrafish. In summary, the novel pharmacophore screeningmodel obtained from the current work provides an effective solutionto the cyanobacterial bloom problem.

TI  - The podocyte: glomerular sentinel at the crossroads of innate and adaptive immunity
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a common glomerular disorder that manifests clinically with the nephrotic syndrome and has a propensity to recur following kidney transplantation. The pathophysiology and therapies available to treat FSGS currently remain elusive. Since the podocyte appears to be the target of apparent circulating factor(s) that lead to recurrence of proteinuria following kidney transplantation, this article is focused on the podocyte. In the context of kidney transplantation, the performance of pre- and post-reperfusion biopsies, and the establishment of in vitro podocyte liquid biopsies/assays allow for the development of clinically relevant studies of podocyte biology. This has given insight into new pathways, involving novel targets in innate and adaptive immunity, such as SMPDL3b, cGAS-STING, and B7-1. Elegant experimental studies suggest that the successful clinical use of rituximab and abatacept, two immunomodulating agents, in our case series, may be due to direct effects on the podocyte, in addition to, or perhaps distinct from their immunosuppressive functions. Thus, tissue biomarker-directed therapy may provide a rational approach to validate the mechanism of disease and allow for the development of new therapeutics for FSGS. This report highlights recent progress in the field and emphasizes the importance of kidney transplantation and recurrent FSGS (rFSGS) as a platform for the study of primary FSGS.

TI  - A new sea ice concentration product in the polar regions derived from the FengYun-3 MWRI sensors
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Sea ice concentration (SIC) is the main geophysical variable for quantifying change in sea ice in the polar regions. A continuous SIC product is key to informing climate and ecosystem studies in the polar regions. Our study generates a new SIC product covering the Arctic and Antarctic from November 2010 to December 2019. It is the first long-term SIC product derived from the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) sensors on board the Chinese FengYun-3B, FengYun-3C, and FengYun-3D satellites, after a recent re-calibration of brightness temperature. We modified the previous Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study Sea Ice (ASI) dynamic tie point algorithm mainly by changing input brightness temperature and initial tie points. The MWRI-ASI SIC was compared to the existing ASI SIC products and validated using ship-based SIC observations. Results show that the MWRI-ASI SIC mostly coincides with the ASI SIC obtained from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager series sensors, with overall biases of - 1 +/- 2 % in the Arctic and 0.5 +/- 2 % in the Antarctic, respectively. The overall mean absolute deviation between the MWRI-ASI SIC and ship-based SIC is 16 % and 17 % in the Arctic and Antarctic, respectively, which is close to the existing ASI SIC products. The trend of sea ice extent (SIE) derived from the MWRI-ASI SIC closely agrees with the trends of the Sea Ice Index SIEs provided by the Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Therefore, the MWRI-ASI SIC is comparable with other SIC products and may be applied alternatively. The MWRI-ASI SIC dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.945188 (Chen et al., 2022b).

TI  - Intraoperative diagnosis of early lymphatic metastasis using neodymium-based rare-earth NIR-II fluorescence nanoprobe
T2  - NANOSCALE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The high mortality of breast cancer is closely related to lymph node (LN) metastasis. Sentinel LNs (SLNs) are the first station where tumor cells metastasize through the lymphatic system. As such, achieving precise diagnosis of the early metastatic status of SLNs during surgery is of paramount importance for precision therapy of breast cancer. While invasive SLNs biopsy is the gold standard for evaluating the status of SLNs, its use is often time-consuming and may increase the risk of operation. It is still challenging to develop a means for rapid SLN metastasis diagnosis. Herein, NaGdF4:5%Nd@NaLuF4 rare earth nanoparticles (Gd:Nd-RENPs) with near-infrared-II (NIR-II) fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) properties were fabricated. With the nanoprobe, metastatic SLNs and lymph vessels (LVs) rapidly brighten and can be observed by the NIR-II imaging system, which is totally different from normal LNs and LVs. The remarkable contrast observed via NIR-II imaging serves to swiftly delineate metastatic SLNs from normal ones, subsequently guiding precise surgical resection of metastatic LNs in just 10 minutes. Furthermore, the consistency between the results obtained via MRI and NIR-II imaging further validates the dependability of this nanoprobe as a diagnostic tool for metastatic SLNs. Additionally, the Gd:Nd-RENPs exhibited good biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated the advantages and prospects of NIR-II imaging for intraoperative early SLN metastasis assessment and shed light on the potential of the dual-modal Gd:Nd-RENPs as a nanoprobe.

TI  - Efficacy and safety comparison between axillary lymph node dissection with no axillary surgery in patients with sentinel node-positive breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThis systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to study the evidence on the efficacy and safety of omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for patients with clinically node-negative but sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive breast cancer using all the available evidence.MethodsThe Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Library databases were searched through February 25, 2023. Original trials that compared only the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with ALND as the control group for patients with clinically node-negative but SLN-positive breast cancer were included. The primary outcomes were axillary recurrence rate, total recurrence rate, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Meta-analyses were performed to compare the odds ratio (OR) in rates and the hazard ratios (HR) in time-to-event outcomes between both interventions. Based on different study designs, tools in the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool were used for randomized trials and the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions to assess the risk of bias for each included article. Funnel plots and Egger's test were used for the publication's bias assessment.ResultsIn total, 30 reports from 26 studies were included in the systematic review (9 reports of RCTs, 21 reports of retrospective cohort studies). According to our analysis, omitting ALND in patients with clinically node-negative but SLN-positive breast cancer had a similar axillary recurrence rate (OR = 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76-1.20), DFS (HR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.89-1.16), and OS (HR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.92-1.03), but caused a significantly lower incidence of adverse events and benefited in locoregional recurrence rate (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59-0.97) compared with ALND.ConclusionFor patients with clinically node-negative but SLN-positive breast cancer (no matter the number of the positive SLN), this review showed that SLNB alone had a similar axillary recurrence rate, DFS, and OS, but caused a significantly lower incidence of adverse events and showed a benefit for the locoregional recurrence compared with ALND. An OS benefit was found in the Macro subset that used SLNB alone versus complete ALND. Therefore, omitting ALND is feasible in this setting.

AB  - Advances in our understanding of melanoma biology and the role of immune checkpoint blockade and targeted therapy have ushered in a new and rapidly evolving era of multidisciplinary care for patients with melanoma. Based on efficacy for patients with metastatic melanoma, these systemic treatment approaches have been introduced into the adjuvant and, more recently, the neoadjuvant landscape. This report highlights the results of key clinical studies published or initially presented in 2021 that have informed our evidence-based approach to melanoma multidisciplinary care, primarily related to adjuvant and neoadjuvant approaches for patients with resectable or resected stage III or high-risk stage II melanoma and their impact on clinical care. Knowledge concerning these areas of active clinical investigation is critical for surgical oncologists who care for melanoma patients as the treatment landscape continues to evolve.

TI  - Reconstructing runoff components and glacier mass balance with climate change: Niyang river basin, southeastern Tibetan plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau (TP), one of the regions with the largest glacier distribution on the plateau, has been experiencing a significant loss in glacier mass balance (GMB) in recent decades due to climate warming. In this study, we used the Spatial Processes in Hydrology (SPHY) model and satellite data from LANDSAT to reconstruct the runoff components and glacier mass balance in the Niyang River basin (NRB). The measured river discharge data in the basin during 2000-2008 were used for model calibration and validation. Then, the validated model was applied to reconstruct the runoff components and GMB in the Niyang River basin for the period 1969-2013. Results showed that rainfall runoff (67%) was the dominant contributor to total runoff, followed by snowmelt runoff (14%), glacier melt runoff (10%), and baseflow (9%). The NRB experienced a severe loss in GMB, with a mean value of -1.26 m w. e./a (corresponding to a cumulative glacier mass loss of -56.72 m w. e.) during 1969-2013. During periods I (1969-1983), II (1984-1998), and III (1999-2013) glacier mass loss was simulated at rates of -1.27 m w. e./a, -1.18 m w. e./a, and -1.33 m w. e./a, respectively. The annual loss of glacier mass in the northern region of the NRB (-1.43 m w. e./a) was significantly greater than that of the southern region (-0.53 m w. e./a) from 1969 to 2013, largely due to temperature variations, especially in summer months. These findings enhance our understanding of how different hydrological processes respond to climate change and provide a potential method to study runoff components and GMB in other glacierized catchments worldwide.

TI  - Relation of land surface temperature with different vegetation indices using multi-temporal remote sensing data in Sahiwal region, Pakistan
T2  - GEOSCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Letter
AB  - At the global and regional scales, green vegetation cover has the ability to affect the climate and land surface fluxes. Climate is an important factor which plays an important role in vegetation cover. This research aimed to study the changes in land cover and relation of different vegetation indices with temperature using multi-temporal satellite data in Sahiwal region, Pakistan. Supervised classification method (maximum likelihood algorithm) was used to achieve the land cover classification based on ground-truthing. Our research denoted that during the last 24 years, almost 24,773.1 ha (2.43%) of vegetation area has been converted to roads and built-up areas. The built-up area increased in coverage from 43,255.54 ha (4.24%) from 1998 to 2022 in study area. Average land surface temperature (LST) values were calculated at 16.6 degrees C and 35.15 degrees C for winter and summer season, respectively. In Sahiwal region, the average RVI, DVI, TVI, EVI, NDVI and SAVI values were noted as 0.19, 0.21, 0.26, 0.28, 0.30 and 0.25 respectively. For vegetation indices and LST relation, statistical linear regression analysis indicated that kappa coefficient values were R-2 = 0.79 for RVI, 0.75 for DVI, 0.78 for DVI, 0.81 for EVI, 0.83 for NDVI and 0.80 for SAVI related with LST. The remote sensing (RS) technology can be used to monitor changes in vegetation indices values over time, providing valuable information for sustainable land use management. Even though the findings on land cover provide significant references for reasoned and optimal use of land resources through policy implications.

AB  - One of today's most important environmental problems is air pollution augmentation. Air pollution is getting worse over time and hurts human health. For the current study, various polar orbiting satellites were utilized to collect data on PM2.5, SO2, AOD, CO, and ozone over Pakistan between January 2005 and December 2021. According to the spatial distribution results, these characteristics have high values throughout central Punjab, western Baluchistan, central Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The seasonal variation in PM2.5, SO2, AOD, CO, and ozone was calculated using monthly data. The greatest value for PM2.5 is 8.7 x 10(-8) kg/m(3) during the monsoon season, while the highest value for SO2 is 1.4 x 10(-5) kg/m(2) during the winter. Over Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, KPK, and Gilgit, AOD was between 0.7 and > 1.0, CO was 127.2 ppb, and ozone was 330.7 DU. Furthermore, we create correlation maps of AOD, CO, SO2, PM2.5, and ozone and evaluate their relationship of high and low values across Pakistan. We looked into the 0.99 correlation between AOD and PM2.5, the strongest ever recorded. Despite this, we look at time series graphs to show the rising and falling pattern of these parameters from January 2005 to December 2021. We also used tables to determine the relative change in Multan, Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, Quetta, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Hyderabad, Gujranwala, and Abbottabad in Pakistan from January 2005 to December 2021.

AB  - Present study was related to the study of landslide hazards of Lower Kosi Watershed, Central Himalaya. The study was aimed at identifying the relation of natural and man-induced factors to the incidences of landslides in the Himalayan territory. The computation of landslide frequency ratio (FR) and density ratio (DR) was accomplished through numerical examination. 1 is a standard value of FR and DR. Therefore, ratio values above 1 and below 1 denote a strong and poor relationship between landslides and the given factors, respectively. The variables which were strongly associated with landslide occurrences were observed in Bhatwari-Barakot Formation; 'steep' slope (>40 & DEG;); 'high hills' (geomorphic unit); 'high' lineament density (>2.5 km/km(2)); 'very high' drainage density (>6 km stream length/km(2)); 'high' stream frequency (12-16 stream/km(2)); 'very high' dissection index (>0.29); 'very high' relative relief zones (>600 m); slope aspect - 'east facing' on one hand and the land use category - 'fallow land' on the other. The outcomes of the research study provide scientific data on natural and man-induced factors characterizing landslide occurrences in the watershed. Present method based on the relationship between natural factors and man-induced factors with landslide occurrences may contribute to intensive landslide hazards mapping and further land use planning of the region.

TI  - New landscape-perspective exploration of Moso bamboo forests under on/off-year phenomena and human activities
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - On-year and off-year phenomena is an unique spatiotemporal characteristics of Moso bamboo forests (MBFs), the combination of multiple sources data to assess the impact of on-/off-year phenomena and human activities is a new perspective to better understand MBFs. There is an urgent need to explore how to characterize the spatial variability of MBFs, whether there is a pattern in the spatial distribution of MBFs boundary lines, and whether the causes of the boundary lines are directly related to human activities. In this paper, Anji County, with a large MBF area, was selected as the study area. Based on Sentinel-2 time-series data, topography and impermeability data, the on-year/off-year status and boundary lines of MBFs were determined, and the Integrated Moso bamboo On-off year Differentiation Index (IMODI) was proposed to evaluate spatial differentiation. Spatial heterogeneity, the shape pattern of boundary lines, and the impact of human activities on the MBFs were quantitatively analyzed, and 631.5 km(2) of MBFs and 140 on-off boundaries were accurately obtained. The on-year and off-year MBFs and boundaries were mainly distributed in mountainous areas, especially at elevations of 100-400 m and on slopes of 10-35 & DEG;. The patterns in elevation can be categorized as stable, single-change, ascending-descending and descending-ascending patterns. The patterns in slope can be summarized as stable, single-change, and trapezoidal patterns. The newly proposed IMODI shows the best performance in reflecting the spatial differentiation of MBFs, and the on-year and off-year phenomenon of MBFs was closely related to human activities because the boundary lines were mostly concentrated within 2 km of villages. The results of this paper provide a new perspective to understand landscape of MBFs and the integrated management of carbon sequestration and sinks.

TI  - Spatial compactness and carbon emission: Nighttime light satellite-based exposure assessment
T2  - REGIONAL SCIENCE POLICY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Scholars of urban sustainability are increasingly interested in the influence of spatial configuration on local environmental performance, with a focus on urban compactness. Spatial compactness with urban density boosts energy-efficient construction and infrastructure, subsequently encouraging lower carbon emissions. In this study, we first documented the distributional pattern of spatial compactness in the prefectures of Japan using refined measurement and nighttime light satellite data, which is a more consistent indicator of economic activities. Further, we investigate the underlying impact of this compactness on the local carbon emission intensity with quantitative evidence. The regression results indicate that higher compactness in a prefecture corresponds to lower carbon intensity even in different settings. Moreover, robustness checks verify the consistency of the abatement effects. Additionally, the mitigating role of compactness presents a heterogeneous pattern across sectors. The effect is statistically significant only in the manufacturing and household sectors. These findings add to the value of urban compactness and offer important policy implications for addressing sustainable societies in the long term.

TI  - The potential of the Crystal Cam handheld gamma-camera for preoperative and intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization in early-stage oral cancer

M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeEvaluating the Crystal Cam handheld gamma-camera for preoperative and intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) localization in early-stage oral cancer.MethodsThe handheld gamma-camera was used complementary to conventional gamma-probe guidance for intraoperative SLN localization in 53 early-stage oral cancer patients undergoing SLN biopsy. In 36 of these patients, a blinded comparison was made between preoperative handheld gamma-camera and lymphoscintigraphy outcomes. Of those, the reliability for marking the SLN's location using both handheld gamma-camera and a Co-57-penpoint marker was evaluated in 15 patients.ResultsIn the entire cohort, the handheld gamma-camera preoperatively detected 116/122 (95%) of SLNs identified by lymphoscintigraphy. In those patients where the observer was blinded for lymphoscintigraphy (n = 36), 71/77 (92%) SLNs were correctly identified by handheld gamma-camera. Overlooked SLNs by handheld gamma-camera were mainly located near the injection site. The SLN's marked location by handheld gamma-camera and Co-57-penpoint marker was considered accurate in 42/43 (98%) SLNs. The intraoperative use of the handheld gamma-camera led to the extirpation of 16 additional 'hot' lymph nodes in 14 patients, 4 of which harbored metastases, and prevented 2 patients (4%) from being erroneously staged negative for nodal metastasis. In those with follow-up & GE; 24 months or false-negative outcomes < 24 months following SLNB, a sensitivity of 82% and negative predictive value of 93% was obtained.ConclusionThe Crystal Cam handheld gamma-camera offers reliable preoperative and intraoperative SLN localization and might reduce the risk of missing a malignant SLN during surgery. Detecting SLNs near the injection site by handheld gamma-camera remains challenging.

TI  - Uncovering spatiotemporal pattern of floods with Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar in major rice-growing river basins of Tanzania
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Tanzania, 71% of rice is grown in a rainfed lowland rice production ecosystem, primarily in river basins where extreme weather events like floods are frequent. For a six-year period (2017-2022), flood mapping was conducted using Sentinel-1 data in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, utilizing change detection and thresholding methodology. In addition to flood mapping, land use and land cover (LULC) were also analyzed using Sentinel-2 data in GEE, employing the Random Forest (RF) algorithm for classification. The aim was to understand the spatiotemporal extent of floods in two study locations. The resulting flood maps achieved an overall accuracy (OA) greater than 90% for all sites and study years. The findings revealed that agricultural land was the predominant land use/cover in both sub-basins, and floods were widespread in both regions. The study highlighted the interannual variability in flood extent, both spatially and temporally. Specifically, at the Ikwiriri site, floods were more extensive in 2020, covering 54.95% of the cultivated area, while in 2017, the minimum flood extent occurred, affecting 14% of the cultivated area. Similarly, at the Mngeta site, extensive floods were observed in 2020, with floods impacting 5.53% of the cultivated areas, while lower flood extents were observed in 2017, affecting 1.49% of the cultivated areas. Furthermore, the study demonstrated distinct spatiotemporal patterns of floods in both locations, with areas in proximity to rivers and wetlands experiencing more frequent floods. The research showcased the capabilities of the GEE cloud computation platform for flood inundation mapping, emphasizing its potential for enhancing our understanding of rice-producing environments. The generated flood maps can be utilized to guide the selection of areas for trials of flood-tolerant rice varieties and the dissemination of technologies such as flood-tolerant rice varieties, contributing to the resilience of rice farmers in these two floodplains.

TI  - Identifying the operational status of container terminals from high-resolution nighttime-light satellite image for global supply chain network optimization
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Container terminals are cargo gateways in the global maritime supply chain network. Major container terminals generally operate throughout the year, but do not operate at night, when container vessels are not calling at ports, or when there is no need to handle containers. Terminal congestion can delay containers' shipping schedules, which impacts the supply chain network. To optimize global logistics, it is therefore important to understand fully the daily operational status of container terminals. A vessels' automatic identification system data are not sufficient to determine whether containers are being handled in container terminals at night. Remote sensing, especially nighttime-light (NTL) imagery, might solve this problem. Recently, high-resolution images for the CE-SAT-IIB satellite with a pixel resolution of 5.1 m became available to observe NTL. This study assessed the operational status of container terminals based on satellite image taken at night. Eight terminals in the Port of Tokyo, Japan, were selected for the study. A Sentinel-2A image recorded during the day on 7 April 2021, and a CE-SAT-IIB image recorded during the night on 6 April 2021, were obtained. The digital numbers (DNs) of each red-, green-, and blue-(RGB) band image were analyzed, revealing that the red, green, and blue bands, in that order, had higher DNs in the Sentinel-2A daytime image and the CE-SAT-IIB NTL image at all terminals. One of the eight terminals had a low DN in the CE-SAT-IIB RGB image because its lights were off at the time the image was taken. The operational status of the terminals could be verified from the CE-SAT-IIB image by setting the DN threshold to the green or red bands. We also found that the CE-SAT-IIB image could distinguish white-light-emitting diode (LED) lamps from high-pressure sodium lamps based on color differences in the DNs of the RGB bands. If high-resolution NTL sensors were placed onboard microsatellites, a high-frequency observation constellation network could be constructed using a combination of NTL data and daytime images. This study showed the benefits and usefulness of NTL images of ports; the results will contribute to the overall optimization of the global maritime supply chain network.

TI  - Understanding the linkages between spatio-temporal urban land system changes and land surface temperature in Srinagar City, India, using image archives from Google Earth Engine
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land-use and land-cover (LULC) is an important component for sustainable natural resource management, and there are considerable impacts of the rapid anthropogenic LULC changes on environment, ecosystem services, and land surface processes. One of the significant adverse implications of the rapidly changing urban LULC is the increase in the Land Surface Temperature (LST) resulting in the urban heat island effect. In this study, we used a time series of Landsat satellite images from 1992 to 2020 in the Srinagar city of the Kashmir valley, North-western Himalaya, India to understand the linkages between LULC dynamics and LST, derived from the archived images using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Furthermore, the relationship between LST, urban heat island (UHI), and biophysical indices, i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), was also analysed. LULC change detection analysis from 1992 to 2020 revealed that the built-up area has increased significantly from 12% in 1992 to 40% in 2020, while the extent of water bodies has decreased from 6% in 1992 to 4% in 2020. The area under plantations has decreased from 26% in 1992 to 17% in 2020, and forests have decreased from 4 to 2% during the same period. Urban sprawl of Srinagar city has resulted in the depletion of natural land covers, modification of natural drainage, and loss of green and blue spaces over the past four decades. The study revealed that the maximum LST in the city has increased by 11 & DEG;C between 1992 and 2020. During the same period of time, the minimum LST in the city has increased by 5 & DEG;C, indicating the impact of urbanization on the city environment, which is reflected by the observed changes in various environmental indices. UHI impact in the city is quite evident with the maximum LST at the city centre having increased from 13.03 & DEG;C in 1992 to 22.01 & DEG;C in 2020. The findings shall serve as a vital source of knowledge for urban planners and decision-makers in developing sustainable urban environmental management strategies for Srinagar city.

TI  - High-resolution distribution maps of single-season rice in China from 2017to 2022
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy rice is the second-largest grain crop in China and plays an important role in ensuring global food security. However, there is no high-resolution map of rice covering all of China. This study developed a new rice-mapping method by combining optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in cloudy areas based on the time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method and produced distribution maps of single-season rice in 21 provincial administrative regions of China from 2017 to 2022 at a 10 or 20 m resolution. The accuracy was examined using 108 195 survey samples and county-level statistical data. On average, the user's, producer's, and overall accuracy values over all investigated provincial administrative regions were 73.08 %, 82.81 %, and 85.23 %, respectively. Compared with the statistical data from 2017 to 2019, the distribution maps explained 83 % of the spatial variation of county-level planting areas on average. The distribution maps can be obtained at (Shen et al., 2023).

TI  - From MASK-air and SILAM to CATALYSE (Climate Action to Advance HeaLthY Societies in Europe).
T2  - Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Plant species vary under different climate conditions and the distribution of pollen in the air and their trends can be used to assess the impact of climate change on public health. In 2015, MASK-air (Mobile Airways Sentinel networK for rhinitis and asthma) was launched as a project of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIP-on-AHA, DG Sante and DG CONNECT). This project aimed to develop a warning system to inform patients about the pollen season onset. SILAM (System for Integrated modeLling of Atmospheric composition), a global-to-meso-scale dispersion model was developed by the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI). It provides quantitative information on atmospheric pollution of anthropogenic and natural origins, particularly on allergenic pollens. POLLAR (Impact of Air Pollution on Asthma and Rhinitis, EIT Health) has combined MASK-air clinical data with SILAM forecasts. A new Horizon Europe grant, CATALYSE (Climate Action to Advance HeaLthY Societies in Europe; grant agreement number 101057131), which started in September 2022, aims at better understanding climate change and finding ways to counteract it. One objectives of this project is to develop early warning systems and predictive models to improve the effectiveness of adaptation strategies to climate change. One of warning system is focused on allergic rhinitis (CATALYSE Task 3.2). with a collaboration between the FMI (Finland), Porto University (Portugal), MASK-air SAS (France), ISGlobal (Spain), Hertie School (Germany) and the University of Zurich (Switzerland). It is to be implemented with the support of EAACI. This paper reports the planning of CATALYSE Task 3.2.

TI  - Evaluation of the CALIPSO Lidar-observed particulate backscattering coefficient on different spatiotemporal matchup scales
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite lidar-derived ocean particulate backscattering coefficient (b(bp)) has rarely been validated globally with in situ observations, and we need to understand how well the satellite CALIPSO lidar b(bp) approach performs. Whether lidar b(bp) performs better in terms of observation accuracy compared to passive ocean color remote sensing has yet to be evaluated for detailed validation. With the continued deployment of the BGC-Argo float array in the global open ocean in recent years, data have accumulated with a total of 42,932 particulate backscattering coefficients (b(bp)) from 2010 to 2017, allowing for a finer spatial and temporal scale evaluation of the performance of the CALIPSO lidar-observed b(bp). We evaluated the performance of CALIPSO-retrieved b(bp) products using the data detected by the BGC-Argo floats at 12 spatiotemporal matchup scales and discussed the differences in product performance at various interannual, seasonal, and spatial scales. We compare lidar, float, and ocean color b(bp) at the same locations and times and find that lidar b(bp) outperforms ocean color data. We also analyzed the key conversion factor & beta;(& pi;)/b(bp) at different spatial and temporal scales and found that there was a seasonal difference in the optimal conversion factor.

TI  - Flash flood-risk areas zoning using integration of decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory, GIS-based analytic network process and satellite-derived information
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing areas prone to flash floods is crucial for effective disaster management and mitigation. This study proposes a framework for mapping flood-prone areas by integrating geographic information system (GIS), remote sensing data, and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. The hybrid MCDM model combines the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) with GIS-based analytic network process (ANP) to evaluate flood vulnerability in Golestan province, Iran. Fourteen criteria related to flood potential, including elevation, slope, aspect, vegetation density, soil moisture, flow direction, river distance, rainfall and runoff, flow time, geomorphology, drainage density, soil type, lithology, and land use, were considered. In areas where official data was lacking, a questionnaire was administered to gather information from 15 specialists, experts, and 20 local managers. The relationships between criteria were analyzed using the DEMATEL method, and their weights were determined using the ANP method. Topography was found to have the greatest impact on flood risk, followed by the type of surface and vegetation cover. Hydrographic, soil and geology, climatic also influence flooding in the region. The study identified the northern and central parts of the study area being at higher risk of flooding compared to the southern part. Based on the flood intensity map, 68 villages (50% of all villages in the Qarasu watershed) with a population of approximately 83,595 were identified as at risk of flooding. The proposed GIS-DANP model provides a valuable tool for flood management and decision-making, aiding in risk reduction and minimizing casualties.

TI  - Hot dots - which nodes should be removed in sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma?
T2  - ACTA ONCOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a critical staging tool for melanoma patients. The optimal number of lymph nodes removed in SLNB remains unclear. In this study, we retrospectively analysed and tested different criteria for selecting sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) by radiotracer uptake and blue dye, and their impact on nodal staging. We also evaluated the association between SLN tumour burden and radiotracer uptake.MethodsThe study population consisted of melanoma patients undergoing SLNB. During the operation all radioactive and blue nodes were removed and sent for histopathological analysis. The ex vivo radioactive count and presence of blue dye of each node were recorded, and these were correlated with presence and size of metastasis in each SLN.ResultsAltogether 175 patients with clinically occult metastasis presented with one or more positive, i.e. metastatic, SLNs. The mean number of lymph nodes removed was 4.5, and the mean number of positive lymph nodes was 1.5 per patient. The most radioactive or hottest node was negative in 38 patients (22%). By removing the hottest node and all nodes with radioactivity >10% of the hottest node, 97% of patients would have been staged correctly. In five patients, metastasis was found solely in a SLN with radioactivity <10% of the hottest node. Of all 267 positive nodes removed, 125 (47%) contained blue dye. Patients with a negative hottest node were associated with lower SLN tumour burden.ConclusionsBy removing the hottest node and all nodes with radioactivity >10% of the hottest node, 97% of patients with SLN metastases are correctly staged with or without using blue dye.

TI  - Quantitative law and scenario-based forecasting of different land use expansion, based on reliability analysis in mountainous areas
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The continuous high-intensity and disorderly expansion of construction land in mountainous areas threatens city development; consequently, the scientific guidance of its sustainable development has become a research hotspot. This work aimed to develop a new theoretical framework for predicting land expansion. Based on DMSP/OLS-Landsat 7 data correction from 2000 to 2019, to ensure data reliability, this study quantitatively analysed the expansion law of land-use and land-cover (LULC) in Huayuan, a typical mountainous area in China. Based on the land expansion law, the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model was used to predict various types of LULCs in different scenarios. The results showed that (1) the reliability of LULC under multi-source spatio-temporal data correction reached more than 0.97. (2) The expansion law of industrial and mining land, urban living land, and traffic land is sprawl, while rural living land is enclaved and the expansion direction and intensity are obviously different. (3) The scale of land expansion in the natural-oriented scenario was significantly higher than that in the humanism-oriented scenario, with a higher value of 199.33 hm(2). This study expands the case study of land use analysis and prediction, and provides scientific guidance for different land expansion planning, which can avoid the mismatch and waste of land resources. Furthermore, it also deepens the exploration of LULC identification reliability method and enriches the theory of different land use prediction in mountainous areas.

TI  - Experience with intraoperative radiation therapy in an urban cancer center
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/objectiveIntra-operative radiation therapy (IORT) is a newer partial breast irradiation technique that has been well studied in 2 large randomized trials, the TARGIT-A and ELIOT trials. We initiated our IORT program in 2018 in the context of a registry trial, and aim to report our early results thus far.MethodsWe instituted an IORT practice using Intrabeam & REG; low energy 50kVp x-rays for selected breast cancer cases in 2018. Patients were enrolled on our institutional registry protocol which allowed for IORT in ER + patients with grade 1-2 DCIS & LE; 2.5 cm or invasive disease & LE; 3.5 cm in patients of at least 45 years of age.ResultsBetween January 2018 and December 2021, 181 patients with clinical stage 0-IIA ER + breast cancer were evaluated. One hundred sixty-seven patients ultimately received IORT to 172 sites. The majority of patients received IORT at the time of initial diagnosis and surgery (160/167; 95.8%). Re-excision post IORT occurred in 16/167 patients (9.6%) due to positive margins. Adjuvant RT to the whole breast +/- LN was ultimately given to 23/167 (13.8%) patients mainly due to positive sentinel LN found on final pathology (12/23; 52%); other reasons were close margins for DCIS (3/23; 13%), tumor size (3/23; 4.3%), and multifactorial (5/23; 17.4%). Five patients (3%) had post-operative complications of wound dehiscence. There were 3 local recurrences (1.6%) at a median follow-up of 27.9 months (range: 0.7- 54.8 months).ConclusionsIORT has been proven to be a safe and patient-centered form of local adjuvant RT for our population, in whom compliance with a longer course of external beam radiation can be an issue. Long term efficacy remains to be evaluated through continued follow up. In the era of COVID-19 and beyond, IORT has been an increasingly attractive option, as it greatly minimizes toxicities and patient visits to the clinic.

TI  - Foehn winds at Pine Island Glacier and their role in ice changes
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pine Island Glacier (PIG) has recently experienced increased ice loss that has mostly been attributed to basal melt and ocean ice dynamics. However, atmospheric forcing also plays a role in the ice mass budget, as besides lowerlatitude warm air intrusions, the steeply sloping terrain that surrounds the glacier promotes frequent Foehn winds. An investigation of 41 years of reanalysis data reveals that Foehn occurs more frequently from June to October, with Foehn episodes typically lasting about 5 to 9 h. An analysis of the surface mass balance indicated that their largest impact is on the surface sublimation, which is increased by about 1.43mm water equivalent (w.e.) per day with respect to noFoehn events. Blowing snow makes roughly the same contribution as snowfall, around 0.34-0.36mmw.e. d 1, but with the opposite sign. The melting rate is 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the surface sublimation rate. The negative phase of the Antarctic oscillation and the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode promote the occurrence of Foehn at PIG. A particularly strong event took place on 9-11 November 2011, when 10m winds speeds in excess of 20ms(- 1) led to downward sensible heat fluxes higher than 75Wm(-2) as they descended the mountainous terrain. Surface sublimation and blowing-snow sublimation dominated the surface mass balance, with magnitudes of up to 0.13mmw.e. h (-1). Satellite data indicated an hourly surface melting area exceeding 100 km(2). Our results stress the importance of the atmospheric forcing on the ice mass balance at PIG.

TI  - Is Choosing Wisely Wise for Lobular Carcinoma in Patients Over 70 Years of Age? A National Cancer Database Analysis of Sentinel Node Practice Patterns
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background. Controversy continues in the treatment of breast cancer in women over 70 years of age. In 2016, the Society of Surgical Oncology recommended against routine use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBx) as part of the 'Choosing Wisely Campaign'. This study examines the oncologic safety of avoidance of routine SLNBx in patients over 70 years of age with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC).Methods. The National Cancer Database was used to identify women with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and ILC diagnosed between 2012 and 2020. Clinical and pathological staging, axillary staging, surgery type, and lymph node positivity between patients with IDC or ILC were compared.Results. Among women with T1 tumors, 85,949 (79.6%) patients with IDC and 12,761 (81.5%) patients with ILC underwent SLNBx (p < 0.001). Among patients who underwent SLNBx, those with IDC were more likely to have positive nodes (n = 7535, 8.8%) than those with ILC (n = 1041, 8.2%; p = 0.02). During the time interval of interest, for both IDC and ILC patients, the rate of axillary lymph node dissection decreased and rates of SLNBx or no axillary staging increased. On multivariate analysis, ILC histology was associated with use of SLNBx, but without nodal positivity.Conclusion. A trend de-escalation of axillary staging was identified in this study, however the majority of patients meeting the 'Choosing Wisely' criteria are still undergoing SLNBx. No increased risk of nodal positivity was identified among patients with ILC, suggesting that surgeons can continue to choose wisely and limit the use of SLNBx in women over 70 years of age with T1 ILC tumors.

TI  - Evaluation of pigment distribution in contact lenses with iris patterns by multiprobe analysis methods
T2  - POLYMER JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Iris-patterned lenses have recently become popular in the field of soft contact lenses (SCLs), and SCLs are typical examples of an industrial application of gel materials. As these patterns can be printed using oxidized-metal-containing pigments, the oxidized metals may be exposed on the lens surface depending on the printing method, potentially accounting for various health hazards. To evaluate the state of the exposed oxidized metal on the lens surface, we analyzed the colored layer, mainly consisting of pigments, on the lens surface via multiple probing methods, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning TEM with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). Furthermore, we confirmed that the XAFS conversion electron yield (CEY) and fluorescence yield (FY) methods demonstrated high sensitivity toward revealing the existence of pigments. Thus, the use of a combination of XAFS CEY and FY methods can facilitate the effective distribution analysis of various elements in the interior of materials such as cosmetic CLs.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Particulate matter (PM2.5) pollutants are a significant health issue impacting human health. To monitor hourly PM2.5 data, ground-based and satellite data are essential. This work aims to improve the hourly PM2.5 model obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data over Northeastern Thailand in 2020. In addition, an innovative combination of MODIS was developed to fulfill all missing aerosol optical depth (AOD) data before being applied to the model. A Linear mixed-effects (LME) model was utilized, and a 10- fold cross-validation was addressed for validation. It was found that hourly PM2.5 data from the models gave R-2 > 0.70. Interestingly, PM2.5 data along the Mekong River area were higher than in the plain area. The finding can infer that the monsoon wind brings polluted air into the region. The results will help analyze air pollution-related health studies.

TI  - Atmospheric and oceanic responses to Super Typhoon Mangkhut in the South China Sea: a coupled CROCO-WRF simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The South China Sea (SCS) is the largest marginal sea in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, and it encounters frequent typhoons. The atmosphere and ocean will create significant thermal and dynamic responses during the intense disturbance caused by typhoons. However, these responses have not been thoroughly investigated owing to the complicated marine environment. According to the satellite data, the SCS Basin was observed to have a strong sea surface temperature (SST) response to Typhoon Mangkhut, resulting in widespread SST cooling. A coupled model was used to investigate the atmospheric and oceanic responses to Typhoon Mangkhut. Best-track data, satellite SST, and ARGO measurements show that the coupled WRF-CROCO simulation displays better track, intensity, SST, temperature, and salinity profiles than those of the WRF-only simulation. Results show that the typhoon induced rightward intensifications in wind speed, ocean current, and SST. The following are some remarkable atmosphere and ocean responses: (1) the SST below the inner-core region is cooled by 1 & DEG;C, resulting in a 37%-44% decrease in wet enthalpy, and the central pressure is increased by & SIM;9 hPa. Therefore, the changes in SST below the inner-core region of the SCS Basin have a significant impact on air-sea fluxes under high-wind conditions; (2) the ocean boundary layer analysis shows that near-inertial oscillations on the right side of the typhoon track and a strong inertial current up to & SIM;2.28 m/s in the upper ocean were observed, which resonated with the local wind and flow field on the right side and induced strong SST cooling; (3) a decrease in SST decreased the moist static energy of the typhoon boundary layer, thereby weakening the typhoon's intensity. The difference in equivalent potential temperature and sea surface pressure have a good correlation, indicating that the influence of moist static energy on typhoon intensity cannot be overlooked.

TI  - Evapotranspiration estimation using Surface Energy Balance Model and medium resolution satellite data: An operational approach for continuous monitoring
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring spatial and temporal trends of water use is of utmost importance to ensure water and food security in river basins that are challenged by water scarcity and climate change induced abnormal weather patterns. To quantify water consumption by the agriculture sector, continuous monitoring is required over different spatial scales ranging from field (< 1 ha) to basin. The demand driven requirement of covering large areas yet providing spatially distributed information makes the use of in-situ measurement devices unfeasible. Earth observation satellites and remote sensing techniques offer an effective alternative in estimating the consumptive use of water (Actual EvapoTranspiration (ETa) fluxes) by using periodic observations from the visible and infrared spectral region. Optical satellite data, however, is often hindered by noises due to cloud cover, cloud shadow, aerosols and other satellite related issues such as Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure in Landsat 7 breaking the continuity of temporal observations. These gaps have to be statistically filled in order to compute aggregated seasonal and annual estimates of ETa. In this paper, we introduce an approach to develop a gap-filled multi-year monthly ETa maps at medium spatial resolution of 30 m. The method includes two major steps: (i) estimation of ETa using the python based implementation of surface energy balance model called PySEBAL and (ii) temporal interpolation using Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) model followed by spline based spatial interpolation to fill the gaps over time and space. The approach is applied to a large endorheic Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) basin with a surface area of similar to 52,970 km(2) in Iran for the years 2013-2015 using Landsat 7 and 8 satellite data. The results show that the implemented gap filling approach could reconstruct the monthly ETa dynamics over different agriculture land use types, while retaining the high spatial variability. A comparison with a similar dataset from FAO WaPOR reported a very high correlation with R-2 of 0.93. The study demonstrates the applicability of this approach to a larger basin which is extendible and reproducible to other geographical areas.

TI  - Assessment of Outdoor Thermal Comfort Using Landsat 8 Imageries with Machine Learning Tools over a Metropolitan City of India
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Rapid urbanization causes potential changes in the urban landscape, resulting in significant changes in land surface temperature and outdoor thermal comfort. This urban growth has a detrimental impact on the health and comfort of residents. The comfort level experienced in any given region depends on various parameters, including atmospheric temperature, relative humidity, land use and land cover (LULC). In this study, we aim to examine the spatial variation of outdoor thermal comfort in the city of Hyderabad. To achieve this, we utilize medium-resolution Landsat 8 imageries along with in situ meteorological data. The classification of LULC is carried out using the maximum likelihood method. A machine learning tool known as Support Vector Machine (SVM) is implemented, with seven environmental indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), new built-up index (NBI), LST, brightness, greenness, and wetness to predict outdoor thermal comfort (THI). The study reveals significant variations in THI across different land covers. Barren lands exhibit the highest mean THI values (27.3), followed by built-up areas (26.9), vegetation (24.1), and water bodies (20.7). These findings indicate that barren and built-up areas are associated with higher levels of discomfort, while vegetated regions and water bodies provide more neutral to moderate comfort conditions. These results also highlight distinct spatial variations in THI across different regions of the city, demonstrating the influence of the urban landscape on outdoor thermal comfort. This research is vital for identifying specific areas within cities that require targeted mitigation strategies to enhance outdoor comfort.

T2  - PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Cure rates for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common childhood cancer have steadily improved over the past five decades. This is due to intensifying systemic therapy, recognizing and treating the central nervous system as a sanctuary site, and implementing modern risk stratification to deliver varying intensities of therapy based on age, presenting white blood count, sentinel somatic genetics, and therapy response. Recently, numerous Children's Oncology Group trials have demonstrated the lack of benefit of intensifying traditional chemotherapy, providing evidence that new approaches are needed to cure the patients for whom cure has been elusive. Distinguishing those who require intensive or novel therapeutic approaches from others who will be cured with minimal therapy is key for future trials. Incorporating new genomic biomarkers and more sensitive measures of minimal/measurable residual disease provide opportunities to achieve these goals.

TI  - What CloudSat cannot see: liquid water content profiles inferred from MODIS and CALIOP observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Single-layer nonprecipitating warm clouds are integral toEarth's climate, and accurate estimates of cloud liquid water content forthese clouds are critical for constraining cloud models and understandingclimate feedbacks. As the only cloud-sensitive radar currently in space,CloudSat provides very important cloud-profiling capabilities. However, asignificant fraction of clouds is missed by CloudSat because they areeither too thin or too close to the Earth's surface. We find that theCloudSat Radar-Visible Optical Depth Cloud Water Content Product, 2B-CWC-RVOD, misses about 73 % of nonprecipitating liquidcloudy pixels and about 63 % of total nonprecipitating liquid cloudwater content compared to coincident Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. Those percentagesincrease to 84 % and 69 %, respectively, if MODIS "partly cloudy"pixels are included. We develop a method, based on adiabatic parcel theorybut modified to account for the fact that observed clouds are oftensubadiabatic, to estimate profiles of cloud liquid water content based onMODIS observations of cloud-top effective radius and cloud optical depthcombined with lidar observations of cloud-top height. We find that, forcloudy pixels that are detected by CloudSat, the resulting subadiabaticprofiles of cloud water are similar to what is retrieved from CloudSat. Forcloudy pixels that are not detected by CloudSat, the subadiabatic profilescan be used to supplement the CloudSat profiles, recovering much of themissing cloud water and generating realistic-looking merged profiles ofcloud water. Adding this missing cloud water to the CWC-RVOD productincreases the mean cloud liquid water path by 228 % for single-layernonprecipitating warm clouds. This method will be included in a subsequentreprocessing of the 2B-CWC-RVOD algorithm.

TI  - The Impact of Obesity on Mortality and Complications in Posterior Retroperitoneoscopic Adrenalectomy
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Obesity is a global epidemic. It influences surgical technique, ergonomics, safety, and outcomes. However, there is a paucity of evidence of obesity-related impact in posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (PRA). This study compared perioperative outcomes of obese and non-obese participants undergoing PRA.Methodology This is a multi-center retrospective cohort study of elective PRA from March 2014 to December 2022. Patient demographics, surgical techniques, clinicopathological parameters, and outcomes, including overall complication rate, were analyzed using SPSS version 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).Results Seventy-five patients underwent a PRA, of which 97.3% were completed retroperitoneoscopically. The overall complication rate was (9.3%), and on subgroup analysis, the obese cohort had a lower percentage complication profile at 6.5%. Male participants comprised 52%, with a median age of 55 (IQR=19). The median BMI was 29.0 (IQR=8), of which 41% were obese, and 40% were overweight. Univariate analysis showed that being obese was not significantly associated with a higher complication rate (p=0.471). In addition, there was no significant increase in conversion (p=0.508), bleeding/transfusion (p=0.508), surgical site infection (SSI; p=1.000), incisional hernia (p=1.000), ICU or high dependency unit admission (p=0.292) and any-cause mortality (p=1.000). No sentinel deaths directly related to PRA were recorded. Procedure duration was longer in obese (117 mins) vs. non-obese participants (88.9 mins, p=0.022). However, there was no significant difference in the length-of-hospital stay (p=0.592). The cohort conversion rate was (2.7%), and tumor size was associated with a higher conversion rate (35.4 vs. 62.5mm, p=0.040).Conclusion Posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy can be a safe procedure in obese populations, and obesity does not increase perioperative morbidity or mortality.

AB  - BackgroundIndications for nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM) is extending to post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) setting. Eligibility for NSM with an optimum tumor-nipple distance (TND) after NAC is unclear. We examined predictive factors for nipple tumor involvement in patients undergoing total mastectomy following NAC.MethodsClinical and pathological data from prospectively collected medical records of women with invasive breast carcinoma, who were undergone NAC and total mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or axillary lymph node dissection were analyzed. PreNAC and postNAC magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) views were examined and a cut-off TND value for predicting the negative nipple tumor status was determined.ResultsAmong 180 women, the final mastectomy specimen analysis revealed that 12 (7%) had nipple involvement as invasive carcinoma. Patients with nipple involvement had more postNAC multifocal/multicentric tumors (p: 0.03), larger tumors on preNAC and postNAC images (p: 0.002 and p < 0.001), shorter median TNDs on preNAC and postNAC images (7 mm-IQR 1.5-14, p: 0.005 and 8.5 mm-IQR 3-15.5, p < 0.001, respectively), more nipple retraction on preNAC and postNAC images (p: 0.007 and p: 0.006) and more nipple areola complex skin thickening (> 2mm) on preNAC and postNAC images (p < 0.001 and p: 0.01). The best likelihood ratios (LR) belonged to the postNAC positivity of the < 20 mm TND, with a + LR of 3.40, and - LR of 0.11 for nipple involvement. PreNAC positivity of the ConclusionA TND-cut-off & GE; 2 cm on preNAC and postNAC MRI was shown to be highly predictive of negative nipple tumor involvement.

TI  - Thermal infrared dust optical depth and coarse-mode effective diameter over oceans retrieved from collocated MODIS and CALIOP observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we developed a novel algorithm based on the collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal infrared (TIR) observations and dust vertical profiles from the CloudAerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) to simultaneously retrieve dust aerosol optical depth at 10 mu m (DAOD(10 mu m)) and the coarse-mode dust effective diameter (D-eff) over global oceans. The accuracy of the D-eff retrieval is assessed by comparing the dust lognormal volume particle size distribution (PSD) corresponding to retrieved Deff with the in situ-measured dust PSDs from the AERosol Properties - Dust (AER-D), Saharan Mineral Dust Experiment (SAMUM-2), and Saharan Aerosol Long-Range Transport and Aerosol-CloudInteraction Experiment (SALTRACE) field campaigns through case studies. The new DAOD(10 mu m) retrievals were evaluated first through comparisons with the collocated DAOD(10.6 mu m) retrieved from the combined Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR) and CALIOP observations from our previous study (Zheng et al., 2022). The pixel-topixel comparison of the two DAOD retrievals indicates a good agreement (R similar to 0.7) and a significant reduction in (similar to 50 %) retrieval uncertainties largely thanks to the better constraint on dust size. In a climatological comparison, the seasonal and regional (2 degrees x 5 degrees) mean DAOD(10 mu m) retrievals based on our combined MODIS and CALIOP method are in good agreement with the two independent Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) products over three dust transport regions (i.e., North Atlantic (NA; R = 0.9), Indian Ocean (IO; R = 0.8) and North Pacific (NP; R = 0 .7)).Using the new retrievals from 2013 to 2017, we performed a climatological analysis of coarse-mode dust D-eff over global oceans. We found that dust D-eff over IO and NP is up to 20% smaller than that over NA. Over NA in summer, we found a similar to 50% reduction in the number of retrievals with D-eff > 5 mu m from 15 to 35 degrees W and a stable trend of D-eff average at 4.4 mu m from 35 degrees Wthroughout the Caribbean Sea (90 degrees W). Over NP in spring, only similar to 5% of retrieved pixels with D-eff > 5 mu m are found from 150 to 180ffi E, while the mean Deff remains stable at 4.0 mu m throughout eastern NP. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to retrieve both DAOD and coarse-mode dust particle size over global oceans for multiple years. This retrieval dataset provides insightful information for evaluating dust longwave radiative effects and coarse-mode dust particle size in models.

TI  - The impact of urban morphology on multiple ecological effects: Coupling relationships and collaborative optimization strategies
T2  - BUILDING SIMULATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban morphology significantly affects the ecological effects of urban heat islands, ventilation, and atmospheric pollution. Here, we reveal the mechanisms linking the ecological effects of urban morphology to develop a planning approach for the collaborative optimization of multiple ecological effects. Considering Shenyang, a cold city in northern China, as the study area, a multiple regression model of morphological parameters and ecological effects was established, and the impact of morphological parameters on ecological effects was explored. The results show that the aspect ratio of the streets, building density, and vegetation coverage are sensitive to multiple ecological effects. The inflection point of the ecological effect function curve occurs when the aspect ratio of the building and building density are 0.2 and 0.3, respectively. In addition, for optimal design applications in typical areas of the city, to obtain a Pareto-optimal urban morphology, Grasshopper is used to establish a parametric platform, wherein a genetic algorithm solves the multiple regression equation set. Ultimately, five ecological effect indicators are optimized and show 8.4%, 5.0%, 31.6%, 33.1%, and 12.5% improvement. The study effectively constructs a collaborative optimization planning and design method for multiple ecological effects.

TI  - Research progress, challenges, and prospects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration estimation using satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Satellite data are vital for understanding the large-scale spatial distribution of particulate matter (PM2.5) due to their low cost, wide coverage, and all-weather capability. Estimation of PM2.5 using satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) products is a popular method. In this paper, we review the PM2.5 estimation process based on satellite AOD data in terms of data sources (i.e., inversion algorithms, data sets, and interpolation methods), estimation models (i.e., statistical regression, chemical transport models, machine learning, and combinatorial analysis), and modeling validation (i.e., four types of cross-validation (CV) methods). We found that the accuracy of time-based CV is lower than others. We found significant differences in modeling accuracy between different seasons (p < 0.01) and different spatial resolutions (p < 0.01). We explain these phenomena in this article. Finally, we summarize the research process, present challenges, and future directions in this field. We opine that low-cost mobile devices combined with transfer learning or hybrid modeling offer research opportunities in areas with limited PM2.5 monitoring stations and historical PM2.5 estimation. These methods can be a good choice for air pollution estimation in developing countries. The purpose of this study is to provide a basic framework for future researchers to conduct relevant research, enabling them to understand current research progress and future research directions.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node detection in early-stage ovarian cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundA systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy remains the surgical standard management of early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer. Sentinel lymph node mapping is being investigated as an alternative procedure; however, data reporting sentinel lymph node performance are heterogeneous and limited. ObjectiveA systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy remains the surgical standard management of early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer. Sentinel lymph node mapping is being investigated as an alternative procedure; however, data reporting on the sentinel lymph node performance are heterogeneous and limited. This study aimed to evaluate the detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph node mapping in patients with early-stage ovarian cancer. MethodsA systematic search was conducted in Medline (through PubMed), Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. We included patients with clinical stage I-II ovarian cancer undergoing a sentinel lymph node biopsy and a pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy as a reference standard. We conducted a meta-analysis for the detection rates and measures of diagnostic accuracy and assessed the risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool. The study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with identifying number CRD42022351497. ResultsAfter duplicate removal, we identified 540 studies, 18 were assessed for eligibility, and nine studies including 113 patients were analyzed. The pooled detection rates were 93.3% per patient (95% CI 77.8% to 100%; I-2=74.3%, p<0.0001), and the sentinel lymph node technique correctly identified 11 of 12 patients with lymph node metastases, with a negative predictive value per patient of 100% (95% CI 97.6% to 100%; I-2=0%). The combination of indocyanine green and Tc-99m-albumin nanocolloid had the best detection rate (100% (95% CI 94% to 100%; I-2=0%)) when injected into the utero-ovarian and infundibulo-pelvic ligaments. ConclusionSentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage ovarian cancer showed a high detection rate and negative predictive value. The utero-ovarian and infundibulo-pelvic injection using the indocyanine green and technetium-99 combination could increase sentinel lymph node detection rates. However, given the limited quality of evidence and the small number of reports, results from ongoing trials are awaited before its implementation in routine clinical practice.

TI  - Combining species distribution models and moderate resolution satellite information to guide conservation programs for reticulated giraffe
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The conservation of threatened and rare species in remote areas often presents two challenges: there may be unknown populations that have not yet been documented and there is a need to identify suitable habitat to translocate individuals and help populations recover. This is the case of the reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata), a species of high conservation priority for which: (a) there may be unknown populations in remote areas, and (b) detailed maps of suitable habitat available within its range are lacking. We implemented a species distribution modeling (SDM) workflow in Google Earth Engine, combining GPS telemetry data of 31 reticulated giraffe with Landsat 8 OLI, Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar, and surface ruggedness layers to predict suitable habitat at 30-m spatial resolution across the potential range of the species. Models had high predictive power, with a mean AUC-PR of 0.88 (SD: 0.02; range: 0.86-0.91), mean sensitivity of 0.85 (SD: 0.04; range: 0.80-0.91), and mean precision was 0.81 (SD: 0.02; range: 0.79-0.83). Model predictions were also consistent with two independent validation datasets, with higher predicted suitable habitat values at known occurrence locations than at a random set of locations (P < 0.01). Our model predicted a total of 5519 km(2) of potentially suitable habitat in Kenya, 963 km(2) in Ethiopia, and 147 km(2) in Somalia. Our results indicate that is possible to combine moderate spatial resolution imagery with telemetry data to guide conservation programs of threatened terrestrial species. We provide a free web app where managers can visualize and interact with the 30 m resolution map to help guide future surveys to search for existing populations and to inform future reintroduction assessments. We present all analysis code as a framework that could be adapted for other species across the globe.

TI  - A Multicentre Clinical Trial Evaluating a Drop-in Gamma Probe for Minimally Invasive Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate Cancer.
T2  - European urology focus
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the safety and performance of a drop-in gamma probe for prostate cancer (PCa) sentinel lymph node biopsy (SeLNB) in a prospective, open-label, multicentre, single-arm clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: The main objective was to determine the sentinel lymph node (SeLN) detection rate with the drop-in gamma probe system. The secondary objectives were overall performance and safety.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: At three European centres, patients received an ultrasound-guided systemic and tumour-targeted injection of [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid followed by planar lymphoscintigraphy and/or single-photon emission computerised tomography. The next day, manual laparoscopic or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy was performed, including SeLN dissection (SeLND) and extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND).OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: SeLNs were detected with the drop-in probe and a rigid laparoscopic gamma probe (RLGP). The primary endpoint of the study was the SeLND rate defined as the percentage of patients with at least one SeLN detected in vivo by the drop-in probe. The secondary endpoints included diagnostic performance, ease of SeLN detection, number of SeLNs detected, and safety. The first two patients at each site (six in total) were used for familiarisation.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 27 patients were included in the main analysis. SENSEI successfully detected at least one SeLN in all 27 patients, resulting in a detection rate of 100% (95% confidence interval 87.2-100%). The total number of SeLNs identified with SENSEI was 85 (median three SeLNs per patient, range 1-6); of these 85 SeLNs, 12 were located outside of the ePLND template. In the nine patients in whom the RLGP was used, SENSEI detected two SeLNs that could not be detected with the RLGP due to manoeuvrability restrictions. Ten of the 27 patients were pN1; four patients had a false-negative SeLNB. No adverse events or complications were related to the use of the drop-in probe.CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that the drop-in gamma probe meets the performance and safety requirements for SeLNB in PCa. The device provided improved manoeuvrability and SeLN detection compared with the conventional RLGP.PATIENT SUMMARY: A novel device was tested for detecting sentinel lymph nodes during minimally invasive surgery for prostate cancer. In this first evaluation, the performance and safety of the device were evaluated positively.

T2  - Japanese journal of infectious diseases
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Sapovirus (SaV) and astrovirus (AstV) are important viral causes of acute gastroenteritis. From 2016 to 2019, 172 stool samples were collected from children with gastroenteritis in Kobe, Japan for sentinel surveillance of infectious gastroenteritis. In this study, we tested 53 of the 172 stool samples that tested negative for other enteric viruses to determine the prevalence of SaV and AstV. The samples were screened for SaV and AstV using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Positive samples were genotyped by sequencing and genetic analysis of partial regions of the capsid and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Of the 53 samples tested, 19 (35.8%) were positive for SaV, and three (5.7%) were positive for AstV. Of the total samples, 11.0% (19/172) and 1.7% (3/172) were positive for SaV and AstV, respectively. The most frequently detected genotype of SaV was GI.1, followed by GII.3. The AstV genotypes were MAstV1.1 and MAstV1.4. This study indicates that SaV and AstV are important causes of viral gastroenteritis in children.

TI  - Effectiveness of UAV-based DTM and satellite-based DEMs for local-level flood modeling in Jamuna floodplain
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Open-source, satellite-based digital elevation models (DEMs) are widely used for flood modeling. However, studies on effectiveness of these DEMs in depicting local-level flood processes are limited. This study generated a high-resolution digital terrain model (DTM) based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry and used in a two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model (HEC-RAS) to simulate the flood processes in a floodplain environment of the Jamuna River in northern Bangladesh. The effectiveness of a few satellite-based DEMs was also compared with this DTM by using the DEMs in the same hydrodynamic model. Field data for two flood seasons were collected to develop the model. The results indicate that the 2D model with UAV-based DTM provides the flood parameters, such as flood arrival time, depth, duration and extent, better than those from the satellite-based DEMs. Of the open-source DEMs, the FABDEM and the WorldDEM & TRADE; have the least errors and provide better results compared to the SRTM30, ALOS PALSAR, and ASTER DEMs. The UAV technique with ground control points and field measurements for the tree-canopy and water areas is very useful in generating a fit-for-purpose DTM. The findings of this study would be useful for terrain generation and DEM selection for local-level flood modeling elsewhere.

TI  - A Modified Cycle Slip Detection Method with GNSS Doppler Assistance and Optimizing by Adaptive Threshold and Sliding Polynomial Fitting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cycle slip determination plays an important role in high-precision data processing and application of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). The TurboEdit method consists of the Melbourne-Wubbena (MW) and the geometry-free phase (GF) combination. It can correctly detect and repair cycle slip in most cases. Cycle slip detection (CSD) with GF is disturbed by severe ionospheric delay variations; moreover, CSD or cycle slip repair (CSR) with the MW faces the risk of the disturbance from large pseudorange errors. Hence, cycle slip determination would be difficult under some extreme conditions, e.g., cycle slips occur in low altitude satellite, low sampling rate of dual-frequency observations. To overcome the limitations, a new dual-frequency CSD and CSR method is proposed. The main contents are as follows: (1) compared with the MW method, the Doppler-assisted phase subtraction pseudorange (DAPSP) method that we proposed has no detection blind spot and can effectively reduce the influence of pseudorange noise at high sampling rates; thus, we replace MW by the DAPSP method to improve the detection accuracy. (2) An adaptive threshold model with root mean square (RMS) is established to effectively reduce the missing and false range detection of cycle slip. (3) The sliding polynomial fitting-assisted GF (SPFAGF) is carried out according to the satellite altitude angle. The trend of ionospheric delay and residual multipath effect error between adjacent epochs is extracted and suppressed by SPFAGF. The method combined with DAPSP and SPFAGF (DAPSP-SPFAGF) overcomes the situation that the TurboEdit method cannot effectively detect under extreme conditions. The experimental results of Beidou dual-frequency observation data show that the TurboEdit method and the DAPSP-SPFAGF method can perform CSD and CSR in most cases. At the sampling rate of 1 s, the detection speed of DAPSP-SPFAGF method is significantly faster than TurboEdit method. The number of false positives about CSD is reduced from 68 to 0. At the sampling rate of 30 s and under the condition of the observed satellite altitude angle below 30 & DEG;, the false alarm rate of the DAPSP-SPFAGF method is 0, but the TurboEdit method's false alarm rate is 71.2%. So DAPSP-SPFAGF method is prior to the TurboEdit method at the high sampling rates or under extreme conditions, especially it can accurately detect and repair cycle slip and reduce the false positives and false alarm rate.

TI  - Early-season and refined mapping of winter wheat based on phenology algorithms - a case of Shandong, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat is one of the major food crops in China, and timely and effective early-season identification of winter wheat is crucial for crop yield estimation and food security. However, traditional winter wheat mapping is based on post-season identification, which has a lag and relies heavily on sample data. Early-season identification of winter wheat faces the main difficulties of weak remote sensing response of the vegetation signal at the early growth stage, difficulty of acquiring sample data on winter wheat in the current season in real time, interference of crops in the same period, and limited image resolution. In this study, an early-season refined mapping method with winter wheat phenology information as priori knowledge is developed based on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform by using Sentinel-2 time series data as the main data source; these data are automated and highly interpretable. The normalized differential phenology index (NDPI) is adopted to enhance the weak vegetation signal at the early growth stage of winter wheat, and two winter wheat phenology feature enhancement indices based on NDPI, namely, wheat phenology differential index (WPDI) and normalized differential wheat phenology index (NDWPI) are developed. To address the issue of " different objects with the same spectra characteristics" between winter wheat and garlic, a plastic mulched index (PMI) is established through quantitative spectral analysis based on the differences in early planting patterns between winter wheat and garlic. The identification accuracy of the method is 82.64% and 88.76% in the early overwintering and regreening periods, respectively, These results were consistent with official statistics (R2 = 0.96 and 0.98, respectively). Generalization analysis demonstrated the spatiotemporal transferability of the method across different years and regions. In conclusion, the proposed methodology can obtain highly precise spatial distribution and planting area information of winter wheat 4_6 months before harvest. It provides theoretical and methodological guidance for early crop identification and has good scientific research and application value.

TI  - Practical Approach to Establishing a Lymphedema Screening Program: Tips and Tricks
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of ReviewBreast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) affects approximately 1 in 5 women diagnosed with breast cancer. Improvements in overall survival cultivate a focus on breast cancer survivorship and quality of life. While personalized cancer care has allowed us to optimize oncologic outcomes and minimize treatment-related morbidity, treatments rendered for cancer cure continue to place our patients at risk for BCRL.Recent FindingsAlthough there is no definitive cure for BCRL, prospective screening has demonstrated lower rates of BCRL and lower rates of progression to late-stage disease. Prevention of late-stage BCRL in turn improves quality of life and results in overall cost advantage to patients and the health care system. Establishment of BCRL screening requires a multidisciplinary team approach. Understanding diagnostic tools and criteria for BCRL detection is imperative, and the development of an institutional protocol is essential for success.With continued advances in breast cancer outcomes, a focus on breast cancer survivorship must be fostered. Institution of BCRL screening is imperative to continue improving our patients' survivorship. We hope that education on the importance for BCRL screening, tools for detection and diagnosis, along with the impact of a multidisciplinary approach, can further advance BCRL detection, prevention, and treatment.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node sampling versus full lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer: a SEER database analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ObjectiveTo assess the long term outcomes and prognosis of sentinel lymph node sampling compared with full lymph node dissection in endometrial cancer patients. MethodsWe used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database for information on women diagnosed with endometrial cancer from 2010 to 2019. We conducted a comparison including overall survival between patients who had undergone sentinel lymph node sampling only and patients who had undergone formal lymph node dissection. Propensity score matching was performed according to the patient's age, type of endometrial cancer, grade and stage of disease, and adjuvant therapy. Subgroup analyses were performed according to type and grade of endometrial cancer. Results41411 endometrial cancer patients were identified through the database. After matching, 6019 patients each were included in the sentinel lymph node and lymph node dissection groups. Median (interquartile range (IQR)) follow-up time was 16 (7-31) months in both groups. One year survival rates were longer in the sentinel lymph node group compared with the lymph node dissection group (hazard ratio (HR) 1.61 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 2.21); p=0.004). Subgroups analysis according to grade of disease showed that 1 year survival rates were longer in the sentinel lymph node group in patients with endometrioid-type grade 1-2 endometrial cancer (HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.31 to 2.56); p=0.01), while no difference in survival was found between the sentinel lymph node and lymph node dissection groups in the subgroup of patients with high grade endometrial cancer (HR 1.40 (95%CI 0.94 to 2.24); p=0.17). In patients with low grade endometrial cancer included in the sentinel lymph node group, only 7% had lymph nodes positive for malignancy compared with 17% in the high grade group. ConclusionSurvival rates were not compromised in endometrial cancer patients undergoing sentinel lymph node sampling versus full lymph node dissection for all grades of disease.

TI  - Semi-automatic mapping of shallow landslides using free Sentinel-2 images and Google Earth Engine
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The global availability of Sentinel-2 data and the widespread coverage of cost-free and high-resolution images nowadays give opportunities to map, at a low cost, shallow landslides triggered by extreme events (e.g. rainfall, earthquakes). Rapid and low-cost shallow landslide mapping could improve damage estimations, susceptibility models and land management.This work presents a two-phase procedure to detect and map shallow landslides. The first is a semi-automatic methodology allowing for mapping potential shallow landslides (PLs) using Sentinel-2 images. The PL aims to detect the most affected areas and to focus on them an highresolution mapping and further investigations. We create a GIS-based and user-friendly methodology to extract PL based on pre- and post-event normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) variation and geomorphological filtering. In the second phase, the semi-automatic inventory was compared with a benchmark landslide inventory drawn on highresolution images. We also used Google Earth Engine scripts to extract the NDVI time series and to make a multi-temporal analysis.We apply this procedure to two study areas in NW Italy, hit in 2016 and 2019 by extreme rainfall events. The results show that the semi-automatic mapping based on Sentinel-2 allows for detecting the majority of shallow landslides larger than satellite ground pixel (100m2). PL density and distribution match well with the benchmark. However, the false positives (30% to 50% of cases) are challenging to filter, especially when they correspond to riverbank erosions or cultivated land.

TI  - Mapping deforestation and recovery of tropical montane forests of East Africa
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation poses a major threat to the tropical montane forest ecosystems of East Africa. Montane forests provide key and unique ecological and socio-economic benefits to the local communities and host diverse flora and fauna. There is evidence of ongoing deforestation and forest clearance in these montane forests although estimates diverge among different sources suggesting rates of 0.4%-3% yr(-1). Quantifying deforestation rates and forest disturbance is critical to design conservation and sustainable management policies for forest management. This study quantified the rate of deforestation and forest recovery over the last three decades for the Mau Forest Complex and Mount Elgon forests in Kenya and Uganda using Landsat time-series satellite imagery. With the analysis, classification accuracies of 86.2% and 90.5% (kappa 0.81 and 0.88) were achieved for the Mau Forest Complex and the Mt Elgon forests, respectively. 21.9% (88,493 ha) of the 404,660 ha of Mau forest was lost at an annual rate of -0.82% yr(-1) over the period between 1986 and 2017. More positively, 18.6% (75,438 ha) of the forest cover that was disturbed during the same period and is currently undergoing recovery. In Mt Elgon forest, 12.5% (27,201 ha) of 217,268 ha of the forest cover was lost to deforestation at an annual rate of -1.03% yr(-1) for the period between 1984-2017 and 27.2% (59,047 ha) of the forest cover disturbed is undergoing recovery. The analysis further demonstrated agriculture (both smallholder and commercial) was the main driver of forest cover loss in Mau forest, accounting for 81.5% (70,612 ha) of the deforestation, of which 13.2% was due to large scale and 68.3% was related to the smallholders. For the Mt Elgon forest, agriculture was also the main driver accounting for 63.2% (24,077 ha) of deforestation followed by the expansion of human settlements that contributed to 14.7% (5,597 ha) of forest loss. This study provides accurate and novel estimates of the rate of deforestation for the Mau forest complex and Mt Elgon forest ecosystems. These rates are higher than previously estimated and recent deforestation has been identified, which provides a quantitative basis for forest restoration programs and to design conservation policies.

TI  - Mapping, intensities and future prediction of land use/land cover dynamics using google earth engine and CA- artificial neural network model
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of land use/ land cover (LULC) dynamics has gained significant attention in the past decades. This is due to the role played by LULC change in assessing climate, various ecosystem functions, natural resource activities and livelihoods in general. In Gedaref landscape of Eastern Sudan, there is limited or no knowledge of LULC structure and size, degree of change, transition, intensity and future outlook. Therefore, the aims of the current study were to (1) evaluate LULC changes in the Gedaref state, Sudan for the past thirty years (1988-2018) using Landsat imageries and the random forest classifier, (2) determine the underlying dynamics that caused the changes in the landscape structure using intensity analysis, and (3) predict future LULC outlook for the years 2028 and 2048 using cellular automata-artificial neural network (CA-ANN). The results exhibited drastic LULC dynamics driven mainly by cropland and settlement expansions, which increased by 13.92% and 319.61%, respectively, between 1988 and 2018. In contrast, forest and grassland declined by 56.47% and 56.23%, respectively. Moreover, the study shows that the gains in cropland coverage in Gedaref state over the studied period were at the expense of grassland and forest acreage, whereas the gains in settlements partially targeted cropland. Future LULC predictions showed a slight increase in cropland area from 89.59% to 90.43% and a considerable decrease in forest area (0.47% to 0.41%) between 2018 and 2048. Our findings provide reliable information on LULC patterns in Gedaref region that could be used for designing land use and environmental conservation frameworks for monitoring crop produce and grassland condition. In addition, the result could help in managing other natural resources and mitigating landscape fragmentation and degradation.

TI  - Modelling swell propagation across the Pacific
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean wave swell generated in the vicinity of Campbell Island in the Southern Ocean is tracked along Great Circle paths across the Pacific Ocean. Data from a wave buoy at Campbell Island provides data on the directional spectrum in the generation region. The swell is measured at locations along a series of 19 Great Circle paths across the Pacific using Sentinel-1 SAR and CFOSAT satellite data. The WAVEWATCH III spectral wave model is used as a diagnostic tool to investigate the physical processes active in the swell propagation and decay. The results indicate that present day spectral wave models over-estimate the decay rate of swell. Although these models contain source terms to represent swell decay and negative wind input, these terms still largely remain tuning parameters. The data indicates that further research is required to adequately represent the observed magnitudes of the swell decay. In addition, the data show that currents have only a small impact on the observed swell decay and that islands can have a major impact. Such island impacts are poorly represented by spectral wave models.

TI  - Comparison of Outcomes between Surveillance Ultrasound and Completion Lymph Node Dissection in Children and Adolescents with Sentinel Lymph Node Positive Cutaneous Melanoma.
T2  - Annals of surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of nodal basin ultrasound surveillance (US) versus completion lymph node dissection (CLND) in children and adolescents with sentinel lymph node (SLN) positive melanoma.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Treatment for children and adolescents with melanoma are extrapolated from adult trials. However, there is increasing evidence that important clinical and biological differences exist between pediatric and adult melanoma.METHODS: Patients ≤18 years diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma between 2010-2020 from 14 pediatric hospitals were included. Data extracted included demographics, histopathology, nodal basin strategies, surveillance intervals, and survival information.RESULTS: Of 252 patients, 90.1% (n=227) underwent SLN biopsy (SLNB), 50.9% (n=115) had at least 1 positive node. 67 total patients underwent CLND with 97.0% (n=65/67) performed after a positive SLNB. In contrast, 46 total patients underwent US observation of nodal basins with 78.3% (n=36/46) of these occurring after positive SLNB. Younger patients were more likely to undergo US surveillance (median age 8.5 years) than CLND (median age 11.3 years; P=0.0103). Overall, 8.9% (n=21/235) experienced disease recurrence: 6 primary, 6 nodal, and 9 distant. There was no difference in recurrence (11.1% vs 18.8%; P=0.28) or death from disease (2.2% vs 9.7%; P=0.36) for those who underwent US vs CLND, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with cutaneous melanoma frequently have nodal metastases identified by SLN. Recurrence was more common among patients with thicker primary lesions and positive SLN. No significant differences in oncologic outcomes were observed with US surveillance and CLND following the identification of a positive SLN.

T2  - GAMES AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper demonstrates that through video game mechanics and internal narrative elements, Horizon Zero Dawn employs Greek mythology to encourage a perspective shift in the player who comes to inhabit the protagonist, Aloy's, worldview. While inhabiting Aloy, an outcast within her own storyworld, Horizon Zero Dawn subtly subscribes to the tenets of standpoint theory which privilege the perspective of the marginalized, and encourages the player to employ Lugones' "world"-traveling, a skill in which marginalized knowers particularly excel. Horizon Zero Dawn thus engages with Greek mythology and uses the connection that is built between player and avatar to encourage the transcendence of the player situation and to employ Lugones' "world"-travel in order to respectfully and lovingly engage with others, both within and without the game's storyworld.

TI  - Assessing spatiotemporally varied ecohydrological effects of apple orchards based on regional-scale estimation of tree distribution and ages
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest ecohydrological processes change with time of tree plantation; however, it remains challenging to estimate tree ages at the regional scale. The objective of this study is to estimate the regional-scale apple tree distribution and ages, and further use it as a bridge to quantify the impacts of apple orchards on hydrological processes. Taking the Changwu County on the Loess Plateau of China as example, we first identified the spatial distribution and age structure of apple trees from 1995 to 2020 based on field investigation, remote sensing data and machine learning procedure, and then explored the spatiotemporally varied impacts of apple orchards on water balance through extrapolating the point-scale observation to the whole study area. The area and tree age of apple orchards were satisfactorily identified, with R2 values of 0.94 and 0.68, respectively. The area of apple orchards kept increasing, and its value in 2020 (17117 ha) was 2.5 times of that in 1995 (6842 ha). Young apple trees dominated the apple orchards during 1995-2000, while trees over 15 years old accounted for 72 % of the apple orchards in 2020. With the point-scale relations of tree ages to soil water balance, the regional-scale cumulative soil water consumed by the increasing apple orchards and old trees reached 129 GL by 2020, and the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation was 109 % when the apple tree was 22 years old. This study proposes a framework to estimate the regional-scale temporal changes in ecohydrological effects of vegetation using tree age as a bridge. The methods in this study can be referred by other studies, and the results can be used for sustainable management of water resources and agricultural production.

TI  - Effect of Isostatic Pressing Support on Forming Force in Single Point Incremental Forming
T2  - INTEGRATED FERROELECTRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Single point incremental forming has no support on the back of the sheet, which leads to the defects such as sheet instability and poor forming accuracy. In this paper, isostatic pressing technology is introduced into single point incremental forming process to provide effective support for the back of sheet metal. Taking cone parts with 1060 aluminum as the research object, the forming force under different static pressure parameters was analyzed by finite element analysis and experimental study. The results show that the horizontal forces F-x and F-y increase slightly under static pressure. The axial force F-z has a relatively large change, and with the static pressure increasing, the axial force increases significantly. The experimental equipment of isostatic pressing single point incremental forming was designed to obtain the forming force variation under different static pressing conditions. Compared with the simulation results, the accuracy of the finite element model was verified.

TI  - Spatio-temporal changes of coastline in Jiaozhou Bay from 1987 to 2022 based on optical and SAR data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past 35 years, the natural coastline along Jiaozhou Bay has undergone extensive changes under the influence of human activities, and the coastal wetland area has been drastically reduced. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the spatio-temporal changes of the Jiaozhou Bay coastline, and their trends and causes, for sustainable economic development and the rational utilization of coastal resources. This paper constructed a comprehensive method for extracting the coastline information and change analysis based on long time series remote sensing data. Based on multi-spectral optical data and dual-polarization SAR data, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Sentinel-1 Dual-polarized Water body Index (SDWI) combined with the Otsu threshold segmentation method were used to automatically extract the spatial distribution of coastline. The U-Net semantic segmentation model was used to classify the land cover types in the land direction of the coastline to count the coastline types. The End Point Rate (EPR) and Linear Regression Rate (LRR) were used to analyze the coastline changes, and the land reclamation was calculated according to the changing trends. The Pearson coefficient was used to study the reasons for the coastline changes. With an average time interval of 5 years, eight coastlines of Jiaozhou Bay in different years were extracted, and the coastline types were obtained. Then, the changes of the coastlines in Jiaozhou Bay from 1987 to 2022 were analyzed. The results show that: 1) Coastline type information provides important information for analyzing the coastline changes in long time series, and coastline information can be effectively extracted using multi-spectral optical data and dual-polarization SAR data. When the resolution of remote sensing data is 30m, the average error of the two types of data is better than one pixel, and the error between the data is about 1-2 pixels. 2) Based on the U-Net model, the overall accuracy of coastline classification using multi-spectral optical data and dual-polarization SAR data is 94.49% and 94.88%, respectively, with kappa coefficients of 0.9143 and 0.8949. 3) In the past 35 years, Jiaozhou Bay area has shown an obvious trend towards the ocean, with an average annual expansion of 16.723m. 4) The coastline of the Jiaozhou Bay area is dynamic. Due to the frequent human activities, the coastline has been reconstructed on a large scale, and the length of artificial coastline has increased significantly. The proportion of artificial coastline length has increased from 33.72% in 1987 to 59.33% in 2022. 5) In the past 35 years, the land reclamation area has reached 41.45km(2), of which Shibei District, Licang District, and Huangdao District are the three most frequent areas, with an area of 34.62 km(2).

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Soil temperature (Ts) and vegetation temperature (Tv) provide significant information for various practical applications such as evapotranspiration estimation, water requirement analysis for vegetation, and drought monitoring during the crop growth. In this study, we estimated Ts and Tv with a land surface temperature (LST)-vegetation index (VI) trapezoidal space-based method (hereafter abbreviated as the trapezoidal method) and a dual-angle algorithm in which the estimation equations for Ts and Tv were established with thermal infrared observations from two angles and solved to using the least squares method. The Ts and Tv estimations were conducted using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-3 data from the Google Earth Engine platform, together with auxiliary meteorological data from eight sites with various land cover types in the Heihe River Basin in 2019, and compared with corresponding in-situ measurements and temperatures from Landsat. The results showed that (1) both estimation methods outperformed the Ts retrievals compared to those of Tv; (2) the trapezoidal method overall had a similar but slightly better performance compared to the dual-angle algorithm, with the root mean square error for Ts retrievals of 3.7 K and 5.7 K, and for Tv retrievals of 6.5 K and 7.2 K, respectively, in comparison with temperatures from Landsat; (3) the trapezoidal method had higher accuracy over sites with grassland, desert, or meadow for Ts retrieval and sites with forests for Tv retrieval. This study provides advice about the method for Ts and Tv estimations and might be useful for rational utilization and more accurate monitoring of soil and vegetation.

TI  - State of activity classification of deep-seated gravitational slope deformation at regional scale based on Sentinel-1 data
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DsGSDs) are very slow slope instabilities that can have a long-term impact on anthropic structures and infrastructures. The characterization of their state of activity is, therefore, essential to evaluate it. By employing Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) techniques, a dedicated procedure, to explore the behavior and define the state of activity of 279 DsGSDs, inventoried in the regional landslide inventory of the Aosta Valley Region (Western Italian Alps), has been implemented. The proposed methodology consists of several steps. Firstly, Sentinel-1 data have been processed through a two-step, advanced, DInSAR processing scheme to detect and identify Persistent Scatterers (PSs). The velocity values measured along the radar Line of Sight (LOS) have been projected along the steepest slope. Subsequently, an analysis of PSs within DsGSD polygons, devoted to the assessment of Sentinel-1 data coverage, has been carried out; in particular, considering the PS abundance, computing voids in point distributions and assessing PS clustering to identify cases with adequate point number and distribution for a suitable definition of the state of activity. Finally, a spatial analysis based on cluster and outlier identification has been carried out to characterize the moving phenomena and their degree of variability in deformation rates. Overall, the implemented methodology provides a valid instrument to remotely define the state of activity of these huge phenomena, often wrongly underestimated or neglected in risk management, useful for a better definition of DsGSD impacts on anthropic elements for a proper land use planning.

T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The main objective of this study is to estimate the actual evapotranspiration rate and determine the water requirement of pistachio crops in the central plateau of Iran using satellite remote sensing products. In order to achieve this main goal, 12 images from the Operational Earth Imager (OLI) of the Landsat 8 satellite for the water year 2018-2019 were downloaded from NASA's Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center. The daily data of the five variables, namely maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and sunshine hours of Taft station, were also obtained from the Iran Meteorological Organization as the closest meteorological station to the study area after preparing images and collecting data. First, the actual evapotranspiration rate of the pistachio product was estimated on a monthly scale for every 12 months of the study using two surface energy balance (SEBAL) and Surface Energy Balance Index (SEBS). Evapotranspiration potential was also acquired in a station scale applying 12 experimental methods. In a comparative study, the results revealed that the evapotranspiration values achieved from the four experimental models H-S, B-C, Trabert, and Rn-Based, have the highest correlation and the lowest error value with the values estimated from the two SEBAL and SEBS models. Finally, the water requirement of the pistachio crop during its growth period was estimated separately using two models, namely SEBAL and SEBS, and confirmed the experimental models.

TI  - Understanding urban agriculture in context: environmental, social, and psychological benefits of agriculture in Singapore
T2  - LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The purported environmental, social, psychological, and economic benefits of urban agricultural initiatives (UAIs) are context-dependent. However, little research has been done on UAIs in Asia, and to our knowledge, no research conducted in Singapore. This study investigated the benefits perceived by employees and volunteers at an UAI in Singapore, an Asian city-state, and how these benefits were achieved or impeded. A secondary aim was to examine differences in participants' perceptions. To address these aims, in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 employees and volunteers, followed by a Q-sort of 36 interview statements delivered to the same participants. The results suggested that the UAI had environmental, social, and psychological benefits which include fostering a genuine connection with nature and facilitating pro-environmental behavioural spillover; enabling friendships and learning to communicate with diverse peoples; and increasing self-awareness and gratitude, respectively. These are facilitated through tactile involvement with nature, exposure to pro-environmental behaviours, a culture of open-mindedness that encourages social interaction and encouragement of reflection. On the other hand, the UAI's economic impact in terms of employment and food production was impeded by its financial difficulties. While both volunteers and employees perceived the psychosocial benefits, it was employees who emphasised the UAI's financial difficulties. These benefits and impediments and how they manifest reflect Singapore's communitarian worldview and accompanying social norms, and demonstrate the local and global relevance of situating UAIs in context. Relevant areas of future research are suggested. (234 words)

TI  - What would other emergency stroke teams do? Using explainable machine learning to understand variation in thrombolysis practice
T2  - EUROPEAN STROKE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Introduction: The aim of this work was to understand between-hospital variation in thrombolysis use among emergency stroke admissions in England and Wales. Patients: A total of 88,928 patients who arrived at all 132 emergency stroke hospitals in England Wales within 4 h of stroke onset, from 2016 to 2018. Methods: Machine learning was applied to the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) data set, to learn which patients in each hospital would likely receive thrombolysis. We used XGBoost machine learning models, coupled with a SHAP model for explainability; Shapley (SHAP) values, providing estimates of how patient features, and hospital identity, influence the odds of receiving thrombolysis. Results: Thrombolysis use in patients arriving within 4 h of known or estimated stroke onset ranged 7% -49% between hospitals. The odds of receiving thrombolysis reduced 9-fold over the first 120 min of arrival-to-scan time, varied 30-fold with stroke severity, reduced 3-fold with estimated rather than precise stroke onset time, fell 6-fold with increasing pre-stroke disability, fell 4-fold with onset during sleep, fell 5-fold with use of anticoagulants, fell 2-fold between 80 and 110 years of age, reduced 3-fold between 120 and 240 min of onset-to-arrival time and varied 13-fold between hospitals. The majority of between-hospital variance was explained by the hospital, rather than the differences in local patient populations. Conclusions: Using explainable machine learning, we identified that the majority of the between-hospital variation in thrombolysis use in England and Wales may be explained by differences in in-hospital processes and differences in attitudes to judging suitability for thrombolysis.

TI  - Habitat modelling of escolar fish (<i>Lepidocybium flavobrunneum</i>, Smith 1843) in the southwestern Indian Ocean using remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Escolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum) belongs to Gempylidae family, is a top predator species that plays a crucial role in the marine ecosystem. However, limited information is available regarding their spatial-temporal variations in habitat, while habitat suitability index (HSI) modelling has been widely used in recent years for conservation, fisheries, and ecology. We compared an Arithmetic Mean Model (AMM) and a Geometric Mean Model (GMM) to gain insights into their habitat distribution. Fishery data were collected from the southwestern Indian Ocean between 2010 and 2014. Ten oceanographic remote sensing data sets were compiled, and four of them were selected based on their higher R-2 values obtained from Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Random Forest (RF) analyses for constructing the model combination. Meanwhile, Suitability Index (SI) curves were employed to determine the habitat suitability range for escolar. Environmental parameters were combined using a step-wise approach and applied for both AMM and GMM. The models were evaluated based on the Lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value. Eventually, AMM was chosen over GMM with the AIC value was 28.49 and 31.25, respectively. The selected model combination of AMM was Sea Surface Height (SSH), Oxygen (O), and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) meaning these parameters influenced the distribution of escolar. The SI curve of the chosen model indicated the habitat range for each parameter as follows: SSH (0.61-0.69 m), O (222-230 mmol m(-3)), and SST (18.7-21.1 & DEG;C). The most suitable habitat for escolar was observed within the coordinates 36 oS-30 oS and 28 oE-36 oE. Thus, this method is demonstrated in a case study where just presence data are provided and the incorporation of remote sensing environmental factors is gathered. This result could help improve escolar fishery management in the southwestern Indian Ocean.

TI  - The Regenerative Lens: A conceptual framework for regenerative social-ecological systems
T2  - ONE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Societies must transform their dynamics to support the flourishing of life. There is increasing interest in regeneration and regenerative practice as a solution, but also limited cohered understanding of what constitutes regenerative systems at social-ecological scales. In this perspective we present a conceptual, cross-disciplinary, and action-oriented regenerative systems framework, the Regenerative Lens, informed by a wide literature review. The framework emphasizes that regenerative systems maintain positive reinforc-ing cycles of wellbeing within and beyond themselves, especially between humans and wider nature, such that "life begets life."We identify five key qualities needed in systems to encourage such dynamics: an ecological worldview embodied in human action; mutualism; high diversity; agency for humans and non-hu-mans to act regeneratively; and continuous reflexivity. We apply the Lens to an envisioned future food system to illustrate its utility as a reflexive tool and for stretching ambition. We hope that the conceptual clarity provided here will aid the necessary acceleration of learning and action toward regenerative systems.

TI  - Characterizing the 2020 summer floods in South China and effects on croplands
T2  - ISCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods occur more frequently in the context of climate change; however, flood monitoring capacity has not been well established. Here, we used a synergic map-ping framework to characterize summer floods in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Plain and the effects on croplands in 2020, from both flood extent and intensity perspectives. We found that the total flood extent was 4936 km(2) from July to August, and for flood intensity, 1658, 1382, and 1896 km(2) of areas experienced triple, double, and single floods. A total of 2282 km(2) croplands (46% of the flooded area) were inundated mainly from Poyang and Dongting Lake Basins, containing a high ratio of moderate damage croplands (47%). The newly increased flooding extent in 2020 was 29% larger than the maximum ever-flooded extent in 2015-2019. This study is expected to provide a reference for rapid regional flood disaster assessment and serving mitigation.

TI  - Landscape changes in the Tombstone Territorial Park region (central Yukon, Canada) from multilevel remote sensing analysis
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Northern ecosystems are vulnerable to surface disturbances caused by warming climate and human activities. The Ogilvie Mountains in central Yukon are an important region that should be monitored, as it is a major transportation corridor con-necting northern communities. This study aims to characterize 35 years of landscape changes in the Tombstone Territorial Park and the surrounding region of the Ogilvie Mountains by detecting and interpreting landscape changes using a Landsat-derived trend analysis and multilevel image interpretation. Statistically significant spectral changes occurred in 24% of the study area between 1986 and 2021, and most of these changes are gradual and associated with vegetation succession and hy-drological processes (i.e., erosion and deposition). Other landscape changes included wildfires, slumps, changes to riverbanks and lake shores, earlier melting of icings in the summer, degradation on the peripheries of some ice-wedge polygonal terrain, and potential insect damage to forests. Our investigation reveals that the extent and magnitude of landscape changes in the study area are influenced by climate, geomorphic setting, ecological succession, and glacial history of the region. Given a var-ied combination of ecotypes, spatial and temporal variations are to be expected in terms of the response of the landscape to climate and anthropogenic disturbances.

TI  - How do Maori navigate advice about nutrition? A review that spans the matauranga Maori, western science, and social media divides
T2  - ALTERNATIVE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death in Aotearoa (New Zealand). Life expectancy for Maori (Indigenous people of Aotearoa) is 7 years less than that for non-Maori. Maintaining a healthy nutrition lifestyle is vital to reduce cardiovascular disease risk and improve overall well-being. Though diet and nutrition campaigns are standard parts of health promotion and campaigns have been developed to target Maori, little is known about the way Maori navigate nutrition advice. This review explored matauranga Maori (Maori knowledge) and western science as bodies of knowledge for nutrition advice and social media as a platform to disseminate nutrition information to understand how communities get their nutrition advice. The findings suggest that for Maori to navigate nutrition advice and messaging effectively, advice needs to be tailored in a way that is acceptable to a Maori worldview while working within the interface of matauranga Maori, western science, and social media.

TI  - Examining cloud vertical structure and radiative effects from satellite retrievals and evaluation of CMIP6 scenarios
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds exhibit a wide range of vertical morphologies that are regulated by distinct atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics and are related to a diversity of microphysical properties and radiative effects. In this study, the new CERES-CloudSat-CALIPSO-MODIS (CCCM) RelD1 dataset is used to investigate the morphology and spatial distribution of different cloud vertical structure (CVS) types during 2007-2010. The combined active and passive satellites provide a more precise CVS than those only based on passive imagers or microwave radiometers. We group the clouds into 12 CVS classes based on how they are located or overlapping in three standard atmospheric layers with pressure thresholds of 440 and 680 hPa. For each of the 12 CVS types, the global average cloud radiative effects (CREs) at the top of the atmosphere, within the atmosphere and at the surface, as well as the cloud heating rate (CHR) profiles are examined. The observations are subsequently used to evaluate the variations in total, high-, middle- and low-level cloud fractions in CMIP6 models. The "historical" experiment during 1850-2014 and two scenarios (ssp245 and ssp585) during 2015-2100 are analyzed. The observational results show a substantial difference in the spatial pattern among different CVS types, with the greatest contrast between high and low clouds. Single-layer cloud fraction is almost 4 times larger on average than multi-layer cloud fraction, with significant geographic differences associated with clearly distinguishable regimes, showing that overlapping clouds are regionally confined. The global average CREs reveal that four types of CVSs warm the planet, while eight of them cool it. The longwave component drives the net CHR profile, and the CHR profiles of multi-layer clouds are more curved and intricate than those of single-layer clouds, resulting in complex thermal stratifications. According to the long-term analysis from CMIP6, the projected total cloud fraction decreases faster over land than over the ocean. The high clouds over the ocean increase significantly, but other types of clouds over land and the ocean continue to decrease, helping to offset the decrease in oceanic total cloud fraction. Moreover, it is concluded that the spatial pattern of CVS types may not be significantly altered by climate change, and only the cloud fraction is influenced. Our findings suggest that long-term observed CVS should be emphasized in the future to better understand CVS responses to anthropogenic forcing and climate change.

TI  - HYPERSPECTRAL ESTIMATION OF WHEAT CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT BASED ON PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Chlorophyll content is an important index to measure the nutritional status of wheat. Rapid and accurate estimation of chlorophyll content is crucial to monitor the photosynthetic capacity and growth status of wheat and optimize its quality. To solve the problem of low precision in the hyperspectral estimation of crop chlorophyll content, this paper selects vegetation indices, spectral characteristic parameters, fractional differential spectrum, and wavelet energy coefficient as index parameters. Meanwhile, principal component analysis (PCA) is exploited to reduce and fuse these index parameters to eliminate the multicollinearity among the index parameters. Then, based on multiple linear regression and support vector machine algorithms, the estimation model of wheat chlorophyll content in different growth stages is constructed. The results show that the PCA reduces the dimension of hyperspectral data while retaining the original information, which improves the operation efficiency of the model, and ensures the effect of chlorophyll content estimation. The experimental results indicate that the multiple linear regression method achieves a better estimation effect of chlorophyll content at the booting stage, and the R2, RMSE, and nRMSE of the estimation model are 0.79, 2.21, and 5.50% respectively. This study provides a new technical method for estimating crop chlorophyll content using hyperspectral remote sensing data and comprehensive index parameters.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of Snow Water Equivalent Using Machine Learning Methods Over the Zayandehroud River Basin, Iran
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Snow cover is an informative indicator of climate change and surface hydrological cycles. Despite its essential accurate dynamic measurement (i.e., accumulation, erosion, and runoff), it is poorly known, particularly in mountainous regions. Since passive microwave sensors can contribute to obtaining information about snowpack volume, microwave brightness temperatures (BT) have long been used to assess spatiotemporal variations in snow water equivalent (SWE). However, SWE is greatly influenced by geographic location, terrain parameters/covers, and BT differences, and thus, the low spatial resolution of existing SWE products (i.e., the coarse resolution of AMSR-based products) leads to less satisfactory results, especially in regions with complex terrain conditions, strong seasonal transitions and, great spatiotemporal heterogeneity. A novel multifactor SWE downscaling algorithm based on the support vector regression (SVR) technique has been developed in this study for the Zayandehroud River basin. Thereby, passive microwave BT, location (latitude and longitude), terrain parameters (i.e., elevation, slope, and aspect), and vegetation cover serve as model input data. Evaluation of downscaled SWE estimates against ground-based observations demonstrated that when moving into higher spatial resolution, not only was there no significant decrease in accuracy, but a 4% increase was observed. In addition, this study suggests that integrating passive microwave remote sensing data with other auxiliary data can lead to a more efficient and effective algorithm for retrieving SWE with appropriate spatial resolution over various scales.

TI  - Two-Dimensional and 3D Change Detection in Urban Area Using Very High-Resolution Satellite Data and Impact of Urbanization over LST and NDVI
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - High-resolution satellite data are an excellent way to monitor the growth of an urban area in terms of vertical and horizontal growth. Time-series data over two different zones from the same satellite sensor or contemporary sensors act as a good test bed for change detection. In most of the cases, 2D images of different time frames are spatially registered, and pixel difference is calculated which enables the detection of change in horizontal growths. Three-dimensional change detection to mark a change in the vertical direction can also be computed by comparing high-resolution digital surface models (DSM) of two different times and detect changes in topography. Using accurate DSM and derived digital terrain models (DTM) information from DSM, exact and accurate heights of the building footprints can be extracted. Using 3D city models, information about horizontal growth and vertical growth of the city can be assessed using change detection over the temporal data. Three-dimensional change detection can also enable district and state administration to discern the planned growth of the city, illegal constructions and future planning of the city, especially in the projects like smart cities. In this study, we are comparing 2D raster images of different time frames to assess change in horizontal direction, very high-resolution DSMs and DTMs datasets of two different time zones to assess change in vertical directions and visualizing 3D change detection of Ahmedabad city, in terms of its horizontal and vertical changes in urban growth area. We are also making the assessment of the growth of the city (5% change in building structures) and population in the studied area. It is inferred that the city population in the year 2018 is more than 35% as compared to the population in the year 2011. Further, we are calculating geophysical parameters of land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over a time using satellite datasets, which provides a proxy observation for the changes in the urban growth. Using satellite data, it is concluded that NDVI is reduced over the study area whereas there is an increase in LST temperature at night time during the winter season. We concluded that increased urbanization and population (> 35%) are also contributing for rise in the LST temperature at nights in the city apart from the other big environmental parameters such as global warming, etc.

TI  - Stability of psychological wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic among people with an anthroposophical worldview: the influence of wondering awe and perception of nature as resources
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, differences in responses and behaviors were observed among specific groups. We aimed to address how people with an anthroposophical worldview behaved with respect to the perception of burden, fears, and wellbeing. As it is an integral part of their lifestyle and convictions, we addressed the influence of wondering awe and gratitude and perception of nature and times of mindful quietness as resources to cope. MethodsIn two cross-sectional surveys with standardized instruments, participants were recruited in 2020 (n = 1,252) and 2021 (n = 2,273). ResultsPsychological wellbeing was much higher than in other studied groups and populations, with slightly lower scores in 2021 compared to the 2020 sample (Eta(2) = 0.020), while the perception of the COVID-19-related burden and fear of the future were low in 2020 with a slight increase in 2021 (Eta(2) = 0.033 and 0.008, respectively). Their transcendence conviction was negatively related to fears of their own infection or the infection of others. Best predictors of their wellbeing were low burden and awe/gratitude, while the best predictors of their burden were low wellbeing and lack of social contacts. ConclusionCompared to the general population in Germany, the anthroposophical lifestyle and related convictions may have buffered some of the COVID-19-related burden and helped them to stabilize their psychological wellbeing.

TI  - Updated geostrophic circulation and volume transport from satellite data in the Southern Ocean
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: A geodetic estimation of the surface geostrophic currents can be obtained from satellite data by combining sea surface height measurements obtained from altimetry missions with geoid data from gravity missions. These surface geostrophic currents serve as a reference for inferring a comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) geostrophy by propagating them downwards using temperature and salinity profiles.Methods: In this work, we revisit this problem for the Southern Ocean, estimating the 3D geostrophy near full depth in 41 layers, with a 1 degrees spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution, covering the 12 years from 2004 to 2015. We analyze the obtained 3D geostrophy over the Southern Ocean region, where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and its several fronts are depicted, as well as other major currents such as the Agulhas Current, the Brazil-Malvinas Current, or the East Australian Current. From the 3D geostrophic currents, we also estimate the associated water volume transport (VT) and present the results for the ACC and the Drake Passage in the context of existing literature.Results: Our analysis yields a mean VT estimate of 15.9 +/- 0.1 Sv per 1 degrees cell within the ACC region and 149.2 +/- 2.2 Sv for the Drake Passage ([60.5 degrees S, 54.5 degrees S] x [303.5 degrees E]). Importantly, our study includes a comprehensive validation of the results. The spatial resolution of our space-data-based approach enables us to provide VT estimates for various paths followed in the different in situ campaigns at the Drake Passage, thereby validating our findings.Discussion: The analysis demonstrates a remarkable agreement across different measurement locations, reconciling the differences in estimates reported from different campaigns. Moreover, we have estimated the barotropic and baroclinic components of the currents and their associated VT.

TI  - Carbon nanoparticles localized clipped node dissection combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy with indocyanine green and methylene blue after neoadjuvant therapy in node positive breast cancer in China: initial results of a prospective study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of applying carbon nanoparticles (CNs) to visualize clip-marked metastatic nodes in combination with indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB) as sentinel lymph node (SLN) tracers for targeted axillary dissection (TAD) after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT).Methods This feasibility trial enrolled 40 patients with node-positive breast cancer, and 38 patients completed NAT and surgery were included in the final analysis. Before NAT or surgery, clip-marked nodes were localized with CNs by ultrasonography. After NAT, the clip-marked nodes were removed under the guidance of carbon-tattooing and confirmed by radiography. SLNs were mapped with ICG and MB. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed for all patients after TAD.Results The clip-marked nodes were retrieved in all patients. The SLN identification rate was 100%. 29 of 38 clipped-nodes were SLNs. The false-negative rate was 6.25% (2/32,95% CI:1.09%similar to 22.22%) for TAD nodes and 9.38% (3/32,95% CI 3.24%-24.22%) for SLNs, and 18.75% for clipped-nodes (6/32, 95% CI:7.86%similar to 37.04%). No adverse events were reported during clip placement, CNs localization, or the TAD procedure.Conclusions The TAD procedure with CNs to locate and visualize clipped nodes as well as SLN tracing with ICG and MB has good accessibility in China, and this technique could be easily mastered by experienced surgeons. The modified TAD technique has also demonstrated good predictive ability for residual axillary lesions after NAT, and is worth of further evaluation.

TI  - Percutaneous microwave ablation combined with endocrine therapy versus standard therapy for elderly patients with HR-positive and HER2-negative invasive breast cancer: a propensity score-matched analysis of a multi-center, prospective cohort study
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is a growing trend to apply minimally invasive local treatments for elderly patients with early-stage breast cancer. As a minimally invasive thermal therapy, microwave ablation (MWA) has been attempted to treat breast cancer of small lesions, but its long-term local efficacy on elderly patients has seldom been reported. In this study, we aimed to compare outcomes of MWA combined with endocrine therapy to standard surgery combined with adjuvant therapy in the treatment of hormone receptor (HR) -positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative invasive breast cancer for elderly patients.Methods: This prospective multi-center cohort study enrolled patients over 70 years old diagnosed with HR-positive and HER2-negative early-stage invasive breast cancer between January 2016 and July 2021. Patients chose either non-randomized to undergo MWA combined with endocrine therapy (MWA group) or standard surgery combined with adjuvant therapy (surgery group). Endpoints for the comparisons were disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and length of hospital stay (LOS) after adjusting for previously reported risk factors using propensity score matching (1:3).Results: Of the enrolled 132 patients, 33 were in the MWA group and 99 were in the surgery group. MWA was successfully performed in all cases, and technical effectiveness was achieved in all cases. With a median follow-up of 31 months, only one case had local recurrence 23 months after MWA. MWA combined with endocrine therapy and standard surgery combined adjuvant therapy for elderly patients with breast cancer achieved similar DFS (hazard ratio, 0.536; 95% CI, 0.128-2.249) and OS (hazard ratio, 0.537; 95% CI, 0.089-3.235). Besides, MWA had much shorter LOS than standard surgery (7.1 versus 13.0 days, P<0.001).Conclusions: MWA combined with endocrine therapy and standard surgery combined with adjuvant therapy for elderly breast cancer patients achieved similar outcomes. MWA combined with endocrine may be a feasible treatment strategy for elderly patients with HR-positive and HER2-negative invasive breast cancer.

TI  - Carbon stocks and potential sequestration of Uruguayan soils: a road map to a comprehensive characterization of temporal and spatial changes to assess carbon footprint
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon net emission is a critical aspect of the environmental footprint in agricultural systems. However, the alternatives to describe soil organic carbon (SOC) changes associated with different agricultural management practices/land uses are limited. Here we provide an overview of carbon (C) stocks of non-forested areas of Uruguay to estimate SOC changes for different soil units affected by accumulated effects of crop and livestock production systems in the last decades. For this, we defined levels based on SOC losses relative to the original (reference) SOC stocks: 25% or less, between 25% and 50%, and 50% or more. We characterized the reference SOC stocks using three approaches: (1) an equation to derive the potential SOC capacity based on the clay and fine silt soil content, (2) the DayCent model to estimate the SOC stocks based on climate, soil texture and C inputs from the natural grasslands of the area, (3) an estimate of SOC using a proxy derived from remote sensing data (i.e., the Ecosystem Services Supply Index) that accounts for differences in C inputs. Depending on the used reference SOC, the soil units had different distributions of SOC losses within the zones defined by the thresholds. As expected, the magnitude of SOC changes observed for the different soil units was related to the relative frequency of annual crops, however, the high variability observed along the gradient of land uses suggests a wide space for increasing SOC with agricultural management practices. The assessment of the C stock preserved (CSP) belowground and the potential for increasing C accumulation or sequestration (CAP) are critical components of the C footprint of a given system. Thus, we propose a methodological road map to derive indicators of CSP and CAP at the farm level combining both, biogeochemical simulation models and conceptual models based on remote sensing data. We recognize at least three critical issues that require scientific and political consensus to implement the use of this propose: (1) how to define reference C stocks, (2) how to estimate current C stocks over large areas and in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes, and (3) what is a reasonable/acceptable threshold of C stocks reduction.

TI  - Micro-spatial flood risk assessment in Nagaon district, Assam (India) using GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP)
T2  - RISK ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Nagaon is one of the highly flood-prone districts of Assam, India that recurrently experiences devastating floods resulting in the loss of lives and property and wreaking havoc on the district's socioeconomic infrastructure. Identification and mapping of spatial patterns of flood hazards, flood vulnerability, and flood risk zones (FRZs) of the district are, therefore, crucial for flood management and mitigation. The present study, therefore, attempts to delineate the FRZs of more than 930 villages in the Nagaon district by integrating the flood hazard and vulnerability layers in the geospatial environment using the multi-criteria decision analysis and analytical hierarchy process techniques. Here, seven flood hazard and vulnerability indicators are considered to derive each layer separately. The results indicate that about 15.14% of the district's total villages are in the very high FRZ, 27.93% in the high, 46.62% in the moderate, and 10.3% in the low FRZ. Further, bivariate correlation analysis is used to evaluate the results with the percentages of the population, cropland, and animals affected by floods at different temporal scales in order to ensure that the revenue circles with a higher percentage of area under high and very high FRZs genuinely have higher percentages of flood-affected cropland, people, and livestock. The significance of this research is evident in its pragmatic findings that could aid the stakeholders in managing and reducing flood risk at micro-spatial scales.

TI  - Spatial variability of Saharan dust deposition revealed through a citizen science campaign
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Saharan dust outbreaks have profound effects on ecosystems, climate, human health, and the cryosphere in Europe. However, the spatial deposition pattern of Saharan dust is poorly known due to a sparse network of ground measurements. Following the extreme dust deposition event of February 2021 across Europe, a citizen science campaign was launched to sample dust on snow over the Pyrenees and the European Alps. This somewhat improvised campaign triggered wide interest since 152 samples were collected from the snow in the Pyrenees, the French Alps, and the Swiss Alps in less than 4 weeks. Among the 152 samples, 113 in total could be analysed, corresponding to 70 different locations. The analysis of the samples showed a large variability in the dust properties and amount. We found a decrease in the deposited mass and particle sizes with distance from the source along the transport path. This spatial trend was also evident in the elemental composition of the dust as the iron mass fraction decreased from 11% in the Pyrenees to 2% in the Swiss Alps. At the local scale, we found a higher dust mass on south-facing slopes, in agreement with estimates from high-resolution remote sensing data. This unique dataset, which resulted from the collaboration of several research laboratories and citizens, is provided as an open dataset to benefit a large community and to enable further scientific investigations. Data presented in this study are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7969515 (Dumont et al., 2022a).

T2  - BULLETIN OF GEOPHYSICS AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Lake Beysehir is a crucial water resource for its region; however, its water level has visibly decreased over the past decade, thus posing a threat to the lake's sustainability. This study aims to investigate the causes behind this phenomenon and its impact on the lake surface area. To achieve this, the study uses monthly lake water level data from the Copernicus Land Service, meteorological data, and Sentinel-2 high-resolution satellite images. From these data sets, four indices are calculated for the period between 2015 and 2020: the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI). The results of the analysis indicate a significant decrease in the lake water level over the past ten years, along with mild, extreme, and severe drought conditions. Additionally, the Sentinel-2 images show a gradual reduction in the lake surface area during the same period. The study underscores the urgent need to address the impacts of climate change on freshwater resources to ensure the sustainability of Lake Beysehir and its surroundings.

TI  - Influenza versus other respiratory viruses-assessing severity among hospitalised children, Belgium, 2011 to 2020
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Knowledge on the burden attributed to influenza viruses vs other respiratory viruses in children hospitalised with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in Belgium is limited. Aim: This observational study aimed at describing the epidemi-ology and assessing risk factors for severe disease. Methods: We retrospectively analysed data from rou-tine national sentinel SARI surveillance in Belgium. Respiratory specimens collected during winter sea-sons 2011 to 2020 were tested by multiplex real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for influenza and other respiratory viruses. Demographic data and risk factors were collected through questionnaires. Patients were followed-up for complications or death during hospi-tal stay. Analysis focused on children younger than 15 years. Binomial logistic regression was used to iden-tify risk factors for severe disease in relation to infec-tion status. Results: During the winter seasons 2011 to 2020, 2,944 specimens met the study case definition. Complications were more common in children with underlying risk factors, especially asthma (adjusted risk ratio (aRR): 1.87; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.46-2.30) and chronic respiratory disease (aRR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.44-2.32), regardless of infection status and age. Children infected with non-influenza respiratory viruses had a 32% higher risk of complications (aRR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.06-1.66) compared with children with influenza only. Conclusion: Multi-virus testing in chil-dren with SARI allows a more accurate assessment of the risk of complications and attribution of burden to respiratory viruses beyond influenza. Children with asthma and respiratory disease should be prioritised for clinical care, regardless of their virological test result and age, and targeted for prevention campaigns.

TI  - Ocean color atmospheric correction methods in view of usability for different optical water types
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing allows large-scale global observations of aquatic ecosystems and matter fluxes from the source through rivers and lakes to coasts, marginal seas into the open ocean. Fuzzy logic classification of optical water types (OWT) is increasingly used to optimally determine water properties and enable seamless transitions between water types. However, effective exploitation of this method requires a successful atmospheric correction (AC) over the entire spectral range, i.e., the upstream AC is suitable for each water type and always delivers classifiable remote-sensing reflectances. In this study, we compare five different AC methods for Sentinel-3/OLCI ocean color imagery, namely IPF, C2RCC, A4O, POLYMER, and ACOLITE-DSF (all in the 2022 current version). We evaluate their results, i.e., remote-sensing reflectance, in terms of spatial exploitability, individual flagging, spectral plausibility compared to in situ data, and OWT classifiability with four different classification schemes. Especially the results of A4O show that it is beneficial if the performance spectrum of the atmospheric correction is tailored to an OWT system and vice versa. The study gives hints on how to improve AC performance, e.g., with respect to homogeneity and flagging, but also how an OWT classification system should be designed for global deployment.

The FDA uses current good manufacturing practices to regulate the processes that produce drugs. Nevertheless, investigative journalists have pointed out problems in the drug supply, and pharmacies are not required to test the drugs they receive. The University of Kentucky Drug Quality Study does perform screening on the sterile injectable drugs that it receives and regularly reports new findings to FDA, practitioners, and the public. A Sentinel Screening Network of academic health systems could provide independent data on drug quality to FDA not available through manufacturers.

TI  - Spatial and temporal patterns of near-surface ground temperature in the Arctic mountain catchment
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - We consider the case of a mountain catchment representative of southwest Spitsbergen to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in temperature of the near-surface ground. We set up 20 thermistor strings distributed in different parts of the catchment, combine the measured data with land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from Landsat imagery, and verify the depth of ground thawing using electrical resistivity tomography. Under current climatic conditions, the thickness of the active layer (ALT) is at least 1.5 m, and in the lower parts of the catchment, between 3.5 and 4 m. The maximum ground surface temperature in the study area can be 27 & DEG;C, and the temperature at a depth of 1.5 m, 5.4 & DEG;C. We identified unfrozen ground (taliks) to a depth of 10-30 m in zones of water concentration at foot slopes and under river channels. The persistence of year-round taliks at lake shores is possible. We verify the hypothesis that topographic parameters significantly determine the spatial variation of near-surface ground temperature. For each level of temperature aggregation (from 6 h to 12 months data) and each examined the depth of the active layer, it is possible to identify environmental variables-related to energy conditions, heights, terrain relief, and ground surface moisture-significantly correlated with ground temperature, and consequently to specify multiple regression models. Topographic exposure and LST (used only in daily models), altitude, and various approximations of relative height are crucial in their construction. The ground temperature variance, unexplained in the regression analysis, prompts recognition of the critical role of factors not included in the modelling (groundwater, soil structure).

TI  - Decadienal afforestation and risks to montane grassland amphibians in the Udzungwa Plateau, Tanzania
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Human modification of the environment has drastically changed ecosystems around the globe. While forest-loss (deforestation) has been well studied for its effects on ecosystems, afforestation also has major impacts. The Udzungwa Plateau in Tanzania is naturally a mix of forests and grasslands. However, non-native pine plantations have recently increased in the area displacing the native grasslands of the montane plateau. In this study, we explored the effects of land use change on amphibian communities by comparing amphibian surveys before non-native plantations were introduced (similar to 2000) and after (2017-2019). To put these amphibian surveys into wider context across the plateau and to distinguish local population loss compared to plateau-wide extinctions, we sample diversity at new sampling locations and locations with multiple surveys through time. We then assessed landscape change through remotely sensed data and ground surveys. Amphibian encounter surveys found approximately the same species diversity across all sampling locations, but local extinctions appear likely. Remaining amphibians appear to be limited to small refugia in non-pine wetlands. Approximately half (45%) of the species found have limited distributional ranges (<72,000 km(2)) and are described as habitat specialists by the IUCN Red List. Monitoring pine plantation growth using remote sensing techniques suggested only limited extensions of plantations between 2000 through to 2013-2016, but ground surveys found small pines (<3 years old) throughout almost all areas identified as grasslands on satellite imagery. Our study highlights the plight of this narrowing biome on the African continent and calls for more research on the impact of non-native plantations on natural communities.Abstract in Swahili is available with online material.

TI  - Evaluating how well active fault mapping predicts earthquake surface-rupture locations
T2  - GEOSPHERE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Earthquake surface-fault rupture location uncertainty is a key factor in fault displacement hazard analysis and informs hazard and risk mitigation strategies. Geologists often predict future rupture locations from fault mapping based on the geomorphology interpreted from remote-sensing data sets. However, surface processes can obscure fault location, fault traces may be mapped in error, and a future rupture may not break every fault trace. We assessed how well geomorphology-based fault mapping predicted surface ruptures for seven earthquakes: 1983 M 6.9 Borah Peak, 2004 M 6.0 Parkfield, 2010 M 7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah, 2011 M 6.7 Fukushima-Hamadori, 2014 M 6.0 South Napa, 2016 M 7.8 Kaikoura, and 2016 M 7 Kumamoto. We trained geoscience students to produce active fault maps using topography and imagery acquired before the earthquakes. A geologic professional completed a "control" map. Mappers used a new "geomorphic indicator ranking" approach to rank fault confidence based on geomorphologic landforms. We determined the accuracy of the mapped faults by comparing the fault maps to published rupture maps. We defined predicted ruptures as ruptures near a fault (50-200 m, depending on the fault confidence) that interacted with the landscape in a similar way to the fault. The mapped faults predicted between 12% to 68% of the principal rupture length for the studied earthquakes. The median separation distances between predicted ruptures and strong, distinct, or weak faults were 15-30 m. Our work highlights that mapping future fault ruptures is an underappreciated challenge of fault displacement hazard analysis-even for experts-with implications for risk management, engineering site assessments, and fault exclusion zones.

TI  - The impact of COVID-19 on mental health and posttraumatic growth of Korean college students: a mixed method study examining the moderating role of coping flexibility and sense of community
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to complex psychological problems, it is important to examine the effect of coping flexibility and sense of community, because relying solely on specific coping strategies is ineffective, and the pandemic necessitates social cooperation. MethodsThis study was divided into two parts. The first study used a quantitative research method(i.e., structural equation modeling) to test if coping flexibility and sense of community moderated the impact of COVID-19-related concerns on mental health (i.e., depression and anxiety) and posttraumatic growth among Korean college students. The second study used a qualitative research method for an in-depth examination of how Korean college students coped with the COVID-19 pandemic and if they achieved any positive change or growth. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic represents a situation distinct from what people have previously encountered, Study II was designed to examine the experiences of individuals during this exceptional period. ResultsIn the first study (Study I), coping flexibility was found to increase the impact of COVID-19-related concerns and difficulties on depression and anxiety. Conversely, a sense of community reduced the consequences of these overwhelming worries on depression and anxiety, while also expanding the impact of COVID-19-related disorders on posttraumatic growth. In the second study (Study II), the findings showed that the participants experienced various psychological consequences, including depression and anxiety, and distress in other aspects of their life, including disruptions in interpersonal relationships and college life. Nonetheless, the participants made efforts to cope with such difficulties and overcome the challenges together with the community. In fact, the pandemic improved their coping skills and expanded their value system and worldview. ConclusionThe study findings suggest that given the unique situation presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, a sense of community protected the mental well-being of Korean college students and facilitated their growth. This study emphasizes the necessity of promoting SOC to effectively cope with disaster situations.

TI  - Coupled Lipidomics and Digital Pathology as an Effective Strategy to Identify Novel Adverse Outcome Pathways in Eisenia fetida Exposed to MoS<sub>2</sub> Nanosheets and Ionic Mo
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets areincreasinglyapplied in several fields, but effective and accurate strategies tofully characterize potential risks to soil ecosystems are lacking.We introduce a coelomocyte-based in vivo exposurestrategy to identify novel adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) and molecularendpoints from nontransformed (NTMoS2) and ultraviolet-transformed(UTMoS2) MoS2 nanosheets (10 and 100 mg Mo/L)on the earthworm Eisenia fetida usingnontargeted lipidomics integrated with transcriptomics. Machine learning-baseddigital pathology analysis coupled with phenotypic monitoring wasfurther used to establish the correlation between lipid profilingand whole organism effects. As an ionic control, Na2MoO4 exposure significantly reduced (61.2-79.5%) the cellularcontents of membrane-associated lipids (glycerophospholipids) in earthwormcoelomocytes. Downregulation of the unsaturated fatty acid synthesispathway and leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) verified the Na2MoO4-induced membrane stress. Compared to conventionalmolybdate, NTMoS2 inhibited genes related to transmembranetransport and caused the differential upregulation of phospholipidcontent. Unlike NTMoS2, UTMoS2 specificallyupregulated the glyceride metabolism (10.3-179%) and lipidperoxidation degree (50.4-69.4%). Consequently, lipolytic pathwayswere activated to compensate for the potential energy deprivation.With pathology image quantification, we report that UTMoS2 caused more severe epithelial damage and intestinal steatosis thanNTMoS(2), which is attributed to the edge effect and higherMo release upon UV irradiation. Our results reveal differential AOPsinvolving soil sentinel organisms exposed to different Mo forms, demonstratingthe potential of liposome analysis to identify novel AOPs and furthermoreaccurate soil risk assessment strategies for emerging contaminants.A risk assessment framework integratingliposome analysisand multidimensional phenotypic monitoring can effectively identifynovel adverse outcome pathways of nontransformed and ultraviolet-transformedMoS(2) nanosheets to soil sentinel species Eisenia fetida.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy versus axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy with one to two metastatic sentinel lymph nodes: sub-analysis of the SINODAR-ONE multicentre randomized clinical trial and reopening of enrolment
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The initial results of the SINODAR-ONE randomized clinical trial reported that patients with T1-2 breast cancer and one to two macrometastatic sentinel lymph nodes treated with breast-conserving surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy only, and adjuvant therapy did not present worse 3-year survival, regional recurrence, or distant recurrence rates compared with those treated with axillary lymph node dissection. To extend the recommendation of axillary lymph node dissection omission even in patients treated with mastectomy, a sub-analysis of the SINODAR-ONE trial is presented here.Methods Patients with T1-2 breast cancer and no more than two metastatic sentinel lymph nodes undergoing mastectomy were analysed. After sentinel lymph node biopsy, patients were randomly assigned to receive either axillary lymph node dissection followed by adjuvant treatment (standard arm) or adjuvant treatment alone (experimental arm). The primary endpoint was overall survival. The secondary endpoint was recurrence-free survival.Results A total of 218 patients were treated with mastectomy; 111 were randomly assigned to the axillary lymph node dissection group and 107 to the sentinel lymph node biopsy-only group. At a median follow-up of 33.0 months, there were three deaths (two deaths in the axillary lymph node dissection group and one death in the sentinel lymph node biopsy-only group). There were five recurrences in each treatment arm. No axillary lymph node recurrence was observed. The 5-year overall survival rates were 97.8 and 98.7 per cent in the axillary lymph node dissection treatment arm and the sentinel lymph node biopsy-only treatment arm, respectively (P = 0.597). The 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 95.7 and 94.1 per cent in the axillary lymph node dissection treatment arm and the sentinel lymph node biopsy treatment arm, respectively (P = 0.821).Conclusion In patients with T1-2 breast cancer and one to two macrometastatic sentinel lymph nodes treated with mastectomy, the overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates of patients treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy only were not inferior to those treated with axillary lymph node dissection. To strengthen the conclusion of the trial, the enrolment of patients treated with mastectomy was reopened as a single-arm experimental study.Registration numberNCT05160324 ()

TI  - Bio-Optical Characterization of Chilika Lagoon Using Multispectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Chilika Lake is an optically complex water body experiencing circulations linked to the tidal influx from Bay of Bengal. These circulations causes seasonal variations in biophysical and chemical parameters of the lake, such as water nutrients, salinity and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). In this study, bio-optical parameters (Chl-a concentration, absorption by colored dissolved organic matter & detritus and backscattering by suspended particles) of Chilika Lake were estimated using multispectral remote sensing data of Oceansat-2 Ocean Color Monitor (OCM-2, spatial resolution similar to 360 m) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI, spatial resolution similar to 30 m) sensors. Spectral matching technique was implemented on the satellite derived remote sensing reflectance spectra (RrsokTHORN) to estimate the bio-optical parameters. Both OLI and OCM-2 revealed that the southern and central portion of Chilika has a relatively higher phytoplankton productivity (8 mg m(-3) <= Chl-a <= 15 mg m(-3)) when compared to the northern sector. Also, retrieval from both the satellites could capture the presence of a high sediment load in the northern sector. Application of spectral matching technique requires accurate estimation of RrsokTHORN from a satellite image. For this purpose, atmospheric corrections were implemented on both OLI and OCM-2 level-1b data. Processing of OLI data was done using SWIR (short wave infrared) atmospheric correction algorithm with the help of ACOLITE software. For OCM-2, due to the absence of SWIR bands, we used the standard atmospheric correction algorithm with certain modifications to obtain accurate results over the turbid waters of Chilika Lake. R-rs from OCM-2 were compared with in situ measured reflectance. Both the shape and magnitude of the spectra compared well, with relative errors ranging from 8.75 to 32.78 %. The modified atmospheric correction algorithm is useful for multi-spectral data that does not have SWIR bands and can be implemented over any inland and coastal water bodies having clear oceanic pixels in its vicinity.

TI  - Threat, voting and candidate support. The impact of mortality salience
T2  - FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionHow does threat motivate political choices? An extensive literature has noted the importance of threat in influencing political behavior. A growing literature in political psychology has used the concept of "mortality salience" to examine the role of existential threat in political decisions. Scholars have argued that inducing mortality salience by asking individuals to think about their own death should result in either reinforcement of their existing political worldview, a shift to a more politically conservative view, or support for a "status quo" option more generally. MethodsWe performed two survey experiments (N = 484 and 1514) manipulating mortality salience and candidate features (Exp. 2). Experiment 1 was performed one week before the 2016 US presidential election and utilized the varying features of the candidates. Experiment 2 manipulated features such as experience level (representing the status quo or change) and partisanship. ResultsWe find that mortality salience led to an increased likelihood of voting for Hillary Clinton, particularly for moderate and independent respondents. We also find that independent participants preferred the status quo candidate under mortality salience. DiscussionWe interpret the findings in both studies as supporting a connection between existential threat and preference for the status quo in psychological terms, at least for less partisan voters, rather than a conservative shift in ideological terms or a tendency to reinforce existing views.

TI  - Lymph Node Positivity of Axillary Reverse Mapping Lymph Nodes at the Time of Axillary Lymph Node Dissection: Two-Site Prospective Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) was introduced in 2007 to identify and selectively preserve upper-extremity lymphatics during axillary lymph node surgery to decrease the risk of lymphedema. The patient population in which an ARM lymph node (LN) can be preserved during an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has not been established to date. This study aimed to determine the frequency of metastatic involvement of an ARM LN among patients undergoing ALND.Methods Patients undergoing ALND with or without immediate lymphatic reconstruction (ILR) were enrolled in a prospective trial at two institutional sites between April 2018 and Decemeber 2022. This report analyzes the ARM node positivity and total LN positivity rates during ALND for the cohort of patients enrolled in the ILR intervention arm of the study.Results The inclusion criteria were met by 139 patients, who made up the study population (133 with breast cancer and 6 with other disease). Of the breast cancer patients, 99.2% were female, 35.3% (47/133) were cT3 or greater, and 96.2% (128/133) had cN1 or greater disease. For 55 of the 133 patients (41.4%), the ARM nodes were marked and specified in the pathology report. Of the 55 patients, 39 (70.9%) had a positive LN at ALND. Of these 55 patients, 11 (20%) had positive ARM nodes. The ARM LN was the only positive node in 3 of the 11 patients.Conclusion In the contemporary patient population undergoing ALND, the positivity rate of the ARM LN was relatively high, suggesting that leaving ARM LNs in patients undergoing ALND may not be oncologically safe.

TI  - The lavatory lens: Tracking the global movement of pathogens via aircraft wastewater
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Modern commercial air travel connects disparate human populations. The global airline industry transported as many as 4.5 billion passengers annually in the years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic. While such connections are convenient for commerce and tourism, air travel networks can also be efficient distributors of infectious diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health agencies used multi-layered control strategies to manage the risk of COVID-19 transmission associated with air travel. Simultaneously, the surveillance of aircraft wastewater was further developed as a promising new method to screen for COVID-19, including newly emerging lineages, among international travelers. Herein, we review the potential of aircraft wastewater for public health surveillance. The known itinerary and defined passenger population along with the highly concentrated waste stream and ease of sampling during routine ground handling make aircraft wastewater a strategic opportunity for unintrusive surveillance of the global circulation of human pathogens. We estimate in the case of a fecal- or urine-shed pathogen, surveying 10% of all global long-haul flight passengers would require sampling from 3,500 and 1,250 flights per week, respectively. In the case of the United States, achieving 10% coverage of all international arrivals would require sampling from 925 and 322 flights per week for each shedding pathway, respectively. Aircraft wastewater surveillance can also be integrated with network and infectious disease models to better target traditional public health control measures during epidemic onset. Given the demonstrated potential for public good and the tremendous economic costs of epidemics, governments should consider international collaboration and investment to create a global aircraft wastewater surveillance system.

TI  - Hyperspectral discrimination of <i>Eichhornia crassipes covers,</i> in the red edge and near infrared in a Mediterranean river
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral data are important for determining and discriminating the spectral signature of invasive aquatic species. Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is a dangerous invasive species that has occupied the Al Kabir River in Lebanon since 2006. It forms a dense carpet of different physiological and morphological states and coexists with other vegetation species. This study aimed to use hyperspectral data acquired by a field spectroradiometer to (1) determine the spectral signature of monospecific water hyacinth cover in different morphological and physiological states to discriminate it from those of (2) mixed water hyacinth covers and (3) other plant targets. To this end, six hyperspectral bands (740, 783, 842, 865, 945, and 705 nm) were selected, the first five of which are present as Sentinel-2 bands (B6-B9, respectively) in the red-edge and near-infrared (NIR) spectral zones. Water hyacinth covers and those of other species in these bands were discriminated based on three main criteria: value, shape, and slope. Ten slopes (S-i) and 12 vegetation indices (10 Normalized Vegetation Indices (NVIs), Cl red-edge, and NDRE2) were calculated. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were also applied to classify the targets. The spectral signature of water hyacinth covers differed from those of other plant targets. It had high reflectance, a specific shape of the spectral curve, and the lowest slope and NVIs, especially using combined red-edge and NIR bands (783-865 and 783-954 nm, respectively). In addition, slopes were considered more useful than NVIs for discriminating water hyacinth covers. This hyperspectral spectroradiometer study can be used and combined with Sentinel-2 data in the these red-edge and NIR bands to detect and monitor invasive species at different spatial scales (20 and 60 m resolutions).

TI  - Identifying coal mining subsidence impacts by soil moisture based on optical trapezoid model in Google Earth Engine
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many coal mining areas overlapped with agricultural land in the world. However, surface subsidence and waterlogging brought on by coal mining inexorably harm the agricultural land. Soil moisture can reflect the variation of mining impact significantly according to the geographic features of the high underground water table, which shows significant spatial gradient variation within the subsidence basin. Previous studies have used site survey and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which are not applicable to large-scale assessments of the ecological impacts and defining the scale of impacts. Here, we used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and an optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) to estimate the soil moisture distribution around 50 mining subsidence waterbody samples in eastern China. Based on the spatial variation in soil moisture, the impact boundary of coal mining was determined using buffer analysis and trend fitting. The results showed that: (1) The OPTRAM can well reflect the soil moisture distribution which shows a good correlation between estimated and measured values, with R = 0.83 and RMSE = 0.054. (2) The spatial trend fitting of soil moisture is suitable for evaluating mining impact, and the impact distances are in the range of 96-762 m, 80% of which are located at 128-436 m. We also find that 28% of subsidence waterbody buffer basins were heavily influenced by human activities, and the coal mining impact boundaries cannot be effectively identified. The study provides a new idea to quantify the ecological and agricultural impact boundary of coal mining, which could be applied to other similar regions across the globe.

T2  - PIGMENT CELL & MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) provides important prognostic information for early-stage melanomas. However, statistics regarding the survival comparison between SLNB and nodal observation in Asia, where acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) predominates, are limited. This study aimed to identify if SLNB offered survival benefits over nodal observation in early-stage melanomas in Taiwan. The retrospective study included 227 patients who met the SLNB criteria according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and were treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from June 1997 to June 2021. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Of the study population, ALM accounted for 73.1%; 161 patients (70.9%) underwent SLNB and 66 patients (29.1%) were under nodal observation. Multivariate analysis showed significantly improved melanoma-specific survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.6; p = .02) in the SLNB group. Among those who underwent completion lymph node dissection (CLND), the non-sentinel node positivity rate was 44.4%. Immediate CLND resulted in significantly longer melanoma-specific survival and distant-metastasis-free survival (DMFS) compared to nodal observation. (HR, 0.2; p = .01 for melanoma-specific survival. HR, 0.3; p = .046 for DMFS). In conclusion, SLNB may provide survival benefits of cutaneous melanoma over nodal observation in the Taiwanese population.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of evapotranspiration in the Xiangjiang River Basin from 2000 to 2020
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial parameter in the process of the hydrological cycle. It is of great significance for water resource management and the improvement of ecological systems in the Xiangjiang River Basin (XRB) to explore the spatial and temporal dynamic characteristics of ET. Based on MOD16, this study revealed the characteristics of spatial and temporal patterns of ET in the XRB from 2000 to 2020. We first applied land use data and change rate for overall trend analysis on ET. Then, we obtained spatiotemporal migration routes of ET through standard deviation ellipse (SDE). Furthermore, we demonstrated the effects of monsoon and urban expansion on ET change. Accordingly, we observed the following novel spatiotemporal patterns of ET: (1) while the ET of artificial surfaces decreased from 2000 to 2020, the change rate in most regions of the XRB was 8.83%, indicating that the overall trend of ET in the XRB was increasing. (2) At 10-year intervals, the SDE center of ET all migrated in a clockwise direction. (3) The correlation between precipitation and ET is more obvious than that between temperature and ET. (4) With the direct effects of monsoon on precipitation in East Asia, we found that the changes in precipitation are consistent with the ET change.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the aim was to create daily ground-level NO2 maps for Vietnam spanning from 2019 to 2021. To achieve this, various machine learning models (including the Mixed Effect Model, Neural Network, and LightGBM) were utilized to process satellite NO2 tropospheric columns from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and TROPOMI, as well as meteorological and land use maps and ground measurement NO2 data. The LightGBM model was found to be the most effective, producing results with a Pearson r of 0.77, RMSE of 7.93 mu g/m(3), and Mean Relative Error (MRE) of 42.6% compared to ground truth measurements. The annual average NO2 maps from 2019-2021 obtained by the LightGBM model for Vietnam were compared to a global product and ground stations, and it was found to have superior quality with Pearson r of 0.95, RMSE of 2.27 mu g/m(3), MRE of 9.79%, based on 81 samples.

TI  - Potential anthropogenic and climatic factors affecting Iran's international wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Human development has reached more than 80% of the earth's surface and in Iran has had devastating effects on aquatic ecosystems such as wetlands. In addition to human development, climate change is also an important factor that threatens the health of Iran's wetlands. Very few studies have examined the major threats to Iran's international wetlands, and it is not clear to what extent these wetlands are affected by anthropogenic and climatic pressures. Therefore, determining how vulnerable these ecosystems are to human development and climate change can help us better manage and restore them. In this regard, this study is aimed at measuring the changes in water bodies of 24 international wetlands when comparing late summer 2000 and 2020 using Landsat images. Next, we calculate the upstream dams' water bodies and discover the long-term trend of precipitation and temperature changes around the wetlands. Our results show that nine wetlands, most of which were marine and estuarine, increased in area between 2000 and 2020. However, eleven wetlands experienced a 1.0-53.5% decrease in their water area by 2020. Our findings suggest that climate change can be a significant factor affecting some of the wetlands studied. Conversely, certain wetlands have experienced a rising trend in precipitation between 2000 and 2020, making it challenging to link the decline in their water levels to climate change. Nevertheless, for seven of the wetlands, we observe an increase in the water areas of upstream dams between 2000 and 2020 and find no strong evidence for climate change effects. Therefore, the construction of dams upstream may be the primary reason for the drying of these wetlands, and in this case, more of a threat than climate change.

TI  - Who Is Skeptical About Scientific Innovation? Examining Worldview Predictors of Artificial Intelligence, Nanotechnology, and Human Gene Editing Attitudes
T2  - SCIENCE COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This work examines worldview predictors of attitudes toward nanotechnology, human gene editing (HGE), and artificial intelligence. By simultaneously assessing the relative predictive value of various worldview variables in two Dutch samples (total N = 614), we obtained evidence for spirituality as a key predictor of skepticism across domains. Religiosity consistently predicted HGE skepticism only. Lower faith in science contributed to these relationships. Aversion to tampering with nature predicted skepticism across domains. These results speak to the importance of religiosity and spirituality for scientific innovation attitudes and emphasize the need for a detailed consideration of worldviews that shape these attitudes.

TI  - AN EXPLORATIVE ANALYSIS OF LAND USE LAND COVER CHANGES AND HYDROMETEOROLOGY OF THE VAIGAI RIVER BASIN, INDIA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The impact of land use and land cover changes (LULCC) is one of the major contributors to increasing greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. At the terrestrial surface, the impact of LULCC is realized in altered hydrology. Conversion of cultivable lands into fallow lands severely affects crop production in agriculturally dominant basins such as the Vaigai River Basin (VRB) in Tamil Nadu, India. Considered as a granary of South Tamil Nadu, any LULCC in VRB results in uncertainty in food production. Therefore, in this study, Landsat images were used to evaluate changes in land use and MODIS NDVI images to estimate changes in browning and greening in VRB during 2001-2020. We also analyzed the rainfall and river discharge in the basin to understand the variations from 2001 to 2019 concerning LULCC. The results showed an increase of seventy-seven percent in fallow lands between 2010 and 2020 and a forty-one to fifty-nine percent increase in urban settlements between 2001 and 2020 in the basin. The impacts of LULCC were realized in monsoon rainfall with no change in river discharge in the lower Vaigai Basin. The study results will aid regulated land use planning and encourage further research on feedback between terrestrial and atmospheric water fluxes for ensuring food security.

TI  - Association of Axillary Dissection With Systemic Therapy in Patients With Clinically Node-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - JAMA SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Importance: The role of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) to determine nodal burden to inform systemic therapy recommendations in patients with clinically node (cN)-positive breast cancer (BC) is currently unknown.Objective: To address the association of ALND with systemic therapy in cN-positive BC in the upfront surgery setting and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a prospective, observational, cohort study conducted from August 2018 to June 2022. This was a preplanned study within the phase 3 randomized clinical OPBC-03/TAXIS trial. Included were patients with confirmed cN-positive BC from 44 private, public, and academic breast centers in 6 European countries. After NACT, residual nodal disease was mandatory, and a minimum follow-up of 2 months was required.Exposures: All patients underwent tailored axillary surgery (TAS) followed by ALND or axillary radiotherapy (ART) according to TAXIS randomization. TAS removed suspicious palpable and sentinel nodes, whereas imaging-guidance was optional. Systemic therapy recommendations were at the discretion of the local investigators.Results: A total of 500 patients (median [IQR] age, 57 [48-69] years; 487 female [97.4%]) were included in the study. In the upfront surgery setting, 296 of 335 patients (88.4%) had hormone receptor (HR)-positive and Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2; formerly HER2 or HER2/neu)-negative disease: 145 (49.0%) underwent ART, and 151 (51.0%) underwent ALND. The median (IQR) number of removed positive lymph nodes without ALND was 3 (1-4) nodes compared with 4 (2-9) nodes with ALND. There was no association of ALND with the proportion of patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy (81 of 145 [55.9%] vs 91 of 151 [60.3%]; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.19-2.67) and type of systemic therapy. Of 151 patients with NACT, 74 (51.0%) underwent ART, and 77 (49.0%) underwent ALND. The ratio of removed to positive nodes was a median (IQR) of 4 (3-7) nodes to 2 (1-3) nodes and 15 (12-19) nodes to 2 (1-5) nodes in the ART and ALND groups, respectively. There was no observed association of ALND with the proportion of patients undergoing postneoadjuvant systemic therapy (57 of 74 [77.0%] vs 55 of 77 [71.4%]; aOR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.43-1.70), type of postneoadjuvant chemotherapy (eg, capecitabine: 10 of 74 [13.5%] vs 10 of 77 [13.0%]; trastuzumab emtansine-DM1: 9 of 74 [12.2%] vs 11 of 77 [14.3%]), or endocrine therapy (eg, aromatase inhibitors: 41 of 74 [55.4%] vs 36 of 77 [46.8%]; tamoxifen: 8 of 74 [10.8%] vs 6 of 77 [7.8%]).Conclusion: Results of this cohort study suggest that patients without ALND were significantly understaged. However, ALND did not inform systemic therapy recommendations.

TI  - Constructing Oxygen-Related Defects in Carbon Nanodots with Janus Optical Properties: Noninvasive NIR Fluorescent Imaging and Effective Photocatalytic Therapy
T2  - ADVANCED MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Noninvasive fluorescence (FL) imaging and high-performance photocatalytic therapy (PCT) are opposing optical properties that are difficult to combine in a single material system. Herein, a facile approach to introducing oxygen-related defects in carbon dots (CDs) via post-oxidation with 2-iodoxybenzoic acid is reported, in which some nitrogen atoms are substituted by oxygen atoms. Unpaired electrons in these oxygen-related defects rearrange the electronic structure of the oxidized CDs (ox-CDs), resulting in an emerging near-infrared (NIR) absorption band. These defects not only contribute to enhanced NIR bandgap emission but also act as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to abundant photo-generated holes on the ox-CDs surface under visible-light irradiation. Under white LED torch irradiation, the photo-generated holes oxidize hydroxide to hydroxyl radicals in the acidification of the aqueous solution. In contrast, no hydroxyl radicals are detected in the ox-CDs aqueous solution under 730 nm laser irradiation, indicating noninvasive NIR FL imaging potential. Utilizing the Janus optical properties of the ox-CDs, the in vivo NIR FL imaging of sentinel lymph nodes around tumors and efficient photothermal enhanced tumor PCT are demonstrated.

TI  - Effect of forest fire on tree diversity and regeneration in the forests of Uttarakhand, Western Himalaya, India
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of forest fires on tree diversity and their regeneration in three fire-prone forests of Uttarakhand, India. We used Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite imagery to prepare fire frequency maps and the study area was divided into four fire frequency classes. Ten plots were marked in each fire frequency class to assess diversity and regeneration pattern of tree species. A total of 14 tree species belonging to 14 genera and 13 families were sampled during the study period. We found that tree species diversity was higher in areas with low fire frequencies in comparison to the areas with no fire frequency class. We also observed that regeneration of tree species varied significantly across all fire frequency classes and forest types, with increasing dominance of certain fire-tolerant species in areas with frequent fires. Of the 33,678 individuals (tree, sapling, and seedling) recorded in all the fire frequency classes, 12,630 were in Sal Forest, 8,033 were in Chir-pine Forest, and 13,015 were in Mixed Forest. The study suggests that if forest fire incidences continue at current levels, the forests could experience a decline in tree diversity. Although forest fire is a natural occurrence in many ecosystems, the increasing frequency and intensity of fires due to human activities such as land-use change and climate change have disrupted the natural fire regime.

T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - We present an updated (v2) catalog of NOx emissions from point sources as derived from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) measurements of NO2 (Products Algorithm Laboratory (PAL) product) combined with wind fields from ERA5. Compared to version 1 of the catalog (Beirle et al., 2021), several improvements have been introduced to the algorithm. Most importantly, several corrections are applied, accounting for the effects of plume height on satellite sensitivity, 3D topographic effects, and the chemical loss of NOx, resulting in considerably higher and more accurate NOx emissions. In addition, error estimates are provided for each point source, taking into account the uncertainties of the individual retrieval steps.The v2 catalog is based on a fully automated iterative detection algorithm of point sources worldwide. It lists 1139 locations that have been found to be significant NOx sources. The majority of these locations match power plants listed in the Global Power Plant Database (GPPD). Other NOx point sources correspond to cement plants, metal smelters, industrial areas, or medium-sized cities.The emissions listed in v2 of the catalog show good agreement (within 20% on average) to emissions reported by the German Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA) as well as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The data are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.26050/WDCC/No_xPointEmissionsV2 (Beirle et al., 2023).

TI  - Transport of Mineral Dust Into the Arctic in Two Reanalysis Datasets of Atmospheric Composition
T2  - TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Two three-dimensional reanalysis datasets of atmospheric composition, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service reanalysis (CAMSRA) and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), are analyzed for the years 2003-2018 with respect to dust transport into the Arctic. The reanalyses agree on that the largest mass transport of dust into the Arctic occurs across western Russia during spring and early summer, but substantial transport events occasionally also occur across other geographical areas during all seasons. In many aspects, however, the reanalyses show considerable differences: the mass transport in MERRA-2 is substantially larger, more spread out, and occurs at higher altitudes than in CAMSRA, while the transport in CAMSRA is to a higher degree focused to well-defined events in space and time; the integrated mass transport of the 10 most intense 36-hour dust events in CAMSRA constitutes 6 % of the total integrated dust transport 2003-2018, whereas the corresponding value for MERRA-2 is only 1 %.Furthermore, we compare the reanalyses with surface measurements of dust in the Arctic and dust extinction retrievals from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) satellite data. This comparison indicates that CAMSRA underestimates the dust transport into the Arctic and that MERRA-2 likely overestimates it. The discrepancy between CAMSRA and MERRA-2 can partially be explained by the assimilation process where too little dust is assimilated in CAMSRA while in MERRA-2, the assimilation process increases the dust concentration in remote areas. Despite the profound differences between the reanalyses regarding dust transport into the Arctic, this study still brings new insights into the spatio-temporal distribution of the transport. We estimate the annual dust transport into the Arctic to be within the range 1.5-31 Tg, where the comparison with observations indicates that the lower end of the interval is less likely.

TI  - Drought vulnerability of central Sahel agrosystems: a modelling-approach based on magnitudes of changes and machine learning techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought is a complex phenomenon with numerous consequences and negative implications for agriculture and food systems. The Sahel is frequently affected by severe droughts, leading to significant losses in agricultural yields. Consequently, assessing vulnerability to agricultural drought is essential for strengthening early warning systems. The aim of this study is to develop a new multivariate agricultural drought vulnerability index (MADVI) that combines static and dynamic factors extracted from satellite data. First, pixel temporal regression from 1981 to 2021 was applied to climatic and biophysical covariates to determine the gradients of trend magnitudes. Second, principal component analysis was applied to groups of factors that indicate the same type of vulnerability to configure the basic equation of vulnerability to agricultural drought. Then, random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB) were used to predict drought vulnerability classes using the 28 factors as inputs and 708 pts of randomly distributed class labels. The results showed statistical agreement between the predicted MADVI spatial variability and the reference model (R=0.86 for RF) and its statistical relationships with the vulnerability subcomponents, with an R=0.73 with exposure to climate risk, R=0.64 with the socioeconomic sensitivity index, R=0.6 with the biophysical sensitivity index and a relatively weak correlation (R=0.21) with the physiographic sensitivity index. The overall vulnerability situation in the watershed is 21.8% extreme, 10% very high, 16.8% high, 27.7% moderate, 22.2% low and 1.5% relatively low considering the cartographic results of the predicted vulnerability classes with SVM having the best performance (accuracy=0.96, Kappa=0.95). The study is the first approach that uses the gradients of magnitudes of satellite covariate anomaly trends in multivariate modelling of vulnerability to agricultural drought. It can be easily scaled up across the Sahel region to improve early warning measures related to the impacts of agricultural drought.

TI  - Black carbon concentrations and modeled smoke deposition fluxes to the bare-ice dark zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice-albedo feedbacks in the ablation region of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) are difficult to constrain and model due, in part, to our limited understanding of the seasonal evolution of the bare-ice region. To help fill observational gaps, 13 surface samples were collected on the GrIS across the 2014 summer melt season from patches of snow and ice that were visibly light, medium, and dark colored. These samples were analyzed for their refractory black carbon (rBC) concentrations and size distributions with a singleparticle soot photometer coupled to a characterized nebulizer. We present a size distribution of rBC in fresh snow on the GrIS and from the weathering crust in the bare-ice dark zone of the GrIS. The size distributions from the weathering crust samples appear unimodal and were overall smaller than the fresh snow sample, with a peak around 0.3 mu m. The fresh snow sample contained very large rBC particles that had a pronounced bimodality in the peak size distributions, with peaks around 0.2 and 2 mu m. rBC concentrations ranged from a minimum of 3 mu g-rBC=L-H2O in lightcolored patches at the beginning and end of the melt season to a maximum of 32 mu g-rBC=L-H2O in a dark patch in early August. On average, the rBC concentrations were higher (20 +/- 10 mu g-rBC+L-H2O) in patches that were visibly dark, compared to medium patches (7 +/- 2 mu g-rBC=L-H2O) and light patches (4 +/- 1 mu g-rBC=L-H2O), suggesting that BC aggregation contributed to snow aging on the GrIS, and vice versa. Additionally, concentrations peaked in light and dark patches in early August, which is likely due to smoke transport from wildfires in northern Canada and Alaska, as supported by the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) reanalysis model. A ccording to the model output, 26 mg m(-3) of biomass-burning-derived smoke was deposited between 1 April and 30 August, of which 85% came from wet deposition, and 67% was deposited during our sample collection time frame. The increase in the rBC concentration and size distributions immediately after the modeled smoke deposition fluxes suggest that biomass burning smoke is a source of BC to the dark zone of the GrIS. Thus, the role of BC in the seasonal evolution of the ice-albedo feedbacks should continue to be investigated in the weathering crust of the bare-ice zone of the GrIS.

TI  - Characterizing the surge behaviour and associated ice-dammed lake evolutionof the Kyagar Glacier in the Karakoram
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surges are prevalent in the Karakoram andoccasionally threaten local residents by inundating land and initiating massmovement events. The Kyagar Glacier is well known for its surge history, andin particular its frequent blocking of the downstream valley, leading to aseries of high-magnitude glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Although the surgedynamics of the Kyagar Glacier have been broadly described in theliterature, there remains an extensive archive of remote sensingobservations that have great potential for revealing specific surgecharacteristics and their relationship with historic lake outburst floods.In this study, we propose a new perspective on quantifying the surgingprocess using successive digital elevation models (DEMs), which could beapplied to other sites where glacier surges are known to occur. AdvancedSpaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer DEMs, High MountainAsia 8-meter DEMs, and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM were used tocharacterize surface elevation changes throughout the period from 2000 to2021. We also used Landsat time series imagery to quantify glacier surfacevelocities and associated lake changes over the course of two surge eventsbetween 1989 and 2021. Using these datasets, we reconstruct the surgingprocess of the Kyagar Glacier in unprecedented detail and find a clear signal ofsurface uplift over the lower glacier tongue, along with uniformlyincreasing velocities, associated with the period of surge initiation.Seasonal variations in surface flow are still evident throughout the surgephase, indicating the presence of water at the glacier bed. Surge activity of theKyagar Glacier is strongly related to the development and drainage of theterminal ice-dammed lake, which itself is controlled by the drainage systembeneath the glacier terminus.

TI  - Six Years of the US Food and Drug Administration's Postmarket Active Risk Identification and Analysis System in the Sentinel Initiative: Implications for Real World Evidence Generation
T2  - CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Congress mandated the creation of a postmarket Active Risk Identification and Analysis (ARIA) system containing data on 100 million individuals for monitoring risks associated with drug and biologic products using data from disparate sources to complement the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) existing postmarket capabilities. We report on the first 6 years of ARIA utilization in the Sentinel System (2016-2021). The FDA has used the ARIA system to evaluate 133 safety concerns; 54 of these evaluations have closed with regulatory determinations, whereas the rest remain in progress. If the ARIA system and the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System are deemed insufficient to address a safety concern, then the FDA may issue a postmarket requirement to a product's manufacturer. One hundred ninety-seven ARIA insufficiency determinations have been made. The most common situation for which ARIA was found to be insufficient is the evaluation of adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes following in utero drug exposure, followed by neoplasms and death. ARIA was most likely to be sufficient for thromboembolic events, which have high positive predictive value in claims data alone and do not require supplemental clinical data. The lessons learned from this experience illustrate the continued challenges using administrative claims data, especially to define novel clinical outcomes. This analysis can help to identify where more granular clinical data are needed to fill gaps to improve the use of real-world data for drug safety analyses and provide insights into what is needed to efficiently generate high-quality real-world evidence for efficacy.

TI  - Transforming consumption: The role of values, beliefs, and norms in promoting four types of sustainable behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study examines the value based predicting factors of sustainable consumption (SC) behaviors of individuals by examining four types of environmentally significant consumer behavior, that is, purchase, household energy and water usage, mobility, and recycling. A structured questionnaire-based survey was used to collect data and verify the research framework guiding the hypotheses for all four types of consumer behavior. Four separate Structural Equation Models (SEM) were utilized to test the formulated hypotheses and model using the data from 1025 respondents (281 for purchase, 265 for household energy and water use, 273 for mobility, and 206 for recycling) ages 18-74. The results indicate that the extended version of value-belief-norm (VBN) theory could provide a good explanation of the sustainable purchase behaviors of consumers, compared to household energy and water usage, mobility, and recycling. The results of the study suggest that having high levels of biospheric values, ecological worldview, personal norms, behavioral intention, awareness of consequences, ascription of responsibility, and low egoistic values have influence on consumers when they make eco-friendly product purchases. Although similar results are found for other examined behaviors, the model fits are not as strong and explanatory powers are lower. This research reveals that marketing managers need to adopt differential marketing strategies to influence consumer sustainable decision-making in the four environmentally significant behaviors of purchase, energy and water usage, mobility, and recycling. This paper concludes with policy implications of the findings for marketers and policymakers, as well as potential directions for further research.

TI  - Snow cover persistence as a useful predictor of alpine plant distributions
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Snow cover persistence (SCP) has significant effects on plants in high-elevation ecosystems. It determines the length of the growing season, provides insulation against low temperatures and influences water availability, thereby shaping the vegetation mosaic. Despite its importance, SCP is rarely used in plant species distribution modelling. In this study, we examine whether incorporating SCP in plant species distribution models (SDMs) improves their predictive power. We investigate the link between species' ecology and SDM improvements by the addition of various SCP predictors.Location Western Swiss Alps.Taxon 206 alpine flowering plants (angiosperms).Methods We produced three maps of landsat satellite-based SCP indices over an entire mountain region, one of them using an online open access platform allowing quick and easy replication and used them as a predictor in plant SDMs alongside commonly used predictors. We tested whether this improved the predictive performance of plant SDMs.Results All three SCP indices improved the overall SDM predictive accuracy, but the overall improvement was potentially limited by their correlation with other climatic predictors. Alpine plant species known for their dependence on snow benefited more from the additional snow information.Main Conclusions SCP should be used for predicting at least the distribution of alpine, snow-related plant species. Given that adding snow cover improves SDMs and that snow duration decreases as climate warms, future predictions of alpine plant distributions should account for both snow predictor and associated snow change scenarios.

TI  - Upscaling field-measured seasonal ground vegetation patterns with Sentinel-2 images in boreal ecosystems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) and leaf area index (LAI) are key variables of ecosystem processes and functioning. Knowledge is lacking on how well the seasonal patterns of ground vegetation AGB and LAI can be detected by satellite images in boreal ecosystems. We conducted field measurements between May and September during one growing season to investigate the seasonal development of ground vegetation AGB and LAI of seven plant functional types (PFTs) across seven vegetation types (VTs) within three peatland and forest study areas in northern Finland. We upscaled field-measured AGB and LAI with Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery by applying random forest (RF) regressions. Field-measured AGB peaked around the first week of August and, in most cases, one to two weeks later than LAI. Regarding PFTs, deciduous vascular plants had clear unimodal seasonal patterns, while the AGB and LAI of evergreen vegetation and mosses remained steady over the season. Remote sensing regression models explained 24.2-50.2% of the AGB (RMSE: 78.8-198.7 g m(-2)) and 48.5-56.1% of the LAI (RMSE: 0.207-0.497 m(2) m(-2)) across sites. Peatland-dominant sites and VTs had a higher prediction accuracy. S2-predicted peak dates of AGB and LAI were one to three weeks earlier than the field-based ones. Our findings suggest that boreal ground vegetation seasonality varies among PFTs and VTs and that S2 time series data can be applied to monitor its spatiotemporal patterns, especially in treeless regions.

TI  - Glacier retreat, dynamics and bed overdeepenings of Parkachik Glacier, Ladakh Himalaya, India
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study describes the morphological and dynamic changes of Parkachik Glacier, Suru River valley, Ladakh Himalaya, India. We used medium-resolution satellite images; CORONA KH-4, Landsat and Sentinel-2A from 1971-2021, and field surveys between 2015 and 2021. In addition, we used the laminar flow-based Himalayan Glacier Thickness Mapper and provide results for recent margin fluctuations, surface ice velocity, ice thickness, and identified glacier-bed overdeepenings. The results revealed that overall the glacier retreated by -210.5 +/- 80m with an average rate of 4 +/- 1ma(-1) between 1971 and 2021. Whereas a field study suggested that the glacier retreat increased to -123 +/- 72m at an average rate of -20 +/- 12ma(-1) between 2015 and 2021. Surface ice velocity was estimated using COSI-Corr on the Landsat data. Surface ice velocity in the lower ablation zone was 45 +/- 2ma-(1) in 1999-2000 and 32 +/- 1ma(-1) in 2020-2021, thus reduced by 28%. Further, the maximum thickness of the glacier is estimated to be similar to 441m in the accumulation zone, while for glacier tongue it is similar to 44 m. The simulation results suggest that if the glacier continues to retreat at a similar rate, three lakes of different dimensions may form in subglacial overdeepenings.

TI  - Changes in glacier albedo and the driving factors in the Western Nyainqentanglha Mountains from 2001 to 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Glacier surface albedo dominates glacier energy balance, thus strongly affecting the glacier mass balance. Glaciers in the Western Nyainqentanglha Mountains (WNM) experienced large mass losses in the past two decades, but long-term changes of glacier albedo and its drivers are less understood. In this study, we retrieved glacier albedo with MODIS reflectance data to characterize the spatiotemporal variability of albedo from 2001 to 2020. Air temperature, rainfall, snowfall and deposition of light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) were evaluated as potential drivers of the observed variability in glacier albedo. The results showed that: (1) the glacier albedo experienced large inter-annual fluctuations, with the mean albedo being 0.552 & PLUSMN; 0.002 and a clear decreasing trend of 0.0443 & PLUSMN; 2 x 10-4 dec-1 in the WNM. The fastest decline was observed in autumn and in the vicinity of the equilibrium line altitude, indicating an extended melt season and an expansion of the ablation region to higher elevation; (2) local meteorology and LAIs deposition are the main drivers of glacier albedo change, but their effects on seasonal albedos are different due to different glacier processes. Both air temperature and the balance between liquid and solid precipitation affect summer and autumn albedos due to glacier ablation. Air temperature is the main driver of spring and winter albedos due to sublimation and metamorphism of snow, while snowfall carried by westerlies has limited influence on these two seasonal albedos due to less snowfall. LAIs mainly affect spring albedo due to high concentration coupled with the southerly wind in spring. These findings highlight the significance of changes in glacier albedo and the key role of local meteorology and LAIs deposition in determining such changes, which play an important role in glaciological and cryosphere processes.

TI  - Relationships between land use types and urban heat island intensity in Hulu Langat district, Selangor, Malaysia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundUrban heat island (UHI) is an urban climate phenomenon that primarily responds to urban conditions and land use change. The extent of hard surfaces significantly influences the thermal properties of the land. To address this issue, a novel approach quantifying the association between land use and UHI is developed. This study offers a new technique for effectively estimating the effect of land use on the UHI intensity using the combination of urban heat intensity index (UHII) and land contribution index (LCI) derived from Landsat 8 OLI images. The time-series thermal effect of land use on the UHI intensity can be determined according to the ratio in mean temperature between specific land use and the whole study site. The study was conducted in the Hulu Langat district, Malaysia during 2014-2021.ResultsThe UHI intensity rose from 0.19 in 2014 to 0.70 in 2021. The negative value of LCI for vegetation areas and water bodies obtained its negative contribution to the urban heat island, while the positive value of LCI for bare areas and built-up areas showed its positive effect on the urban heat island. The LCI value for urban areas showed a significant increase in the 7 years such as 0.51, 0.66, 0.69, and 0.75 for periods 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2021, respectively. The change in LCI from 2014 to 2021 for the transformation of bare area and forest was recorded to be 0.23 and - 0.02, respectively. Thus, the conversion of forests into urban areas had a negative effect on the increment of UHI intensity. ConclusionsOverall, these findings are useful for policy-making agency in developing an effective policy for reducing high UHI intensity and planning long-term land use management.

TI  - A method to pan-sharpen SAR amplitude data via electromagnetic reflectance similarities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For a long time, the idea of fusing synthetic radar imagery (SAR) and higher-resolution panchromatic imagery, with the aim of increasing the spatial resolution of radar imagery, has been conceived as impossible. The challenge is due to the different natures of microwave radiation and visible radiation, where the former is the spectrum of SAR imagery, and the latter is of panchromatic imagery. Average reflection amplitude, which constitutes pixel values on both panchromatic and SAR imagery, is taken as a common framework around which this study proposes a method that enables the translation of an array on a panchromatic spectrum into an array of C-band microwave spectrum in order to achieve a higher spatial resolution. In this regard, open-access Worldview-2 and Worldview-3 panchromatic and Sentinel-1 (amplitude-only) images are used. The outputs are qualified using spatial correlation coefficient (SCC), net histogram curve, and R-2 difference, and Erreur relative globale adimensionnelle de synthese (ERGAS) as full-reference image quality assessment methods in various scenarios. The results are tenable enough to consider this method for ordinary earth observation and monitoring objectives.

TI  - An optimum datasets analysis for monitoring crops using remotely sensed Sentinel-1A SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To effectively monitor crops, it is necessary to select extremely redundant satellite images and to know the number of acquisitions required for a specific period to analyse cropping patterns, thereby reducing analysis time. In this paper, we have examined an empirical analysis for the optimum dataset (OptD) selection required to monitor the crops. Sentinel-1 dual-polarized SAR datasets were used in this study to illustrate the effectiveness of optimum datasets required for the considered crops (ginger, tobacco, rice, cabbage, and pumpkin). In this work, at first, the entropy and alpha bands were treated as cluster centres for crop decomposition and its scattering mechanism using the cluster-based K-means unsupervised classification technique. The clusters are plotted on the H-a plane to get the H-a plot of dual-polarization SAR data for target decomposition. To understand the dominance of scattering type with crop growth stage, the obtained scattering distribution from the H-alpha plot is scaled to a percentage analysis. Based on qualitative observations of the percent scattering distribution of crop pixels over a h-alpha plot and backscattering coefficient behaviour at different crop growth stages, an empirical approach has been used to select dataset reduction. It has been suggested that the combination of successive repeated data with similar scattering analysis of combined h-alpha plots and backscattering analysis is the best reduced dataset selection for effective crop monitoring. From the analysis, the optimum dataset required for monitoring Ginger (from the flourishing stage), Tobacco, Paddy, Cabbage, and Pumpkin has been identified, and found that the tobacco crop requires fewer datasets, whereas the rice crop requires a greater number of datasets for monitoring. Despite the challenges associated with, p-bias for the crops was achieved at good levels, given that, lowering the datasets to obtain the optimal number without significantly reducing the accuracy of the data.

TI  - A pansharpening method combining iterative filtering and NSST-NSML-PAPCNN to optimize spatial detail extraction and injection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial injection-based pansharpening methods are prone to spatial or spectral distortions in pansharpening images due to insufficient extraction of spatial details and a mismatch between the amount of spatial detail information injected and the required amount. To this end, this paper proposes a pansharpening method that optimizes spatial detail extraction and injection. Firstly, a method to optimize the amount of spatial detail injection is proposed, that is, to extract the high-frequency information of the image through iterative filtering and determine the optimal number of iterations based on the global analysis of the method. Then, to fully extract and combine the spatial detail information of the source image, the detailed high-frequency image extracted corresponding to the optimal iterative filtering times is decomposed by non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST), and a new multi-scale sum-modified-Laplacian (NSML) as an external stimulus to a parameter-adaptive pulse-coupled neural network model (PAPCNN). A fusion rule based on multi-scale morphological gradients is designed to extract a small amount of detailed information for the low-frequency subband. The fused spatial detail image can be obtained by combining the fused low-frequency and high-frequency subbands and inverse NSST transformation. Finally, pansharpening can be realized by combining spatial detail image, injection coefficient, and MS image. In this paper, many experiments are carried out on the QuickBird, GeoEye-1, and WorldView-4 datasets, and quantitative and qualitative comparisons are made with eight advanced methods. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can achieve better fusion results.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sino-US geostrategic rivalry has carried over into cyberspace and is reflected in how both the United States and China view the internet as a battleground for the propagation of information warfare in their bids to increase global influence at the expense of the other. Both the United States and China have harnessed cyberspace in order to propagate their worldview to a global audience, whilst countering and rebutting the other's information narrative. The flow of information - including the use of cyberspace to inject misinformation, deliberately biased reporting, cover-ups, and fabricated information - can be seen as a weapon of statecraft in pursuit of global influence and geostrategic objectives. Such ability to shape the information narrative marks a refinement of the use of propaganda, to the extent that private individuals with access to social media can be seen as propaganda tools.

TI  - Assessment of Development Plans for Small Urban Areas of Bangladesh: Remote Sensing and GIS-based Approach
T2  - APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Assessment of development plans particularly in terms of land use and land cover can strategically support conventional land use planning practices. This paper attempts to assess the land cover related proposals mentioned in the development plans of two small urban areas, namely Madaripur and Rajoir of Bangladesh, which are rapidly growing and facing shrinkage of agricultural lands and water bodies by such growth. Land cover data for the study have been extracted from Landsat satellite images of 1995, 2005 and 2015. The classified satellite data have been employed in a Multi-Layer Perceptron Markov model to predict the land cover scenario of the study areas for 2035, the terminal year for the development plans. The proposed development plan and the modelpredicted land cover maps of 2035 are both quantitatively and spatially compared. The study also determines the degree of conformance and identifies the affected sites within respective protected areas. The analysis reveals significant mismatches between the development plans and the model predictions for the unconstrained simulation of the model, whereas fewer differences are observed in the case of guided simulation. The results imply that lack of implementation of the development plans may result in undesired land cover transformations. It recommends employing remote sensing and GIS-based models to support the land-use plan-making process in the development authorities.

TI  - Reforestation policies around 2000 in southern China led to forest densification and expansion in the 2010s
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest expansion has been observed in China over the past decades, but the typically applied coarse resolution satellite data does not reveal spatial details about China's forest transition. By using three decades of satellite observations at a 30-m spatial resolution, we reveal here the complex spatiotemporal patterns of individual forest stands forming the forest return history of southern China. We calculate forest age, forest densification rates, and annual forest fragmentation and show that the observed forest area surge around 2010 is a result of trees planted after 2000 that formed dense forests about a decade later. We document that old forests in the 1980s were mostly fragmented into scattered patches located on mountain tops, but forests rapidly expanded downhill by 729,540 km(2) and alleviated the clear-cut and logging pressure from old forests. Our study provides a detailed documentation of forest densification and expansion for a country that had been largely deforested three decades ago.The increase in forest area observed around 2010 in southern China is the result of trees planted after 2000 that formed dense forests about a decade later, according to an analysis of high-resolution Landsat satellite data during 1986-2020.

TI  - Current applications of indocyanine green fluorescence in colorectal surgery: a narrative review
T2  - ANNALS OF LAPAROSCOPIC AND ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background and Objective: Colorectal surgical operations are linked with a substantial risk of morbidity and mortality. Indocyanine green (ICG) dye has been proposed to potentially reduce complications, particularly anastomotic failures, by allowing surgeons to assess bowel perfusion and make perceived necessary adjustments during surgery; other applications are being investigated and implementation is ongoing; a review of the current state is presented here. Methods: A systematic search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases for literature on ICG dye usage in colorectal surgery published up to March 30, 2023 was used to perform this narrative review. A Google Scholar scoping search was also conducted to locate relevant grey material. Key Content and Findings: According to qualitative evaluation, the use of ICG dye alters the rate of anastomotic leakage (AL), although the overall impact of the effect is modest. The quantitative measurement of the ICG dye resulted in a greater magnitude of influence; however, additional research is required to demonstrate the results' statistical significance. This approach has been utilized to detect positive sentinel lymph nodes in patients with primary colorectal cancer. Ultimately, according to existing studies using ICG dye to pinpoint lesions resulted in accurate identification can be obtained in 81% of cases. Conclusions: The use of ICG dye in colorectal surgery appears to be a promising tool for qualitative and quantitative assessment of perfusion, with the goal of improving results related to ALs, accurate tumour labelling and sentinel lymph node identification, lymphatic drainage mapping, and ureter identification. Further study in this area has the potential to enhance overall patient outcomes for colorectal patients substantially.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Coconut palm tree plantation, monitoring and management in tropical countries is vital to improving exports, domestic food use and the economy. Remote sensing and GIS technologies are widely used to maintain and monitor the coconut palm's health and production using very high-resolution satellite data. Deep learning algorithms will help identify and monitor the growth and health of coconut palms automatically using satellite data. In this study, a deep learning model has been developed to identify the coconut trees using Worldview-2 satellite data. ArcGIS Pro software is used to develop the deep learning model. Single Shot Detector (SSD) algorithm is adopted for developing the model to detect the coconut trees. The model is based on the object detection technique. The generated model accurately identified the individual trees for the study area using the Worldview-2 satellite data. Produced maps will be used to calculate the population of coconut trees.

TI  - External validity in distributed data networks
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Purpose: While much has been written about how distributed networks address internal validity, external validity is rarely discussed. We aimed to define key terms related to external validity, discuss how they relate to distributed networks, and identify how three networks (the US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System, the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies [CNODES], and the National Patient Centered Clinical Research Network [PCORnet]) deal with external validity.Methods: We define external validity, target populations, target validity, generalizability, and transportability and describe how each relates to distributed networks. We then describe Sentinel, CNODES, and PCORnet and how each approaches these concepts, including a sample case study.Results: Each network approaches external validity differently. As its target population is US citizens and it includes only US data, Sentinel primarily worries about lack of external validity by not including some segments of the population. The fact that CNODES includes Canadian, United States, and United Kingdom data forces them to seriously consider whether the United States and United Kingdom data will be transportable to Canadian citizens when they meta-analyze database-specific estimates. PCORnet, with its focus on study-specific cohorts and pragmatic trials, conducts more case-by-case explorations of external validity for each new analytic data set it generates.Conclusions: There is no one-size-fits-all approach to external validity within distributed networks. With these networks and comparisons between their findings becoming a key part of pharmacoepidemiology, there is a need to adapt tools for improving external validity to the distributed network setting.

TI  - Mapping river turbidity at a large basin-scale with a spatially transferable ensemble model using Landsat 8 multispectral imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping river water quality at a basin scale with satellite image data represents a tremendous technical challenge, since traditional empirical remote sensing models calibrated for specific reaches of a river cannot be applied to all the rivers and streams in the basin with an adequate prediction accuracy. In this study, we developed a multi-predictor ensemble model to map and assess water turbidity for all rivers and streams in the Tombigbee River Basin with Landsat 8 multispectral images. Coincident with Landsat 8 satellite overpass on 2 May 2019, we conducted boat-based water quality data collection in the confluence area of Tombigbee River and Black Warrior River near the city of Demopolis, Alabama. Based on the coincident satellite image and field water samples, we calibrated and evaluated the multi-predictor ensemble model, which consists four component empirical models. Our evaluations suggest that the multi-predictor ensemble model can improve turbidity estimation accuracy by 79% in comparison with the best traditional empirical model. More importantly, our multi-predictor ensemble model can be applied to other river and stream reaches across three major sub-basins with a high prediction accuracy. With the multi-predictor ensemble model, we derived a turbidity map for all rivers and streams with a width greater than 90 m in the basin, by processing three Landsat 8 image scenes. This basin-wide turbidity map indicates that the turbidity of rivers and streams exhibits longitudinal gradients and distinct spatial trends within the basin, which were related to the basin land cover/land use, hydrometeorological condition, and the spatial distribution of dams. Owing to its strong spatial transferability and high prediction accuracy, the ensemble model, in conjunction with synoptic multispectral satellite image data, is recommended as an effective and efficient tool for mapping and monitoring river and stream water quality at a large basin or regional scale.

T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objective: To characterize residential social vulnerability among healthcare personnel (HCP) and evaluate its association with severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.Design: Case-control study.Setting: This study analyzed data collected in May-December 2020 through sentinel and population-based surveillance in healthcare facilities in Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Oregon. Participants: Data from 2,168 HCP (1,571 cases and 597 controls from the same facilities) were analyzed.Methods: HCP residential addresses were linked to the social vulnerability index (SVI) at the census tract level, which represents a ranking of community vulnerability to emergencies based on 15 US Census variables. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by positive antigen or real-time reverse-transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test on nasopharyngeal swab. Significant differences by SVI in participant characteristics were assessed using the Fisher exact test. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between case status and SVI, controlling for HCP role and patient care activities, were estimated using logistic regression.Results: Significantly higher proportions of certified nursing assistants (48.0%) and medical assistants (44.1%) resided in high SVI census tracts, compared to registered nurses (15.9%) and physicians (11.6%). HCP cases were more likely than controls to live in high SVI census tracts (aOR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.37-2.26).Conclusions: These findings suggest that residing in more socially vulnerable census tracts may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among HCP and that residential vulnerability differs by HCP role. Efforts to safeguard the US healthcare workforce and advance health equity should address the social determinants that drive racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic health disparities.

TI  - Examining TROPOMI formaldehyde to nitrogen dioxide ratios in the Lake Michigan region: implications for ozone exceedances
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface-level ozone (O-3) is a secondary air pollutant that has adverse effects on human health. In the troposphere, O3 is produced in complex cycles of photochemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Determining if O3 levels will be decreased by lowering NOx emissions ("NOx-sensitive"), VOC emissions ("VOC-sensitive"), or both ("the transition zone") can be done by using the formaldehyde (HCHO; a VOC species) to nitrogen dioxide (NO2; a component of NOx) concentration ratio (HCHO/NO2; "FNR"). Generally, lower FNR values indicate VOC sensitivity, while higher values indicate NOx sensitivity. Despite being a highly populated region with coastal O3 air quality issues, the Lake Michigan region in the United States, including the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area (CMA), remains relatively understudied, especially from the satellite perspective. In this work, we present the first study that utilizes TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite data over the Lake Michigan region from 2019-2021 to assess changes in O-3 precursor levels and the inferred O-3 chemistry sensitivity between (1) O-3 season days and CMA O-3 exceedance days and (2) weekdays and weekends. Higher NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs), HCHO VCDs, and FNR values are seen throughout the study domain on exceedance days, indicating generally more NOx-sensitive O-3 chemistry. The largest change occurs in the areal extent of the transition zone, which decreases by 40 % during exceedance days. Major urban cores in the domain (e.g., Chicago, Illinois; Gary, Indiana; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin) remain VOC-sensitive on exceedance days as the higher NO2 VCDs in these areas counterbalance the regionally higher HCHO VCDs. Utilizing 10 m wind analysis data, we show that the lake breeze circulation is stronger on exceedance days. The strengthening of the lake breeze causes stronger convergence of the wind field along the southwestern Lake Michigan coastline, which can concentrate NO2 emissions originating in this area. This finding provides a possible explanation for the higher TROPOMI NO2 VCDs over the urban core of Chicago on exceedance days. Investigation of 2 m air temperature analysis data reveals that temperatures are higher on exceedance days, which explains the stronger lake breeze circulation and provides a possible cause for the higher TROPOMI HCHO VCDs over the entire region (due to increased temperature-dependent biogenic VOC emissions). Comparing weekdays and weekends, higher FNR values throughout much of the region indicate increasingly NOx-sensitive O3 chemistry on weekends. These changes are driven by lower NO2 VCDs in urban areas, particularly in Chicago, and higher HCHO VCDs in the southern part of the domain on weekends. Overall, our analyses suggest that VOC emissions controls in major urban areas and NOx emissions controls throughout the entire domain are necessary to decrease O-3 levels in the Lake Michigan region.

TI  - Observed and projected changes in urbanization and nature conservation in a typical fast growing city of Ethiopia, Jimma
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Urbanization poses a significant threat to biodiversity, particularly in developing nations characterized by high rural-urban migration and inadequate urban planning that fails to consider nature conservation. Insufficient information on how to effectively integrate urban expansion and nature conservation exacerbates environmental problems and hampers mitigation efforts. In this study, we assessed the expansion of Jimma City, a typical rapidly growing city in Ethiopia, over the past 35 years, projected changes for the next 50 years, and identified priority areas for conservation. Landsat satellite images from 1985 and 2020 were utilized to map major land cover types and quantify temporal changes. We employed a Markov chain model to predict changes over the next 50 years and a GIS-based multi-criteria approach to identify conservation priority areas. Our findings underscore the adverse effect of urban expansion on natural habitats. Over the past three decades, built-up areas expanded by sevenfold (721%; 2227 ha) while croplands expanded by 34% (4155 ha). Conversely, natural habitats experienced significant declines: forest cover declined by 39% (5209 ha), grassland by 20% (655 ha) and wetland by 28% (638 ha). Projecting the current trend over the next 50 years showed built-up areas to further increase by about fourfold (436%, 3565 ha). However, open water, wetland, natural forest, and cropland are predicted to decline by 81% (120 ha), 40% (660 ha), 42% (3455 ha), and 55% (8848 ha), respectively. Given the current rate of population growth and rural-urban migrations, urban expansion appears inevitable. Our study emphasizes the importance of designating at least 9040 ha (28%) of the land within the city and its surroundings as high-priority areas for biodiversity conservation. These areas encompass approximately 95% of the remaining forest remnants, 78% of the wetland area, and 22% of the grassland. It is imperative for urban administrations in developing nations to adopt sound policies, strategies, and planning approaches that support the integration of urban development and nature conservation, with special attention given to the preservation of key biodiversity areas. Such efforts are crucial for fostering inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities.

TI  - Contribution of remote sensing to wildfire trend and dynamic analysis in two of Ghana's ecological zones: Guinea-savanna and Forest-savanna mosaic
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTwo of Ghana's ecological zones-Guinea-savanna zone (GSZ) and Forest-savanna mosaic zone (FSZ)-are practically homologous in terms of structure and floristic composition, with some differences. The various sub-ecosystems that make up these areas are being depleted and losing their natural values due to various threats. There is little understanding about the fire trends in these areas due to a lack of data and poor accessibility to existing fire statistics. This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of the trends of area burned and active fire in the Guinea-savanna and Forest-savanna mosaic zones in order to inform policy-makers about sustainable management options. We used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily active fire (MDC14ML) and burned-area (MCD64A1) products to characterize the fire regime in terms of seasonality, intensity, density, burned area, frequency, and trends during the study period of 2001 to 2021.ResultsThis study indicated that fire activity started in October and peaked in December (GSZ) and January (FSZ). The mean proportion burned was approximately 39.95% (burned area of 2659.31 km(2); FSZ) and 60.05% (burned area of 3996.63 km(2): GSZ), while the frequency was approximately 42.87% (1759.95 of active fires; FSZ) and 57.13% (2345.26 of active fires: GSZ). In 2018, GSZ recorded the largest burned area (19 811.2 km(2), which represents an average of 825.5 km(2) of the total area burned from 2001 to 2021) with 4719 active points detected. FSZ recorded its greatest burned area in 2015 (8727.4 km(2); which represents an average of 363.6 km(2) of the total area burned from 2001 to 2021) with 5587 active points recorded. In addition, it was found that specific times of the day (1000 h to 1420 h) recorded the majority of burned areas. In overview, between 2001 and 2021, burned areas increased by an average of 1.4 km(2) (FSZ) and 4.6 km(2) (GSZ), and the number of active fires increased by an average of 4.7 (FSZ) and 4.4 (GSZ) active fires per km(2).ConclusionsIn conclusion, burned areas and active fires are increasing in both ecological zones. This study demonstrated the relevance of remote sensing to describe spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrence in Ghana and highlighted the need for fire control and fuel management by the policies and institutions (e.g., Ghana National Fire and Rescue Service) in these important and vulnerable zones (GSZ and FSZ). This is especially true in the Forest-savanna mosaic zone, which is increasingly affected by the disasters of wildfires and records more active fires than GSZ, indicating that this zone is becoming more and more vulnerable. Therefore, rigorous continuous monitoring is essential, and collaboration between organizations fighting for the conservation of natural resources in the field is strongly recommended.

T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Iranian southern intertidal ecosystems are colonized by mangrove forests (mostly Avicennia marina) and presented a notable mangrove area expansion over the past decades. To discover its spatio-temporal dependencies, five mangrove forests were studied along a coastline of more than 1,200 km. Cloud-free Landsat images were processed using a temporal median filter to produce one representative Landsat image for each year from 1988 to 2020. The images were categorized into mangrove and non-mangrove classes using an object-based algorithm and visual post-classification. A consistent mangrove area expansion was observed across all regions, which regressed linearly against time with an adjusted R-2 range of 0.914-0.955 (p < 0.01). The expansions were also found to be highly significantly similar (0.182 < p < 0.822) using the t-test applied on the slope of region-specific regression models. Three spatial metrics of infilling, edge-expansion, and outlying were developed to investigate the spatial pattern of expansions. Results showed the dominance of the edge-expansion pattern across all regions (53-78% of the expansions), which was attributed to the better establishment of propagules near and under the canopy of parent trees. The outlying pattern (11-22%) was related to mangrove colonization along the inland creeks.

TI  - Assessing environmental and radiological impacts and lithological mapping of beryl-bearing rocks in Egypt using high-resolution sentinel-2 remote sensing images
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerald and other beryls represent a family of the most valuable gemstone around the world and particularly in Egypt. Beryllium (Be) contents in beryl-bearing bedrocks in south Sinai (Wadi Ghazala and Wadi Sedri), and in central and south Eastern Desert of Egypt (Igla area, Zabara-Um Addebaa belt, Homret Akarem, and Homret Mukpid) were investigated in this study. The environmental risk levels of Be, associated major ions, and heavy metals in groundwater nearby to beryl-bearing mineralization were also evaluated. Results showed that Be contents ranged from 1 to 374 ppm in beryl-bearing bedrocks, while in nearby groundwater, Be content has a range of 0.0001-0.00044 mg/L with an average of 0.00032 mg/L, which is within the permissible levels and below (0.004) the U.S. EPA maximum contaminant level (MCL). Most levels of heavy metals (e.g., Be, B, Ni, V, Fe, and Al) in the investigated groundwater of central and south Eastern Desert and south Sinai are within the permissible levels and below their corresponding U.S. EPA MCLs. This study also investigated the radiological risk of natural radionuclides distributed in beryl-bearing bedrocks in the study area using gamma spectrometry; Sodium Iodide [NaI(Tl)] scintillation detector. Among the estimated mean U-238, Th-232, and Ra-226 activity concentrations of the studied beryl-bearing rocks, Homret Mukpid (79, 87.15, 60.26 Bq kg(-1)) and Homret Akarem (111.6, 51.17, 85.1 Bq kg(-1)) contain the highest values. This may be attributed to their highly fractionated granitic rocks that host uranium and thorium reservoir minerals such as zircon, allanite, and monazite. The estimated data of multi-radiological parameters such as absorbed gamma dose, outdoor and indoor annual effective dose, radium equivalent activity, internal and external indices, index of excess cancer, and effective dose to human organs reflecting no significant impacts from the emitted natural gamma radiation.

The current research was conducted to determine the capability of machine learning models for the generalization of the modeling results from the reference area, i.e., Marvdasht plain, for estimating soil fertility attributes with the aims of extrapolating the modeling results to receptor area, i.e., Bandamir, in Iran with the aid of Homosoil concepts.Materials and methodsThe field study consists of 200 and 50 soil sampling locations in the reference and the receptor areas, respectively. Then, four soil properties, namely, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and exchangeable potassium were measured as soil fertility attributes. Eighty-two soil and environmental covariates were gathered from different sources, i.e., soil variables from field work and laboratory analysis, digital elevation model, and remote sensing data as potentially connected to "scorpan" factors in both areas. Here, seven soil variables (bulk density, clay, silt and sand contents, calcium carbonate equivalent, pH, and soil electrical conductivity), 36 covariates as proxy of surface and vegetation cover, and 39 attributes related to topography are representations of "s," "o," and "r" in scorpan model, respectively. Selection of the most relevant covariates, feature selection was made based on recursive feature elimination method and the performance of three ML models, i.e., cubist, random forest, and k-nearest neighbors, in the reference area for finding the best spatial model to apply in the receptor area.Results and discussionThe feature selection results showed that 15 soil and environmental covariates were most relevant and therefore were chosen as predictors of soil fertility attributes. The validation results showed that the soil fertility attribute maps in the receptor area were highly accurate than the prediction maps of the reference area based on the coefficient of determination for soil organic carbon in topsoil (R-2 = 0.74) and subsoil (R-2 = 0.52), exchangeable potassium in topsoil (R-2 = 0.77) and subsoil (R-2 = 0.27), and total nitrogen at the topsoil (R-2 = 0.28) and subsoil (R-2 = 0.25), also for available phosphorus, the prediction accuracy increased in the receptor area. The machine learning performances also showed that cubist outperformed the model in the prediction of soil fertility attributes in both areas. Also, the results revealed that soil variables identified as high-rank in the prediction of soil fertility attributes followed by topographic attributes.ConclusionGenerally, in areas where soil data is limited and detailed maps of soil properties are not available, extrapolation approach could be applied as an easy and quick methodology for preparing soil maps with low-cost and acceptable accuracy. Also, we are suggesting that the applied methodology employed in this study can be applied in another region with similar conditions.

TI  - Prediction of CO pollutant in Mashhad metropolis, Iran: Using multiple linear regression
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Given the importance of carbon monoxide (CO) in acute health threats, studies have been conducted in different countries and cities (272 cities in China and 337 cities on a global scale) on the relationship between daily mortality and CO while the spatial analysis of factors affecting CO pollutant in cities, especially in developing countries, has rarely been done. Accordingly, this research has measured the effect of five environmental-social variables (ESVs) on the spatial distribution of CO pollutants in the metropolis of Mashhad, Iran. CO concentration data were collected in 23 air pollutant monitoring stations in an area of 356 km(2) in 2019. Then, the relationship between five variables and CO pollutant were measured using linear and multiple regression by Sentinel 2A and 3 satellite images in ArcGIS and TerrSet software. The results show that the mean CO concentration averages at 1.56 ppm in the whole city. But its range varies between 0.171 and 2.907 ppm, which is a low figure compared with presented standards and does not indicate a critical situation. The results of multiple regression indicate that 42% of the variance in CO concentration is explained by independent variables. Among five independent variables, the beta value of the land surface temperature (LST) and digital elevation model (DEM) variables is negative and positive for the other three variables, including population density, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalised difference built-up index (NDBI). It should be noted that the strongest correlating variable is population density. Prediction of the spatial distribution of CO pollutants shows the division of the city into three areas: (1) the south and southwest slopes of the city with a low concentration; (2) central areas with a medium concentration; and (3) northern and northeastern areas of the city with a high concentration where low-income groups reside and there are more worn-out vehicles, motorcycles and industrial workshops. Areas with high CO concentration need more attention from urban managers.

M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn order to explore the surgical safety and the reliability of axillary staging of single-port endoscopic-sentinel lymph node biopsy, we combined it with indocyanine green that was excited by near-infrared fluorescence endoscopy and carbon nanoparticles as a tracer and compared this method to conventional open sentinel lymph node biopsy.MethodsThis is a retrospective and observational study, there were 20 patients in each group and the total sample size was 60: Group 1, single-port endoscopic-sentinel lymph node biopsy combined with indocyanine green and carbon nanoparticles; Group 2, single-port endoscopic-sentinel lymph node biopsy with carbon nanoparticles only; Group 3, conventional sentinel lymph node biopsy with indocyanine green and carbon nanoparticles. Sentinel lymph node detection and upper extremity function were determined to measure the safety and efficacy of the novel single-port endoscopic-sentinel lymph node biopsy (SPE-SLNB) technique to the standard conventional sentinel lymph node biopsy technique.ResultsThe detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes was 100% in Group 1, 100% in Group 2, and 95% in Group 3. There were no significant differences in upper arm function and pain scores between the three groups.ConclusionThe novel technique of combining indocyanine green and carbon nanoparticles with single-port endoscopic-sentinel lymph node biopsy achieved a similar detection rate and mean number of sentinel lymph nodes as conventional sentinel lymph node biopsy. Traditional open surgery requires two different incisions for breast surgery and SLNB. While the most important advantage of SPE-SLNB is that two procedures can be effectively performed through a single-port in the axilla Therefore, for patients who meet the indications, single-port endoscopic-sentinel lymph node biopsy is as safe and reliable as conventional sentinel lymph node biopsy but has the aesthetic advantage of only one incision.

TI  - Extremely Low Incidence of Local-Regional Recurrences Observed Among T1-2 N1 (1 or 2 Positive SLNs) Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Upfront Mastectomy Without Completion Axillary Node Dissection
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background Completion axillary node dissection (CLND) is routinely omitted in cT1-2 N0 breast cancer treated with upfront, breast-conserving therapy and sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) showing one to two positive sentinel nodes (SLNs). The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and impact of axillary treatment among patients treated with mastectomy in a contemporary cohort.Methods A prospective, institutional database was reviewed from 2006 to 2015 to identify patients with T1-2 breast cancer treated with upfront mastectomy and SLNB found to have one to two positive SLNs. Patients were stratified by axillary therapy [including CLND and/or post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT)], and clinicopathologic factors and incidence rates of local-regional and distant recurrence were analyzed.Results A total of 548 patients were identified, including 126 (23%) without CLND. Rates of PMRT were similar between those with and without CLND (35.3% vs. 28.6%, p = 0.16). On multivariate analysis, two rather than one positive SLN, larger SLN metastasis size, frozen-section analysis of the SLNB, and adjuvant chemotherapy were significantly associated with receipt of CLND. At a median follow-up of 7 years, there were only two local-regional recurrences in the no-CLND group, of which only one was an axillary recurrence. The 5-years incidence rate of LRR was not significantly different for those with and without CLND (1.3% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.93).Conclusions We found extremely low rates of local-regional recurrence among those with T1-2 breast cancer undergoing upfront mastectomy with 1-2 positive SLNs. Further axillary surgery may not be indicated in selected patients treated with a multidisciplinary approach, including adjuvant therapies.

TI  - Semantic segmentation of satellite images for crop type identification in smallholder farms
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Accurate and reliable crop type identification from satellite images provides a foundation for crop yield predictions which paves the way to help ensure food security. Most of the work done in the field of crop type mapping using remote sensing is restricted to the developed countries having large field parcels, while a little effort has been directed towards doing so for developing countries, where this task becomes more challenging due to the small size of field parcels, irregular shapes of the fields, and an acute shortage of labelled datasets for training supervised machine learning models. In this research, we try to fill this gap in the literature by exploring the feasibility of performing the semantic segmentation of agricultural fields from satellite images by proposing an encoder-decoder-based semantic segmentation architecture, CropNet, with a ResNet network as the encoder backbone and the use of attention modules in the decoder to allow the model to focus on more important portions of the feature maps and the feature fusion to concatenate the feature maps from all the decoder nodes getting a more precise prediction by bringing the spatial location information from the previous layers. The architecture outperformed the state of the art by 0.51% and 1.3%, on overall accuracy and macro-F1 score, respectively, after being trained on the "2019 Zindi's Farm Pin Crop Detection" dataset of Sentinel-2 images. The model achieved a field-wise overall classification accuracy of 78.06% and macro-F1 score of 67.3% and a pixel-wise segmentation mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 62.22% which is an improvement of 2.56% over the state-of-the-art methods, thereby demonstrating that our model is computationally efficient for the job of semantic segmentation of crop types from the satellite images in the difficult scenario of smallholder farms.

TI  - Gradual or abrupt? An algorithm to monitor urban vegetation dynamics in support of greening policies
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - While greening becomes a more and more popular strategy to address multiple urban challenges and to enhance wellbeing and human-nature connectedness, there is an increasing need for usable methods and indicators to monitor its implementation. Earth observations produce a wealth of data on vegetation dynamics, but their use for monitoring urban greening policies is still limited. In this article, we develop and test an algorithm for the analysis of urban vegetation dynamics based on NDVI time series. Specifically, we focus on yearly greenest pixel composites that illustrate the maximum value of NDVI during the year ("greenness"): a key structural attribute to monitor urban ecosystems in the European Union. The algorithm is inspired by earlier examples of segmentation algorithms but fits the specific requirements of the targeted use in urban areas. It takes the series of NDVI values associated to each pixel, detects existing (multiple) break points, and quantifies related abrupt changes, as well as significant gradual changes that occurred during a selected period. We tested the algorithm on a 30-year Landsat series in Berlin and partially validated the output through a comparison with infrared ortophotos. The results reveal a net increase in NDVI between 1988 and 2017 in 84% of the pixels, with an average change over the whole city of + 0.096. Around 20% of the pixels show at least one abrupt change. Most abrupt changes (71.5%) were positive, but the negative ones had on average a greater absolute value (-0.170 vs +0.085). However, considering the cumulative impacts during the whole period, 97% of the total change is attributable to gradual changes. The validation proves that abrupt changes successfully capture variations in the extent of vegetation due to land cover changes (e.g., vegetation removal or new greening interventions), while gradual changes can be associated to vegetation growth or decline. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed algorithm, and how the spatially- and temporally-explicit results can be a step forward in the interpretation of urban vegetation dynamics towards an effective monitoring of the impacts of local greening policies.

TI  - Modeling metamorphosis of the Old Brahmaputra River and associated impacts on landscapes in the Central Bengal Basin, Bangladesh
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores causal mechanisms of river metamorphosis and its impacts on regional landscapes. The study also investigates the implications of metamorphosis on associated ecological resources. Advanced GIS and remote sensing technologies were used to delineate morphological parameters describing metamorphosis of the Old Brahmaputra River from historical maps (i.e., Rannell's Map in 1776, Tassin's Map in 1840, Topographic Survey Map in 1943) and remotely sensed optical satellite imagery Sentinel-2 in 2022. Flood frequencies were investigated for different periods by applying Gumbel's Analytical Method (GAM), Log-Pearson Type III, and Log-Normal Method to estimate probability of flood vulnerability and impacts of flooding on morphodynamics in the central Bengal Basin. During the periods between 1776 and 2022, the area of sedimentation (77,999.43 ha) was greater than the eroded area (2983.29 ha).This difference was attributed to siltation of the channel bed morphology and corresponding accelerated flood vulnerability that accompanied river metamorphosis. Hydrological variables particularly annual average discharge significantly declined from 22 to similar to 18 m(3)/s per year during the period from 1965 to 2020. The study results demonstrated that the log-normal methods significantly overestimated peak flood discharge compared to Log-Pearson methods and Gumbel's probability model. The extrapolation of the discharge for the 100-year flood by applying the three methods produced values of 712.66 m(3)/s, 1750.26 m(3)/s, and 2462.92 m(3)/s. Differences of these magnitudes may be critical for planning purposes because these differences in results will generate large-scale projected impacts on morphodynamics of the central Bengal Basin.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Agricultural crop mapping has advanced over the last decades due to improved approaches and the increased availability of image datasets at various spatial and temporal resolutions. Considering the spatial and temporal dynamics of different crops during a growing season, multi-temporal classification frameworks are well-suited for mapping crops at large scales. Addressing the challenges posed by imbalanced class distribution, our approach combines the strengths of different deep learning models in an ensemble learning framework, enabling more accurate and robust classification by capitalizing on their complementary capabilities. This research aims to enhance the crop classification of maize, soybean, and wheat in Bei'an County, Northeast China, by developing a novel deep learning architecture that combines a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) with a variant of convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNN). The proposed method integrates multi-temporal Sentinel-1 polarimetric features with Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data for multi-source fusion and achieves an overall accuracy of 91.7%, a Kappa coefficient of 85.7%, and F1 scores of 93.7%, 92.2%, and 90.9% for maize, soybean, and wheat, respectively. Our proposed model is also compared with alternative data augmentation techniques, maintaining the highest mean F1 score (87.7%). The best performer was weakly supervised with ten per cent of ground truth data collected in Bei'an in 2017 and used to produce an annual crop map for measuring the model's generalizability. The model learning reliability of the proposed method is interpreted through the visualization of model soft outputs and saliency maps.

TI  - First Light Demonstration of Red Solar Induced Fluorescence for Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The risks harmful algal blooms (HAB) pose to aquatic ecosystems, public health, and coastal economies necessitate supplementation of current observation strategies. Herein, we explore the use of red solar induced fluorescence (SIF) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), a remote sensing measurement retrievable in variable cloud conditions, for Karenia brevis detection. Along the West Florida Shelf from 2018 to 2020, we compare red SIF with normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH) from MODIS-Aqua, a standard remote sensing HAB indicator limited to clear sky days. A strong positive linear relationship is found between nFLH and red SIF during severe bloom conditions in 2018 (N = 33,376, r-value = 0.79, R-2 = 0.63) permitting direct comparison. Red SIF provided nearly double the amount of spatiotemporal fluorescence information than nFLH. This work presents the first application of TROPOMI's red SIF for HAB monitoring and illuminates an approach for bolstering early warning systems for HABs beyond clear sky conditions.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating bathymetric information is vital for aquaculture and navigation applications. Free, high-resolution satellite imagery provides a cost-effective solution for routine bathymetric measurements. We tested six algo-rithms to retrieve water depth in the Mwanza Gulf of Lake Victoria using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery: the conventional Stumpf method, Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Neural Network (NNET), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In-situ depth points collected via echo sounders were used to train and validate the algorithms. Performance evaluation metrics included coeffi-cient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and spatial autocor-relation of residuals. Among the algorithms tested, the Stumpf model exhibited moderate performance with an R2 of 0.441, higher MAE (2.078 m), and RMSE (2.964 m) values. The RF algorithm improved performance with an R2 of 0.957, lower MAE (0.476 m), and RMSE (0.823 m). The GBM and XGB algorithms achieved R2 values of 0.960 and 0.956, respectively, with low MAE (0.484 m for GBM, 0.482 m for XGB) and RMSE (0.795 m for GBM, 0.830 m for XGB) values. The NNET algorithm outperformed the GBM and XGB models, obtaining an R2 of 0.963, the lowest MAE (0.438 m), and RMSE (0.761 m). The SVM algorithm demonstrated the best performance with an R2 of 0.965, the lowest MAE (0.403 m), and RMSE (0.745 m), implying the highest accuracy in depth estimation. SVM also showed stable generalization across different locations with insignificant spatial autocorrelation of residuals. Therefore, SVM is recommended for repetitive bathymetry calculations.

TI  - Modulation of Tropical Cyclone Tracks and Rainfall by the North Atlantic Oscillation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and quantifying the large-scale environmental control of spatio-temporal tropical cyclone (TC) variability beyond a few weeks remains a challenge with significant implications for societal impacts. This study focuses on the relationship between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and year-to-year changes in TC activity and rainfall using observational data and reanalysis products. We use Poisson regression models to show that low-frequency NAO (LF-NAO) variability is associated with a distinct pattern of TC activity, which extends across the western North Atlantic, the Caribbean Basin, and the Gulf of Mexico. The negative LF-NAO phase is characterized by enhanced TC activity: an interquartile range decrease in the NAO corresponds to a 30%-40% increase in TC track density. While the NAO is known to affect the weather regimes of the mid-latitudes, we show that its low-frequency component has a strong correlation to the large-scale environment across the Main Development Region of TCs. The negative LF-NAO phase is associated with two favorable environmental conditions for TCs: significantly higher sea-surface temperature and weaker deep-tropospheric wind shear. The LF-NAO relationship to TC activity is strongest during El Nino Southern Oscillation positive or neutral conditions and during the negative Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation phase, and it can also be detected in the basin-scale variations of TC rainfall. By developing annual TC rainfall composites from satellite data and reanalysis products, we show that TC rainfall is strongly enhanced in the Caribbean and in the Gulf of Mexico during the negative LF-NAO phase.

TI  - Do Optically Denser Trade-Wind Cumuli Live Longer?
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the lifetime and temporal evolution of physical properties of trade-wind cumuli based on tracking individual clouds in observations with the Advanced Baseline Imager aboard the geostationary GOES-16 satellite during the "ElUcidating the RolE of Cloud-Circulation Coupling in ClimAte" (EUREC(4)A) campaign east of Barbados in winter 2020. A first application of our upgraded cloud-tracking toolbox to measurements with high spatio-temporal resolution (2 x 2 km(2) and 1 min) provides probability density functions of lifetime and area of clouds that develop as a consequence of meso-to-synoptic scale motions. By separately considering clouds that exist during daytime and live in distinct lifetime intervals, we find that shallow marine cumuli live longer when they cover a larger surface area and show higher cloud optical thickness (COT). Besides the effect of COT, the scale of the atmospheric motions with which the clouds interact is also critical to their lifetime.

TI  - COVID-19 Impact on the Oil and Gas Industry NO<sub>2</sub> Emissions: A Case Study of the Permian Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 caused a historic collapse in fossil fuel demand, a general decline in economic activity, and hydrocarbon price volatility. This resulted in an unprecedented scenario to evaluate the contribution of the O&G (Oil and Gas) industry NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) emissions in the Permian basin (United States), currently the second largest hydrocarbon-bearing area on Earth. TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument), on board the Sentinel-5P satellite, has captured the impact of the oil and gas industry emissions during the COVID-19 lockdown. A generalized drop (similar to 30%) of NO2 emissions derived using the divergence method in comparison with 2019 was observed following the decline in production and drilling (13% and 68% respectively) during the lockdown. NO2 tropospheric columns were less impacted with a smaller decrease (similar to 4%) across the basins. This study demonstrates that the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on NO2 emissions was not only present in urban areas but also in vast O&G production regions, which shows the potential of TROPOMI to assess future pollution mitigation strategies for this industry.Plain Language Summary The COVID-19 pandemic caused a big impact on the oil and gas industry, not only in production but also in price and demand. This situation was a good opportunity to analyze one of the most common gas emissions of this industry, nitrogen dioxide, in one of the biggest oil and gas production areas, the Permian basin. Using satellite imagery, it was observed a generalized drop in nitrogen dioxide emissions during the lockdown period of the pandemic. This study not only shows that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nitrogen dioxide emissions was present in other environments apart from the urban for example, the oil and gas production regions, but also the capability to monitor it using satellite imagery.

TI  - A Nomogram for Identifying HR+/Her2-Breast Cancer Patients with Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes and Omitted Axillary Lymph Node Dissection Who Need Abemaciclib Therapy
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The efficacy of abemaciclib in high-risk patients with early-stage HR+/Her2- breast cancer has been verified by MonarchE. However, accurately determining the number of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases remains challenging. The Z0011 trial changed the axillary management strategy, eliminating the need for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with 1-2 sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases. Therefore, further exploration is needed to identify patients who could benefit from abemaciclib therapy. Material/Methods: This retrospective study included cT1-2N0M0 HR+/Her2- patients with 1-2 positive SLNs who underwent ALND. Clinicopathological data were collected, and logistic regression analyses identified independent predictors for >_4 positive ALNs. A predictive nomogram was developed, and discrimination and calibration were evaluated using the C-index and calibration curve. Clinical efficacy was assessed using decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: We enrolled 444 patients, with 77 (17.3%) having >_4 positive ALNs. Independent predictors for >_4 positive ALNs included abnormal ALN on ultrasound, mammographic calcifications, T stage, and the number of positive SLNs. The nomogram demonstrated an AUC of 0.777 (95% CI: 0.735-0.815, P<0.001), and internal validation showed good calibration and discrimination (C-index, 0.802; 95% CI: 0.779-0.824). DCA revealed a positive net benefit for risk levels ranging from 5% to 54%.Conclusions: This nomogram is a convenient and reliable tool to predict the risk of >_4 positive ALNs in HR+/Her2- patients. It aids in protocol selection by identifying SLN-positive patients who may benefit from abemaciclib therapy without ALND.

TI  - Observation and Process Understanding of Typical Cloud Holes Above Lakes Over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding cloud distribution over lakes is crucial to determine input radiation and precipitation for lake thermal and water balance processes. Based on Himawari-8 satellite observation and Weather Research and Forecasting model results, this study examines the influences of lakes on daytime cloud cover during warm seasons over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is home to thousands of lakes. Observation shows the existence of cloud holes and narrow cloud rings around the lakes, that is, fewer clouds over the lakes and more clouds along the shoreline, which has rarely been reported and is considered typical to TP by comparison with lakes outside of TP. The threshold size of lakes that can produce the shoreline cloud ring is identified to be about 300 km(2), as a conservative estimate. We further highlight the importance of atmosphere advection/background wind in the formation of lake-associated clouds. Lake breeze forms under weak background winds and the downdraft branch inhibits cloud formation over the lakes; while the updraft branch causes convection to form clouds over lakeshores. However, strong background winds do not favor lake breeze formation, changing cloud distribution over the lakes. Fewer clouds are also found in the downwind regions, and this influence is at a distance comparable to the lake scale. Due to fewer clouds over lakes, shortwave radiation is significantly larger (similar to 100 W/m(2)) and longwave radiation is smaller (similar to a few W/m(2)) than that of the further land region. Therefore, the above observational facts provide a new perspective to advance the understanding of lake-air interactions.Plain Language Summary There are lots of lakes over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), but the influence of these lakes on cloud during warm seasons remain unclear. Satellite data shows the existence of cloud holes and narrow cloud rings around the lakes, that is, fewer clouds over the lakes and more clouds along the shoreline, which has rarely been reported before. Simulation results demonstrate that the lake breeze accounts for this phenomenon: air descends over the lake, which inhibits cloud formation, while ascending branch over the shoreline favors cloud formation. Lakes over 300 km(2) can yield these cloud influences, so this area is thought as the threshold area that lakes can have influence on atmosphere. Clouds in the downwind regions are also fewer under the influence of background wind, and this influencing distance is almost equal to the lake scale itself. Due to less block by clouds, solar radiation is much higher over the lake than surrounding land, but downward longwave radiation is a little lower because of less emission from the cloud bottom, resulting an increase of net radiation in total at the lake surface. The conclusions of this study can help understand energy and hydrology processes of lakes better over the TP.

TI  - Shifts of Formation Regimes and Increases of Atmospheric Oxidation Led to Ozone Increase in North China Plain and Yangtze River Delta From 2016 to 2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - China is confronting severe ozone (O-3) pollution although particulate matter reduced significantly, causing damages to public health and ecological systems. Here we utilized the comprehensive methods of ground-level observations, satellite data, and source-oriented chemical transport model to interpret O-3 variations throughout China from 2016 to 2019. A remarkably worsened trend of O-3 levels has been found both by observation and simulation in these years. Our results showed that the remarkable O-3 elevation was found in the North China Plain (NCP) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) (maximum daily 8 hr average O-3 similar to 60 ppb) with an annual increasing rate of 10%. In addition, O-3 formation regimes also changed in the NCP, where 4.9% grids shifted from VOC-limited to transition regimes and 9.6% grids shifted from transition to NOx-limited regimes. The elevation of MDA8 O-3 was mainly attributed to the enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) in above regions. Particularly, the increasing rates of OH and HO2 radicals (major oxidants) in NCP and YRD reached similar to 15% and similar to 5%, respectively. The comprehensive study of long-term O-3 changes, formation regimes, and AOC based on a multimethod approach should be considered when designing O-3 control policies.Plain Language Summary Tropospheric Ozone (O-3) is a key secondary pollutant in the atmosphere, which is harmful to human health and the ecosystem. Although strict air pollution control policies have been implemented in China recently, the O-3 pollution remains serious nevertheless the reduced precursor such as HCHO and NO2. While field measurements and model simulations have been used to investigate O-3 variations, the roles of formation regimes, atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC), and source apportionment of O-3 are still unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we utilized a multi-method approach, including satellite and ground-level observations as well as improved source-oriented simulations, to investigate the variations of O-3 and its associated precursors. Our findings revealed that from 2016 to 2019, the annual increasing ratio of O-3 was up to 10% in the North China Plain (NCP). The elevation of O-3 levels was caused by shifts in O-3 formation regimes and increases in AOC, which were associated with meteorological variations and anthropogenic emission reductions.

TI  - Analysis of macerated ticks using Boolean logic gating colorimetric isothermal nucleic acid assays for Lyme <i>Borrelia</i> and <i>Ixodes scapularis</i> ticks
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lyme disease, one of the most common tickborne diseases, has been rapidly spreading in parallel with the expansion of the range of its tick vector. Better tick surveillance efforts are needed to accurately estimate disease risk and to guide public health and clinical management. We have developed two multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reactions coupled with oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes to identify the tick host, Ixodes scapularis, and the Lyme disease pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi, they carry. In each multiplex LAMP-OSD assay the co-presence of two target sequences is computed at the DNA level by linking the two corresponding amplicons and detecting the co-product on colorimetric lateral flow dipsticks. In tests with synthetic DNA, the co-presence of as few as four copies of input DNA could be detected, without producing spurious signals. Most importantly, though, the LAMP-OSD assay is amenable to being carried out directly with macerated tick samples, without any sample preparation. In such field conditions, assays performed robustly and demonstrated 97-100% sensitivity and 100% specificity with both field-collected and lab-raised artificially infected ticks. Such easy-to-use, arthropod and pathogen-specific assays would be well suited to field and near patient use without relying on complex instrumentation or infrastructure.

TI  - Scenario simulation of land use change and carbon storage response in Henan Province, China: 1990-2050
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon storage service of terrestrial ecosystems has an veritable impact on the global carbon cycle and, in turn, on global climate change. Hence, both assessing and predicting the impact of land use changes on carbon storage are necessary to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. Therefore, using integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs (InVEST) model with remote sensing data, this study systematically analyzes the land use/cover change (LUCC) and the carbon storage response characteristics of land types in Henan Province, China in the 1990-2020 period. The study also uses patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model to predict the LUCC and carbon storage in Henan Province from 2023 to 2050 under different scenarios, including Business as Usual (BAU), Ecological Conservation (EC), and Urban Development (UD) scenarios. The following results are noted: (1) The LUCC mainly comprises the conversion of farmland to con-struction land. Presently, Henan Province's carbon storage is found to have decreased by 339.72 Tg due to LUCC, which is characterized as "high in the west and low in the east." (2) Regarding the three aforementioned sce-narios, the province's construction land is predicted to increase to its greatest extent under the UD scenario. Under the EC scenario, its woodland and farmland areas will be effectively protected. Therefore, the highest level of carbon reserves will likely be found in the EC scenario, followed by that in the BAU scenario, while the lowest level of carbon reserves should be seen in the UD scenario. The carbon reserves of Henan Province in 2050 will be 312.07 Tg, 233.43 Tg, and 394.49 Tg lower than that in 2020 under the BAU, EC, and UD scenarios, respectively. In sum, this study provides the scientific basis of the decisions aimed at the facilitation of low-carbon devel-opment, the optimal utilization of land spaces, and the development of an ecological civilization in Henan Province.

TI  - An attention-based multiscale transformer network for remote sensing image change detection
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The bi-temporal change detection (CD) is still challenging for high-resolution optical remote sensing data analysis due to various factors such as complex textures, seasonal variations, climate changes, and new requirements. We propose an attention-based multiscale transformer network (AMTNet) that utilizes a CNN transformer structure to address this issue. Our Siamese network based on the CNN-transformer architecture uses ConvNets as the backbone to extract multiscale features from the raw input image pair. We then employ attention and transformer modules to model contextual information in bi-temporal images effectively. Additionally, we use feature exchange to bridge the domain gap between different temporal image domains by partially exchanging features between the two Siamese branches of our AMTNet. Experimental results on four commonly used CD datasets - CLCD, HRSCD, WHU-CD, and LEVIR-CD - demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed AMTNet approach. The code for this work will be available on GitHub.1

TI  - A dryness index TSWDI based on land surface temperature, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, and water balance
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has a serious impact on the health of terrestrial ecosystems, socio-economy and human health. It is important to accurately monitor drought conditions. Soil moisture (SM) can directly characterize surface dryness and wetness. Precipitation (PPT), evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (LST), and vegetation status indirectly relate to SM, and they influence each other. Therefore, using one index cannot comprehensively and objectively reflect the real situation of surface dryness and wetness. In this study, based on the Z-score data of LST, OCO-2-based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence product (GOSIF) and water balance (WB) from 2003 to 2018, a new three-dimensional (3D) drought index, namely temperature-SIF-Water Balance Dryness Index (TSWDI), was constructed using Euclidean distance method. The accuracy of TSWDI was verified by soil moisture (SM), standardized precipitation index (SPI), and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), and compared with other recognized drought indices. The results showed that TSWDI had a higher correlation with SM (R = 0.340) and SPEI (R = 0.533) than vegetation health index (VHI) (R was 0.201 and 0.207, respectively), temperature-vegetation-soil moisture dryness index (TVMDI) (R was -0.022 and -0.031, respectively), and temperature vegetation precipitation dryness index (TVPDI) (R was 0.123 and 0.132, respectively). Furthermore, taking the frequency of drought occurrences monitored by SPEI and the normalized anomaly of SM as the benchmark, the errors of drought frequency between TSWDI/TVMDI/TVPDI/VHI and SM/ SPEI were obtained, respectively. The results showed that the mean error between TSWDI and SM, SPEI were 0.12 and 0.21, respectively, which were lower than that of VHI (0.19, 0.24), TVMDI (0.87, 0.63) and TVPDI (0.89, 0.69). These all indicated that TSWDI could better monitor regional drought conditions than VHI, TVMDI, and TVPDI in our study area. TSWDI had good applicability in monitoring meteorological and agricultural drought. In addition, the spatial variations and patterns of drought conditions in the study area were explored by the annual time series of TSWDI. The results showed that the study area became wetter at an average rate of 0.0064/year. The pixels reaching significant wetting (P < 0.05) accounted for 49.18%, and only 12.14% of the area reached significant drying (P < 0.05), which was consistent with that of SPEI. Finally, the results from the cross-correlation method indicated that the percentage of TSWDI which was ahead, synchronized, and lag of SM changes were 10.13%, 89.47%, and 0.4%, respectively. TSWDI was further employed to identify drought events in China. It demonstrated that TSWDI and VHI can more accurately capture the onset, evolution, and end of drought than TVMDI and TVPDI in the five southwestern provinces of China. Moreover, R (0.627) between TSWDI and the normalized anomaly of SM was higher than that of VHI (R = 0.619). It indicated that TSWDI can recognize more accurately than TVMDI, TVPDI, and VHI for drought events in the five southwestern provinces of China. Therefore, TSWDI can more accurately monitor regional drought conditions and respond in advance or synchronously to SM changes. TSWDI contains several key indicators (SIF, LST, and WB) of surface drought, in which SIF can reflect the physiological characteristics of vegetation, temperature can affect vegetation transpiration and WB affects vegetation absorbing water from the soil. When drought occurs, TSWDI can synthesizethe changes in these three indicators.It can be concluded that TSWDI has great potential for evaluating drought conditions in China.

TI  - No difference in survival for primary cutaneous Merkel cell carcinoma after Mohs micrographic surgery and wide local excision
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The preferred treatment for clinically node-negative Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is surgical excision in conjunction with sentinel lymph node biopsy. There is limited large-scale research on survival outcomes by surgical approach for management of the primary tumor.Objective: To compare overall and MCC-specific survival outcomes in clinically and pathologically, node-negative MCC patients treated with wide-local excision (WLE) and Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) in a nationally representative sample.Methods: Overall and MCC-specific survival outcomes for primary MCC tumors contained in the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results)-18 database from 1989 to 2015 were stratified by surgical modality and analyzed via competing risk analysis.Results: A total of 2359 US adults with MCC were included in the analysis. For overall and MCC-specific survival, there was no significant difference in survival outcomes between WLE and MMS on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.88-1.22]; subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.53-1.09]). Sentinel lymph node biopsy was associated with improved overall survival and MCC-specific survival.Limitations: Retrospective design of SEER and the lack of covariates such as comorbidities and immunostaining.Conclusion: There is no survival disadvantage for MMS compared to WLE as the surgical modality for primary cutaneous MCC. Sentinel lymph node biopsy should be coordinated prior to MMS. ( J Am Acad Dermatol 2023;89:254-60.)

TI  - RelB-deficient autoinflammatory pathology presents as interferonopathy, but in mice is interferon-independent.
T2  - The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autoimmune diseases are leading causes of ill health and morbidity and have diverse etiology. Two signaling pathways are key drivers of autoimmune pathology, interferon and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)/RelA, defining the 2 broad labels of interferonopathies and relopathies. Prior work has established that genetic loss of function of the NF-kappaB subunit RelB leads to autoimmune and inflammatory pathology in mice and humans.OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize RelB-deficient autoimmunity by unbiased profiling of the responses of immune sentinel cells to stimulus and to determine the functional role of dysregulated gene programs in the RelB-deficient pathology.METHODS: Transcriptomic profiling was performed on fibroblasts and dendritic cells derived from patients with RelB deficiency and knockout mice, and transcriptomic responses and pathology were assessed in mice deficient in both RelB and the type I interferon receptor.RESULTS: We found that loss of RelB in patient-derived fibroblasts and mouse myeloid cells results in elevated induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes. Removing hyperexpression of the interferon-stimulated gene program did not ameliorate the autoimmune pathology of RelB knockout mice. Instead, we found that RelB suppresses a different set of inflammatory response genes in a manner that is independent of interferon signaling but associated with NF-kappaB binding motifs.CONCLUSION: Although transcriptomic profiling would describe RelB-deficient autoimmune disease as an interferonopathy, the genetic evidence indicates that the pathology in mice is interferon-independent.

TI  - Using machine learning and satellite data from multiple sources to analyze mining, water management, and preservation of cultural heritage
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Remote sensing, particularly satellite-based, can play a valuable role in monitoring areas prone to geohazards. The high spatial and temporal coverage provided by satellite data can be used to reconstruct past events and continuously monitor sensitive areas for potential hazards. This paper presents a range of techniques and methods that were applied for in-depth analysis and utilization of Earth observation data, with a particular emphasis on: (1) detecting mining subsidence, where a novel approach is proposed by combining an improved U-Net model and Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology. The results showed that the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) U-Net model performed better than the U-Net (baseline) model in terms of Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) and Intersection over Union (IoU) indicators; (2) monitoring water conservancy and hydropower engineering. The Xiaolangdi multipurpose dam complex was monitored using Small BAsline Subsets (SBAS) InSAR method on Sentinel-1 time series data and four small regions with high deformation rates were identified on the slope of the reservoir bank on the north side. The dam body also showed obvious deformation with a velocity exceeding 60 mm/a; (3) the evaluation of the potential of InSAR results to integrate monitoring and warning systems for valuable heritage and architectural preservation. The overall outcome of these methods showed that the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in combination with InSAR data leads to more efficient analysis and interpretation, resulting in improved accuracy and prompt identification of potential hazards; and (4) finally, this study also presents a method for detecting landslides in mountainous regions, using optical imagery. The new temporal landslide detection method is evaluated over a 7-year analysis period and unlike conventional bi-temporal change detection methods, this approach does not depend on any prior-knowledge and can potentially detect landslides over extended periods of time such as decades.

TI  - Terrestrial and groundwater storage characteristics and their quantification in the Chitral (Pakistan) and Kabul (Afghanistan) river basins using GRACE/GRACE-FO satellite data
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Pakistan and Afghanistan, intensive groundwater abstraction has accelerated socioeconomic development, but it also endangers the long-term sustainability of groundwater resources. Sustainable water resource management throughout river basins requires a spatiotemporal analysis of groundwater storage changes, but continuous groundwater monitoring is critical while there are few observation wells in the Chitral Kabul River Basin (CKRB). Therefore, this study uses total water storage (TWS) data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its Follow-on (GRACE-FO) and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model water storage components, such as surface runoff (Qs), soil moisture content (SMS), and snow water equivalent (SWE) to determine the characteristics of groundwater storage (GWS) variations from 2003 to 2021. The seasonal decomposition LOESS method (STL) was used to assess the long-term trend, seasonal trend, and associated uncertainty of TWS and GWS time-series, while Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator was used to detect and quantify the increasing and decreasing trend values of TWS and GWS time-series. The results showed that TWS indicated a general decreasing trend of -3.67 & PLUSMN; 0.98 mm/month while GWS indicated a harsh declining trend of -7.83 & PLUSMN; 0.52 mm/month from 2003 to 2021 in CKRB. The validation of GRACE-derived GWS results showed a correlation of R2 = 0.47 in comparison to in situ GWS. Spatially and temporally, according to sub-basins of CKRB, the more severe decline of TWS in Chitral-Kunar (-2.66 mm/year) and GWS in Swat (-4.34 mm/year) was observed. This research would be insightful to estimate the agroeconomic impact of the intensive ground-water in CKRB and its sub-basins.

TI  - Long-term monitoring and phenological analysis of submerged aquatic vegetation in a shallow lake using time-series imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is a key functional group for the restoration of wetlands and aquatic ecosystems. It plays a vital role in the stability of ecosystem structure and function in shallow lakes and reser-voirs. With Baiyangdian Lake as the research area, Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI and Sentinel-2 imagery datasets were used to explore the phenological characteristics of SAV over different time scales and construct a phenological map of the SAV groups. The long-term spatial distribution characteristics and trends of SAV from 1986 to 2021 were analyzed. The results show the following: (1) the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) eliminated abnormal observations and noise. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series curves generated after HANTS accurately reflected the phenological characteristics of SAV. The early spring submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV1), such as Potamogeton crispus, entered the germination period in late February at the earliest (DOY = 53). The mature period ran from April to May, after which SAV1 began to decline gradually. The length of the growing season (LOS) was about 110 days. SAV2, which was represented by Ceratophyllum demersum, Myriophyllum verticillatum, and Potamogeton pectinatus, germinated in early April (DOY = 99). The mature period ran from July to September. The length of the growing season was 210 days. (2) The decision tree constructed based on the NDVI and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) identified SAV with an accuracy of 89.7%. (3) The distribution range of the SAV changed dramatically during 1986-2021. According to the area change, it can be divided into a shrinkage period, expansion period, degeneration period, and initial period of recovery. The succession trend of SAV provide a theoretical scientific basis and technical support for the ecological restoration and management of shallow lake ecosystems.

TI  - Long-term trends of aerosol and cloud fraction over Eastern China based on ground-based observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We looked into the long-term variability of aerosols and clouds over Eastern China (EC) using MICAPS ground-based data from 1995 to 2019 and MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval from 2003 to 2019. The ground-based observed visibility (VIS) was used to characterize aerosol concentrations. Our study indicate that VIS shows a significant shift over EC in recent decades, as evidenced by falling (P1: 1995-2006)-flat (P2: 2007-2013)-rising (P3: 2014-2019) periods. Correspondingly, a change was observed in cloud fraction (CF) from a strong increase to a slow fluctuation during the three periods over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), but no significant variation over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. In addition, the CF-VIS shows a negative cor-relation during both P1 and P3 periods while this relationship weakened during P3 (35% weaker in BTH and 44% weaker in YRD). However, it is important to note that this weakening may be influenced by a few factors, such as data processing methods, the location of aerosols relative to the cloud, relative humidity (RH), and large-scale circulation etc. Further studies, including numerical simulations and analysis, are required to determine how much change of cloudiness is attributed to aerosols.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Representing and measuring the status of land use and land cover (LU and LC) alterations and drivers of alteration are essential for classifying susceptible regions for alteration and planning sustainable environmental services. This study presents the contributing factors of LU and LC and the extent and effects of these changes on sustainable LU in the Diyala River drainage area, north of Iraq. Five major LU and LC types (cultivated and settled land, bare land, water bodies, and palm) from Landsat images of 2013, 2016, 2019, and 2022 were mapped. The images were classified using a classification algorithm and a maximum likelihood classifier. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation condition index (VCI), and land surface temperature (LST) maps are derived using multi-temporal Landsat 8 and 9 OLI/TIRS satellites. In the past decade, the buildup and barren lands have expanded from 1295.8 km(2) (3.9%) to 1677.4 km(2) (5.1%) and 5770.3 km(2) (17.5%) to 8501.1 km(2) (25.8%), whereas the vegetation cover has declined from 25,273.9 km(2) (76.6%) to 22,421.8 km(2) (68.0%). NDVI saw a significant rise in 2019 and 2022. There were maximum changes in NDVI in the northeast and southeast, where rainfall was higher than before in some parts. The VCI results showed that in 2022, there was a larger class area, with a prolonged extreme drought extent of 5727.1 km(2) (47.8%). The findings imply that NDVI and LST are more closely correlated drought indices and are appropriate for use in arid and semi-arid areas to monitor drought with limited data. These studies will advance our knowledge of the connections between drought indices from remote sensing and meteorology. It is suggested that this research methodology be used again in the future, taking into account the impact of changes in climate that affect LU and LC patterns in similar climates.

TI  - Effects of optical and radar satellite observations within Google Earth Engine on soil organic carbon prediction models in Spain
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The modeling and mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) has advanced through the rapid growth of Earth observation data (e.g., Sentinel) collection and the advent of appropriate tools such as the Google Earth Engine (GEE). However, the effects of differing optical and radar sensors on SOC prediction models remain uncertain. This research aims to investigate the effects of different optical and radar sensors (Sentinel-1/2/3 and ALOS-2) on SOC prediction models based on long-term satellite observations on the GEE platform. We also evaluate the relative impact of four synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisition configurations (polarization mode, band fre-quency, orbital direction and time window) on SOC mapping with multiband SAR data from Spain. Twelve experiments involving different satellite data configurations, combined with 4027 soil samples, were used for building SOC random forest regression models. The results show that the synthesis mode and choice of satellite images, as well as the SAR acquisition configurations, influenced the model accuracy to varying degrees. Models based on SAR data involving cross-polarization, multiple time periods and "ASCENDING" orbits outperformed those involving copolarization, a single time period and "DESCENDING" orbits. Moreover, combining infor-mation from different orbital directions and polarization modes improved the soil prediction models. Among the SOC models based on long-term satellite observations, the Sentinel-3-based models (R2 = 0.40) performed the best, while the ALOS-2-based model performed the worst. In addition, the predictive performance of MSI/ Sentinel-2 (R2 = 0.35) was comparable with that of SAR/Sentinel-1 (R2 = 0.35); however, the combination (R2 = 0.39) of the two improved the model performance. All the predicted maps involving Sentinel satellites had similar spatial patterns that were higher in northwest Spain and lower in the south. Overall, this study provides insights into the effects of different optical and radar sensors and radar system parameters on soil prediction models and improves our understanding of the potential of Sentinels in developing soil carbon mapping.

TI  - The assessment of shoreline changes along the Johor Strait using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar imagery and GIS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper presents a robust approach for shoreline detection using the K-Means clustering and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System developed by the United States Geological Survey. The shoreline changes along the Johor Straits of Malaysia are assessed by using the multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar images from 2018 to 2022. This area is known to be important for both socioeconomic activities. The retrieved shorelines are found reliable with a good accuracy of 1.4 m when validating against the Global Positioning System rapid static survey. This merits finding a robust approach that goes beyond the normal practice in Malaysia where manual digitization is usually exercised. The rate of change is calculated by using the end point rate (EPR) for providing a short-term (annual) rate of change while using the linear regression rate (LRR) for providing a long-term (5 year) rate of change. Based on the EPR, the mean annual changes are approximately 10 m/yr for erosion and up to 9.83 m/yr for accretion; meanwhile, the mean of 5-year changes based on the LRR is 62% and 37% for erosion and accretion, respectively. This study reveals that 10 out of 12 sites along Johor Strait are categorized as 'high' erosion, two locations are categorized as 'medium' erosion and none are as 'low' erosion.

TI  - Use of remote sensing-based pressure-state-response framework for the spatial ecosystem health assessment in Langfang, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover changes are occurring at an unprecedented rate and scale because of the economic development that has jeopardized the ecosystem's health. Ecosystem health should be studied and monitored at spatiotemporal scale to promote sustainable development and ecological civilization. The goal of this study was to assess the spatial ecosystem health of Langfang at the city and administrative levels using city's regional characteristics. Remote sensing-based pressure-state-response (PSR) framework, analytical hierarchy process (AHP), and principal component analysis (PCA) were utilized for spatial ecosystem health index (SEHI) formulation, indicator weighting, and indicator selection in several epochs (1990, 2003, 2013, and 2021), respectively. SEHI was formulated by combining subindices of pressure, state and response. The spatial ecosystem pressure index (SEIP) identified that the pressure was increasing on the ecosystem. In contrast, the spatial ecosystem state index (SEIS) pointed out an improvement in the state of the ecosystem since 1990. The worst state of the ecosystem was observed for the year 2013. The spatial ecosystem response index (SEIR) indicated that the response of the ecosystem towards the exerted pressures and states remained variable; however, it was reasonably good in 1990. All the administrative units of Langfang were associated with a healthy score for the spatial ecosystem health index (SEHI) for 1990 (pre-industrialization epoch), while the SEHI significantly reduced in 2013 (industrialization epoch) however improved for the later epochs (circular economy and ecological civilization epoch). The SEHI was moderately healthy for Dachang, Dacheng, Guan, Guangyang, and Yongqing while relatively healthy for the remaining administrative units in 2021. SEHI identified that spatial health has been improving since 2003 though not reaching the 1990's level for Langfang. Therefore, efforts should be focused on minimizing pressure and stabilizing the state to improve the spatial ecosystem health of Langfang. The developed SEHI can assist policymakers in analyzing regional health, identifying development strategies, driving environmental restoration, and quantifying needed changes.

TI  - A 16-year global climate data record of total column water vapour generated from OMI observations in the visible blue spectral range
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a long-term data set of 1 degrees x 1 degrees monthly mean total column water vapour (TCWV) based on global measurements of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) covering the time range from January 2005 to December 2020.In comparison to the retrieval algorithm of Borger et al. (2020), several modifications and filters have been applied accounting for instrumental issues (such as OMI's "row anomaly") or the inferior quality of solar reference spectra. For instance, to overcome issues related to low-quality reference spectra, the daily solar irradiance spectrum is replaced by an annually varying mean earthshine radiance obtained in December over Antarctica. For the TCWV data set, we only consider measurements with an effective cloud fraction less than 20 %, an air mass factor (AMF) greater than 0.1, a snow- and ice-free ground pixel, and an OMI row that is not affected by the row anomaly over the complete time range of the data set. The individual TCWV measurements are then gridded to a regular 1 degrees x 1 degrees lattice, from which the monthly means are calculated.The investigation of sampling errors in the OMI TCWV data set shows that these are dominated by the clear-sky bias and cause on average deviations of around 10 %, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies. However, the spatiotemporal sampling errors and those due to the row-anomaly filter are negligible.In a comprehensive intercomparison study, we demonstrate that the OMI TCWV data set is in good agreement with the global reference data sets of ERA5 (fifth-generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis), RSS SS-M/I (Remote Sensing Systems Special Sensor Microwave Imager), and CM SAF/CCI TCWV-global (COMBI): over ocean the orthogonal distance regressions indicate slopes close to unity with very small offsets and high coefficients of determination of around 0.96. However, over land, distinctive positive deviations of more than +10 kg m(-2) are obtained for high TCWV values. These overestimations are mainly due to extreme overestimations of high TCWV values in the tropics, likely caused by uncertainties in the retrieval input data (surface albedo, cloud information) due to frequent cloud contamination in these regions. Similar results are found from intercomparisons with in situ radiosonde measurements from version 2 of the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA2) data set. Nevertheless, for TCWV values smaller than 25 kg m(-2), the OMI TCWV data set shows very good agreement with the global reference data sets. Furthermore, a temporal stability analysis proves that the OMI TCWV data set is consistent with the temporal changes in the reference data sets and shows no significant deviation trends.As the TCWV retrieval can be easily applied to further satellite missions, additional TCWV data sets can be created from past missions, such as the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-1 (GOME-1) or the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY (SCIAMACHY); under consideration of systematic differences (e.g. due to different observation times), these data sets can be combined with the OMI TCWV data set in order to create a data record that would cover a time span from 1995 to the present. Moreover, the TCWV retrieval will also work for all missions dedicated to NO2 in the future, such as Sentinel-5 on MetOp-SG.The Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (MPIC) OMI total column water vapour (TCWV) climate data record (CDR) is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7973889 (Borger et al., 2023).

AB  - In this paper, the current field modulation is described using a solution of the wave action equation. Using an integrated equation model (IEM), a current field modulated scattering model is established. The sea surface backscattering coefficient decreases with increasing current speed. At high wind speeds, the change of back-scattering coefficient under 1 m center dot s(-1) current field modulation is about 1 dB. An increase of 60 degrees in the angle between wind and current direction leads to a decrease of 1.5 dB in the modulation coefficient. Finally, the model is verified using satellite data.

T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundUnderstanding temporal trends and varying responses of water use efficiency (WUE) to environmental changes of diverse ecosystems is key to predicting vegetation growth. WUE dynamics of major ecosystem types (e.g., forest, grassland and cropland) have been studied using various WUE definitions/metrics, but a comparative study on WUE dynamics and their driving forces among different ecosystem types using multiple WUE metrics is lacking. We used eddy covariance measurements for 42 FLUXNET2015 sites (396 site years) from 1997 to 2014, as well as three commonly used WUE metrics (i.e., ecosystem, inherent, and underlying WUE) to investigate the commonalities and differences in WUE trends and driving factors among deciduous broadleaf forests (DBFs), evergreen needleleaf forests (ENFs), grasslands, and croplands.ResultsOur results showed that the temporal trends of WUE were not statistically significant at 73.8% of the forest, grassland and cropland sites, and none of the three WUE metrics exhibited better performance than the others in quantifying WUE. Meanwhile, the trends observed for the three WUE metrics were not significantly different among forest, grassland and cropland ecosystems. In addition, WUE was mainly driven by atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration at sites with significant WUE trends, and by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) at sites without significant trends (except cropland).ConclusionsOur findings revealed the commonalities and differences in the application of three WUE metrics in disparate ecosystems, and further highlighted the important effect of VPD on WUE change.

TI  - An assessment of mangrove vegetation changes in reference to cyclone impacted climatic alterations at land-ocean interface of Indian Sundarbans with application of remote sensing-based analytical tools
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecoregions of the Indian Sundarbans (IS) are highly productive ecosystems in the Bengal delta of the Indian subcontinent. These mangroves are crucial in reducing the negative consequences of extreme environmental events like excessive wave movements and periodic storm surges, in addition to serving as an important habitat for a variety of distinct flora and animals. The Bay of Bengal has been increasingly affected by climatic changes like increase in sea surface temperature (SST), salinization, and sediment loads, a decrease in freshwater intake, and sea level rise. In the last two decades (2000-2020), these climatic phenomena have increased the frequency of tropical cyclones. From 2000 to 2020, the loss of landmass has been attributed to exposure to these climate changes. According to open-source satellite imaging data, such losses in land area have also led to a decrease in the amount of mangrove vegetation. Thus, to monitor the health of mangrove vegetation, Landsat-based health indicators like normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and combined mangrove recognition index (CMRI) have been considered in this study. CMRI, as a mangrove-specific index, was measured on the basis of the difference of NDVI and normalized difference water index for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space (NDWI_Gao). Furthermore, datasets for abiotic variables have been extrapolated from remotely sensed data for the said period using specific formulae. Both long-term and short-term temporal trends have been considered to better envisage the impact of episodic cyclonic events on mangrove health (1990-2020). Our findings indicate that cyclones altered the habitat with respect to land area and salinization status which would possibly render the dominance of more halotolerant forms with loss of freshwater mangrove biodiversity. Even though plantation efforts have shown the recovery of mangroves in this area, sudden storm surges and concomitant salinization of habitat put the plantation efforts in vain. A combination of factors like salinization, rise in SST, rainfall reduction in pre- and post-monsoon periods and episodic cyclonic events would probably lead to further deterioration of mangrove health in this area. Since the IS is suffering the most from climatic change and intermittent cyclonic occurrences, it is crucial to consider this when making policy decisions. Appropriate actions must be taken along with stronger conservation techniques, to protect this vulnerable environment. Better conservation tactics and ongoing plantation efforts would stop the loss of mangrove vegetation and its habitat, even though the growing frequency of episodic storm occurrences cannot be stopped.

In Italy, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is one of the most common wild carnivores. This species can serve as a reservoir and sentinel host for several infectious diseases. We aimed to improve knowledge about the exposure of red foxes to selected zoonotic (Anaplasma spp, Ehrlichia spp., Borrelia spp., and hepatitis E virus) and carnivore-specific pathogens (canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus, pseudorabies virus, and Dirofilaria spp.) through a retrospective survey performed in the Tuscany region during the spring season of 2013. Using specific ELISAs and serum samples (n = 38) collected during a culling campaign, a prevalence of 2.6% for canine distemper virus, 18.4% for canine parvovirus, 5.2% for Anaplasma spp., 2.6% for Ehrlichia spp., 7.9% for Dirofilaria spp., 21.05% for hepatitis E virus, and 10.5% for pseudorabies virus was observed. Conversely, antibodies against Borrelia spp. were not identified in any of the animals. Our results revealed no significant sex-related differences in seroprevalence and confirmed hepatitis E virus as the most common pathogen in the analyzed samples. All of the animals that tested positive for tick-borne zoonotic agents presented ticks at the time of sampling. Our study confirms the exposure of red foxes in the Tuscany region to viral and bacterial infections raising medical and veterinary concern and indicating the need for large-scale surveillance to fully assess the epidemiological significance of these findings.

TI  - Causative fault and seismogenic mechanism of the 2010 Suining <i>M</i>5.0 earthquake from joint modeling of seismic and InSAR data
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the Sichuan basin is a stable block with low historical seismicity, the Suining M5.0 earthquake on January 31, 2010 occurred near the center of the basin, causing casualty and substantial damage. Previous studies have shown that the earthquake is very shallow and may occur in the sedimentary cover rocks, but its causative fault has not been identified. Based on local broadband seismic waveform data as well as a pair of ALOS PALSAR ascending orbit data, we explore the seismogenic mechanism via further constraining the source depth and the ruptured fault. The earthquake caused ground uplift in the southeast of the epicenter area, with a maximum line of sight displacement of about 13.6 cm, much larger than the displacement caused by a M5 earthquake at a typical depth of 10 km, which indicates that the earthquake is very shallow. Through joint inversion of seismic waveform and InSAR data, we obtain the moment magnitude of Suining earthquake as M(W)4.5, with the strike, dip, and rake of its fault plane as 17 & DEG;, 66 & DEG; and 90 & DEG;, respectively, and the centroid depth less than 1 km, supporting that the earthquake occurred at the shallow part of a high angle thrust fault dipping to the southeast. It is further confirmed that the earthquake may be triggered by the diffusion of high-pressure fluid migrating from the underside gas reservoir.

TI  - The current management of clear cell sarcoma
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) is a rare melanocytic soft tissue sarcoma with a high propensity for lymphatic metastasis and poor prognosis. It is characterized by the translocation of t (12;22), resulting in the rearrangement of the EWSR1 gene and overexpression of MET. Despite improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of soft tissue sarcomas, the management of CCSs remains challenging owing to their rarity, unique biological behaviour and limited understanding of their molecular pathogenesis. The standard treatment for localized CCSs is surgical excision with negative margins. However, there is an ongoing debate regarding the role of adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy and lymphadenectomy in the management of this disease. CCSs are usually resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Targeted therapies, such as sunitinib and MET inhibitors, may provide promising results. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, is currently under investigation as a potential treatment option for CCSs. Further research is needed to better understand the biology of CCSs and develop effective therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of current knowledge and advances in the diagnosis and treatment of CCSs.Surgical excision is the standard treatment for clear cell sarcoma; however, the role of adjuvant therapy remains uncertain. Targeted therapies and immunotherapy are promising, but further research is required.

TI  - Validation of MODIS AOD retrievals in West Africa: a comparison with AERONET observations
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - There is increasing use of satellite data for environmental monitoring in data-sparse regions of the world. However, challenges such as cloud cover and swath area of satellite sensors necessitate the validation of satellite retrievals, particularly in regions where ground-based measurements or high-density coverage may be sparse. In this study, the performance of two NASA MODIS products-AQUA and TERRA-were compared with observational AERONET data over eight study sites in West Africa for the period 2000-2022. Results obtained showed a regression slope between 0.09 and 0.83 for TERRA data and 0.11 and 0.86 for AQUA data. The normalized root mean square error between AERONET and AQUA data was in the range of 0.097-0.517, while a range of 0.123-0.540 was reported for TERRA data. Although both AQUA and TERRA AOD products had similar aerosol trends across the eight AERONET study sites, AQUA has an overall better performance with lower error estimates. Generally, the satellite retrieved data performed well during the wet season but poorly in the dry season. The performance of both MODIS products over the region suggests they can be used at most locations with little error/adjustment.

TI  - Burned area and carbon emissions across northwestern boreal North Americafrom 2001-2019
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is the dominant disturbance agent in Alaskan and Canadian boreal ecosystems and releases large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Burned area and carbon emissions have been increasing with climate change, which have the potential to alter the carbon balance and shift the region from a historic sink to a source. It is therefore critically important to track the spatiotemporal changes in burned area and fire carbon emissions over time. Here we developed a new burned-area detection algorithm between 2001-2019 across Alaska and Canada at 500m (meters) resolution that utilizes finer-scale 30m Landsat imagery to account for land cover unsuitable for burning. This method strictly balances omission and commission errors at 500m to derive accurate landscape- and regional-scale burned-area estimates. Using this new burned-area product, we developed statistical models to predict burn depth and carbon combustion for the same period within the NASA Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) core and extended domain. Statistical models were constrained using a database of field observations across the domain and were related to a variety of response variables including remotely sensed indicators of fire severity, fire weather indices, local climate, soils, and topographic indicators. The burn depth and aboveground combustion models performed best, with poorer performance for below-ground combustion. We estimate 2:37 x 10(6) ha (2.37 Mha) burned annually between 2001-2019 over the ABoVE domain (2.87 Mha across all of Alaska and Canada), emitting 79.3 x 27.96 Tg (+/- 1 standard deviation) of carbon (C) per year, with a mean combustion rate of 3.13 x 1.17 kgCm(-2). Mean combustion and burn depth displayed a general gradient of higher severity in the northwestern portion of the domain to lower severity in the south and east. We also found larger-fire years and later-season burning were generally associated with greater mean combustion. Our estimates are generally consistent with previous efforts to quantify burned area, fire carbon emissions, and their drivers in regions within boreal North America; however, we generally estimate higher burned area and carbon emissions due to our use of Landsat imagery, greater availability of field observations, and improvements in modeling. The burned area and combustion datasets described here (the ABoVE Fire Emissions Database, or ABoVE-FED) can be used for local- to continental-scale applications of boreal fire science.

TI  - Spaceborne thermal infrared observations of Arctic sea ice leads at 30 m resolution
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice leads play an important role in the heat exchange between the ocean and the overlying atmosphere, particularly narrow leads with widths of less than 100 m. We present a method for detecting sea ice leads in the Arctic using high-resolution infrared images from the Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS) on board the Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), with a resolution of 30m in a swath of 300 km. With the spatial resolution of leads observed by infrared remote sensing increasing to tens of meters, focused on the Beaufort Sea cases in April 2022, the TIS-detected leads achieve good agreement with Sentinel-2 visible images. For the three infrared bands of the TIS, the B2 (10.3-11.3 mu m) and B3 (11.5-12.5 mu m) bands show similar performance in detecting leads. The B1 band (8.0-10.5 mu m) can be usefully complementary to the other two bands, as a result of different temperature measurement sensitivity. Combining the detected results from the three TIS bands, the TIS is able to detect more leads with widths less than hundreds of meters compared to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Our results demonstrate that SDGSAT-1 TIS data at 30m resolution can effectively observe previously unresolvable sea ice leads, providing new insight into the contribution of narrow leads to rapid sea ice changes in the Arctic.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Himalayan region is experiencing a heightened risk in downstream habitats due to the effects of climate change, which include rapid glacier recession, the formation of glacial lakes and the potential for outburst flood hazards. The present study is aimed at analyzing alteration of three benchmark glaciers (Tanak 1, Tanak 2 and Tanak 3) situated in Kishtwar High Altitude National Park (KHANP), Chenab basin of Jammu and Kashmir, India. Multi-temporal Landsat data (MSS, TM, ETM + and OLI), high-resolution Indian Remote Sensing LISS IV, and Google Earth (TM) in conjunction with ALOS PALSAR DEM have been utilized in the study. For the periods 1980-93, 1993-99, 1999-2010, and 2010-21 glaciers in the region have deciphered area change of 0.99 (2.9%), 0.53 (1.6%), 0.59 (1.8%) and 0.88 km(2) (2.75%) respectively. During the consolidated time line of 40 years, the total glaciated area has experienced a reduction of 3.02 & PLUSMN; 2.2 km(2) (0.075 km(2) a(-1)), which amounts to 8.8% shrinkage of glacier area.Glacier recession has given rise to formation and enlargement of moraine dammed lakes. One such proglacial lake (Mundiksar lake) has expanded by 0.258 & PLUSMN; 0.16 km(2) (similar to 150%) during 1980-2020. Results further reveal reduction in the surface ice velocity for all the studied glaciers (Tanak 1; - 20.82%, Tanak 2; - 5.29%, Tanak 3; - 12.39%). Based on GlabTop2 model, ice thickness of the three glaciers varies between 10 and 290 m with an average mean ice thickness of 101.78, 87.64, and 80.32 m respectively. Lake volume of the proglacial lake ranges from 0.223 x 10(6)m(3) to 19.275 x 10(6) m(3) and Peak discharge values ranges from 152.51 to 19739.49 m(3) s(-1). The work explicitly is indicative of an ongoing expansion of proglacial bodies of water and glacial recession in the region and allures attention towards its associated threats in the downstream area.

T2  - MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - To understand trends in U.S. cannabis-involved emergency department (ED) visits (i.e., those for which cannabis use was documented in the chief complaint or a discharge diagnosis) among young persons aged <25 years during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC used National Syndromic Surveillance Program data to examine changes in ED visits during 2019-2022. Mean weekly cannabis-involved ED visits among all young persons were higher during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, 2021, and 2022, compared with corresponding periods in 2019. Large increases in cannabis-involved ED visits throughout the COVID-19 pandemic compared with prepandemic surveillance periods in 2019 were identified among persons aged ≤10 years. ED visit rates among children and adolescents aged 11-14 years did not differ by sex until the first half of the 2020-21 school year (2020, weeks 37-53), when ED visit rates among females surpassed those among males. Improving clinicians' awareness of rising cannabis-involved ED visits might aid in early diagnosis of cannabis intoxication among young persons. Further, increasing adults' knowledge regarding safe cannabis storage practices, strengthening youths' coping and problem-solving skills through evidence-based prevention programs, and modifying cannabis packaging to decrease appeal to youths might help prevent intentional and unintentional cannabis use.

T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Potential field data play a vital role in mineral resource mapping, especially in deriving the lithological information of poorly mapped terrains. The Mundiyawas-Khera area of the Alwar basin in Rajasthan, India, is known for Cu mineralization hosted within the felsic volcanic rocks. However, much of the area is covered with soil and needs detailed lithological mapping. In this study, different machine learning (ML) algorithms have been employed to integrate the digital elevation, drilling wells, gravity, and magnetic data, together with their derivatives, for obtaining accurate lithology information of the area. Initially, five different ML algorithms, random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and gradient boosting (GB) were employed using 540 samples from six lithological units to obtain the refined lithologic map of the area. Subsequently, a stacking classifier was built, considering the best-performing ML models in the base learner. Comparison of evaluation matrices (precision, recall, and confusion matrix) of these ML algorithms suggests that RF, GB, and stack model (RF + GB + MLP with RF meta-classifier) provide the highest accuracy score (RF: 74.69%, GB: 74.69%, and stack: 75.31%) and class membership probabilities in predicting the lithology. Adding derivatives and analytic signal information to the input data improves the classification accuracy of ML models by similar to 5-8%. Overall the study results demonstrate that ensemble ML algorithms can aid in creating the first-pass lithology map of areas with limited outcrops, drilling, and geochemical data.

AB  - ContextInterdisciplinary borrowing between ecology and the social sciences has produced numerous insights about pastoral livelihood practices and rangeland ecology, demonstrating how people practicing pastoralism constantly modify their practices to adapt to social, political, economic, and biophysical change.ObjectivesI outline an approach for integrating research on pastoral livelihoods into a landscape ecology framework. I focus on access to land and resources, and an integrative approach to scale, to assess the relationship between landscape and social processes.MethodsI use remotely sensed data and ethnographic analysis of livelihood change in two semi-arid contexts in Kenya to compare broad scale changes in pastoral mobility to spatio-temporal patterns of variability in rainfall and vegetation productivity. I then synthesize the political, economic, and social relations that have most prominently influenced access to land and restructured landscape process at finer scales.ResultsSpatial controls have been imposed on land use that have increasingly partitioned landscapes and concentrated pastoral access to land. Access to land has also been influenced by changes in social norms, employment, and market relations. Informal rules and norms, social differentiation, and exclusionary partitions have produced socially differentiated land use intensity gradients and novel landscape processes that have not previously been considered in landscape analyses in Kenya.ConclusionsUnderstanding access, land use, and landscape processes as intertwined, with uneven processes of land and resource capture at different scales, would enable landscape ecologists to choose observational scales relevant to rural livelihoods and sensitive to power asymmetries, creating robust analytical linkages between social and ecological processes.

TI  - Transcriptional regulation of dendritic cell development and function
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are sentinel immune cells that form a critical bridge linking the innate and adaptive immune systems. Extensive research addressing the cellular origin and heterogeneity of the DC network has revealed the essential role played by the spatiotemporal activity of key transcription factors. In response to environmental signals DC mature but it is only following the sensing of environmental signals that DC can induce an antigen specific T cell response. Thus, whilst the coordinate action of transcription factors governs DC differentiation, sensing of environmental signals by DC is instrumental in shaping their functional properties. In this review, we provide an overview that focuses on recent advances in understanding the transcriptional networks that regulate the development of the reported DC subsets, shedding light on the function of different DC subsets. Specifically, we discuss the emerging knowledge on the heterogeneity of cDC2s, the ontogeny of pDCs, and the newly described DC subset, DC3. Additionally, we examine critical transcription factors such as IRF8, PU.1, and E2-2 and their regulatory mechanisms and downstream targets. We highlight the complex interplay between these transcription factors, which shape the DC transcriptome and influence their function in response to environmental stimuli. The information presented in this review provides essential insights into the regulation of DC development and function, which might have implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related diseases.

TI  - River Ecological Protection and Restoration Using Multi-source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In the modern era, remote sensing capabilities of wireless sensor networks have enabled the preservation and restoration of river ecology. Remote sensing can detect changes and anomalies in river ecosystems, identify areas vulnerable to flooding, erosion, or sedimentation, and measure the effectiveness of restoration efforts over time by providing real-time monitoring and data collection. As a result, remote sensing technology can significantly improve our ability to protect and restore river ecosystems, resulting in improved sustainability and biodiversity conservation. However, adequate supervision is challenging due to technical bottlenecks encountered by river ecological protection and restoration and the wide range of river ecological protection areas. Firstly, this paper examines river ecological protection using multi-source remote sensing data. Secondly, it restores the appearance of river ecological protection by formulating monitoring targets, extracting river ecological remote sensing feature information, and using multiple remote sensing data for fusion and dynamic river ecology monitoring. Finally, this paper takes a river ecological protection restoration project as a research pilot. It establishes a multi-remote sensing monitoring mechanism for river protection and restoration in China by optimizing the indicators of river ecological protection and restoration and improving the accuracy of remote sensing's data mining and analysis. This paper conducts several experiments that demonstrate that the proposed platform can improve the restoration effect of river ecology as well as the richness of river ecology. As a result, using multi-source remote sensing data for river ecological protection and restoration is critical to improving river ecological status.

T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The role of bivalve aquaculture as a carbon sink is highly debated, without a general consensus on the components to include in the budget. This study proposes to estimate the terms of the budget using a scope-for-growth-based model. The model was applied at 12 Mediterranean sites, with environmental forcings provided by operational oceanography data spanning over 12 years. Mussels were found to be slight sinks, with a limited variability across sites, if all components of the budget, i.e. accumulation in soft tissue, emissions associated with calcification and respiration, are included. The differences found among stations concerning the calcification and soft tissue contributions to the budget were found to be related to site-specific productivity and water chemistry parameters. This led to the identification of a set of meta-models, which could be used for relating the budget to local conditions, at a screening level, rendering them useful for optimal site selection.

Although several turbidity algorithms are available to monitor water quality, they are mainly developed for mapping turbidity ranges of 0-100 FNU. Thus, their use in a highly turbid region may not give accurate results, which is crucial for estuarine ecosystem management. To fill this gap, we developed a multi-conditional turbidity algorithm that can retrieve turbidity from 0 to 600 FNU using the Sentinel-2 red and red-edge bands. Four major steps are implemented: atmospheric and sun glint correction of the Level-1C Sentinel-2 data, spectral analysis for different water turbidity levels, regression modelling between in situ turbidity and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) for algorithm development, and validation of the best-suited model. When turbidity was < 85 FNU, the Rrs increased firstly in the red wavelength (665 nm), but it saturated beyond a certain turbidity threshold (> 250 FNU). At this time, Rrs started to increase in the red-edge wavelength (704 nm). Considering this spectral behavior, our algorithm is designed to automatically select the most sensitive turbidity vs. Rrs, thus avoiding the saturation effects of the red bands at high turbidity levels. The model showed good agreement between the satellite derived turbidity and the in situ measurements with a correlation coefficient of 0.97, RMSE of 15.93 FNU, and a bias of 13.34 FNU. Turbidity maps derived using this algorithm can be used for routine turbidity monitoring and assessment of potential anthropogenic actions (e.g., dredging activities), thus helping the decision-makers and relevant stakeholders to protect coastal resources and human health.

TI  - Transmission formulation for random stacks of clouds
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - We present a formulation for calculations of photon transmission for random cloud stacks (maximum-random overlap) that can be applied in contrail avoidance experiments, for instance. Other applications are not excluded. In contrail avoidance experiments, the application of the method is to estimate in advance whether contrails are detectable with a satellite instrument and whether therefore the result of the experiment can be validated. For an established contrail avoidance procedure, the method can help to decide whether a contrail should be avoided if cirrus clouds in below the contrail would render the expected infrared radiation effect quite low. The method is derived in some detail, and a practical example is provided. For applications it is necessary to empirically determine or estimate a transmission threshold, that likely depends on the viewing geometry, the spatial resolution and the wavelength of the satellite instrument. An IDL-code is available to interested users.

TI  - HIGH-RESOLUTION SINGLE-PHOTON IMAGING WITH A LOW-FILL-FACTOR 32x32 SPAD ARRAY BY SCANNING IN THE PHOTOSENSITIVE AREA
T2  - JOURNAL OF RUSSIAN LASER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Single-photon light detection and ranging (LiDAR) provides the single-photon sensitivity and picosecond time resolution, which is rapidly developing in three-dimensional (3D) imaging applications. Spatial resolution and imaging quality of LiDAR based on the single-photon avalanche-diode (SPAD) array detectors are difficult to improve, because currently available SPAD arrays still have small size array, due to the semiconductor manufacturing process limitation, and the functional circuitry around pixels reduces the fill factor. Herein, we propose a photon-efficient LiDAR method that guarantees the coupling relationship between the photosensitive area of each pixel and the corresponding beam spot illuminated on the target and uses 1/4 field of view (FoV) scanning imaging in the photosensitive area. The proposed method can effectively improve the spatial resolution of LiDAR system based on SPAD array detectors. Resolution test experiments show that the best observed (transversal) resolution is 3.1748 lp/mm at a working distance of 2.3 m, over tenfold larger than that of previous methods. Three-dimensional experiments prove that the system can achieve 3D high-resolution single-photon imaging, which is valuable in the fields of remote sensing and long-range target recognition.

TI  - Automated fluvial hydromorphology mapping from airborne remote sensing
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Mapping fluvial hydromorphology is an important part of defining river habitat. Mapping via field sampling or hydraulic modeling is however time consuming, and mapping hydromorphology directly from remote sensing data may offer an efficient solution. Here, we present a system for automated classification of fluvial hydromorphology based on a deep learning classification scheme applied to aerial orthophotos. Using selected rivers in Norway, we show how surface flow patterns (smooth or rippled surfaces vs. standing waves) can be classified in imagery using a trained convolutional neural network (achieving a training and validation accuracy of >95%). We show how integration of these classified surface flow patterns with information on channel gradient, obtained from airborne topographic LiDAR data, can be used to compartmentalize the rivers into hydromorphological units (HMUs) that represent the dominant flow features. Automated classifications were broadly consistent with manual classifications that had been made in previous ground surveys, with equivalency in automated and manually derived HMU classes ranging from 61.5% to 87.7%, depending on the river stretch considered. They were found to be discharge-dependent, showing the temporally dynamic aspect of hydromorphology. The proposed system is quick, flexible, generalizable, and provides consistent classifications free from interpretation bias. The deep learning approach used here can be customized to provide more detailed information on flow features, such as delineating between standing waves and advective diffusion of air bubbles/foam, to provide a more refined classification of surface flow patterns, and the classification approach can be further advanced by inclusion of additional remote sensing methods that provide further information on hydromorphological features.

TI  - Social-coalitional trait is related to coping capacity with mortality threat: association with leadership and a reduced parietal response to mortality salience
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionCoping with mortality threat, a psychological threat unique to humans and distinct from general emotional distress, is traditionally characterized by immediate suppression and prolonged worldview defense within the framework of the influential terror management theory (TMT). Views regarding the personality-trait concepts for this coping capacity diverge: some favor a broad definition based on general psychological attitudes (e.g., hardiness), while others prefer a narrow definition linked to interpersonal attitudes related to social coalition (e.g., attachment style and self-transcendence). MethodsUsing functional MRI, we presented healthy older participants with death-related words and explored correlations between the neural responses to mortality threat and the factor scores of the Power to Live questionnaire, which measures eight resilience-related psychobehavioral traits. ResultsWe observed a significant association between the factor score and a neural response only for leadership; individuals with a high leadership score exhibited reduced neural response to mortality salience in the right inferior parietal lobule. DiscussionWithin the TMT framework, our findings align with the concept of the immediate suppression of death-thought accessibility associated with a secure attachment style, a trait conceptually linked to leadership. These findings highlight the unique role for the narrowly defined social-coalitional trait during the immediate stage of the coping process with mortality salience, in contrast to the broadly defined resilience-related personality traits associated with a prolonged worldview defense process. The deterioration of this coping process could constitute a distinct aspect of psychopathology, separate from dysfunction in general emotion regulation.

TI  - The Self-Transcendence Experience Scale: Extracting Core Constructs
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Self-transcendence has been used both to a process of movement beyond one's immediate self-boundaries and to a quality that emerges as a result of this process, culminating in a broadened worldview. Due to the elusive character of the construct, there is difficulty in defining and measuring it. The present study attempts to introduce exploratory findings using an Israeli convenience sample (n = 366) in an effort to identify common core constructs in widely used measures of self-transcendence and make a preliminary unified cross-disciplinary self-transcendence assessment tool. Exploratory principal component analysis of the Self-Transcendence Scale, the Adult Self-Transcendence Inventory, the Temperament and Character Inventory Self-Transcendence subscale, the Spiritual Transcendence Scale, and the Mysticism Scale was completed. A three-factor structure was revealed: Transpersonal Awareness, Broadening of Experience, and Centeredness. Correlations between the three factors revealed a possible new, integrated conceptualization of self-transcendence as a three-dimensional construct. Further theoretical analysis is required.

TI  - Selective use of radiological staging in node-positive stage II breast cancer patients may have a role in treatment
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAdvanced-staging radiography is used inconsistently for patients with early-stage (stage I + II) breast cancer. However, accurate and appropriate staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer may significantly impact treatment decisions.MethodsFour hundred and ninety-nine patients with stages II and III breast cancer were seen in the breast service at Waitemata DHB, New Zealand from 2013 to 2018 were enrolled in the study and audited for radiological staging.ResultsOne hundred and two stage II patients had computed tomography (CT) at baseline; 88 of 102 (86%) of stage II patients were node-positive (=N1) with six patients (6.8%) having distant metastatic disease, and were upstaged to stage IV. Fifty-two stage III patients out of 72 (72%) had baseline staging CTs. Nine out of 52 patients (17%) of stage III patients were upstaged to stage IV. Despite guideline recommendations, baseline staging for T4 disease (stage IIIB) was poor, with only 7 out of 13 patients with stage IIIB disease radiologically staged.ConclusionConsideration for baseline radiological staging should be given to stages II and III, cN1 breast cancer patients, in which diagnosis of distant metastatic disease would change the treatment plan. Regional guidelines for baseline radiological staging for breast cancer patients may have an impact on patient management in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Revisiting the Received Image of Machiavelli in Business Ethics Through a Close Reading of <i>The Prince</i> and <i>Discourses</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In business ethics literature, the figure of Machiavelli is often taken as a representation of that which is dark, sinister and negative-a source of inspiration for undesirable and unethical actions. In this research, we examine the evaluation of Niccolo Machiavelli's thought in extant studies, and posit that Machiavelli's works consist of ideas that may appear contradictory, which, coupled with historically contextualized close reading of his texts have more to offer. In this theoretical investigation, we construct new conceptual categories of a leader's decision-making rubric and attempt to provide a structured framework that will allow us to specify the boundary conditions under which the apparent contrary views may be accommodated, by undertaking a close reading of Machiavelli's texts. Our work contributes to business ethics literature in at least three ways. First, we present a holistic assessment of the research area that applies the tenets of Machiavelli's writings to business ethics, management, and organizational studies, and delineate the dominant themes. We outline and substantiate the informal research networks, thought structures, and "invisible colleges" that form the intellectual framework of this research area through a bibliometric analysis and literature review. Second, we present a contextualized close reading of Machiavelli's major treatises. Third, we reimagine the critical landscape of business ethics literature, specifically pertaining to Machiavelli's oeuvre by shifting the single-minded focus from The Prince, by including The Discourses, which, as we show, has new and unprecedented implications for business ethics. In light of this, the parameters for ethical action by business leaders can be redrawn according to a Machiavellian schema. This marks a radical departure from the long-standing association between Machiavelli's tenets and the absence of ethics, instead proposing a more positive and affirmative relationship between Machiavelli and business ethics. Specifically, while pointing out that the existing ethical frameworks foisted on Machiavelli's texts do not do justice to the political philosopher's worldview, which are complex insights into ideas of leadership, we urge researchers to incorporate the thoughts offered in this research in future investigations.

TI  - What Would It be Like to be Bohmians? Experiencing a Gestalt Switch in Physics as an Effect of Path Dependence
T2  - SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The philosophical goal is to characterize 'path dependence' (PAD) in science by comparison to PAD in technology where the concept was initially introduced. I rely on quantum mechanics to substantiate the analyses, exploiting the contrast between standard versus Bohmian quantum physics (NQP/BQP). To achieve the goal, counterfactual history is mobilized as a means to generate instructive virtual alternatives to the actual scientific path: I design a 'permuted-situations counterfactual scenario' in which it is BQP, instead of NQP, that first acquires a monopoly on physics and is exclusively practiced in science education, before NQP is introduced. Then, I endeavor to 'reenact' - as forensic investigators carry out the re-enactment of a crime scene - how virtual mainstream Bohmians would assess NQP. Contrasting the two 'views from inside' - 'what it is like to be' a standard quantum physicist in our world (a physicist trained in NQP) and what it would be like to be a physicist exclusively trained in BQP - I attempt to come as close as possible to an 'experience' of the gestalt switch involved when shuttling back and forth between one scientific worldview to the other. The effects of PAD in physics are discussed on this basis.

TI  - Identification of river basins within northwestern slope of Crimean Mountains using various digital elevation models (ASTER GDEM, ALOS World 3D, Copernicus DEM, and SRTM DEM)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the end of the 20th century, the use of geographic information systems and digital elevation models has reduced the time required for and improved the quality of morphometric analysis of the relief within river basins. However, researchers are constantly faced with the problem of choosing the most accurate and suitable digital terrain model for their task. Many global, regional, and local digital elevation models are available. In this study, we comparatively analyzed the accuracy of the ASTER GDEM, ALOS World 3D, Copernicus DEM, and SRTM DEM spatial datasets for the purpose of catchment basin modeling for the river basins of the northwestern slope of the Crimean Mountains (Zapadnyy Bulganak, Alma, Kacha, Belbek, and Chernaya Rivers) as an example. For each river basin, we calculated the systematic, root mean square, mean absolute, standard root mean square (Bessel's correction), and centered mean absolute errors by comparing ASTER GDEM, ALOS World 3D, Copernicus DEM, and SRTM DEM data with a 1:100,000 topographic map within the considered river basins. We found the smallest error values for the Copernicus DEM and ALOS World 3D datasets; furthermore, we used the Copernicus DEM dataset to model the river basins and sub-basins of the northwestern slope of the Crimean Mountains. As a result, we identified these river basins and sub-basins for the Zapadnyy Bulganak, Alma, Kacha, Belbek, and Chernaya Rivers, which are represented by stream basins, valleys, gullies, and ravine systems.

TI  - Agrometeorological Approach for Sugarcane Yield Estimation at Regional Scale Using Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane is the major sugar producing crop of India and the prediction of sugarcane yield has immense importance for sugar industries. Satellite remote sensing has the potential to provide periodical information on the morphology throughout the growing season of sugarcane over a large area at various spatial scales and thus has the capability to be used for spatial and regional scale yield prediction. Agrometeorological indicators like crop evapotranspiration (ET), rainfall and crop response factors and the crop health indicators like spectral vegetation index from satellite data influence the crop water and drymatter content and hence can be used as the yield predictors. This study was carried out to generate these agrometeorological and health indicators from the available satellite image and develop yield models based on these indicators for estimating sugarcane yield at a regional scale. The study was conducted over 22 sugarcane growing districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. The bivariate regression model based on ET and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index representing the water relation and the spectral behavior of sugarcane crop was found to be the best (r = 0.79) having RMSE of 7.9% in terms of consistency and performances as compared to univariate models that account only spectral behaviour or only water relations. Moreover, the moisture availability in terms of ET when used along with the crop response factor based on the relative yield proved to be a better yield predictor than the ET alone. This study brought out the options to choose the model depending on the availability and accessibility of input data products from space-based optical and thermal remote sensing.

TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities and genomic epidemiology of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> in Stockholm, Sweden
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the genomic epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibilities of N. gonorrhoeae isolates in Stockholm, Sweden. In total, 6723 isolates detected in Stockholm, Sweden, from January 2016 to September 2022, were examined for antimicrobial susceptibilities by using E-test. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was applied to isolates in sentinel surveillance and isolates resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) or high-level azithromycin (HLAzi-R, MIC & GE; 256 mg/L). As sentinel surveillance, consecutive clinical isolates (n = 396) detected every 4th week from January 2021 to September 2022 were enrolled in the study. Of the 6723 isolates investigated, 33 isolates (< 1%) were found to be resistant to cefixime, one of which was co-resistant to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin and was detected in September 2022. Ten isolates presented a high level of azithromycin resistance. Resistant rates to ciprofloxacin varied from 32 in 2017 to 68-69% in 2021-2022. Elevated MIC50 and MIC90 of azithromycin were observed over the years. No resistance to spectinomycin was identified. The most frequently occurring MLST in the sentinel surveillance was ST9362 (23%), followed by ST11706 (9%), ST7359 (8%), ST10314 (7%), and ST11422 (6%). The ceftriaxone-resistant isolate belonged to ST8130 and the novel NG-STAR ST4859. Genomic resistance traits found in this strain included mutations in genes mtrR (A39T), parC (S87N), and gyrA (S91F and D95A), as well as the presence of blaTEM-135 and tetM genes. A predominance of ST9362 was observed in Stockholm. The high number of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates and the emergence of a strain with a novel NG-STAR are of great concern.

TI  - Application of satellite remote sensing data and random forest approach to estimate ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in Northern region of Thailand
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter up to 2.5 & mu;m (PM2.5) is associated with many health consequences, where PM2.5 concentration obtained from the monitoring station was normally applied as the exposure level, so that the concentration of PM2.5 in unmonitored areas has not been captured. The satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) product is then used to spatially predict ground truth of PM2.5 concentration that covers the locations with no air quality monitoring station, but this method has seldom been developed in Thailand. This study aimed at estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentration at 3 km x 3 km spatial resolution over Northern region of Thailand in 2021 using the random forest model integrating the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD products from Terra and Aqua satellites, meteorological factors, and land use data. A random forest model contained 100 decision trees was utilized to train the model, and 10-fold cross-validation approach was implemented to validate the model performance. The good consistency between actual (observed) and predicted concentrations of PM2.5 in Northern region of Thailand was observed, where a coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the model fitting were 0.803 and 14.30 & mu;g/m(3), respectively, and those of 10-fold cross-validation approach were 0.796 and 14.64 & mu;g/m(3), respectively. The three most important predictors for estimating the ground-level concentrations of PM2.5 in this study were normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), relative humidity, and number of fire hotspot, respectively. Findings from this study revealed that integrating the MODIS AOD, meteorological variables, and land use data into the random forest model precisely and accurately estimated ground-level PM2.5 concentration over Northern region of Thailand that can be further used to investigate the effects of PM2.5 exposure on health consequences, even in unmonitored locations, in epidemiological studies.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThrough the lens of social exchange and self-determination theories, this paper proposes and tests a model to explore how inclusive leadership practices foster employee job satisfaction at higher education institutions. It also explores the intervening roles of psychological ownership and employee thriving in this relationship.Design/methodology/approachThis study followed a positivist worldview and a quantitative methodology. The authors collected data from a sample of 329 academic and nonacademic staff working at Omani higher education institutions. The authors utilized partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to examine the model and test the hypothesized relationships.FindingsThis study's findings reveal that inclusive leadership is related to job satisfaction. They also show that psychological ownership and employee thriving mediate between inclusive leadership and job satisfaction at Omani academic institutions.Practical implicationsSince employees at Omani academic institutions come from different cultures, academic leaders should manage and promote inclusiveness by developing and enforcing relevant policies. They should carefully select the workforce that stimulates growth and effectiveness, create an atmosphere to foster acceptance and exchange of ideas, improve performance appraisal practices, and embed inclusiveness in their vision and mission.Originality/valueThis research helps researchers and practitioners better understand how inclusiveness fosters vitality and learning in the higher education sector. It also sheds more light on how psychological ownership and employee thriving mediate between inclusive leadership and job satisfaction. This research is also important due to its context, as it was implemented in a multicultural environment with a diverse workforce.

TI  - Role of intraoperative touch imprint cytology and immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of metastatic malignancies in the central nervous system: Cyto-histomorphological findings and differential diagnosis
T2  - DIAGNOSTIC CYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Brain metastases (BMs) are intracranial neoplasms that are more common in adults than primary brain tumors, causing significant mortality and morbidity in cancer patients. This study aimed to evaluate the definitive histopathological diagnosis using touch imprint cytology and the importance and use of immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of primary origin.Method Cytological, paraffin section, and immunohistochemical study slides of all metastatic brain tumors consecutively consulted at the pathology department between 2018 and 2023 were evaluated. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of patients' diagnostic results who underwent imprint cytology were compared based on the final diagnosis histopathological report.Results A total of 45 patients with and without intraoperative consultation were included in the study. The definitive histopathologic diagnosis and the diagnostic accuracy rate of imprint cytology for distinguishing glial and metastatic tumors on paraffin sections was 100%. Immunohistochemistry was performed in all patients (except one patient; immediate exitus) and histological classification of the primary tumor was performed by analysis of clinical findings and biomarkers. The primary origins of metastatic tumors were often lung and breast, with adenocarcinoma subtype histomorphology, cerebral hemispheres, and discrete foci of metastasis.Conclusion TPs is a simple and rapid technique that supports diagnosis in intraoperative neuropathology and is a very cost-effective procedure. The pathologist's experience is the key factor in the diagnosis and reduces the need for a frozen section. In our series, the final histopathologic correlation of imprint cytology in the diagnosis of primary and metastatic tumors is 100%.

TI  - Exposure and hazard of bisphenol A, S and F: a multi-biomarker approach in three-spined stickleback
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Due to the estrogenic behavior of bisphenol (BP) A, industries have developed many substitutes, such as BPS and BPF. However, due to their structural similarities, adverse effects on reproduction are currently observed in various organisms, including fish. Even if new results have shown impacts of these bisphenols on many other physiological functions, their mode of action remains unclear. In this context, we proposed to better understand the impact of BPA, BPS, and BPF on immune responses (leucocyte sub-populations, cell death, respiratory burst, lysosomal presence, and phagocytic activity) and on biomarkers of metabolic detoxification (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, EROD, and glutathione S-transferase, GST) and oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase, GPx, and lipid peroxidation with thiobarbituric acid reactive substance method, TBARS) in an adult sentinel fish species, the three-spined stickleback. In order to enhance our understanding of how biomarkers change over time, it is essential to determine the internal concentration responsible for the observed responses. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the toxicokinetics of bisphenols. Thus, sticklebacks were exposed either to 100 & mu;g/L of BPA, BPF or BPS for 21 days, or for seven days to 10 and 100 & mu;g/L of BPA or BPS followed by seven days of depuration. Although BPS has very different TK, due to its lower bioaccumulation compared to BPA and BPF, BPS affect oxidative stress and phagocytic activity in the same way. For those reasons, the replacement of BPA by any substitute should be made carefully in terms of risk assessment on aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Intraoperative Pathology Assessment May Lead to Overtreatment of the Axilla in Clinically Node-Negative Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Upfront Mastectomy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background. Randomized trials have established the safety of observation or axillary radiation (AxRT) as an alternative to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with limited nodal disease who undergo upfront surgery. Variability remains in axillary management strategies in cN0 patients undergoing mastectomy found to have one to two positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). We examined the impact of intraoperative pathology assessment in axillary management in a national cohort of AMAROS-eligible mastectomy patients.Methods. The National Cancer Database was used to identify AMAROS-eligible cT1-2N0 breast cancer patients undergoing upfront mastectomy and SLN biopsy (SLNB) and found to have one to two positive SLNs, from 2018 to 2019. We constructed a variable defining intraoperative pathology as 'not performed/not acted on' if ALND was either not performed or performed at a later date than SLNB, or 'performed/acted on' if SLNB and ALND were completed on the same day. Adjusted multivariable analysis examined predictors of treatment with both ALND and AxRT.Results. Overall, 8222 patients with cT1-2N0 disease underwent upfront mastectomy and had one to two positive SLNs. Intraoperative pathology was performed/acted on in 3057 (37.2%) patients. These patients were significantly more likely to have both ALND and AxRT than those without intraoperative pathology (41.0% vs. 4.9%; p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the strongest predictor of receiving both ALND and AxRT was use of intraoperative pathology (odds ratio 8.99, 95% confidence interval 7.70-10.5; p < 0.001).Conclusions. We advocate that consideration should be made for omission of routine intraoperative pathology in mastectomy patients likely to be recommended postmastectomy radiation to minimize axillary overtreatment with both ALND and AxRT in appropriate patients.

TI  - Improving modelled albedo over the Greenland ice sheet through parameter optimisation and MODIS snow albedo retrievals
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenland ice sheet mass loss continues to accelerate as global temperatures increase. The surface albedo of the ice sheet determines the amount of absorbed solar energy, which is a key factor in driving surface snow and ice melting. Satellite-retrieved snow albedo allows us to compare and optimise modelled albedo over the entirety of the ice sheet. We optimise the parameters of the albedo scheme in the ORCHIDEE (Organizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic Ecosystems) land surface model for 3 random years taken over the 2000-2017 period and validate over the remaining years. In particular, we want to improve the albedo at the edges of the ice sheet, since they correspond to ablation areas and show the greatest variations in runoff and surface mass balance. By giving a larger weight to points at the ice sheet's edge, we improve the model-data fit by reducing the root-mean-square deviation by over 25 % for the whole ice sheet for the summer months. This improvement is consistent for all years, even those not used in the calibration step. We also show the optimisation successfully improves the model-data fit at 87.5 % of in situ sites from the PROMICE (Programme for Monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet) network. We conclude by showing which additional model outputs are impacted by changes to the albedo parameters, encouraging future work using multiple data streams when optimising these parameters.

TI  - Feasibility and Clinical Utility of Prediction Models for Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema Incorporating Racial Differences in Disease Incidence
T2  - JAMA SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a common complication of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) but can also develop after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Several models have been developed to predict the risk of disease development before and after surgery; however, these models have shortcomings that include the omission of race, inclusion of variables that are not readily available to patients, low sensitivity or specificity, and lack of risk assessment for patients treated with SLNB. OBJECTIVE To create simple and accurate prediction models for BCRL that can be used to estimate preoperative or postoperative risk.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this prognostic study, women with breast cancer who underwent ALND or SLNB from 1999 to 2020 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the Mayo Clinic were included. Data were analyzed from September to December 2022.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Diagnosis of lymphedema based on measurements. Two predictive models were formulated via logistic regression: a preoperative model (model 1) and a postoperative model (model 2). Model 1 was externally validated using a cohort of 34438 patients with an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis of breast cancer. RESULTS Of 1882 included patients, all were female, and the mean (SD) age was 55.6 (12.2) years; 80 patients (4.3%) were Asian, 190 (10.1%) were Black, 1558 (82.8%) were White, and 54 (2.9%) were another race (including American Indian and Alaska Native, other race, patient refused to disclose, or unknown). A total of 218 patients (11.6%) were diagnosed with BCRL at a mean (SD) follow-up of 3.9 (1.8) years. The BCRL rate was significantly higher among Black women (42 of 190 [22.1%]) compared with all other races (Asian, 10 of 80 [12.5%]; White, 158 of 1558 [10.1%]; other race, 8 of 54 [14.8%]; P < .001). Model 1 included age, weight, height, race, ALND/SLNB status, any radiation therapy, and any chemotherapy. Model 2 included age, weight, race, ALND/SLNB status, any chemotherapy, and patient-reported arm swelling. Accuracy was 73.0% for model 1 (sensitivity, 76.6%; specificity, 72.5%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.75-0.81) at a cutoff of 0.18, and accuracy was 81.1% for model 2 (sensitivity, 78.0%; specificity, 81.5%; AUC, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83-0.88) at a cutoff of 0.10. Both models demonstrated high AUCs on external (model 1: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.74-0.76) or internal (model 2: 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.85) validation.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, preoperative and postoperative prediction models for BCRL were highly accurate and clinically relevant tools comprised of accessible inputs and underscored the effects of racial differences on BCRL risk. The preoperative model identified high-risk patients who require close monitoring or preventative measures. The postoperative model can be used for screening of high-risk patients, thus decreasing the need for frequent clinic visits and arm volume measurements.

TI  - Application of bivariate statistical techniques for landslide susceptibility mapping: A case study in Kaghan Valley, NW Pakistan
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Landslides are dangerous events that threaten both human life and property. This research presents a case study of Kaghan valley catchment, which is an area of frequent landslide activity. We aim to present a comparison between the bivariate Landslide Numerical Risk Factor (LNRF), Statistical Index (SI) and Information Value (InfV) statistical models to evaluate landslide susceptibility. A total of 1556 landslides were identified using earlier reports, field surveys, and GOOGLE Earth imagery. The abundance of landslides is primarily controlled by acute deformation caused by a major thrust fault system and proximity to Hazara Kashmir Syntaxis (HKS). A landslide inventory was randomly partitioned into two datasets. 70% (1106) of landslides were used as a training phase of the models, whereas 30% (450) as validation of the three models. A spatial database of 11 conditioning factors was produced consisting of slope, aspect, elevation, lithology, land use, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), rainfall, Stream Power Index (SPI), distance to faults, rivers and streams. All the landslide susceptibility assessment parameters were obtained from different sources and different landslide susceptibility maps were prepared on the GIS software. Performance of the three models was validated through the Receiver operator Characteristics (ROC) through success and prediction rate curves. Results show that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for InfV, LNRF and SI models are 70.95, 83.99 and 67.56 for success rate curves and 70.75, 83.99 and 67.85 for prediction rate curves, respectively. LNRF having the highest AUC value proved to be superior for generating regional scale landslide susceptibility maps.

TI  - A tool for detecting giant kelp canopy biomass decline in the Californias
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Kelp species provide many ecosystem services associated with their three-dimensional structures. Among these, fast-growth, canopy-forming species, like giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, are the foundation of kelp forests across many temperate reefs. Giant kelp populations have experienced regional declines in different parts of the world. Giant kelp canopy is very dynamic and can take years to recover from disturbance, challenging comparisons of standing biomass with historical baselines. The Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER), curates a time series of Landsat sensed surface cover and biomass for giant kelp in the west coast of North America. In the last decade, this resource has been fundamental to understanding the species' population dynamics and drivers. However, simple ready-to-use summary statistics aimed at classifying regional kelp decline or recovery are not readily available to stakeholders and coastal managers. To this end, we describe here two simple metrics made available through the R package kelpdecline. First, the proportion of Landsat pixels in decline (PPD), in which current biomass is compared with a historical baseline, and second, a pixel occupancy trend (POT), in which current year pixel occupancy is compared to the time-series long probability of occupancy. The package produces raster maps and output tables summarizing kelp decline and trends over a 0.25 x 0.25 degrees scale. Using kelpdecline, we show how sensitivity analysis on PPD parameter variation can increase the confidence of kelp decline estimates.

TI  - Assessing Typhoon Soulik-induced morphodynamics over the Mokpo coastal region in South Korea based on a geospatial approach
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The inner shelf and coastal region of the Yellow Sea along the Korean Peninsula are frequently impacted by typhoons. The Mokpo coastal region in South Korea was significantly affected by Typhoon Soulik in 2018, the deadliest typhoon strike to the southwestern coast since Typhoon Maemi in 2003. Typhoon Soulik overran the region, causing extensive damage to the coast, shoreline, vegetation, and coastal geomorphology. Therefore, it is important to investigate its impact on the coastal ecology, landform, erosion/accretion, suspended-sediment concentration (SSC), and associated coastal changes along the Mokpo region.In this study, the net shoreline movement (NSM), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), fractional vegetation coverage (FVC), coastal-landform change model, normalized difference suspended-sediment index (NDSSI), and SSC-reflectance relation have been used to analyze the coastal morphodynamics over the typhoon periods. We used pre- and post-typhoon Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) images for mapping and monitoring the typhoon effect and recovery status of the Mokpo coast through short- and medium-term coastal-change analysis. The findings highlighted the significant impacts of typhoons on coastal dynamics, wetland vegetation, and sediment resuspension along the Mokpo coast. It has been observed that typhoon-induced SSC influences shoreline and coastal morphology. The outcome of this research may provide databases to manage coastal environments and a long-term plan to restore valuable coastal habitats. In addition, the findings may be useful for post-typhoon emergency response, coastal planners, and administrators involved in the long-term development of human life.

TI  - Microplastic pollution in the food web: observation of ingestion by the talitrid amphipod <i>Cryptorchestia garbinii</i> on the shores of Lake Garda
T2  - EUROPEAN ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic pollution in the environment has become a much-discussed issue worldwide. In recent decades, the contamination of all environments has become increasingly evident, in particular, that of water is highly concerning. Ingestion by different animal species under natural conditions has also been demonstrated. Among these is the Talitrid Amphipod Cryptorchestia garbinii, which lives on the banks of the internal waterways and lakes' shorelines. As detritivores species, it is very exposed to microplastics that can be ingested, probably mistaking them for food. Aiming to highlight the microplastic ingestion and the role of this species as an entry point for the food web, we analyzed 80 specimens from 4 sites along the shores of Garda Lake, one of the first lakes in Italy to be studied for this type of contamination. The microplastics ingested were observed and quantified through the Nile Red staining method. We were able to verify the presence of ingested microplastics in all the samples analyzed and, therefore, in the food web. This species could serve as valuable natural models of plastic exposure. Microplastic sentinel species can be used as a proxy for environmental exposure and ecosystem monitoring tools to quantify and assess the impacts of microplastic contamination.

TI  - Elemental ratios as tracers of the sources of mineral dust in north-eastern Sahara
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The objective of this study is to confirm the possibility of tracing sources of airborne mineral dust using elemental ratios. The region of study is the north-eastern part of the Sahara where dust compositional data were lacking; 272 mineral dust samples collected at 3 experimental stations of Egypt were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence. Based on the mineral dust concentration, 65% of the samples correspond to moderate (3-10 & mu;g m(-3)), 22% to medium (10-25 & mu;g m(-3)), and 13% to intense (> 25 & mu;g m(-3)) dust events. The Ca/Al and (Mg + Ca)/Fe ratios were found to be strongly correlated and their ranges of variation to cover are more than one order of magnitude, which confirms their interest for the tracing of the dust sources. Using a combination of MODIS satellite observations, HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis, and simulations with dust emission models, the large (> 6) and intermediate (2-6) Ca/Al ratios were shown to correspond to dust originating from saline playas (chotts) and calcareous surfaces, respectively. Conversely, the lowest (< 2) ratios correspond to dust emitted by siliceous sand seas (ergs). Therefore, a classification of the dust in 3 categories (erg-like, calcareous, and chott-like) based on Ca/Al is proposed. The events of moderate to medium intensity are dominated by chott-like and calcareous dust, which suggests that these sources are activated during erosion events of limited (local) extension. Conversely, the fact that the dust composition is more likely to be of the erg-like type during intense events underlines the dominant role played by sand dune fields during major erosion events.

TI  - A prospective CSFV-PCV2 bivalent vaccine effectively protects against classical swine fever virus and porcine circovirus type 2 dual challenge and prevents horizontal transmission
T2  - VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infection leading to CSF outbreaks is among the most devastating swine diseases in the pig industry. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection, resulting in porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), is also a highly contagious disease affecting pig health worldwide. To prevent and control disease occurrence, multiple-vaccine immunization is necessary in contaminated areas or countries. In this study, a novel CSFV-PCV2 bivalent vaccine was constructed and demonstrated to be capable of eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses against CSFV and PCV2, respectively. Moreover, a CSFV-PCV2 dual-challenge trial was conducted on specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs to evaluate vaccine efficacy. All of the vaccinated pigs survived and showed no clinical signs of infection throughout the experimental period. In contrast, placebo-vaccinated pigs exhibited severe clinical signs of infection and steeply increased viremia levels of CSFV and PCV2 after virus challenge. Additionally, neither clinical signs nor viral detections were noted in the sentinel pigs when cohabitated with vaccinated-challenged pigs at three days post-inoculation of CSFV, indicating that the CSFV-PCV2 bivalent vaccine completely prevents horizontal transmission of CSFV. Furthermore, conventional pigs were utilized to evaluate the application of the CSFV-PCV2 bivalent vaccine in field farms. An adequate CSFV antibody response and a significant decrease in PCV2 viral load in the peripheral lymph nodes were observed in immunized conventional pigs, suggesting its potential for clinical application. Overall, this study demonstrated that the CSFV-PCV2 bivalent vaccine effectively elicited protective immune responses and the ability to prevent horizontal transmission, which could be a prospective strategy for controlling both CSF and PCVAD in commercial herds.

Its main parameters are aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 670 nm over ocean and valid land pixels and at 865 nm over ocean. Here, the algorithm and assumptions behind it are presented. Further, first examples of product parameters are given based on applying the algorithm to simulated EarthCARE test data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level-1 data. Comparisons to input fields used for simulations, to the official MODIS aerosol product, to AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and to Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) show an overall reasonable agreement. Over ocean, correlations are 0.98 (simulated scenes), 0.96 (compared to MYD04) and 0.9 (compared to MAN). Over land, correlations are 0.62 (simulated scenes), 0.87 (compared to MYD04) and 0.77 (compared to AERONET). A concluding discussion will focus on future improvements that are necessary and envisioned to enhance the product.

TI  - Pampas fox spatial and temporal variation in Argentinean agroecosystems
T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Context. Agricultural activities have reduced wildlife natural habitats and increased the spatial overlap between animals' distribution and human activities. However, carnivores with a broad diet and flexible habitat requirements can tolerate human-induced environmental changes. Thus, identifying changes in their densities and spatial distribution are important factors to take into consideration when working towards minimising human-carnivore conflict. Aims. Our aim was to identify the main environmental and human variables influencing Pampas fox density and to produce density maps in the reproductive and non-reproductive seasons. Methods. We performed spotlight counts at night, following the line transect method in the non-reproductive and reproductive seasons during two consecutive years. We also obtained landscape, human-impact and environmental spatial variables using remote sensing data and Geographic Information Systems. We modelled and mapped the Pampas fox's spatial density using Density Surface Models. Key results. We found that disturbance by human activities and landscape configuration influenced the spatial variation of the Pampas fox density across time and space. We registered a positive association between the number of foxes and the proximity to urban areas and paved roads, and we also found higher densities near grasslands areas and less modified habitats varying with the season and year. A higher density of foxes was observed in the non-reproductive season compared with the reproductive season. Conclusions and Implications. This study provides insight on the variation in Pampas fox densities across agroecosystems. It highlights the relevance of more naturalised and protected habitats to sustain the Pampas fox population in highly fragmented landscapes, but also shows a positive association with disturbed areas. The spatial information developed in this study is useful to identify areas where ecosystem services could be encouraged, helping to maintain the ecosystems' equilibrium and biodiversity conservation, and develop new management programs creating human-wildlife coexistence.

TI  - A new inventory of High Mountain Asia surging glaciers derived from multiple elevation datasets since the 1970s
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Glacier surging is an unusual instability of ice flow, and inventories of surging glaciers are important for regional glacier mass balance studies and glacier dynamic studies. Glacier surges in High Mountain Asia (HMA) have been widely reported. However, the completeness of available inventories of HMA surging glaciers is hampered by the insufficient spatial and temporal coverage of glacier change observations or by the limitations of the identification methods. In this study, we established a new inventory of HMA surging glaciers based on glacier surface elevation changes and morphological changes over 4 decades. Three elevation change datasets based on four elevation sources (the KH-9 DEM, NASA DEM, COP30 DEM, and HMA DEM) and long-term Landsat satellite image series were utilized to assess the presence of typical surge features over two time periods (1970s-2000 and 2000-2020). A total of 890 surging and 336 probably or possibly surging glaciers were identified in HMA. Compared to the most recent inventory of surging glaciers in HMA, our inventory incorporated 253 previously unidentified surging glaciers. The number and area of surging glaciers accounted for similar to 2:49% (excluding glaciers smaller than 0.4 km(2)) and similar to 16:59% of the total glacier number and glacier area in HMA, respectively. Glacier surges were found in 21 of the 22 subregions of HMA (except for the Dzhungarsky Alatau); however, the density of surging glaciers is highly uneven. Glacier surges occur frequently in the northwestern subregions (e.g., Pamir and Karakoram) but less often in the peripheral subregions. The inventory further shows that surge activity is more likely to occur for glaciers with a larger area, longer length, and wider elevation range. Among glaciers with similar areas, the surging ones usually have steeper slopes than non-surging ones. The inventory and elevation change products of identified surging glaciers are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7961207 (Guo et al., 2023).

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Air, water, soil, and plant resources have been endangered by human activities in recent years. The aim is to study the trend of changes in these resources using remote sensing data over the last 20 years. The study area of Yazd province (including 24 cities) is in the desert area in the center of Iran. Data were extracted from remote sensing products with web-based software Giovanni NASA and Google Earth Engine platform in the form of time series maps and graphs. The results showed there are two groups, increased and decreased variables. Increased variables were the vegetation density soil temperature, soil organic carbon, black carbon, and evapotranspiration. Decreased variables were wind speed, carbon monoxide, dust, soil moisture, and land surface temperature. Comparing these three categories of climatic, edaphic, and plant factors showed plant and climatic factors had a good trend. Edaphic factors only 50% of them had a good trend. In climatic factors, evapotranspiration had an unfavorable trend, but temperature and wind speed had a good trend. We found good trends; for example, enhanced vegetation index (EVI) had 42%, increasing relative minimum and land surface temperature (LST) had about 46% decreasing relative maximum in the desert region in urban areas. The policy of conservation of plant environmental resources in the desert region was caused by increasing vegetation cover density and decreasing dust, wind speed, and air temperature. Good and bad trends were observed in regions with more nighttime light in cities. This method provides a quick review of many various resources in early warning to governments and decision-makers in the region.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study focuses on analyzing the impact of dryness/wetness, derived from Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), on vegetation phenology in different agro-ecological zones (AERs) of India during 2001-2018. Long-term CRU TS3 SPEI datasets at a 3-month time scale were used to characterize the drought events, while Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from MODIS at a 250 m scale was used to extract crop phenology metrics. The results revealed that the dryness was prevalent in the hot sub-humid regions since the new millennium. Non-parametric trend analysis showed that northeast India experienced the highest increase in drought events over the past 38 years. In terms of phenology metrics, approximately 59, 23, and 61% of agricultural areas displayed an increasing trend of the start of season (SoS), seasonal NDVI amplitude (NDVImax), and length of season (LoS). However, 21% of agricultural area showed a decreasing trend in SoS, 5.17% in NDVImax, and 28% in LoS. The impact of climate extremes varied across different AERs, that too in dry and wet years. During drought years, most AERs exhibited a delayed SoS, reduced NDVImax, and decreased LoS. The sensitivity of LoS to dryness is higher in semi-arid and sub-humid regions compared to arid and humid regions. Under the projected increase in extreme events, understanding resilient crop growth in response to dryness/wetness is crucial for adaptation and mitigation strategies. The findings of this study help in identifying areas that are particularly vulnerable to drought events and can contribute in informed decision-making.

TI  - A mental spaces analysis of religious identity discourse
T2  - REVIEW OF COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Religious identity is often viewed as a relatively stable construct, reflecting an individual's personal worldview. However, individuals living within modern multi-cultural societies often must engage in extensive reflection to orient themselves to faith traditions in ways that are coherent and personally relevant. Although some work has examined the connection between narratives of religious experience, identity and cognition (cf. Richardson, 2012; Richardson & Nagashima, 2018; Richardson & Mueller, 2019), the relationship between thinking and speaking about this identity is still a developing area of enquiry, with important consequences for how religious faith and practice are understood. This article presents a detailed analysis of an interview with a UK-based Jewish woman based on the mental spaces (Fauconnier, 1994) and conceptual blending (Fauconnier & Turner, 2002) frameworks. The analysis shows how mental spaces and the relationship between elements within those spaces emerge over the course of a discourse event so as to constitute a personal account of religious identity. The concluding section furthermore discusses how within- and across-space contrast links are utilized, along with general processes of compression and decompression, to develop a blend that dynamically expresses the interviewee's religious identity as an integrated and coherent position lying between competing attractor states.

TI  - Indirect effect of race-related stress on traumatic stress and depression symptoms via subjective social status in a Black community sample
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Experiencing racism is linked to lower subjective social status (SSS), defined as one's perception of their position in society. SSS is influenced by power, prestige, and objective socioeconomic status (SES). Previous findings suggest that race-related stress may be related to adverse mental health outcomes through SSS in Black Americans, a population that has been deeply affected by continuing legacies of oppression. The current study examines the indirect association between race-related stress and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms through SSS in a community sample of largely trauma-exposed Black Americans (N = 173). Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that overall race-related stress significantly predicted lower SSS, higher PTSD symptoms, and higher depression symptoms. Analyses also revealed indirect effects of cultural race-related stress on PTSD and depression symptoms through SSS after controlling for SES. Results suggest that the experience of race-related stress, particularly cultural race-related stress, which involves the degradation and disparagement of one's culture and worldview, is associated with more severe PTSD and depression symptoms potentially due to these experiences decreasing Black Americans' SSS. Findings support the need for systemic intervention strategies to disrupt the cultural oppression of Black Americans and improve the societal value and mental health of this population.

TI  - Interpretation of aeromagnetic and remote sensing data of Auchi and Idah sheets of the Benin-arm Anambra basin: Implication of mineral resources
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The need for mineral resources for economic development is key in both developing and developed countries. However, miners usually resort to random excavation of mineral deposits without proper investigation to identify structures of interest in target areas. This usually leads to land depletion and abandonment. The aim of this study is to assess the mineral potential in part of the Benin-arm of the Anambra basin by investigating the geophysical characteristics of the area using remote sensing and aeromagnetic data. Surface and subsurface regional structures, including faults and zones of mineralisation, were mapped by integrating aeromagnetic and remote sensing data. The mineral bearing zones that show high prospects of mineral deposits in the region were identified. The rose diagram revealed that the surface lineaments are aligned in the NW-SE, N-S, NE-SW, E-W, NNE-SSW, ENE-WSW, and ESE-WNW directions. The orientations of the subsurface lineaments are aligned mostly in the NE-SW, N-S, and E-W directions. The magnetic intensity ranged between -431.38 and 399.82 nT, while reduction-to-pole magnetic intensity ranged from -416 to 664.45 nT. The first vertical derivative showed magnetic intensity which ranged from -0.5863 to 0.9060 nT/km(2). The total horizontal derivative magnetic intensity ranged from -0.00031 to 0.762691 nT/km(2), while the analytic signal showed magnetic intensity ranging from 14.0664 to 394,607.3438 nT/cm(2). The windowed Euler deconvolution depth to magnetic source showed depth range of <20 to 2,000 m. Many of the features delineated in the study area were characterised by shallow magnetic source depths (<500 m); this is a common characteristic of basement complex terrains. Deeper magnetic source depths (>1,000 m) were observed in the sedimentary terrain. Mineral exploration should be focused in areas with high lineament concentration, as lineaments are potential conduits for economic minerals deposition.

TI  - Continuous weekly monitoring of methane emissions from the Permian Basin by inversion of TROPOMI satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We quantify weekly methane emissions at 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees (approximate to 25 x 25 km(2)) resolution from the Permian Basin, the largest oil production basin in the US, by inverse analysis of satellite observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) from May 2018 to October 2020. The mean oil and gas emission from the region (+/- standard deviation of weekly estimates) was 3.7 +/- 0.9 Tg a(-1), higher than previous TROPOMI inversion estimates that may have used biased prior emissions or background assumptions. We find strong week-to-week variability in emissions superimposed on longer-term trends, and these are consistent with independent inferences of temporal emission variability from tower, aircraft, and multispectral satellite data. New well development and natural gas spot price were significant drivers of variability in emissions over our study period but the concurrent 50% increase in oil and gas production was not. The methane intensity (methane emitted per unit of methane gas produced) averaged 4.6% +/- 1.3% and steadily decreased from 5 %-6% in 2018 to 3 %-4% in 2020. While the decreasing trend suggests improvement in operator practices during the study period, methane emissions from the Permian Basin remained high, with methane intensity an order of magnitude above the industry target of <0.2 %. Our success in using TROPOMI satellite observations for weekly estimates of emissions from a major oil production basin shows promise for application to near-real-time monitoring in support of climate change mitigation efforts.

TI  - Mapping tree species diversity of temperate forests using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and -2 imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on tree species diversity is critical for forest biodiversity, conservation and management, but mapping forest diversity over large and mixed forest areas using satellite remote sensing data remains a challenge because of scale-and ecosystem-dependent relationships between spectral heterogeneity and tree species diversity. In this study, three different diversity indices (Simpson (& lambda;), Shannon (H'), and Pielou (J')), were tested to characterize forest tree species diversity using individual monthly and multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and-2 images during 2021. The performance of three different machine learning models, Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) were tested. A collection of 1,020 plot measurements (comprising 47 tree species and 28,122 trees), randomly collected in a mixed broadleaf-conifer forest area in northeast China, was used to train (n = 816) and validate (n = 204) the models. The models dependent on multi-temporal Sentinel-1/2 imagery were found to outperform the models based on individual monthly data, in predicting forest tree species diversity, with average accuracies of 78% for H', 77% for & lambda; and 77% for J'. The use of DNN performed marginally better than the XGB and RF models, with accuracies of 81% for H', 80% for & lambda; and 79% for J', respectively. Finally, a boosted regression model, involving environmental variable predictors and the DNN-based estimated tree species diversity, showed that on average 63 & PLUSMN; 4% of the spatial variations of tree species diversity was explained by environmental variables, including annual temperature (29.30%), followed by soil fertility (27.03%), snow cover (13.63%) and a digital elevation model (12.33%). Our results highlight that an empirical approach based on machine learning and multi-temporal Sentinel-1/2 data can accurately predict forest tree species diversity and we further show the important roles of air temperature and soil fertility in governing the spatial variability of tree species diversity in a mixed broadleaf-conifer forest setting.

TI  - Assessment of aboveground biomass and carbon stock of subtropical pine forest of Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The presented study estimated the aboveground biomass (AGB) of Pinus roxburghii (chir pine) natural forests and plantations, and created biomass maps using a relationship (regression model) between AGB and Sentinel-2 spectral indices. The mean AGB and BGB (belowground biomass) of natural forests were 79.54 Mg & BULL;ha-1 and 20.68 Mg & BULL;ha-1, respectively, whereas the mean AGB and BGB of plantations were 94.48 Mg & BULL;ha-1 and 24.56 Mg & BULL;ha-1, respectively. Correlation showed that mean diameter at breast height (DBH) and mean height have weak relationships with AGB, and BGB has shown correlation coefficients (R2 = 0.46) and (R2 = 0.56) for polynomial models. Regression models between AGB (Mg & BULL;ha-1) of Pinus roxburghii natural forest and Sentinel-2 spectral indices showed a strong relationship with Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI) with R2 = 0.72 followed by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) with R2 = 0.70. In contrast, the lower performance of spectral indices has been shown in regression with plantation AGB. Correlation coefficients (R2) were 0.41, 0.41, and 0.40 for RVI, NDVI, and ARVI, respectively. All indices showed that the distribution of AGB data was not the best fit with the linear regression model. Therefore, non-linear exponential and power models were considered the best fit for NDVI, RVI, and ARVI. A biomass map was developed from RVI for both natural forests and plantation because RVI has the highest R2 and lowest P-value.

TI  - Assessing microhabitat, landscape features and intraguild relationships in the occupancy of the enigmatic and threatened Andean tiger cat (Leopardus tigrinus pardinoides) in the cloud forests of northwestern Colombia.
T2  - PLoS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesocarnivores play a key role in ecosystem dynamics through the regulation of prey populations and are sensitive to environmental changes; thus, they are often considered good model organisms for conservation planning. However, data regarding the factors that influence the habitat use of threatened small wild felids such as the Andean tiger cat (Leopardus tigrinus pardinoides) are scarce. We conducted a two-year survey with 58 camera trap stations to evaluate the determinants of Andean tiger cat habitat use in three protected areas in the Middle Cauca, Colombia. We developed site occupancy models and found that Andean tiger cat habitat use increased with leaf litter depth at intermediate elevations and far from human settlements. Through conditional cooccurrence models, we found that Andean tiger cat habitat use was invariant to the presence of prey or potential intraguild competitors and killers/predators, but its detectability increased when they were present and detected. This suggests that Andean tiger cats may be more likely to be detected in sites with high prey availability. We found that Andean tiger cats preferred sites with deep leaf litter, which is a particular feature of cloud forests that provides suitable conditions for ambush hunting and hiding from intraguild enemies. Our results showed that Andean tiger cats avoided human settlements, which may minimize potential mortality risks in those areas. Moreover, the restricted use of middle elevations by Andean tiger cats suggested that they could be used as a sentinel species to track the effects of climate change since their suitable habitat is likely to be projected upward in elevation. Future conservation actions must be focused on identifying and mitigating human-related threats close to the Andean tiger cat habitat while preserving microhabitat conditions and the existing networks of protected areas.

However, data regarding the factors that influence the habitat use of threatened small wild felids such as the Andean tiger cat (Leopardus tigrinus pardinoides) are scarce. We conducted a two-year survey with 58 camera trap stations to evaluate the determinants of Andean tiger cat habitat use in three protected areas in the Middle Cauca, Colombia. We developed site occupancy models and found that Andean tiger cat habitat use increased with leaf litter depth at intermediate elevations and far from human settlements. Through conditional cooccurrence models, we found that Andean tiger cat habitat use was invariant to the presence of prey or potential intraguild competitors and killers/predators, but its detectability increased when they were present and detected. This suggests that Andean tiger cats may be more likely to be detected in sites with high prey availability. We found that Andean tiger cats preferred sites with deep leaf litter, which is a particular feature of cloud forests that provides suitable conditions for ambush hunting and hiding from intraguild enemies. Our results showed that Andean tiger cats avoided human settlements, which may minimize potential mortality risks in those areas. Moreover, the restricted use of middle elevations by Andean tiger cats suggested that they could be used as a sentinel species to track the effects of climate change since their suitable habitat is likely to be projected upward in elevation. Future conservation actions must be focused on identifying and mitigating human-related threats close to the Andean tiger cat habitat while preserving microhabitat conditions and the existing networks of protected areas.

TI  - Comparison of sentinel lymph node distribution and lymphatic drainage pathway between high- and low-risk endometrial cancers
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis study aimed to compare the distribution and drainage pathway of sentinel lymph nodes between high- and low-risk endometrial cancers.MethodsIn total, 429 patients with endometrial cancer who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy in Peking University People's Hospital from July 2015 to April 2022 were retrospectively enrolled. There were 148 patients in the high-risk group and 281 patients in the low-risk group.ResultsThe unilateral and bilateral detection rates of sentinel lymph nodes were 86.5% and 55.9%, respectively. The highest detection rate was achieved in the subgroup with a combined use of indocyanine green (ICG) and carbon nanoparticles (CNP) (94.4% for unilateral detection and 66.7% for bilateral detection). The upper paracervical pathway (UPP) was detected in 93.3% of cases in the high-risk group and 96.0% of cases in the low-risk group (p = 0.261). The lower paracervical pathway (LPP) was detected in 10.0% of cases in the high-risk group and 17.9% of cases in the low-risk group (p = 0.048). Remarkably increased detection rates of SLN in the common iliac (7.5%) and para-aortic or precaval areas (2.9%) were observed in the high-risk group. In contrast, a markedly decreased detection rate of SLN in the internal iliac area (1.9%) was observed in the high-risk group.ConclusionThe highest detection rate of SLN was observed in the subgroup with a combined use of ICG and CNP. The detection of UPP is important for both high-risk and low-risk cases, while LPP detection plays a more important role in the low-risk group. Lymphadenectomy in the common iliac and para-aortic or precaval areas is essential for patients with high-risk EC. Removal of internal iliac lymph nodes is essential for patients with low-risk EC, in case of ineffective SLN mapping.

TI  - Both Landsat- and LiDAR-derived measures predict forest bee response to large-scale wildfire
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Large-scale disturbances such as wildfire can have profound impacts on the composition, structure, and functioning of ecosystems. Bees are critical pollinators in natural settings and often respond positively to wildfires, particularly in forests where wildfire leads to more open conditions and increased floral resources. The use of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) provides opportunities for quantifying habitat features across large spatial scales and is increasingly available to scientists and land managers for post-fire habitat assessment. We evaluated the extent to which LiDAR-derived forest structure measurements can predict forest bee communities after a large, mixed-severity fire. We hypothesized that LiDAR measurements linked to post-fire forest structure would improve our ability to predict bee abundance and species richness when compared to satellite-based maps of burn severity. To test this hypothesis, we sampled wild bee communities within the Douglas Fire Complex in southwestern Oregon, USA. We then used LiDAR and Landsat data to quantify forest structure and burn severity, respectively, across bee sampling locations. We found that the LiDAR forest structure model was the best predictor of abundance, whereas the Landsat burn severity model had better predictive ability for species richness. Furthermore, the Landsat burn severity model was better at predicting the presence and species richness of bumble bees (Bombus spp.), an ecologically distinct and economically important group within the Pacific Northwest. We posit that the divergent responses of the two modeling approaches are due to distinct responses by bee taxa to variation in forest structure as mediated by wildfire, with bumble bees in particular depending on closed-canopy forest for some portions of their life cycle. Our study demonstrates that LiDAR data can provide information regarding the drivers of bee abundance in post-wildfire conifer forest, and that both remote sensing approaches are useful for predicting components of wild bee diversity after large-scale wildfire.

TI  - Evaluating the spatiotemporal variations of soil salinity in Sirjan Playa, Iran using Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 OLI imagery
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The creation of large-scale deserts is a consequence of soil salinization, a major land degradation phenomenon that also disrupts ecological equilibrium. Saline lands can be evaluated, mapped, and monitored in different world regions using satellite imaging and remote sensing techniques. In order to assess the ability of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A imagery for monitoring the spatiotemporal variations of electrical conductivity (EC) and to determine the importance of salinity indices for prediction in two seasons (summer and winter) using the systematic sampling method, from surface depth (0--20 cm), 90 soil samples were taken of marginal lands of Sirjan Playa, southeast of Iran. Satellite images for two seasons were acquired close to the sampling time to obtain the soil salinity indices. Four machine-learning algorithms, namely artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), were applied to estimate the spatiotemporal changes in soil salinity. Results confirmed that the ANN model developed by the Sentinel-2A image had the highest performance (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 16.1, NRMSE = 27.1) to predict ECe in the winter season. Furthermore, RF presents the lowest error for prediction ECe during the summer, independent type of satellite data used. Additionally, in virtually all of the analyzed models, the Sentinel-2A data produced lower RMSE and NRMSE values than the Landsat-8 data throughout the two seasons. Results also confirmed that among the soil salinity indices, the Vegetation Soil Salinity Index (VSSI) was identified as the most effective predictor. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of satellite imaging and machine learning algorithms for monitoring and predicting soil salinity, which can contribute to the sustainable management of marginal lands in arid and semi-arid regions. The findings also highlight the importance of selecting appropriate satellite data and salinity indices for accurate and reliable predictions.

TI  - Geodetic observations confirming land subsidence of Bandung Basin, Indonesia, and subsequent building damage
T2  - ACTA GEODAETICA ET GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence in the Bandung Basin has been historically detected and possibly caused by several factors, including groundwater withdrawal. It is presumed that land subsidence is still occurring, causing a wide-ranging impact on infrastructure and buildings. This study aimed to determine the current status of land subsidence in Bandung Basin by using the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS). The source of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery used in this study is Sentinel-1 imagery from 2014 to 2021. Land subsidence was then estimated using the InSAR method and validated with the GPS results. Based on the interpretation of the InSAR results, the most significant land subsidence in the Bandung Basin occurred in the Gedebage and Dayeuhkolot districts. It is estimated that the average annual land subsidence for these districts is about 10 cm/yr, with a maximum amplitude of around 17 cm/yr. Considerable damages due to land subsidence were also found. InSAR-derived land subsidence showed a good agreement with the GPS-derived land subsidence. In conclusion, land subsidence has been confirmed by two independent methodologies in this region and tends to worsen in the Bandung Basin.

TI  - Tracking the pumice rafts from the Fukutoku-Okanoba submarine volcano with Satellites and a Lagrangian Particles trajectory model
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - On August 13th, 2021, the Fukutoku-Okanoba, a submarine volcano in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, erupted. Satellites detected various pumice rafts that had drifted westward to reach southern Japan over two months. To cope with the potential danger from pumice rafts, predicting their trajectories is crucial. Using a Lagrangian particle tracking model, the trajectories of the rafts were investigated. The model results showed strong sensitivity to the windage coefficient of pumice rafts, which is uncertain and could cause significant errors. An optimal windage coefficient was estimated by comparing the model results with satellite images using a skill score based on the distance between simulated particles and the nearest observed rafts divided by the travel distance of the particles. The optimal windage coefficients ranged between 2 and 3 % and produced pathways comparable to the observations from satellites. The simulation results showed that the pumice rafts moved from Fukutoku-Okanoba toward the Ryukyu Islands for approximately two months prior to being pushed by the north-easterly wind toward Taiwan against the Kuroshio. The methods presented here may become a valuable tool in managing coastal hazards due to diverse marine debris.

TI  - Amelanotic Malignant Melanoma: A Case Report
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Amelanotic malignant melanoma (AMM) is a skin cancer that arises from mutated melanocytes that lack pigmentation. AMM represents 2-8% of all malignant melanomas. This rare subtype is difficult to diagnose clinically as it mimics other benign skin lesions. AMM can occur in any part of the body with various presentations and has a predilection for male gender and fair skin tones. We present a case report of a 62-year-old Caucasian male with AMM of the right lower extremity. The patient presented with a painless nodule on his right lower extremity that rapidly increased in size for seven months with no signs of malignancy, such as fever, night sweats, fatigue, bruising, weight loss, or headache. Simultaneously, the patient presented with right inguinal lymphadenopathy and pitting edema of the right lower extremity. The patient had a previous medical history of basal and squamous cell carcinoma and psoriasis with no personal or family history of melanoma. The mass was excised and sent to a pathologist along with a right inguinal sentinel lymph node biopsy. The final pathology report revealed an ulcerated AMM on the right lower extremity and a positive node for melanoma with a metastatic deposit. The patient underwent adjuvant immunotherapy resulting in the clearance of the cancer cells. This report highlights the importance of early diagnosis, appropriate surgical management, and adjuvant therapy to improve the prognosis of this rare melanoma subtype.

TI  - Interannual fires as a source for subarctic summer decadal climate variability mediated by permafrost thawing
T2  - NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate model simulations run under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) use an inhomogeneous biomass burning aerosol (BBA) emission dataset, which exhibits pronounced interannual variability from 1997-2014 due to the infusion of satellite data. Using the Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble (CESM2-LE) with original and smoothed CMIP6 BBA forcings, we show that the CMIP6 data inhomogeneity causes spurious decadal subarctic land warming. During years with reduced aerosol concentrations, increased solar radiation can trigger abrupt subarctic permafrost thawing, increased soil water drainage, upper soil drying, and subsequent surface warming. This slow process, which is further amplified by nonlinear cloud-aerosol interactions, cannot be completely offset during years of increased aerosol fluxes, thereby reddening surface temperature spectra in response to large-amplitude interannual aerosol forcing. More generally, our CESM2 experiments identify a pathway for generating decadal variability in high latitudes, involving interannual shortwave forcing and slow nonlinear soil responses.

TI  - Satellite record reveals 1960s acceleration of Totten Ice Shelf in East Antarctica
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wilkes Land and Totten Glacier (TG) in East Antarctica (EA) have been losing ice mass significantly since 1989. There is a lack of knowledge of long-term mass balance in the region which hinders the estimation of its contribution to global sea level rise. Here we show that this acceleration trend in TG has occurred since the 1960s. We reconstruct ice flow velocity fields of 1963-1989 in TG from the first-generation satellite images of ARGON and Landsat-1 & 4, and build a five decade-long record of ice dynamics. We find a persistent long-term ice discharge rate of 68 & PLUSMN; 1 Gt/y and an acceleration of 0.17 & PLUSMN; 0.02 Gt/y(2) from 1963 to 2018, making TG the greatest contributor to global sea level rise in EA. We attribute the long-term acceleration near grounding line from 1963 to 2018 to basal melting likely induced by warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water. The speed up in shelf front during 1973-1989 was caused by a large calving front retreat. As the current trend continues, intensified monitoring in the TG region is recommended in the next decades.Historical velocity maps reveal over five decade-long acceleration and high-level discharge in Totten Glacier, East Antarctica, from 1963-2018, induced by warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water.

TI  - Prognosis and local treatment strategies of breast cancer patients with different numbers of micrometastatic lymph nodes
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundLymph node micrometastasis is an important prognostic factor in breast cancer, but patients with different numbers of involved lymph nodes are all divided into the same N1mi stage without distinction. We designed this study to compare the prognosis and local treatment recommendations of N1mi breast cancer patients with different numbers of micrometastatic lymph nodes.Patients and methodsA total of 27,032 breast cancer patients with T1-2N1miM0 stage from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2004-2019) who underwent breast surgery were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into three groups for prognosis comparison according to the number of micrometastatic lymph nodes: N1mi with 1 (Nmi = 1), 2 (Nmi = 2), or more (Nmi & GE; 3) involved lymph nodes. We explored the characteristics and survival outcomes of the population receiving different local treatments, including different axillary surgery types and whether receiving radiotherapy or not. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were used to compare the overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) in different groups. Stratified analyses and interaction analyses were also applied to explore the predictive significance of different involved lymph nodes numbers. Propensity score matching (PSM) method was utilized to balance the differences between groups.ResultsUnivariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that nodal status was an independent prognostic factor. After adjustment for other prognostic factors, there was a significant difference in prognosis between Nmi = 1 group and Nmi = 2 group [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.145, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.047-1.251, P = 0.003], and patients with Nmi & GE; 3 group had a significantly poorer prognosis (adjusted HR 1.679, 95% CI 1.589-2.407; P < 0.001). The proportion of N1mi patients only underwent sentinel lymph nodes biopsy (SLNB) gradually increased from 2010 (P-trend < 0.001). After adjusting for other factors, N1mi patients who underwent axillary lymph nodes dissection (ALND) was associated with significant survival benefit than SLNB (adjusted HR 0.932, 95%CI 0.874-0.994; P = 0.033), the same goes for receiving radiotherapy (adjusted HR 1.107, 95%CI 1.030-1.190; P = 0.006). Further stratified analysis showed that in the SLNB subgroup, radiotherapy was associated with a significant survival benefit (HR 1.695, 95%CI 1.534-1.874; P < 0.001), whereas in the ALND subgroup, there was no significant prognostic difference with or without radiotherapy (HR 1.029, 95%CI 0.933-1.136; P = 0.564).ConclusionOur study indicates that the increasing number of lymph node micrometastases was associated a worse prognosis of N1mi breast cancer patients. In addition, ALND does provide a significant survival benefit for these patients, while the benefit from local radiotherapy may be of even greater importance.

TI  - Using airborne lidar and machine learning to predict visibility across diverse vegetation and terrain conditions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Visibility analyses, used in many disciplines, rely on viewshed algorithms that map locations visible to an observer based on a given surface model. Mapping continuous visibility over broad extents is uncommon due to extreme computational expense. This study introduces a novel method for spatially-exhaustive visibility mapping using airborne lidar and random forests that requires only a sparse sample of viewsheds. In 24 topographically and vegetatively diverse landscapes across the contiguous US, 1000 random point viewsheds were generated at four different observation radii (125 m, 250 m, 500 m, 1000 m), using a 1 m resolution lidar-derived digital surface model. Visibility index - the proportion of visible area to total area - was used as the target variable for site-scale and national-scale modeling, which used a diverse set of 146 terrain- and vegetation-based 10 m resolution metrics as predictors. Variables based on vegetation, especially those based on local neighborhoods, were more important than those based on terrain. Visibility at shorter distances was more accurately estimated. National-scale models trained on a wider range of vegetation and terrain conditions resulted in improved R-2, although at some sites error increased compared to site-scale models. Results from an independent test site demonstrate potential for application of this methodology to diverse landscapes.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node identification using contrast-enhanced ultrasound in breast cancer: review of the literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ULTRASONICS
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Before breast cancer surgery, sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification and biopsy using blue dye, radioisotope (RI) with a gamma probe, or a combination of the two are mainly performed. The dye-guided method requires skilled technique to make an incision in the skin and identify SLNs without damaging the lymphatic vessels. In addition, dye-induced anaphylactic shock has been reported. To use the & gamma;-probe-guided method, the facility must be able to handle RI. However, to overcome the drawbacks of these methods, Omoto et al. developed a new identification modality using contrast-enhanced ultrasound with an ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) in 2002. Since then, many basic experiments and clinical studies using various UCA have been reported. In particular, a number of studies in SLN detection using Sonazoid have been reported and are herein reviewed.

TI  - Using microsatellite data to estimate the persistence of field-level yield gaps and their drivers in smallholder systems
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - One way to meet growing food demand is to increase yields in regions that have large yield gaps, including smallholder systems. To do this, it is important to quantify yield gaps, their persistence, and their drivers at large spatio-temporal scales. Here we use microsatellite data to map field-level yields from 2014 to 2018 in Bihar, India and use these data to assess the magnitude, persistence, and drivers of yield gaps at the landscape scale. We find that overall yield gaps are large (33% of mean yields), but only 17% of yields are persistent across time. We find that sowing date, plot area, and weather are the factors that most explain variation in yield gaps across our study region, with earlier sowing associated with significantly higher yield values. Simulations suggest that if all farmers were able to adopt ideal management strategies, including earlier sowing and more irrigation use, yield gaps could be closed by up to 42%. These results highlight the ability of micro-satellite data to understand yield gaps and their drivers, and can be used to help identify ways to increase production in smallholder systems across the globe.

AB  - Evaluating glacial change and the subsequent water stores in high mountains is becoming increasingly necessary, and in order to do this, models need reliable and consistent glacier data. These often come from global inventories, usually constructed from multi-temporal satellite imagery. However, there are limitations to these datasets. While clean ice can be mapped relatively easily using spectral band ratios, mapping debris-covered ice is more difficult due to the spectral similarity of supraglacial debris to the surrounding terrain. Therefore, analysts often employ manual delineation, a time-consuming and subjective approach to map debris-covered ice extents. Given the increasing prevalence of supraglacial debris in high mountain regions, such as High Mountain Asia, a systematic, objective approach is needed. The current study presents an approach for mapping debris-covered glaciers that integrates a convolutional neural network and object-based image analysis into one seamless classification workflow, applied to freely available and globally applicable Sentinel-2 multispectral, Landsat-8 thermal, Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence, and geomorphometric datasets. The approach is applied to three different domains in the Central Himalayan and the Karakoram ranges of High Mountain Asia that exhibit varying climatic regimes, topographies and debris-covered glacier characteristics. We evaluate the performance of the approach by comparison with a manually delineated glacier inventory, achieving F-score classification accuracies of 89.2%-93.7%. We also tested the performance of this approach on declassified panchromatic 1970 Corona KH-4B satellite imagery in the Manaslu region of Nepal, yielding accuracies of up to 88.4%. We find our approach to be robust, transferable to other regions, and accurate over regional (>4,000 km(2)) scales. Integrating object-based image analysis with deep-learning within a single workflow overcomes shortcomings associated with convolutional neural network classifications and permits a more flexible and robust approach for mapping debris-covered glaciers. The novel automated processing of panchromatic historical imagery, such as Corona KH-4B, opens the possibility of exploiting a wealth of multi-temporal data to understand past glacier changes.

TI  - "What is the problem with vaccines?" A typology of religious vaccine skepticism
T2  - VACCINE: X
M3  - Article
AB  - Research has identified religion as one of numerous factors that may contribute to delay or refusal of vaccination. The influence of religion on vaccine decisions may be accidental, or it may involve explicit religious objections. By presenting a typology of religious vaccine skepticism, this article seeks to give a comprehensive overview of the essence of these objections and to clarify differences and similarities between them. This knowledge is useful for policy-makers and others who wish to better understand the influence of religion on vaccine decision-making. The typology consists of five main types: (1) a worldview clash type, in which vaccines do not make sense as a health intervention; (2) a divine will type, which represents a form of passive fatalism; (3) an immorality type, which considers some vaccines unethical because of their production or effect; (4) an impurity type, pointing to ingredients that will defile the body; and (5) a conspiracy type, in which a vaccine plot is targeting a religious group.

TI  - Identification of wetland conservation and restoration priorities in regions of oil extraction in the Yellow River Delta using circuit theory modelling
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil exploration fragments coastal wetland habitats, which often leads to biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Assessing the negative effects of oil infrastructures at the landscape scale is critical for practical coastal wetland management and the planning of protected areas (PAs). However, information gaps involving wetland connectivity and oil exploration exist in current conservation, which limit the efficiency of PAs. Here, we used a GIS-based circuit theory model (Circuitscape) and high-resolution remote sensing data to simulate the movement patterns of random species and to elucidate the effects of oil wells on their connective elements in four types of wetlands (mudflat, saline marsh, shrub wetland and forest wetland) in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China. The effectiveness of the Yellow River Delta Nature Reserve (YRDNR) in protecting wetland connectivity was evaluated. A planning framework to optimize wetland conservation and restoration by Linkage Mapper was then provided to improve the landscape connectivity of oil well-disturbed wetlands in this region. The results showed that oil wells significantly decreased wetland connectivity and altered their connective elements in the four wetlands of the YRD. Both the resistance of wetland species movement and the heterogeneity of species dispersal have increased. The length of potential corridors and areas possessing barriers to movement have increased by 126 km (20%) and 51 km2 (120%), respectively. Areas with pinch points that promote species movements, however, decreased by 1178 km2 (60%). The YRDNR protected less than 50% of the key corridors and ecological nodes, considering the impacts of oil wells. Mudflat is seriously affected by oil wells in the YRDNR. Consequently, new alternative corridors produced by oil wells and pinch areas at high risk of impacts by oil wells have the highest protection priorities, whereas those permeable barrier areas, such as croplands and paddy fields, have the highest restoration priorities. The results also illustrated the importance of rivers and water bodies as potential shelters for wetland species. Our research suggests that circuit theory model is an effective planning tool to quantify the negative impacts of oil activities and to identify the protection or restoration priorities of ecological hot spots which are unable to be detected by traditional PAs method. This work provides guides for improving landscape connectivity and specifying target habitats for coastal conservation management.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Supported Video Analysis as a Means to Assess the Impact of DROP-IN Image Guidance on Robotic Surgeons: Radioguided Sentinel Lymph Node versus PSMA-Targeted Prostate Cancer Surgery
T2  - ADVANCED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The introduction of the tethered DROP-IN gamma probe has enabled targeted robot-assisted radioguided prostate cancer (PCa) resection of pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive lesions. While both procedures use Tc-99m-isotopes, the two vary in signal and background intensity. To understand how the different levels of image guidance impact surgical decision-making, computer-vision algorithms are used to extract the DROP-IN probe kinematic form clinical videos. 44 PCa patients undergo SLN (25) and PSMA-targeted (19) resections. PSMA-PET/CT and SPECT/CT create preoperative roadmaps, and intraoperative probe signal intensities are recorded. Using neural network-based software, probe trajectories are extracted from videos to extract multiparametric kinematics and generate decision-making and dexterity scores. PSMA-targeted resections yield significantly lower nodal signal intensities in preoperative SPECT-CT scans (three-fold; p = 0.01), intraoperative probe readouts (eight-fold; p < 0.001), and signal-to-background ratios (SBR; two-fold; p < 0.001). Kinematics assessment reveal that the challenges encounter during PSMA-targeted procedures converted to longer target identification times and increase in probe pick-ups (both five-fold; p < 0.001). This results in a fourfold reduction in the decision-making score (p < 0.001). Reduced signal intensities and intraoperative SBR values negatively affect the impact that image-guided surgery strategies have on the surgical decision-making process.

TI  - A non-linear theoretical dry/wet boundary-based two-source trapezoid model for estimation of land surface evapotranspiration
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that the dry/wet boundaries of land surface temperature fractional vegetation coverage (LSTfc) trapezoid framework vary linearly with vegetation coverage (f(c)). In this study, the theoretical end-members algorithm is modified to continuously estimate the dry/wet end-members under varying vegetation conditions, causing the theoretical dry/wet boundaries to become non-linear. The findings revealed that the non-linear dry/wet boundaries were generally below the conventional linear dry/wet boundaries. Furthermore, the non-linear boundary scheme adopted herein provided better performance in estimating the latent heat flux (LE) and vegetation latent heat flux fraction (LEv/LE) compared to the linear boundary scheme. The parametric schemes of aerodynamic and thermodynamic roughness length and the aerodynamic resistance were the major drivers that result in dry/wet boundaries characteristics being highly non-linear. This study enhanced the physical process description in the LST-f(c) trapezoid framework and improved the prediction accuracy of regional LE and its components.

TI  - <i>Debaryomyces hansenii</i> supplementation in low fish meal diets promotes growth, modulates microbiota and enhances intestinal condition in juvenile marine fish
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe development of a sustainable business model with social acceptance, makes necessary to develop new strategies to guarantee the growth, health, and well-being of farmed animals. Debaryomyces hansenii is a yeast species that can be used as a probiotic in aquaculture due to its capacity to i) promote cell proliferation and differentiation, ii) have immunostimulatory effects, iii) modulate gut microbiota, and/or iv) enhance the digestive function. To provide inside into the effects of D. hansenii on juveniles of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) condition, we integrated the evaluation of the main key performance indicators coupled with the integrative analysis of the intestine condition, through histological and microbiota state, and its transcriptomic profiling.ResultsAfter 70 days of a nutritional trial in which a diet with low levels of fishmeal (7%) was supplemented with 1.1% of D. hansenii (17.2 x 10(5) CFU), an increase of ca. 12% in somatic growth was observed together with an improvement in feed conversion in fish fed a yeast-supplemented diet. In terms of intestinal condition, this probiotic modulated gut microbiota without affecting the intestine cell organization, whereas an increase in the staining intensity of mucins rich in carboxylated and weakly sulphated glycoconjugates coupled with changes in the affinity for certain lectins were noted in goblet cells. Changes in microbiota were characterized by the reduction in abundance of several groups of Proteobacteria, especially those characterized as opportunistic groups. The microarrays-based transcriptomic analysis found 232 differential expressed genes in the anterior-mid intestine of S. aurata, that were mostly related to metabolic, antioxidant, immune, and symbiotic processes.ConclusionsDietary administration of D. hansenii enhanced somatic growth and improved feed efficiency parameters, results that were coupled to an improvement of intestinal condition as histochemical and transcriptomic tools indicated. This probiotic yeast stimulated host-microbiota interactions without altering the intestinal cell organization nor generating dysbiosis, which demonstrated its safety as a feed additive. At the transcriptomic level, D. hansenii promoted metabolic pathways, mainly protein-related, sphingolipid, and thymidylate pathways, in addition to enhance antioxidant-related intestinal mechanisms, and to regulate sentinel immune processes, potentiating the defensive capacity meanwhile maintaining the homeostatic status of the intestine.

TI  - Integrating active fire behavior observations and multitemporal airborne laser scanning data to quantify fire impacts on tree growth: A pilot study in mature Pinus ponderosa stands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods that integrate pre-, active-, and post-fire measurements to quantify fire effects across multiple spatial scales are needed to improve our understanding of ecological effects following fire and for informing natural resource management decisions that rely on post-fire growth and yield estimates. Given growth and yield modeling systems require tree level measurements to parameterize diameter and height distributions, effective datasets require both tree and stand level characterization. However, most stand-to-landscape scale fire effects studies use optical multispectral data (e.g., 30 m spatial resolution Landsat data) which are too coarse to quantify tree-level effects and is limited in its ability to quantify changes in forest structure. Most studies also fail to integrate active fire behavior observations, such as heat flux, limiting their ability to identify mechanisms of tree injury and mortality and/or predict fire effects. Combining active fire observations and structural measurements derived from multitemporal airborne laser scanning (ALS) data has been proposed to quantify fire effects on tree structure and growth but has yet to be tested. In this pilot study, we used a combination of fire behavior and heat flux metrics, including Fire Radiative Power per unit area (FRP: W m-2) and Fire Radiative Energy per unit area (FRE: J m-2), along with multitemporal field and ALS measurements to quantify fire intensity impacts on mature tree height growth. Prescribed fires were conducted in 2014 in thinned and unthinned mature Pinus ponderosa stands and plot-scale fire behavior and heat flux metrics were quantified using standard videography methods and tower-mounted infrared radiometers. Tree height growth was quantified using multitemporal field and ALS data and included pre-fire measurements and post-fire measurements up to eight years post-fire. Results show that trees exposed to the surface fire treatments had height growth that was less than unburned trees. The results also show that height growth 5-8 years post-fire is reduced in trees exposed to greater fire intensities, in terms of maximum FRP per unit area and rate of spread. There was no significant relationship between height growth and other fire behavior metrics (FRE per unit area, average flame length, flame residence time), although height growth decreased with greater FRE per unit area and increased with greater flame residence time. These findings, taken together with similar sapling-, mature tree- and landscape-scale studies, suggest that an integrated activefire behavior and ALS-data approach may provide a quantitative, scalable method for assessing fire effects on tree structure and growth.

TI  - Impact of lockdowns and possible quantification of pollution sources on the water quality of the Yamuna River
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 lockdown halted industrial and transportation networks, resulting in a change in the level of pollution. In this study, the analysis of pre- and post-lockdown water quality of the Yamuna River is done, and primary causes are identified, by considering five in situ parameters and four Landsat-8-derived parameters. During the 2020 lockdown, pollution-indicating in situ parameters decreased, with chemical oxygen demand decreasing the most, possibly due to reduced industrial impact. All satellite-derived indices improved during lockdown and post-lockdown periods of 2020. Even in segments with uniform flow, floating algal index and normalized difference vegetation index exhibited lower levels. In contrast, the examination of the 2021 lockdown revealed no noteworthy insights. Mapping the observations with the drainage network and location of common effluent treatment plants revealed that industrial effluents were the dominant cause of water quality fluctuations. This demonstrates the impact of industrial effluents on the degrading water quality of Yamuna.

TI  - The goby fish <i>Sicydium</i> spp. as valuable sentinel species towards the chemical stress in freshwater bodies of West Indies
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Implementation of the European Water Framework Directive in tropical areas such as the French West Indies (FWI) requires to select relevant aquatic sentinel species for investigating the ecological status of surface waters. The present work aimed to study the biological response of the widespread fish Sicydium spp. towards river chemical quality in Guadeloupe island through a set of proper biomarkers. During a 2-year survey, the hepatic EROD activity, the micronucleus formation and the level of primary DNA strand breaks in erythrocytes were measured respectively as an enzymatic biomarker of exposure and genotoxicity endpoints in fish living upstream and downstream of two chemically-contrasted rivers. Hepatic EROD activity was shown to be variable along the time but always significantly higher in fish from the most contaminated river (Rivie`re aux Herbes) compared to the low contaminated one (Grande Rivie`re de Vieux-Habitants). Fish size did not influence EROD activity. Female fish exhibited a lower EROD activity compared to males depending on the catching period. We observed significant temporal variation in micronucleus frequency and primary DNA damage level measured in fish erythrocytes that did not depend on the fish size. Micronucleus frequency and to a lesser extent DNA damage were significantly higher in fish from the Rivie`re aux Herbes compared to the Grande Rivie`re de Vieux-Habitants. Our results argue for the interest of using Sicydium spp. as sentinel species to assess river quality and chemical pressures in FWI.

TI  - The effects of forest composition and management on evapotranspiration in the New Jersey Pinelands
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests deliver contrasting ecosystem services in relation to water, both provisioning it through filtration and recharge, and consuming it through evapotranspiration. Understanding forest evapotranspiration is critical for landscapes managed in part for the social benefits of their water provisioning ecosystem services. We used the flux disaggregation algorithm for the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse model (DisALEXI) with remotely sensed data to characterize landscape-scale evapotranspiration at 30-m spatial resolution over the forested coastal plain Pinelands of southern New Jersey, USA. We examined changes in evapotranspiration due to forest compositional and cover differences, then evaluated the effects of three common management actions (thinning, seed tree regeneration, and prescribed burning) on stand evapotranspiration. Among various forest compositions, upland oak forests had the lowest annual evapotranspiration, while Atlantic white cedar had the highest. In uplands, increasing proportions of conifers increased evapotranspiration, as did increased canopy cover in conifer stands. Seed tree harvests reduced evapotranspiration for about 13 years, while thinning reduced forest water use for approximately six years. Prescribed fires had variable effects, but their typical application did not reduce evapotranspiration for a complete growing season. Our research can help to inform models and decisionmaking around forests and landscape water yield.

TI  - Thermal modelling of a small satellite data processing unit aided by sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensitivity analysis (SA) and uncertainty quantification (UQ) were used to verify the thermal design of the Intuition-1 nanosatellite data processing unit (DPU). For that purpose, a numerical model of the satellite was developed and validated against experimental data, which were obtained in thermal-vacuum chamber experiments. First, a simplified approach was applied to identify and eliminate less important parameters from further analysis. In the second step, a second-order probability approach was utilized to take into account the epistemic and aleatory uncertainties in the UQ study. The results identified crucial design parameters and the separate influence of aleatory and epistemic input uncertainty on the output variables. The results showed that the design of the nanosatellite DPU does not require modification and that minimizing the uncertainty of the input could considerably reduce the output uncertainty. The presented methodology can be applied to other systems to identify the importance of individual design parameters and predict the uncertainty of key responses under mixed aleatory and epistemic uncertainty. This process is crucial for the robustness of thermal design and provides valuable information supporting project decisions.

TI  - Relationship between coral bleaching and large-scale oscillations in the Lakshadweep archipelago
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The coral reef ecosystems in the Lakshadweep Sea are among the least studied due to the dearth of in situ measurements. The objectives of this study were to compare the remote sensing datasets with the available in situ measurements and confirm the reliability of the former for further studies in this region. The study also examines how the sea surface temperature and salinity triggered coral bleaching during El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO)/Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) events. We found that satellite observations of sea surface temperature (r = 0.94) and salinity (r = 0.81) correlated well with in situ measurements. Such a high degree of correlation enabled us to analyse satellite data for inter-annual variations like ENSO and IOD. In the study area, coral bleaching due to salinity variation was found to be negligible. The study delineates a coral bleaching threshold temperature and the prevalence of such warm waters in the coral environment. Analysis revealed a mass coral bleaching peak during the El Nino event in 2016, with a maximum prevalence of 78 days. Similarly, significant coral bleaching events were observed in 2010 (El Nino; 63 days) and 2019 (PIOD; 56 days). Maximum temperature was noticed during the spring inter-monsoon (March to May). But from 2015, intense warming in the coral region was also noticed in the fall inter-monsoon (October). Combined with global warming, the threat of thermal stress to corals may continue in the long term, which will negatively impact the health of reef ecosystems.

TI  - Divine Character: Iqbal's Conception of Divine Action and Armstrong's Laws of Nature
T2  - THEOLOGY AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper will look at David Malet Armstrong's conception of the Laws of Nature in light of Iqbal's conception of nature and divine action. For the sake of pragmatic austerity Armstrong rooted his theory in naturalism, physicalism, and an understanding of the world as a "state of affairs." In contrast to Humean empiricists, nominalists, and transcendent realists, Armstrong affirmed the reality of both universals and particulars, which relate to each other in what Mumford calls a form of immanent and a posterior realism. It is out of this formulation that he developed his Laws of Nature as relations between universals. Due to the theoretical problems that typically arise from interactionist views (such as some forms of theism), Armstrong operates from a viewpoint that would question the conceivability of anything acting upon nature from beyond the spatio-temporal realm. However, the conception of God offered by Iqbal, the Ultimate Reality existing as "pure-duration"-holding together "the multiplicity of objects and events," offers a view of nature not as "a mass of pure materiality occupying a void," but as a "structure of events, a systematic mode of behavior" that is "organic" to the Ultimate Self. Nature is an expression of God's character, His habit. And, "nature", or "laws of nature," is our interpretation of the "creative activity" of the Creator. This essay will thus elaborate on the details of Iqbal's conception of God and divine action and the benefits it offers to one seeking to operate within the pragmatic benefits of Armstrong's system while maintaining a decidedly theistic worldview.

TI  - Loess landslides detection via a partially supervised learning and improved Mask-RCNN with multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Loess landslides pose a severe threat of destruction, and detecting them is crucial for minimizing their impact on society. They typically consist of wind-deposited clay and silt, which makes them challenging to detect using conventional methods. Techniques like visual interpretation and field surveys are the most useful, yet these methods can be laborious, expensive, and require a certain level of prior knowledge. Furthermore, remote sensing approaches face the challenge of distinguishing between natural erosion and landslides. Recently, deep learning for landslide detection has the potential to speed up and improve detection accuracy. Nonetheless, deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data and the development of robust algorithms capable of extracting meaningful features from remote sensing data. In this article, a novel approach is introduced to improve the Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network (Mask-RCNN) algorithm for accurately detecting landslides when the number of available segmentation mask samples is limited. Specifically, A novel loess landslides dataset is established using high-resolution remote sensing images in Gansu Province. In the context of partially supervised learning, a neural network branch containing a weight transfer function is developed to capture mask information from bounding boxes. Additionally, a mask-scoring network block is used to learn the quality of predicted instance masks. Our modified algorithm achieves an average precision improvement of 20.7% compared to the original Mask R-CNN algorithm in small landslide detection. The mask IoU threshold value of 0.5 is used to estimate the average accuracy higher than 0.75. The average precision of the segmentation mask is improved by 16.7% in test set. By proposing a solution that can achieve accurate landslide detection while using limited labeled samples, this study makes a valuable contribution to the application of deep learning in the domains of remote sensing and landslide detection.

TI  - Characterization and mapping of photovoltaic solar power plants by Landsat imagery and random forest: A case study in Gansu Province, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Numbers and sizes of photovoltaic solar power plants have grown unprecedentedly over the last few years in China, which aims to achieve a carbon emission peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Thus, timely and accurate monitoring of photovoltaic solar power plants is crucial to the design and management of renewable electricity systems in China. Random forest algorithm has been used to map photovoltaic solar power plants at multiple scales, however, it always causes several salt-and-pepper noises, limiting its application at larger spatial scales. Here we first develop a photovoltaic solar power plant mapping method through integrating time series Landsat imagery, random forest, and morphological characteristics. Then we apply this method in Gansu Province, which has abundant solar and wind energy resources and provide large amounts of potential lands for photovoltaic development, and generate the annual photovoltaic maps from 2015 to 2020. We further analyze the spatial-temporal dynamics of sizes and areas of photovoltaic solar power plants and major land cover conversion of expansive photovoltaic regions. Finally, we discuss the reliability, uncertainties, implications, and future development of our improved methods. We find our photovoltaic mapping method can remove most of salt-and-pepper noises effectively, and the resultant maps in Gansu for 2020 have very high accuracies with user's and producer's accuracies of 97.57% and 99.22%, respectively. There are 165.29 km2 photovoltaic solar power plants in Gansu for 2020, and most of which are located in the northwestern Gansu. In addition, the photovoltaic with patch size > 1 km2 and & LE; 2 km2 (53.4 km2, 32.3%) has largest patch number (39, 15.7%). The improved photovoltaic mapping methods and further analysis in this study provide critical information for accurate and automatic classification of photovoltaic solar power plants in the future, as well as the environmental and sustainable development of solar energy in China.

TI  - In-orbit background simulation of a type-B CATCH satellite
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL ASTRONOMY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Chasing All Transients Constellation Hunters (CATCH) space mission plans to launch three types of micro-satellites (A, B, and C). The type-B CATCH satellites are dedicated to locating transients and detecting their time-dependent energy spectra. A type-B satellite is equipped with lightweight Wolter-I X-ray optics and an array of position-sensitive multi-pixel Silicon Drift Detectors. To optimize the scientific payloads for operating properly in orbit and performing the observations with high sensitivities, this work performs an in-orbit background simulation of a type-B CATCH satellite using the Geant4 toolkit. It shows that the persistent background is dominated by the cosmic X-ray diffuse background and the cosmic-ray protons. The dynamic background is also estimated considering trapped charged particles in the radiation belts and low-energy charged particles near the geomagnetic equator, which is dominated by the incident electrons outside the aperture. The simulated persistent background within the focal spot is used to estimate the observation sensitivity, i.e. 4.22x10(-13) erg cm(-2) s(-1) with an exposure of 104 s and a Crab-like source spectrum, which can be utilized further to optimize the shielding design. The simulated in-orbit background also suggests that the magnetic diverter just underneath the optics may be unnecessary in this kind of micro-satellites, because the dynamic background induced by charged particles outside the aperture is around 3 orders of magnitude larger than that inside the aperture.

TI  - Air temperature estimation over winter wheat fields by integrating machine learning and remote sensing techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature (Ta) is significant to numerous Earth's surface and agricultural processes. For agricultural fields (e.g., winter wheat), Ta plays an important role in crop growth monitoring, crop yield estimation, and agricultural risk assessment. In this study, a revised Ta estimation model is proposed by integrating the temperaturevegetation index (TVX) method with multiple regression models. Daily Ta from 2013 to 2021 over winter wheat fields in Henan province (the Top 1 winter wheat-producing province in China) was estimated. The revised models utilized the TVX method over regions and periods featuring extensive vegetation coverage, especially during winter wheat growing seasons, then employed three regression models including multivariate linear regression (MLR) model, random forest (RF) machine learning regression model, and deep belief network (DBN) deep learning regression model. The satellite remote sensing observations, meteorological in-situ Ta measurements, and model assimilations were integrated into the revised models to retrieve Ta. Results obtained through methods proposed in this study were calibrated and validated by in-situ Ta measurements from weather networks. The statistical results reveal that the revised methods can produce Ta estimation over winter wheatplanting areas with higher accuracy compared with traditional regression methods, with R2, MAE, and RMSE ranges from 0.915 to 0.971, 1.204 to 2.097 degrees C, and 1.623 to 2.911 degrees C, respectively. Integrating the TVX with RF has the best performance with the highest R2 (0.971), lowest MAE (1.204 degrees C), and lowest RMSE (1.623 degrees C) over the winter wheat planting area.

TI  - Reducing spatial resolution increased net primary productivity prediction of terrestrial ecosystems: A Random Forest approach
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary production (NPP) is a pivotal component of the terrestrial carbon dynamic, as it directly contributes to the sequestration of atmospheric carbon by vegetation. However, significant variations and uncertainties persist in both the total amount and spatiotemporal patterns of terrestrial NPP, primarily stemming from discrepancies among datasets, modeling approaches, and spatial resolutions. In order to assess the influence of different spatial resolutions on global NPP, we employed a random forest (RF) model using a global observational dataset to predict NPP at 0.05 & DEG;, 0.25 & DEG;, and 0.5 & DEG; resolutions. Our results showed that (1) the RF model performed satisfactorily with modeling efficien-cies of 0.53-0.55 for the three respective resolutions; (2) NPP exhibited similar spatial patterns and interannual vari-ation trends at different resolutions; (3) intriguingly, total global NPP varied greatly across different spatial resolutions, amounting 57.3 & PLUSMN; 3.07 for 0.05 & DEG;, 61.46 & PLUSMN; 3.27 for 0.25 & DEG;, and 66.5 & PLUSMN; 3.42 Pg C yr-1 for 0.5 & DEG;. Such differences maybe associated with the resolution transformation of the input variables when resampling from finer to coarser resolution, which significantly increased the spatial and temporal variation characteristics, particularly in regions within the southern hemisphere such as Africa, South America, and Australia. Therefore, our study introduces a new concept em-phasizing the importance of selecting an appropriate spatial resolution when modeling carbon fluxes, with potential applications in establishing benchmarks for global biogeochemical models.

TI  - Habitat and vertical stratification affect capture of stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) and biological control of the invasive brown marmorated stink bug
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal distribution of stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) and their natural enemies across farmscapes has been studied in more detail recently. However, the impact of plant height on vertical stratification of stink bugs and their natural enemies is rarely addressed across these diverse habitats. In this study, we examined capture of native stink bugs, the invasive brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal)(Hemiptera:Pentatomidae), and a predaceous wasp, Astata occidentalis Cresson (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae) in pheromone-baited traps, in 2 habitats, woodlands of mostly deciduous trees mixed with some conifers and pecan orchards, in addition to their vertical stratification (0-13.7 m) at increasing heights. Furthermore, the effects of canopy height and habitat on H. halys egg mass predation and parasitism were evaluated. Adult H. halys were abundant in both habitats, but more nymphs were captured in pecan orchards. The same pattern was found for adult Euschistus servus (Say) (Hemiptera:Pentatomidae), Thyanta custator McAtee (Hemiptera:Pentatomidae), and A. occidentalis. In contrast, adult E. tristigmus (Say) (Hemiptera:Pentatomidae) and Chinavia hilaris (Say) (Hemiptera:Pentatomidae) were more abundant in woodlands. More nymphal H. halys and adults of E. servus, T. custator, and A. occidentalis were captured in ground traps than canopy traps in pecan. More adult and nymphal H. halys were captured at varying heights in the woodland canopy compared to near the ground as were adult E. tristigmus and C. hilaris. Both parasitism and predation occurred in woodland and pecan canopies. However, in one test we found that parasitism of H. halys egg masses occurred more often in the upper tree canopy, and more parasitism was detected in woodland than orchard habitat. In 2 tests, predation was higher in woodlands than pecan orchards. These results will aid in optimizing conservation biological control tactics in these habitats.

TI  - <i>PM</i><sub>2.5</sub> concentrations estimation using machine learning methods with combination of MAIAC - MODIS AOD product - a case study in western Iran
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The harmful effects of ambient air pollution on human health have been consistently documented by many epidemiological studies around the world, and it is estimated that at least seven million deaths worldwide each year are caused by the effects of air pollution. Harmful airborne particles are identified by the Particulate Matter (PM) parameter, which is a term that used for solid and liquid particles in varying size, shape, composition and with different sources, suspended in the air. The aim of this study is to build PM2.5 concentrations estimation model with meteorological data such as PBLH, and a combination of two AOD's data retrieved from MODIS satellite (MAIAC - MODIS AOD product) using machine learning methods. The study area is in the Western part of Iran, where dust storms as one of the most important sources of air pollutants increasing sharply in recent decades, and this increase has caused numerous health and environmental problems. The data period is four years from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2021, and three machine learning methods, LightGBM, MLP, and Random Forest algorithms were used. For the three typical machine learning methods, the RF model presents the best result by obtaining the lowest RMSE (30.1 mu g/m(3)) and MAE (25.0 mu g/m(3)) values in combination with the highest R-2 (0.64) value for daily predictions.

TI  - Identification of pegmatites zones in Muiane and Naipa (Mozambique) from Sentinel-2 images, using band combinations, band ratios, PCA and supervised classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been widely used in Geological Sciences for different applications, such as to identify geological and mineralogical objects and surface alteration changes. This study aimed to analyze the Sentinel-2 potential to detect pegmatite bodies and associated alteration zones in Muiane and Naipa in Mozambique. Different remote sensing techniques were applied to a Sentinel-2 image: RGB combinations, band ratios, principal component analysis (PCA), and supervised image classification algorithms such as the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). MLC was used as a benchmark classifier to evaluate the performance of SVM because MLC is the predominant algorithm employed in remote sensing classification studies. For that, several statistical metrics based on the confusion matrices were computed, namely accuracy, Kappa index, precision, recall, and f-score, among others. This study allows identifying the location of pegmatites by direct identification and segregating between hydrothermally altered zones and non-altered areas through remote sensing data/techniques, supported by field data. The field campaigns allowed for validating the results obtained and verifying the pegmatites identified using Sentinel-2 data that were not previously mapped. Moreover, reflectance spectroscopy studies in the laboratory were conducted on the samples collected in the field campaigns allow to validate the adequacy of the methodology proposed in this study. The results show that the precise identification of pegmatite targets requires a high spatial resolution such as Sentinel-2 images. Thus, with the integration of high spatial and spectral resolution data, a potential level of precision and accuracy can be achieved in the study areas.

TI  - The wildland-urban interface in Poland reflects legacies of historical national borders
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextThe wildland-urban interface (WUI) is an area where houses are located near wildland vegetation. As such, the WUI is a focal area of wildfire risk, human-wildlife conflicts, and other human-nature interactions. Although there is a wide consensus on the impact WUI existence might have, little is known about the WUI spatial determinants over long periods, especially in countries with long settlement history.ObjectivesOur goal here was to map the WUI across Poland, and to quantify the extent to which historical legacies shape current WUI pattern, since Poland is one of the countries, which experienced substantial political changes over time, which had an impact on historical settlement development.MethodsWe analysed a database of nearly 15 million building locations and a 10-m Sentinel-2-based land cover map to produce a country-wide WUI map of Poland. Then we compared the WUI pattern among parts of Poland which belonged to different political entities in 1900s and 1930s and also among different ecoregions. Lastly, we verified the effects of the historical borders or landscape units borders on WUI patterns with a discontinuity analysis.ResultsWe found that a substantial part of Poland is WUI, and over 60% of all buildings are in WUI. However, WUI patterns differ considerably across the country, and WUI hotspots are located around the largest metropolitan areas in central and southern part of Poland and in the Carpathians. Furthermore, WUI patterns reflect pre-1945 national borders indicating long-term legacies of past settlement patterns and urban planning approaches. Diversity among ecoregions was much less pronounced than among past political entities.ConclusionsOur work shows that current WUI pattern is to large extent shaped by former political conditions, which is likely true not only in Poland, but also in many parts of Europe and elsewhere where settlement history goes back centuries.

TI  - Construction of multidimensional features to identify tea plantations using multisource remote sensing data: A case study of Hangzhou city, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - China is the world's largest tea producer and trader. From 1995 to 2020, the plantation area and tea production increased by approximately 200 and 400%, respectively. Therefore, we must accurately identify the distribution of tea plantations to optimize production and promote sustainable development. However, most studies on the identification of tea plantations rely on local hyperspectral data processing, which have limitations related to a small scale, significant time consumption, and difficulty in integrating multisource images and multidimensional features to achieve the accuracy and optimization of the results. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we integrated the spectral, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), terrain, and textural features to extract the seasonal phenological index using specific phenological information on tea plantations. Then, the random forest (RF) algorithm was applied to evaluate the importance of each feature in the initial feature set, followed by screening of the optimal feature combination and verification of the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance. Finally, the optimal feature combination was used as the input variable for the RF classification algorithm to identify the distribution of tea plantations in Hangzhou, China. The following outcomes were achieved: (1) compared to the processing of local hyperspectral data, the identification of tea plantations using the GEE had notable advantages, such as high automation, convenient algorithm adjustment, and rapid iteration of the results. (2) The user and producer accuracies of the classification of tea plantations using SAR and terrain and textural features improved from 89.3 and 85.9% to 95.8 and 91.7%, respectively, compared to only using spectral information. (3) The high-contribution feature combination identified by the importance analysis using the RF algorithm increased the JM distance to a high degree of separability of approximately 2, which is highly effective for the optimization of classification features. (4) In addition to the visible and near-infrared bands commonly used in spectral information, short-wave infrared and vegetation red-edge bands can play important roles in identifying tea plantations. (5) The importance of the same spectral or SAR information varied for different seasonal phenological indicators, indicating that the addition of phenological information was beneficial for the identification of tea plantations.

TI  - Comparison of progression-free survival outcome of sentinel node biopsy without ultrastaging versus lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer: a propensity-matched analysis.
T2  - Journal of gynecologic oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the oncologic outcomes of patients with endometrial cancer who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy without ultrastaging compared with that of those who underwent lymphadenectomy (LND).METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who underwent staging with SLN biopsy or LND during 2006 - 2021 were analyzed using propensity score matching (PSM). SLN metastasis was examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining, without ultrastaging. Progression-free survival (PFS) was compared between the two groups before and after PSM using age, histology, and stage as covariates. Clinical variables such as recurrence patterns and lymphatic complications, were assessed.RESULTS: After excluding 213 patients who underwent validation LND with SLN biopsy, 902 were identified. The demographics of the remaining patients differed according to histology, myometrial invasion depth, and stage. Lymph node metastasis was less frequent in the SLN group than in the LND group (9.4% vs. 3.8%, p=0.004). The recurrence rates within 2 years were lower in the SLN group. The SLN group exhibited significantly superior 2-year and overall PFS than the LND group. Among patients with uterus-confined disease, overall PFS was favorable for SLN biopsy. After matching, differences in PFS were no longer observed, although the lymphocele and lymphedema rates were significantly lower in the SLN group.CONCLUSION: In patients with endometrial cancer, SLN biopsy without ultrastaging did not compromise survival outcomes and was associated with significantly reduced lymphatic complication rates compared with LND. Therefore, SLN biopsy can be recommended for patients with endometrial cancer without definitive preoperative evidence of distant metastasis.

TI  - Analysis of forest tree dieback using UltraCam and UAV imagery
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, increasing tree diebacks and mortality in some forests, particularly in forest parks, created a need amongst forest managers to find effective methods to gather information about the rate of dieback and mortality and their reasons. High-quality air and space-born remote sensing data has established as an alternative to field surveys for certain inventory tasks. This study used high-quality UltraCam-Xp and UAV drone images from 2016 and 2021 to map tree dieback and mortality in Daland Forest Park, Golestan Province, Iran. High-quality ortho mosaics and Digital Surface Models (DSMs) were generated from UltraCam (2016) and UAV (2021) images. The images were then classified through object-based classification by Nearest Neighbor (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bayes algorithms using various input data sets including spectral bands, Canopy Height Model (CHM), vegetation indices, and texture analysis features. Our results indicate that the Bayes algorithm is more precise in mapping tree dieback for the two time steps compared to other algorithms. The best tree dieback map on UltraCam images was obtained using the spectral bands with CHM, texture analysis features, and vegetation indices. This combination resulted in an overall accuracy of 91.20% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.88. It was also found that combining the UAV main bands with CHM and texture features did produce a high-accuracy map with an overall accuracy of 88.46% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.84. Change detection analysis of tree dieback showed that between 2016 and 2021, the number of healthy trees decreased, and the number of gaps and open areas increased in the study area. We conclude that UltraCam and UAV photographs can serve to identify and map tree dieback and dead trees with good accuracies and can hence support forest health monitoring.

TI  - Evaluation of remotely sensed imagery to monitor temporal changes in soil organic carbon at a long-term grazed pasture trial
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal variation of soil organic carbon (SOC) is driven by land use/management practice, ecosystem conditions and climatic variation. Robust quantification of changes in SOC that is cost-effective and provides a statistical assessment of uncertainty is challenging, particularly in the face of large spatial variability and slow soil SOC changes. Remote-sensing indicators of above-ground vegetation provide some indication of the amount of fresh organic material being supplied to the soil. Although, because of the time taken for this organic material to decay and become incorporated into the soil, there will be a lag between the changes in the indicator of vegetation growth and the resulting changes in SOC. In this work, we investigate how a remotely sensed indicator of vegetation cover can be used with a lag period to predict or indicate changes in SOC for grazed pasture sites at a long-term monitoring study, which has been monitoring soil under different land uses for over forty years. We assessed how well this worked for indicating the SOC changes for different depths in the soil profile. Results suggested that a lagged remotely sensed vegetation cover-the average cover of the two preceding years-provides some indication of SOC changes for the 0-10 cm soil depth, but changes for deeper soil depths were not well predicted. Further, we investigated the potential of using soil data from a point-in-time spatial dataset (e.g. data from a baseline sampling round) to calibrate a relationship between the remotely sensed cover and SOC, which can then be applied to predict or indicate the temporal variation of SOC. Results showed this approach gave large prediction errors, likely because the temporal variation (at a fixed point in space) and spatial variation (for a fixed point in time) of SOC that is predictable by cover differences are not interchangeable.

TI  - Seasonal Migration Zone of Skipjack Tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) in the South Java Sea Using Multisensor Satellite Remote Sensing.
T2  - Journal of Marine Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) is the most dominating tuna species caught in the Indian Ocean. However, tuna fishermen in the Indian Ocean still face difficulties determining potential skipjack tuna fishing grounds due to limited geographic information. An attempt to improve information regarding potential skipjack tuna fishing grounds is through modeling the SST, SSC, SSH, and SSS oceanographic parameters with skipjack tuna distribution using GIS. The characteristics of the skipjack tuna habitat can be found through the generalized additive model (GAM) statistical analysis using data of skipjack tuna catch and oceanographic parameters from satellite imagery. The integrated GIS and GAM methods can improve the study of the habitat of skipjack tuna species. Therefore, this research is aimed at analyzing the condition and SST, SSC, SSH, and SSS variations in 2016-2021 in the South Java Sea; at predicting the correlation of SST, SSC, SSH, and SSS towards skipjack tuna catch in 2016-2021 in the South Java Sea using GAM; and at creating a map of skipjack tuna seasonal migration zones. The data included skipjack tuna catches, number of trips, and skipjack tuna fishing coordinates in 2016-2021 from PPS Cilacap and PPP Pondokdadap. The oceanographic parameter data in 2016-2021 was derived from Aqua MODIS level 3 (SST and SSC) and CMEMS (SSH and SSS) satellite imagery. The results showed that the average values of oceanographic parameters at skipjack tuna fishing ground coordinates in the South Java Sea (2016-2021) were SST (26.050-30.816&DEG;C), SSC (0.094-0.564 mg/m3), SSH (0.268-0.639 m), and SSS (33.075-34.514 psu). The best GAM modeling was the combination of four oceanographic parameter variables with an AIC value of 45357.92. Skipjack tuna in the South Java Sea migrates southeast during the west monsoon season to the first transitional season and tends to migrate northwest during the east monsoon season to the second transitional season.

TI  - A Multi-Domain Compression Radiative Transfer Model for the Fengyun-4 Geosynchronous Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS)
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forward radiative transfer (RT) models are essential for atmospheric applications such as remote sensing and weather and climate models, where computational efficiency becomes equally as important as accuracy for high-resolution hyperspectral measurements that need rigorous RT simulations for thousands of channels. This study introduces a fast and accurate RT model for the hyperspectral infrared (HIR) sounder based on principal component analysis (PCA) or machine learning (i.e., neural network, NN). The Geosynchronous Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS), the first HIR sounder onboard the geostationary Fengyun-4 satellites, is considered to be a candidate example for model development and validation. Our method uses either PCA or NN (PCA/NN) twice for the atmospheric transmittance and radiance, respectively, to reduce the number of independent but similar simulations to accelerate RT simulations; thereby, it is referred to as a multi-domain compression model. The first PCA/NN gives monochromatic gas transmittance in both spectral and atmospheric pressure domains for each gas independently. The second PCA/NN is performed in the traditional spectral radiance domain. Meanwhile, a new method is introduced to choose representative variables for the PCA/NN scheme developments. The model is three orders of magnitude faster than the standard line-by-line-based simulations with averaged brightness temperature difference (BTD) less than 0.1 K, and the compressions based on PCA or NN methods result in comparable efficiency and accuracy. Our fast model not only avoids an excessively complicated transmittance scheme by using PCA/NN but is also highly flexible for hyperspectral instruments with similar spectral ranges simply by updating the corresponding spectral response functions.

TI  - Eye in outer space: satellite imageries of container ports can predict world stock returns
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting stock returns is challenging. Traditional economic data that are available to all investors are published with lags and suffer from the problem of frequent revisions. Consequently, they often fail to forecast stock returns. For this reason, investors are increasingly interested in seeking alternative data. This paper forecasts stock returns using satellite-based information on shipping containers, which can capture economic activity in real-time. The container coverage area in each port is identified from 83,672 satellite images via the U-Net method and used as a proxy for the number of containers. Forecast combination over univariate predictive regression is used to generate return forecasts. The results indicate that the number of containers in ports can significantly predict stock index returns in 27 out of 33 countries at a daily frequency for the 2019-2021 period. An investor making use of satellite data on marine ports can, on average, receive an annualized return of 16.38%. The predictability can be explained by the predictive relationship between port container numbers and economic activity. In future studies, satellite data can be applied to monitor and forecast other economic indicators.

TI  - Comprehensive model for sustainable water resource management in Southern Algeria: integrating remote sensing and WEAP model
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Water resource management is a global challenge, particularly in arid regions, where equitable access to clean water must be ensured while addressing scarcity, pollution, and sustainability issues. This paper highlights the challenges of managing water resources, specifically on water issues in southern Algeria and the associated management constraints. The study employs remote sensing techniques using Landsat satellite images from 1990 to 2020 to analyze urban and agricultural land changes. Based on current investigations, it integrates the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model with the satellite data to develop an original model and forecast multiple management scenarios (Improved, standardized, optimal, sustainable) from 2015 to 2050. The analysis includes projections of land change in the study region, global water demand, and overall return flow for different future scenarios. The study's results highlight constraints and issues across all scenarios. They emphasize the necessity of implementing sustainable management policies, including strategies to reduce water loss and establish specific consumption standards. It also highlights the importance of adopting new irrigation techniques and promoting the reuse of purified water for irrigation purposes.

TI  - Performance of indocyanine green in sentinel lymph node mapping and lymph node metastasis in penile cancer: systematic review, meta-analysis, and single-center experience
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - PurposeThe aim of this study was to investigate the overall sensitivity and specificity of indocyanine green (ICG)-near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging in the detection of sentinel lymph node metastasis (SLNM) in penile cancer.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify manuscripts where ICG was intravenously administered prior to or during penile cancer surgery, with no restriction on language or publication status. The results extracted are presented as forest plots.ResultsSeven studies were included in the analysis. The median sensitivity and specificity of ICG-NIR imaging for SLNM detection were 100 and 4%, respectively; the pooled sensitivity was 100.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 97.0-100.0) and specificity was 2.0% (95% CI 1.0-3.0). There was no significant difference in the diagnostic results between different injection sites and doses in each experimental group.ConclusionTo our knowledge, this meta-analysis is the first to summarize the diagnostic performance of ICG-NIR imaging for SLNM detection in penile cancer. ICG is sensitive in the imaging of SLN tissue, which can consequently improve the accuracy of lymph node detection. However, the specificity is very low.

TI  - Satellite evidence for small biophysical effects of transport infrastructure in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Transport expansion is detrimental to natural ecosystems and yet to what extent it can impact nearby alpine ecosystems is not well understood. This case study in Qinghai-Tibet railway and highway explores the bio-physical effects of transport infrastructure in terms of remote sensing-based greenness, wetness, dryness, and heat according to a space-for-time substitution method. We estimate highly diverse changes across road sections in all the indices from both multiyear-mean and long-term perspectives, and no clear biophysical gradients with distance away from the transport lines, except for a gradual decrease in multiyear-mean heat and wetness. In a 500-m buffer zone, those indices on average are 0.1-15.7% lower or higher than the references and the dis-parities increase or decrease significantly from 2000 to 2021 alongside 15-48% of the transport lines. We further find that the estimated biophysical changes depend strongly on the reference conditions and the elevation gradients nearby the roads. Also, the road sections surrounded by some urban/crop lands show much more frequent "significant" trends than the others, confirming strong land use effects on the biophysical dynamics in alpine regions. Nevertheless, it remains open to debate to what extent transportation contribute the land use activities near the roads. We argue that highways and railways unlikely strongly impact the biophysical con-ditions in alpine regions due to small road width, widespread nature reserves, various protective measures, and low accessibility to surroundings if they are fenced. Our results highlight the small biophysical impacts of transport infrastructure on roadside natural ecosystems in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and suggest prioritized attention to the direct damages to soil and vegetation by transport construction and the habitat disruption, biodiversity change, and road kills by transport operation for developing an environment-friendly transport system.

TI  - How do tradeoffs in satellite spatial and temporal resolution impact snowwater equivalent reconstruction?
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the tradeoffs between spatial and temporal resolution, questions about resolution optimality are fundamental to the study of global snow. Answers to these questions will inform future scientific priorities and mission specifications. Heterogeneity of mountain snowpacks drives a need for daily snow cover mapping at the slope scale (=30 m) that is unmet for a variety of scientific users, ranging from hydrologists to the military to wildlife biologists. But finer spatial resolution usually requires coarser temporal or spectral resolution. Thus, no single sensor can meet all these needs. Recently, constellations of satellites and fusion techniques have made noteworthy progress. The efficacy of two such recent advances is examined: (1) a fused MODIS-Landsat product with daily 30 m spatial resolution and (2) a harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A and B (HLS) product with 3-4 d temporal and 30 m spatial resolution. State-of-the-art spectral unmixing techniques are applied to surface reflectance products from 1 and 2 to create snow cover and albedo maps. Then an energy balance model was run to reconstruct snow water equivalent (SWE). For validation, lidar-based Airborne Snow Observatory SWE estimates were used. Results show that reconstructed SWE forced with 30 m resolution snow cover has lower bias, a measure of basin-wide accuracy, than the baseline case using MODIS (463 m cell size) but greater mean absolute error, a measure of per-pixel accuracy. However, the differences in errors may be within uncertainties from scaling artifacts, e.g., basin boundary delineation. Other explanations are (1) the importance of daily acquisitions and (2) the limitations of downscaled forcings for reconstruction. Conclusions are as follows: (1) spectrally unmixed snow cover and snow albedo from MODIS continue to provide accurate forcings for snow models and (2) finer spatial and temporal resolution through sensor design, fusion techniques, and satellite constellations are the future for Earth observations, but existing moderate-resolution sensors still offer value.

AB  - During the development of the infrastructure of towns, there are constant changes in the way land is used. This paper, selecting a town in Hebei province as an example, obtained its remote sensing data, analysed the characteristics of land-use changes and the impact on ecological protection in the area between 2013 and 2020, and calculated its degree of diversity, dynamic degree and ecological index. The results showed that from 2013 to 2020, the area of the cultivated land in the town decreased by 423.33 km(2), the area of the forest land decreased by 25.15 km(2), but the area of the construction land increased by 454.743 km(2). The degree of diversity was relatively stable, the overall dynamic degree was 0.24% and the fragmentation and separation degrees decreased. The cultivated and construction lands changed the most. This study can provide a reference for the subsequent land-use planning of this town.

TI  - Forecasting landslides using community detection on geophysical satellite data
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW E
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of extreme weather conditions, such as heavy precipitation, natural hillslopes can fail dramatically; these slope failures can occur on a dry day, due to time lags between rainfall and pore-water pressure change at depth, or even after days to years of slow motion. While the prefailure deformation is sometimes apparent in retrospect, it remains challenging to predict the sudden transition from gradual deformation (creep) to runaway failure. We use a network science method-multilayer modularity optimization-to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of deformation in a region near the 2017 Mud Creek, California landslide. We transform satellite radar data from the study site into a spatially embedded network in which the nodes are patches of ground and the edges connect the nearest neighbors, with a series of layers representing consecutive transits of the satellite. Each edge is weighted by the product of the local slope (susceptibility to failure) measured from a digital elevation model and ground surface deformation (current rheological state) from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). We use multilayer modularity optimization to identify strongly connected clusters of nodes (communities) and are able to identify both the location of Mud Creek and nearby creeping landslides which have not yet failed. We develop a metric, i.e., community persistence, to quantify patterns of ground deformation leading up to failure, and find that this metric increased from a baseline value in the weeks leading up to Mud Creek's failure. These methods hold promise as a technique for highlighting regions at risk of catastrophic failure.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo identify predictors of quality of life (QoL) among patients who undergo surgical staging with sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy or lymphadenectomy for endometrial cancer. MethodsPatients who underwent minimally invasive surgery for primary endometrial cancer at the Mayo Clinic from October 2013 to June 2016 were mailed a 30-item QoL in Cancer survey (QLQ-C30) and a validated 13-item lower extremity lymphedema screening questionnaire. Patients who answered ResultsThe 221 patients included in the analysis were stratified into two groups: patients who underwent (1) bilateral lymphadenectomy as 'backup' after SLN mapping (lymphadenectomy group; n=101) or (2) SLN removal with or without side-specific lymphadenectomy (SLN group; n=120). On multivariable analysis, obesity, lower extremity lymphedema, and kidney disease had significant (p<0.05) and clinically meaningful negative impacts on global QoL. Declines in average adjusted global QoL scores were marked (19.7 points lower) in patients with BMI & GE;40 kg/m(2) and lower extremity lymphedema compared with non-obese patients without lower extremity lymphedema. In contrast, there was only a 2.9 point difference in the adjusted average global QoL score between the SLN and lymphadenectomy groups. ConclusionsLower extremity lymphedema coupled with obesity predicts poorer QoL in patients who undergo surgical staging for endometrial cancer. In this population, reduction of lower extremity lymphedema by performing SLN instead of lymphadenectomy and earlier targeted interventions may improve patients' QoL. Future research focusing on targeted interventions is needed.

TI  - Theoretical and clinical implications of trauma
T2  - Biologie Aujourd hui
M3  - Article
AB  - Usually, trauma is defined as exposure to an event that threatens death or induces serious injury or sexual violence. Beyond post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), trauma may increase the risk for severe mental disorders including mood disorders and psychotic disorder. PTSD, following exposure to a traumatic event, is strongly linked to dissociation. However, in contrast convergent findings indicated that, despite the relationship between peri-traumatic dissociation and later PTSD, many people who develop PTSD do not display dissociative responses in the acute phase after the event. Several risk factors are described for PTSD including previous history of traumatic event, previous mental disorders, genetic factors and gender. It is now proposed to distinguish PTSD with or without dissociative symptoms with some specific neural signature for each syndrome. Dissociation may also lead to change in cultural belief and worldview. According to the terror management theory (TMT), it is suggested that cultural worldviews, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships work together to protect individuals from death anxiety. The trauma, by disrupting this anxiety buffering system, contributes to change beliefs in victims and exposes them to a feeling of social exclusion.

Last decades have witnessed tremendous efforts and resources being invested to find sustainable solutions for urban heat mitigation, whereas the relative contributions of different UHI attributes and their patterns of spatiotemporal variability remain obscure. In this study, we employed the random forest (RF) method to quantify the relative importance of four categories of urban surface characteristics that regulate the surface UHI, namely the urban greenery fraction, land surface albedo, urban morphology, and level of human activities. We selected seventeen major cities from six megaregions in China as our study areas, with the RF training and test sets obtained from multi-sourced remote sensing and observational data products. It is found that the urban greenery coverage manifests as the most important environmental determinants of UHI, followed by surface albedo. The results are informative for urban planners, policymakers, and engineering practitioners to design and implement sustainable strategies for urban heat mitigation.

TI  - Using Landsat time series and bi-temporal GEDI to compare spectral and structural vegetation responses after fire
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive and active spaceborne remote sensing technologies play a key role in monitoring forests across large areas, particularly when combining the advantages of both sensor technologies. This study investigates the link between spectral and structural change metrics following forest fire disturbance, collected from Landsat satellites and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission, respectively. The relationships were analysed across 1849 GEDI sampling locations (footprints), spread across south-east Australian forests. To assess structural change on the footprint level, simulated pre-fire GEDI observations were compared with real GEDI observations from one year after the fires. Results show relatively strong fire responses across Landsat spectral indices, with a median decline to between 46.1 % (Normalised Burn Ratio 2) and 77 % (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) of pre-fire levels. GEDI's structural change metrics demonstrated a markedly different response, with most showing an even more pronounced decline. In contrast, canopy height demonstrated a less substantial decline, dropping to 82.7 %. Results also suggest that fire severity and forest type impact the fire response of some of the examined spectral and structural metrics. In particular, taller forests and increased fire severity were associated with a more pronounced post-fire decline. The findings of this study highlight the large variation of forest structural responses to fire and their divergence from spectral change metrics, and emphasise the potential of integrating GEDI observations into wall-to-wall spectral forest change monitoring. The concept of bi-temporal GEDI observations as demonstrated in this study is promising, as it captures both pre-and post-disturbance structure on the footprint level and might enhance modelling of forest structural change in future approaches.

TI  - Dynamic characteristics of vegetation communities in the floodplain wetland of Lake Poyang based on spatio-temporal fusion of remote sensing data
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The structure and dynamic characteristics of wetland vegetation communities are important indicators reflecting the health of the wetland ecosystem, which are essential for predicting the direction of development and ecological restoration of the wetland ecosystem. Based on the 30-m and 8 -day resolution NDVI dataset obtained by fusing Landsat and MODIS data, we adopted a phenology-based decision tree approach to map the spatial distribution patterns of different vegetation communities in the floodplain wetland of Lake Poyang from 2000 to 2020, and analysed the spatiotemporal dynamics and transformation processes of different vegetation communities. The results indicated that the spatio-temporal adaptive fusion model for NDVI products ( STAFFN) could provide a powerful database for fine classification of wetland vegetation in Lake Poyang. The study area was classified into eight landscapes using a phenology-based decision tree approach: water, mudflat, floating aquatic macrophyte community, Polygonum hydropiper-Phalaris arundinacea community, Carex community, Phragmites australis-Triarrhena lutarioriparia community, Artemisia selengensis community and forest. The overall classification accuracy was 89.36%. Within the whole lake, the total vegetation cover fluctuated, but showed a significant increasing trend during the observation period. Among the different vegetation communities, the Polygonum hydropiper-Phalaris arundinacea community showed the most significant increase, while the Carex community, which is the most widespread, first increased and then decreased slightly, and the Phragmites australis Tharrhena lutarioriparia community, which is the subdominant species, fluctuated between 300 and 500 km(2). Comparison of the sub -lake regions showed that the trend in the Carex community was relatively clear in the northern and eastern regions. There were spatial differences in the distribution of the subdominant species. The northern and eastern regions were dominated by the Polygonum hydropiper Phalaris arundinacea community, while the southern region was dominated by the Phragmites australis Triarrhena lutarioriparia community. In addition, the landscape evolution trend of Poyang Lake wetland during 2000-2020 showed a transitional characteristic from water mudflat lower flat vegetation ( Carex community and Polygonum hydropiper-Phalaris arundinacea community) to mutual transformation of Carex community and Phragmites australis-Tharrhena lutarioriparia community. The overall situation was that the vegetation ( e.g. Phragmites australis, Triarrhena lutarioriparia, etc.) on the higher level expanded towards the lower level and the Carex, Phalaris arundinacea and Polygonum hydropiper,, etc. on the lower level expanded towards the centre of the lake.

TI  - Analysis of spatiotemporal patterns and determinants of energy-related carbon emissions in the Yellow River basin using remote sensing data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study employs DMSP-OLS and NPP-VIIS nighttime light remote sensing data to develop a carbon emission regression model based on energy consumption, analyzing the spatiotemporal evolution of carbon emissions in 57 cities within the Yellow River Basin from 2012 to 2021. The analysis uses a quantile regression model to identify factors affecting carbon emissions, aiming to enhance the basin's emission mechanism and foster low-carbon development. Key findings include: 1) Carbon emissions from energy consumption increased in this period, with a decreasing growth rate. 2) Emissions were concentrated along the Yellow River and its tributaries, forming high-density carbon emission centers. 3) The Yellow River Basin has mainly formed a "high-high" agglomeration area centered on resource-based cities such as Shanxi and Inner Mongolia's coal, and a "low-low" agglomeration area centered on Gansu and Ningxia. The standard deviation ellipse of carbon emissions in the Yellow River Basin generally extends from east to west, and its center of gravity tends to move northward during the study period. 4) Technological innovation, economic development, and population agglomeration suppressed emissions, with digital economy and foreign investment increasing them in certain cities. Urbanization correlated positively with emissions, but adjusting a single industrial structure showed insignificant impact.

TI  - GStatSim V1.0: a Python package for geostatistical interpolation and conditional simulation
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The interpolation of geospatial phenomena is a common problem in Earth science applications that can be addressed with geostatistics, where spatial correlations are used to constrain interpolations. In certain applications, it can be particularly useful to a perform geostatistical simulation, which is used to generate multiple non-unique realizations that reproduce the variability in measurements and are constrained by observations. Despite the broad utility of this approach, there are few open-access geostatistical simulation software applications. To address this accessibility issue, we present GStatSim, a Python package for performing geostatistical interpolation and simulation. GStatSim is distinct from previous geostatistical tools in that it emphasizes accessibility for non-experts, geostatistical simulation, and applicability to remote sensing data sets. It includes tools for performing non-stationary simulations and interpolations with secondary constraints. This package is accompanied by a Jupyter Book with user tutorials and background information on different interpolation methods. These resources are intended to significantly lower the technological barrier to using geostatistics and encourage the use of geostatistics in a wider range of applications. We demonstrate the different functionalities of this tool for the interpolation of subglacial topography measurements in Greenland.

TI  - Migrating eagles stopping in the Sahara Desert: Aberrant behaviour or foraging strategy?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Sahara Desert is one of the major ecological barriers of the Palearctic-Africa bird migration system. We analysed the behaviour of GPS-tagged booted eagles (Aquila pennata) breeding in Spain and wintering in Tropical Africa, focusing on the Sahara crossing. We searched for anomalous track segments recorded during the desert crossing, finding that non-directional and/or slow movements occur in 35% of the migratory journeys and last up to 31 days (average: 5.9). The analyses show that this behaviour is not triggered by adverse weather conditions, and is shown especially by females during spring. The length of the stopping periods affects the arrival date to the breeding grounds only in males, which means that females buffer the potential delay with an earlier migration start, suggesting that this behaviour is followed deliberately. These wandering movements occur in hyper-arid areas without vegetation cover. A similar behaviour has not been previously recorded in any other trans-Saharan raptor and is probably related to the ability of booted eagles to take advantage of food resources unexploited by other predators, such as migratory songbirds stopping in the desert during the day, and migratory locusts. If confirmed by further research involving higher resolution tracking and field observations, our findings may show a new way of combining foraging and migration, without a well-defined directed trajectory, nor stopping in a restricted spot, but instead wandering over wide areas.

TI  - Assessment of land-use land-cover dynamics and urban heat island effect of Dehradun city, North India: a remote sensing approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Urbanisation is a crucial issue for urban planners and researchers worldwide, especially in South Asia, where rapid urbanisation has led to several negative impacts on the environment, economy, and people. Land-use change is one of the associated problems of urbanisation that can lead to an increased land surface temperature (LST) and surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect. This study aimed to investigate the impact of urbanisation on the local climate in Dehradun city, India, by analysing the relationship between land-use and land-cover (LULC) change, LST, and the UHI effect. Geospatial analyses were carried out using Landsat multispectral data from 1996 to 2019. LULC classification using a machine learning-based supervised classification technique, support vector machine and LST were derived using a mono-window algorithm, and the surface UHI (SUHI) effect was quantified using the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI). The study found that the built-up cover increased by 28%, resulting in seasonal LST increases of 7 & DEG;C and 2 & DEG;C for the summer and winter seasons, respectively. The findings show that the regions with no SUHI effect reduced significantly from 42.59% in 1996 to 21.55% in 2019, while the strongest SUHI regions increased from 0% in 1996 to 10.7% in 2019. This study contributes to delivering scientific information on the impact of urbanisation and land-use change on the urban thermal environment of the city, which may be useful for policymakers in developing appropriate strategies to reduce the impact of urbanisation on the environment and to improve the quality of life for citizens.

TI  - Fury of nature: evaluating the impact of hailstorm on vegetation using sentinel 2 data at Moran, India
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The primary objective of the study is to analyze the impact assessment of hailstorms on vegetation in the Moran region of Assam. The experiments employed sentinel-2A data of December, 2022 and January, 2023 for the computation of the NDVI, GNDVI, and MSAVI indices and their temporal dynamics. Further, LandScan gridded (1 k x 1 km) population data of 2021 have been used to portray the population affected in the study area. The result evidenced a significant decline in the mean NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), GNDVI (Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and MSAVI (Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index) from the pre-hailstorm to the post-hailstorm period. The above indices declined from 0.270, 0279 and 0.416 in pre-hailstorm (24 December, 2022) period to 0.257, 0.269 and 0.410 in post-hailstorm period (3 January, 2023). Similarly, the area under healthy vegetation decreased from 72.06 and 103.55 sq km in 2022 to 60.74 and 96.35 sq km in 2023, based on GNDVI and MSAVI, respectively. The hailstorm affected the majority of villages as well as the population lying to the east of the NH-37, i.e., the Charaideo district of Assam. The Villages such Bagtali Sonowal, Demorukinar Changmai, Hatkhola gaon and Mout gaon experienced maximum damage to vegetation. Overall, 125.355 and 132.07 sq km of area considering both assessments (MSAVI & GNDVI with population) with a total population of about 131,342 are severely affected by hailstorm phenomena.

TI  - Assessing the role played by meteorological conditions on the interannual variability of fire activity in four subregions of Iberia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background. The Iberian Peninsula is recurrently affected by severe wildfires resulting from an interplay of human activities, landscape features and atmospheric conditions. Aims. The role played by atmospheric conditions on wildfire activity in 2001-2020 is assessed in four pyror-egions of the Iberian Peninsula. Methods. Wildfire activity is characterised by Fire Radiative Power (FRP) and meteorological danger is rated by the Fire Weather Index (FWI). The distribution of log(10)FRP in each pyroregion consists of a truncated lognormal central body with Generalised Pareto distributions as tails, and the model is improved using FWI as covariate. Synthetic time series of total annual FRP are generated using the models with and without FWI as covariate, and compared against observed FRP. Key results. Pyroregions NW, N, SW and E present increases of 1, 5, 6 and 7% in interannual explained variance of FRP when progressing from the model without to that with FWI as covariate. Conclusions. The models developed characterise the role of meteorological conditions on fire activity in the Iberian Peninsula, and are especially valuable when comparing expected impacts for different scenarios of climate change. Implications. The largest effects of atmospheric conditions on fire activity are in regions of the IP where the strongest impact of climate change is expected.

TI  - Detecting temporal and spatial malaria patterns from first antenatal care visits
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pregnant women attending first antenatal care (ANC) visits represent a promising malaria surveillance target in Sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the spatio-temporal relationship between malaria trends at ANC (n = 6471) and in children in the community (n = 3933) and at health facilities (n = 15,467) in southern Mozambique (2016-2019). ANC P. falciparum rates detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction mirrored rates in children, regardless of gravidity and HIV status (Pearson correlation coefficient [PCC] > 0.8, & chi;(2)<1.1), with a 2-3 months lag. Only at rapid diagnostic test detection limits at moderate-to-high transmission, did multigravidae show lower rates than children (PCC = 0.61, 95%CI[-0.12-0.94]). Seroprevalence against the pregnancy-specific antigen VAR2CSA reflected declining malaria trends (PCC = 0.74, 95%CI[0.24-0.77]). 60% (9/15) of hotspots detected from health facility data (n = 6662) using a novel hotspot detector, EpiFRIenDs, were also identified with ANC data (n = 3616). Taken together, we show that ANC-based malaria surveillance offers contemporary information on temporal trends and geographic distribution of malaria burden in the community.Pregnant people visiting antenatal clinics may represent a useful sentinel surveillance population for monitoring infections such as malaria. Here, the authors investigate the potential of this approach by comparing malaria prevalence in pregnant people and children living in the same area of southern Mozambique.

TI  - Investigating the Spatiotemporal Distributions of NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> and Their Association with NDVI in Lahore (Pakistan) and Its Adjoining Region of Punjab (India)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing country like Pakistan is severely affected by poor air quality and is globally ranked in third position for mortality cases caused by air pollution. Air Pollution is severely degrading the quality of air and climatic systems and is affecting the health of the people and plants. This study aimed to examine the spatiotemporal distributions of some selected air pollutants (NO2 and SO2) and their association with NDVI in Lahore and its adjoining regions from July 2018 to December 2020. The present study utilized air pollutants (NO2 and SO2) observations obtained from TROPOMI onboard Sentinel-5P, and NDVI retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra satellite. The mean annual high NO2 concentrations of 163.0 x 10(-6) mol m(-2), 160.0 x 10(-6) mol m(-2), and 154.0 x 10(-6) mol m(-2) were found over northwestern, central, and southern boundaries of Lahore, respectively, while the SO2 concentration of 315.4 x 10(-6) mol m(-2) was observed over the northwestern boundary of Lahore. Moreover, the mean annual NDVI ranging from 0.5 to 0.65 was observed in the east, northeast, southeast and outside the boundary of Lahore towards Amritsar. The monthly time series analyses show that the highest values of NO2, SO2 and NDVI are found to be 149 x 10(-6) & PLUSMN; 1.58 x 10(-5) (mole m(-2)), 544 x 10(-6) & PLUSMN; 1.68 x 10(-4) (mole m(-2)), and 0.670 & PLUSMN; 0.12 in January 2019, December 2020 and February 2019, respectively. The highest correlation between NO2 and SO2 with NDVI is found to be 0.95 and 0.87, respectively in the southwest, and southeast directions. These findings will be helpful for concerned departments such as Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC), and the scientific community to formulate policies and take measures to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution on the agricultural sector.

TI  - A framework base on deep neural network (DNN) for land use land cover (LULC) and rice crop classification without using survey data
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Precise and cost-effective mapping of crop and other land cover (LC) types is essential for food security, precision agriculture, and water distribution management. However, accurate identification of the extent of crop and LC types is still a challenge. However, the efficiency of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms were evaluated and assimilated with time-series satellite information and In-situ data for detecting crop and other LC types. Therefore, in the current study, a framework was established on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) using Sentinel-2 time-series satellite datasets to identify rice crop and other LC types without survey data. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) stack was developed through Google Earth Engine (GEE) and adopted as input features. Three widely used ML algorithms, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and classification and regression trees (CART), and four DL models (Swin Transformer (ST), HRNet, two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) were employed to perform the classification of rice crop and four non-crop classes. The overall accuracies were determined to be 93.95%, 91.67%, 89.80%, 86.89%, 81.01%, 76.51%, and 72.9% and the kappa coefficients were 92.35%, 89.49%, 87.13%, 83.52%, 76.12%, 70.56%, and 66.56%, of corresponding methods respectively. The findings showed that DL methods outperformed ML methods, while ST methods yielded the highest accuracy, and input data can be prepared for LULC classification without ground survey. Accurate classification of LC types and timely assessment of rice crop estimation can provide valuable statistics for state officials, decision-makers, and planners.

This intensive observation period, part of the four weeks Urban Climate Under Change (UC)2 campaign, intended to provide a comprehensive data set to understand the complex interactions of thermally induced wind systems, vertical turbulent mixing and air pollutant concentration distribution in the atmospheric boundary layer of the city. Stuttgart has a very special and complex topography with a city center located in a basin surrounded by hills with heights of 250 to 300 m influencing the wind and flow system, reducing the wind speed, causing inhibited dispersion of air pollutants. Cold air flows from the surrounding plains can penetrate into the urban areas and influence the urban climate including the air quality. For investigating these effects with a focus on urban climate, combinations of different measurement platforms and techniques were used, such as in situ stationary and mobile measurements with cars, vertical profiling by means of tethered balloons, radiosondes, a drone, and aircraft observations, remote sensing devices and satellite-based instruments. Numerous atmospheric processes in an urban area regarding boundary layer evolution, inversion, local wind systems, urban heat island, etc. were observed. Some important findings are: Temperature observations provide local information about the warmest areas in the city and about the city and its surroundings. The urban heat island effect was evident from the results of stationary and mobile air temperature measurements as higher air temperature was measured in Stuttgart basin compared to its surroundings. Considerable spatio-temporal differences concerning the wind (speed and direction), turbulence and the convective boundary depth are evident. Lower wind speeds were observed during the nighttime and the main wind direction in the Stuttgart valley was measured to be southwest, which carried cold air from the hillsides into the city and pollutants to the windward side of the city into the Neckar valley. The low wind speed favored the accumulation of pollutants in a shallow nocturnal boundary layer close to the surface. During the day, the overall pollutant concentration was reduced by vertical convective mixing. The vertical profile measurements have shown that the applied techniques provided a good overview to understand the vertical characteristics of meteorological parameters and pollutants as well as the stability of the atmosphere and extent of the urban boundary layer. It also showed that the extent of atmospheric mixing determines the dispersion, dilution and mixing of emitted pollutants.Finally, the additional comprehensive air-chemical observations (surface and satellite based) allow understanding the diurnal cycle of air pollutants in the atmospheric boundary layer of the city of Stuttgart. Satellite-based observations from Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI have shown their potential for mapping urban pollution islands and urban pollution plumes even in cities with a complex terrain like Stuttgart. These observations assisted to obtain a comprehensive data set intended for the validation of a novel urban climate model, PALM-4U.

TI  - Downscaling satellite night-time lights imagery to support within-city applications using a spatially non-stationary model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - For mapping and monitoring socioeconomic activities in cities, night-time lights (NTL) satellite sensor images are used widely, measuring the light intensity during the night. However, the main challenge to mapping human activities in cities using such NTL satellite sensor images is their coarse spatial resolution. To address this drawback, spatial downscaling of satellite nocturnal images is a plausible solution. However, common approaches for spatial downscaling employ spatially stationary models that may not be optimal where the data are spatially heterogeneous. In this research, a geostatistical model termed Random Forest area-to-point regression Kriging (RFATPK) was employed to disaggregate coarse spatial scale VIIRS NTL images (450 m) to a fine spatial scale (100 m). The RF predicts at a coarse resolution from fine spatial resolution variables, such as a Population raster. ATPK then downscales the coarse residuals from the RF prediction. In numerical experiments, RFATPK was compared with three benchmark techniques, including the simple Allocation of pixel values from the coarse resolution NTL data, Machine Learning with Splines and Geographically Weighted Regression. The downscaled results were validated using fine resolution LuoJia 1-01 satellite sensor imagery. RFATPK produced more accurate disaggregated images than the three benchmark approaches, with mean root mean square errors (RMSE) for the year 2018 of 13.89 and 6.74 nWcm- 2 sr-1, for Mumbai and New Delhi, respectively. Also, the property of perfect coherence, measured by the Correlation Coefficient, was preserved consistently when applying RFATPK and was almost 1 for all years. The applicability of the disaggregated NTL data to monitor socioeconomic activities at the within-city scale against the reference NTL was illustrated by utilizing them as a proxy for the Gross National Income (GNI) per capita and the Night Light Development Index. The GNI estimation from the down scaled NTL outperformed the coarse resolution NTL when examining their coefficients of determination, with R2 of 0.67 and 0.47 for the GNI estimation using the fine and coarse resolution NTL data, respectively. For the Night Light Development Index (NLDI), the results of the index were compared by measuring their correlation with the Human Development Index (HDI). The NLDI from the downscaled NTL outperformed the coarse resolution NTL when measuring the correlation with the HDI, with Pearson's correlation coefficients of-0.48 and-0.35 for the NLDI using the fine and coarse resolution NTL data, respectively, for New Delhi. The outcomes indicate that RFATPK provides more accurate predictions than the three benchmark techniques and the downscaled NTL data are more suitable for fine scale socioeconomic applications, as demonstrated by the NLDI and GNI. This research, thus, shows that the RFATPK solution for NTL disaggregation can facilitate data enhancement for fine-scale sub national applications in social sciences and can be generalized worldwide by including other cities as well as other applications.

TI  - Models overestimate ecosystem water use efficiency for northern permafrost regions
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the carbon-water coupling over permafrost regions is essential to projecting global ecosystem carbon sequestration and water dynamics. Ecosystem water use efficiency (EWUE), defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET), reflects plant acclimation strategies with varying ecosystem functioning against environmental stress. Yet EWUE change and its potential drivers across the northern permafrost regions remain poorly quantified, hampering our understanding of permafrost carbon-climatefeedback. Here, we compared and analyzed the difference using satellite observations and process based models to estimate the spatio-temporal variations of EWUE in 1982-2018 over northern permafrost regions. Using flux measurements as truth data, satellite-derived EWUE was more reliable than model-based EWUE. Satellite-derived EWUE showed biome-dependent spatial patterns, with a steady temporal trend (0.01 g C mm-1 decade-1, P > 0.05) for spatially averaged EWUE over northern permafrost regions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and nitrogen deposition positively affected interannual variations of EWUE, while vapor pressure deficit and other climatic factors (i.e., temperature, precipitation, and radiation) negatively controlled EWUE. Compared to satellite-derived EWUE, we found that EWUEs derived from an ensemble of process-based carbon cycle models are overestimated in seven out of ten models, with an increasing trend of 0.11 g C mm-1 decade 1 (P < 0.001) for spatially averaged EWUE of the ensemble mean. The relationships between climatic factors and EWUE are partially misinterpreted in model estimates, especially with overstated CO2 sensitivity and the opposite temperature effect. The fluctuating sensitivities to climate over time and the diminishing effect of CO2 fertilization on gross primary productivity (GPP) may partially explain the discrepancy observed between satellite-derived and model-based estimates of EWUE. Thus, this study calls for caution concerning model-based EWUE and aids in understanding permafrost-climate feedbacks and projections of carbon and water cycles.

TI  - The method of algal bloom extraction in Lake Chaohu waters based on FAI-L method
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, with increasing human activities, water eutrophication has seriously threatened the ecological security of lakes. In order to obtain the range of algal bloom quickly and accurately, FAI linear fitting model of planktonic algae index (FAI-L) is proposed in this paper. In previous studies, NDVI ( normalized difference vegetation index) has been widely used in algal bloom identification, and the method of obtaining NDVI threshold by slope calculation has also been verified. Compared with NDVI, FAI is less sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and has higher accuracy in the identification of algal blooms due to the addition of short infrared bands to effectively reduce the impacts of atmosphere and thin clouds. However, there is no effective solution to the problem of how to determine the threshold for identifying algal blooms by FAI. This paper established the linear fitting equation between NDVI and FAI and used NDVI threshold to determine FAI threshold, which can effectively solve the problem of FAI threshold determination. The extraction results of Landsat8 and Sentinel -2 showed that: ( 1) Compared with NDVI, the accuracy of FAI-L was greatly improved. The extraction accuracy of algal blooms from Landsat8 images was 97.16%, which was 5.44% higher than that of NDVI ( 91.72%). ( 2) Based on Sentinel -2 data, the applicability of FAI-L was explored. The results showed that for high -resolution remote sensing images, the extraction accuracy of FAI-L was 97.10%, and had good applicability. ( 3) FAI-L could eliminate the interference of clouds on the extraction of algal blooms and had a better extraction effect on the edge areas and small sporadic areas of algal blooms. FAI-L can better obtain the spatial distribution of algal blooms in Lake Chaohu waters, effectively reduce the misjudgment caused by clouds, and has high accuracy and applicability. It can provide a new method for determining the threshold of the spectral sensitivity index of algal bloom extraction.

TI  - National-scale imperviousness mapping and detection of urban land changes
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With high land take for urbanization a serious concern, the European Union and Member States have set quantitative targets for limiting land take in Europe. Consistent and reliable information on land take is crucial for measuring progress in achieving these targets. In the big data era, Earth observation data offers opportunities to regularly and consistently monitor land use change dynamics on a national scale. However, often-used methods such as image classification do not solve the mixed pixels problem common to urban areas with high heterogeneity. Moreover, the urban land use changes detected by these methods are often affected by random noise caused by non-relevant changes in atmospheric conditions, sun angle, vegetation phenology, etc. Therefore, the resulting products are often judged as being of insufficient quality for operational application.In this study, we present an approach to measuring annual land take using imperviousness mapping and change detection. Based on the Google Earth cloud computing platform, we first applied a data mining approach on annual Sentinel-2 image scenes to extract temporal and spectral information at Germany wide scale. Then spectral unmixing algorithm was used to estimate sub-pixel fractions of imperviousness. We end by using imperviousness changes to detect newly built surfaces. The change detection products were validated using highresolution historical aerial photos and images. The results achieved an accuracy of 87% for detecting new builtup and 98% for detecting changes. The difference between the two numbers is caused by the areas with changes on the surface but not for urban use.We found that the integration of temporal information improves the performance of spectral unmixing than using spectral information alone, because it can better distinguish imperviousness from other land covers with similar spectral signatures but different temporal characteristics. We also found that, due to the sub-pixel analysis approach, spectral-unmixing-derived imperviousness is sensitive to urban features even with a size of just a few pixels. Moreover, the imperviousness layer represents urban land with a continuous index, meaning that random noise, represented as a low-range change of fractions, can be filtered out. Our study demonstrated that remote sensing products can be tailored to fulfil the needs of specific applications supporting sustainable land-use policy. This opens up more possibilities for the diverse and growing user communities of urban land change products.

TI  - Sample-free automated mapping of double-season rice in China using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Timely and accurately mapping the spatial distribution of rice is of great significance for estimating crop yield, ensuring food security and freshwater resources, and studying climate change. Double-season rice is a dominant rice planting system in China, but it is challenging to map it from remote sensing data due to its complex temporal profiles that requires high-frequency observations.Methods: We used an automated rice mapping method based on the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based Rice Mapping Index (SPRI), that requires no samples to identify double-season rice. We used the Sentinel-1 SAR time series data to capture the growth of rice from transplanting to maturity in 2018, and calculated the SPRI of each pixel by adaptive parameters using cloud-free Sentinel-2 imagery. We extensively evaluated the methods performance at pixel and regional scales.Results and discussion: The results showed that even without any training samples, SPRI was able to provide satisfactory classification results, with the average overall accuracy of early and late rice in the main producing provinces of 84.38% and 84.43%, respectively. The estimated area of double-season rice showed a good agreement with county-level agricultural census data. Our results showed that the SPRI method can be used to automatically map the distribution of rice with high accuracy at large scales.

TI  - Destabilizing the science of soils: Geoscientists as spokespersons for land subsidence in Semarang, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this article, we explore how land subsidence is scientifically known in the coastal city of Semarang, Indonesia. We do so to ask questions about how the authority of this scientific knowledge is or not effective to help slow down land subsidence? We examine the scientific methods used to measure where, and at what rate, subsidence occurs, and we inventory the theories mobilized to interpret and explain them. Our analysis shows how land subsidence resists being fully or unambiguously known; its science remains somewhat speculative. We explore how, in Semarang, but also more broadly, this makes it difficult for subsidence scientists to act as effective 'spokespersons' for subsidence; their predictions lack certainty and confidence. As we follow the subsidence debates in Semarang we document how subsidence scientists need the authority of science to speak convincingly to powerful elite coalitions of government agencies and private companies, who have vested interests in ignoring or denying their role in causing or accelerating subsidence. We identify this as one reason why subsidence scientists deploy great efforts to present themselves, and their science, as separate from politics and society, as detached and therefore objective. Beyond contributing to emergent discussions in science and technology studies about how science shapes underground politics, our analysis opens up and sheds new light on the question of how scientific facts become entangled with politics in societal controversies.

TI  - The Relations of Vietnam with the Middle East-North Africa Region: From a Divided State to an Important Member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
T2  - CONTEMPORARY REVIEW OF THE MIDDLE EAST
M3  - Article
AB  - During the Cold War, three countries were partitioned into two states: Germany, Korea, and Vietnam. The last was a result of its war of independence against the French following World War II and continued until 1954. Following a victorious war against the United States-backed government in the south, the communist government in the north reunited the country between 1975 and 1976. In 1988, facing economic troubles, Vietnam instituted Doi Moi market reforms while relaxing its ideological worldview and expanded its diplomatic and economic relations. In 1995, Vietnam joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which it had regarded as a pro-Western organization during the Cold War. Meanwhile, first North Vietnam and later a reunified Vietnam went from a country whose relations were exclusive with states in the communist bloc and a few other non-aligned countries to one that today has ties with almost every country in the world. Academic studies on Vietnam's foreign relations largely focus on those with Russia, China, the US, its ASEAN partners, and other countries in Asia. However, since the end of the Cold War, countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are an import source of Vietnam's crude oil and natural gas and an expanding market for its exports, while MENA states, in this era of globalization, have sought to increase diplomatic and economic ties throughout Asia.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to apply various digital image processing methods of satellite imageries and remote sensing techniques in the geological and geomorphological analysis of Wadi Fatima area, Saudi Arabia. This area includes a sequence of volcano-sedimentary rocks of Arabian Shield and it is characterized by diagnostic drainage lines. Landsat-7 images and digital elevation model (DEM) in a 30 m resolution data have been used in this work. These data were also used in the geological interpretations, extracting morphometric parameters, and geomorphological analysis of Wadi Fatima drainage basin.The geological map of Wadi Fatima drainage basin was constructed and interpreted from the processed Landsat ETM + space imageries. The structural lineaments map of Wadi Fatima drainage basin was extracted from the digital data of panchromatic Landsat ETM + band. The geomorphological analysis identified, delineated and gave the main geomorphic characteristics of Wadi Fatima drainage basin. The statistical analysis of structural lineaments and the stream orders of Wadi Fatima basin showing that the main directional trends of both have a common trend in the directions of NE-SW, N-S & E-W. This means that the main wadies of Wadi Fatima drainage basin are structurally controlled and follow up the main faults and shear zones in the area. This study results in accurate delineation and constructive detailed geological and geomorphological aspect maps of Wadi Fatima basin. Wadi Fatima basin is less dangerous due to its rectangular shape than the circular shape, because the top of the flood reaches after a long time.& COPY; 2023 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Microplastic levels and sentinel species used to monitor the environmental quality of lagoons: A state of the art in Italy
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Lagoons play an important role in providing a variety of ecological services. They provide important habitats for several plant and animal species, also acting as natural filters that regulate water quality. Microplastic (MP) pollution has become a global environmental problem that warrants in-depth studies to understand its impact on socioeconomically and ecologically important areas such as lagoon systems. However, there is a notable lack of data on the occurrence of MPs in Italian lagoon systems, highlighting the need for monitoring and assessment. In this review, peer-reviewed studies from Google Scholar and Scopus databases were examined (n = 10), reflecting the current knowledge on the occurrence of MPs in Italian lagoon systems. A high degree of methodological heterogeneity was recorded, making difficult a meaningful comparison and draw comprehensive conclusions about the occurrence of MPs. Alarmingly, in Italy, only 9 of more than 100 coastal transition ecosystems have been monitored for MP pollution, leaving a significant number unexplored and inadequately studied. In addition, most studies have focused primarily on organism analysis without simultaneously examining the presence of MPs in water and sediments, making it difficult to establish links between MP pollution in abiotic and biotic com-partments. To address these gaps, we extended the literature review to research performed worldwide to identify potential organisms suitable for monitoring MPs in lagoons and nearshore transition ecosystems. As observed in many studies, our results highlight the urgent scientific need to standardize methods, procedures, and sampling designs to facilitate comparability and improve the robustness of future research in this area. Overall, this review sheds light on the MP occurrence in Italian lagoon systems, highlights the limitations of existing studies, and emphasizes the urgency of adopting standardized approaches for consistent monitoring and assessment. By addressing these research gaps, we can improve our understanding of MP pollution in lagoons and develop effective strategies to protect these important ecosystems.

TI  - Characterization of icing conditions using aircraft reports and satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A sample of 115 aircraft icing events in the Western Europe and Northeastern Atlantic sector, identified in aircraft pilot reports (PIREPs), is assessed in terms of spatio-temporal distribution and cloud characteristics, using satellite observations and products. Within our database, most of the reported events occur between October and February, although a few cases were identified during late spring and even summer months. Icing conditions are generally reported at mid-troposphere, with 82.7% and 78.6% of moderate and severe icing, respectively, identified between FL100 and FL250 (R-.1 3-7.6 km). Satellite observations allow the identification of icing-prone conditions and also provide an independent means of validating some of the data in the aircraft reports. It is shown that icing occurs mainly within opaque clouds, with ice cloud-tops, or mixed phase (ice and water), noting the severe events, take place mostly under mixed-phase cloud-tops. Accordingly, most events were associated with middle and high opaque clouds, with 10.8 & mu;m brightness temperatures (BT10.8) between-40 and -8 & DEG;C. Moreover, a detailed analysis of three events, making use of model, satellite and synoptic observations, illustrates the occurrence of aircraft icing in precipitating clouds. Within those cases, one occurred below the upper layer of a thick nimbostratus associated with an occluded low centred in the Bay of Biscay. The second event, reported as severe, as in the former case, took place within low clouds over southern England in association with northwesterly winds driven by a complex low. Finally, a moderate event happened over southern Portugal in association with a cold front, near the cloud top of nimbostratus. In all cases, the icing index operational at the Portuguese Weather Service, based on the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model, was able to predict prone-icing conditions, with higher severity in the severe cases.

TI  - NEO-SAFE: a clinical model for patients and healthcare personnel safety in primary level hospitals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Patient safety is a major concern in medicine. Approximately, 4 million infants die each year worldwide and 23% of these deaths are caused by perinatal asphyxia. To prevent the long-term damage of asphyxia, the resuscitation flowchart must be perfectly and promptly performed. However, high effectiveness in performing resuscitation can only be achieved and maintained if the algorithm is frequently executed. Therefore, maintaining a high level of patient care is difficult in some remote centres. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new organizational model of care-network between Hub & Spoke hospitals to improve both the safety of the newborns in hospitals with a low number of births and the well-being of operators. Our project, NEO-SAFE (NEOnatal SAFety and training Elba), began in 2017 and involved the neonatal intensive care unit and the NINA Center of the Pisa University Hospital (hub) and the Hospital of Elba Island (spoke). It consisted of a continuous training program, both with 'classic' training course and 'on-job tutoring' (on side and remotely), of the health workers at spoke (i.e. nurses, midwives, and paediatricians). All four milestones of the study design were achieved. During the project, NINA Center instructors organized training courses for the staff in Portoferraio. These courses were based on learning technical and non-technical skills in a training course of increasing difficulty. Staff training needs were also monitored during the project by means of periodic questionnaires, sentinel events, and specific requests. The curve described by the rate of newborns transfer to the Pisa neonatal intensive care unit (hub) shows a monotonous decreasing trend line. On the other hand, this project allowed operators to develop greater self-confidence and greater safety in managing emergency situations, reducing stress for them and improving patient safety. The project allowed the creation of a safe, effective, low-cost, and reproducible organizational model for centres with a low number of births. Moreover, the tele-medicine approach is an important improvement in the assistance and is a window on the future.

TI  - Identifying changes in the hydrological connectivity and their drivers in the Liaohe Delta wetland
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological connectivity is of great significance to the formation and development of wetlands. Identifying the causes of reduced hydrological connectivity is also critical for restoring wetland systems. Despite its importance, research to identify connectivity or blockage and quantify the impact of different drivers on wetland hydrological connectivity remains a challenge due to the lack of appropriate data at large scales. This paper quantitatively analyzed the hydrological connectivity in the Liaohe Delta wetland using multispectral Landsat series datasets from 1986 to 2020 in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) by combining water area, connectivity function value (CFV), average monthly inundation frequency. The paper also defined identification criteria for connectivity or blockage and quantified the drivers of changes in hydrological connectivity by combining the identified results with wetland classification data. The results showed that (1) over the past 35 years, water area has slightly decreased and has shown a seasonal difference, with summer, autumn, and spring in decreasing order. The spatial distribution of water has expanded from land to sea. (2) CFV decreased and connectivity blockage occurred. The maximum hydrological connectivity distance has undergone fluctuations, exhibiting a decrease in its threshold value from 62.37 km between 1986 and 2011, to 55.2 km between 2011 and 2013. Subsequently, the threshold increased back to 62.37 km between 2013 and 2014, before declining to 55.17 km between 2014 and 2020. Heavy inundation and total inundation were mainly concentrated in nascent estuary areas and shallow sea areas. (3) Connectivity blockage has been a major trend in connectivity change over the past 35 years, with the most severe blockage occurring from 2006 to 2015. The factors influencing connectivity blockage were more natural than human factors before 2006, after which human factors gradually became the dominant driving factor. Over the past 35 years, hydrological connectivity has decreased and connectivity has been blocked. Human activities have become the main factor in the blockage of connectivity in the Liaohe Delta wetland since 2006. This study provides valuable insights for the conservation and restoration of hydrological connectivity in the Liaohe Delta wetland.

TI  - Evaluation of the national clinical sentinel surveillance system for sexually transmitted infections in South Africa: Analysis of provincial and district-level data.
T2  - South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, >1 million new cases of curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are estimated to occur daily, an alarming rate that has prevailed for over a decade. Modelled STI prevalence estimates for South Africa (SA) are among the highest globally. Robust STI surveillance systems have implications for policy and planning, antimicrobial stewardship and prevention strategies, and are critical in stemming the tide of STIs.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the STI clinical sentinel surveillance system (STI CSSS) in SA, to describe the population incidence of four designated STI syndromes in males and females ≥15 years, and to provide recommendations for strengthening the STI CSSS.METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of the STI CSSS in SA. Distribution of the primary healthcare facilities designated as STI CSSS sites was described, taking into account provincial population distribution and headcount coverage of STI CSSS facilities. Reporting compliance was evaluated to determine completion of data reporting. Further analysis was undertaken for those provinces that had good reporting compliance over a 12-month period. Population-level and demographic STI syndrome incidence were estimated from CSSS data using case reports of male urethritis syndrome (MUS) as a proxy for data extrapolation.RESULTS: Reporting compliance exceeded 70% for seven of the nine provinces. STI syndromes with the highest incidence were MUS and vaginal discharge syndrome (VDS). The 20 - 24 years age group had the highest STI incidence, at least double the incidence estimated in the other two age groups. Overall STI incidence in females was higher than among males in all provinces, except Limpopo and Western Cape. The 15 - 19 years age group had the most prominent gender disparity, with the national STI incidence in females 70% higher than in males. District-level analysis revealed high regional STI incidence even in provinces with lower overall incidence.CONCLUSION: The STI CSSS is pivotal to epidemiological monitoring and proactive management of STIs, especially in view of the high HIV prevalence in SA. CSSS processes and facility selection should be reviewed and revised to be representative and responsive to the current STI needs of the country, with biennial analysis and reporting to support evidence-based policy development and targeted implementation.

TI  - Designing a Wastewater-Based Epidemiology Study at the US Air Force Academy: Using Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 to Test a Sentinel System for Early Disease Outbreak Detection
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Introduction The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in wastewater has been proposed as a sentinel surveillance epidemiological tool for detection of infectious disease at a community level and as a complementary approach to syndromic surveillance of infectious disease outbreaks. We have designed a study to test the presence and quantity of SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID19, in the wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) of the U.S. Air Force Academy. Materials and Methods Wastewater samples were tested in the laboratory to quantify the amount of SARS-CoV2 RNA using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Raw SARS-CoV2 viral titer in wastewater was normalized to the viral titer of a fecal marker, pepper mild mottle virus, to correct for dilutions. Temporal and spatial trends of COVID19 were analyzed. Furthermore, we compared wastewater analysis results against clinical data to assist public health decisions. Results Preliminary data suggest that wastewater analysis can provide temporal and spatial trends of COVID19. The geographically discrete WWTF at the U.S. Air Force suggests that wastewater testing is a useful approach to developing a comprehensive sentinel surveillance system. Conclusions Together with ongoing syndromic surveillance data, this proof-of-concept study seeks to determine whether early detection of SARS-CoV2 in a closed system WWTF correlates to changes in community and clinically reported COVID19. The well-documented population served by the geographically discrete WWTF at the U.S. Air Force Academy may serve to better elucidate the adjunctive role of wastewater testing in a comprehensive surveillance system. These results may be of particular interest to the DoD and local commanders given the WWTFs under their immediate control and the information that these studies may provide in support of operational readiness through early detection of disease outbreaks.

TI  - Revolutions of the mind, (threats of) actual revolutions, and institutional change
T2  - PUBLIC CHOICE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - I construct a simple theoretical model that incorporates the role of ideas and contested persuasion in processes of institutional change, specifically democratization. The model helps reconcile the view that extensions of the franchise in Western Europe tended to occur as a response to the threat of revolution with the view that these occurred based on a change of social values due to the Enlightenment. In particular, the model puts forward the argument that institutional changes become possible once ideological entrepreneurs -the carriers of an alternative worldview- win an ideological contest against the holders of traditional ideas so that the rest of society adopts their worldview, and a revolutionary threat becomes credible. The model shows that the preferences of the ideological entrepreneurs are key. A revolution takes place only if they prefer it to a peaceful transition. Also, the model predicts that actual revolutions occur only when the probability of them being successful is either low or high. Finally, the ideological benefits associated with adhering to a specific ideology affect whether institutional change is peaceful or not. A strong traditional ideology generating large psychological benefits of adhering to the status quo makes it more likely that democratization occurs through revolution. On the contrary, a strong alternative ideology favoring the extension of the franchise makes it more likely that democracy emerges but has an ambiguous effect on the likelihood of a revolution.

TI  - DynIceData: a gridded ice-water classification dataset at short-time intervals based on observations from multiple satellites over the marginal ice zone
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
M3  - Early Access
AB  - High-resolution observations of short-term changes in sea ice are critical to understanding ice dynamics and also provide important information used in advice to shipping, especially in the Arctic. Although individual satellite sensors provide periodic sea ice observations with spatial resolutions of tens of meters, information regarding changes that occur over short time intervals of minutes or hours is limited. In this study, a gridded ice-water classification dataset with a high temporal resolution was developed based on observations acquired by multiple satellite sensors in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ). This dataset - DynIceData - which combines Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR and SDGSAT-1 thermal infrared imagery was used to obtain observations of the MIZ with a range of temporal resolutions ranging from minutes to tens of hours. The areas of the Arctic covered include the Kara Sea, Beaufort Sea, and Greenland Sea during the period from August 2021 to August 2022. Object-oriented segmentation and thresholding were used to obtain the ice-water classification map from Sentinel-1 and GF-3 SAR image pairs and Sentinel-1 SAR and SDGSAT-1 thermal image pairs. The time interval between the images in each pair ranged from 1 minute to 68 hours. Ten-kilometer grid sample granules with a spatial resolution of 25 m for the GF-3 SAR data and 30 m for the SDGSAT-1 thermal data were used. The classification was verified as having an overall accuracy of at least 95.58%. The DynIceData dataset consists of 7338 samples, which could be used as reference data for further research on rapid changes in sea ice patterns at different short time scales and provide support for research on thermodynamic and dynamic models of sea ice in combination with other environmental data, thus potentially improving the accuracy of sea ice forecasting using Artificial Intelligence. The dataset can be accessed at .

TI  - The government of masks in sentinel territories against Covid-19: Dakar and Seine-Saint-Denis
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The pandemic of Covid-19 has led to reluctance or resistance to wear a mask in countries that made it compulsory. The acceptance to wear a mask against respiratory diseases depends on conceptions of scientific authority and of the personality in the public space. It has material and symbolic dimensions that can be covered under the term "government of masks". We have questioned populations on these two aspects in territories we call sentinel because they are more exposed than others to emerging infectious diseases: Dakar (Senegal) and Seine-Saint-Denis (France). In France, school students have asked 250 people in public places on their perception of masks following a questionnaire, while in Senegal a team of master students went in 606 people's houses to ask questions following the same questionnaire. Despite these methodological differences, our results show that the perception of the State in these territories influences the uses of masks against Covid-19 at symbolic and material levels. While in Seine-Saint-Denis, the State provides more masks than in Dakar, the trust in the efficacy of mask wearing is lower. From a symbolic point of view, the mask is for many people an intrusion of the State into the private sphere, which hinders physical contact between family members. On the contrary, from the material point of view, the mask is a need that manifests the presence of the welfare State to watch over the health of the population. This comparative study suggests that a State that is at the same time coercive and protective produces a lower level of adherence to mask-wearing recommendations than a State where religious authorities are included in the prescription and where individuals contribute to making masks.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of Hydro-Estimator Technique-Based Rain Products from INSAT-3DR During Indian Summer Monsoon 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Hydro-Estimator (H-E) method-based rainfall products from INSAT-3DR are operationally available at the web portal of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). These high spatial (4 km) and temporal (30 min) resolution products not only play a significant role in monitoring monsoonal rain over India and the surrounding ocean but also show importance in assessing several meteorological events such as tropical cyclones, floods, cloud bursts and thunderstorms. Thus, a comparison of these rain products with in situ observations and other satellite data is important to evaluate their performance. This study details about the validation procedures and discusses the performance of H-E technique-based rain products from INSAT-3DR over India and surrounding oceans during the Indian summer monsoon (June-September) 2020. The performance of products is evaluated using two sets of data (1) in situ network of IMD rain gauges over India and (2) Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) (IMERG) products. Results show that H-E well captures the spatial distribution of rain as depicted by rain gauges and IMERG. H-E shows a probability of detection of > 95% and a false alarm rate of < 25% with in situ rain gauges' observations on a monthly scale. It provides a correlation of 0.4 and a root mean square error of 54.48 mm/day with respect to IMERG over India and the surrounding ocean. The present study provides a detailed evaluation of the H-E rain for its worthiness for various applications.

TI  - Baseline characterization of entomological drivers of malaria transmission in Namibia: a targeted operational entomological surveillance strategy
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Namibia's focus on the elimination of malaria requires an evidence-based strategy directed at understanding and targeting the entomological drivers of malaria transmission. In 2018 and 2019, the Namibia National Vector-borne Diseases Control Program (NVDCP) implemented baseline entomological surveillance based on a question-based approach outlined in the Entomological Surveillance Planning Tool (ESPT). In the present study, we report on the findings of the ESPT-based NVDCP on baseline vector species composition and bionomic traits in malaria endemic regions in northern Namibia, which has the aim of generating an evidence base for programmatic decision-making.Methods Nine representative sentinel sites were included in the 2018 entomological surveillance program (Kunene, Omusati, Oshana, Ohangwena, Oshikoto, Otjozondjupa, Kavango West, Kavango East and Zambezi); the number was reduced to four sites in 2019 due to limited funding (Ohangwena, Kavango West, Kavango East, and Zambezi). In the 2018 baseline collections, multiple sampling methods (human landing catches, pyrethroid spray catches, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps [CDC-LTs], resting boxes [RBs] and larval sampling) were utilized to evaluate indoor/outdoor human biting rates, resting behaviors and insecticide resistance (IR). CDC-LTs and RBs were not used in 2019 due to low and non-representative sampling efficacies.Results Overall, molecular evidence demonstrated the presence of three primary mosquito vectors, namely Anopheles arabiensis, rediscovered Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto and Anopheles funestus sensu stricto, alongside Anopheles squamosus and members of the Anopheles coustani complex. Vectors were found to bite throughout the night (1800 hours 0600 hours) both indoors and outdoors, with An. arabiensis having the highest biting rates outdoors. Low numbers of indoor resting Anopheles point to possible low indoor residual spraying (IRS) efficacy-with An. arabiensis found to be the major vector species resting indoors. The IR tests demonstrated varying country-wide resistance levels to the insecticide deltamethrin, with the resistance levels confirmed to have increased in 2019, evidence that impacts national programmatic decision-making. Vectors demonstrated susceptibility to the insecticides dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, bendiocarb and Actellic 300CS in 2018, with mosquitoes from only one site (Kavango West) demonstrating possible resistance to DDT. Targeted and question-based entomological surveillance enabled a rapid and focused evidence base to be built, showing where and when humans were being bitten and providing entomological data on long-lasting insecticidal nets, IRS efficacy and insecticide resistance, which the Ministry of Health and Social Services-Namibia can use to further build a monitoring and evaluation framework for understanding the drivers of transmission.Conclusion Identification and characterization of species-specific bionomic traits allows for an understanding of where and when vector human contact may occur as well as the potential impact of interventions. Low indoor resting rates as well as the presence of insecticide resistance (and the increase in its frequency) point to the need for mosquito-behavior-directed and appropriate interventions as well as the requirement for a resistance mitigation strategy. The ESPT-based question- and minimal essential indicator-based operational research strategy provides programs with directed and focused data for facilitating decision-making while requiring limited funding and capacity.

TI  - Mapping of soil organic matter in a typical black soil area using Landsat-8 synthetic images at different time periods
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of soil organic matter (SOM) in cultivated land is one of the important aspects of digital soil mapping, and its results are of great significance for agricultural precision management and carbon cycle assessment. This study takes Youyi Farm, a typical black soil area in Northeast China, as the research area and utilizes all Landsat8 images covering the study area from April to October during 2014-2022. After masking clouds, all images were synthesized monthly. According to the local crop phenology, the period from April to October was divided into the bare soil period (April to June), peak crop growth period (July to August), and late crop growth period (September to October). Based on the random forest regression algorithm, differences in the accuracy of SOM mapping using synthetic images from different periods were evaluated, and the impact of adding environmental covariates on the SOM mapping accuracy was analyzed. The results showed that (1) when using a singletemporal synthesized image for SOM mapping, the order of accuracy was bare soil period > peak crop growth period > late crop growth period, with the synthesized image in May exhibiting the highest accuracy, with an RMSE of 0.979 %; (2) when using a multitemporal image combination for SOM mapping, the combination of optimal months (April, May, June) in the same periods can obtain the best SOM mapping accuracy, with an RMSE of 0.919 %; and (3) adding environmental covariates can effectively improve the accuracy of SOM mapping, especially when using the growing season remote sensing images, RMSE decreased from 1.136 % to 0.909 %. This study expands the applicable areas and conditions of SOM remote sensing mapping.

TI  - Crop yield estimation based on assimilation of crop models and remote sensing data: A systematic evaluation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - CONTEXT: With the warming trend and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, accurate crop yield estimation is becoming urgent. Crop yield estimation mainly consists of two methods: crop model simulation and remote sensing observations. Crop models can achieve accurate simulations of crop growth at field scales. However, in regional applications, they are limited by the spatial heterogeneity of certain input parameters. Remote sensing observations can obtain crop status over large areas quickly and conveniently, while lacking knowledge of crop growth processes. By combining the advantages of crop models and remote sensing, crop yield estimation with spatiotemporal continuity can be achieved using data assimilation methods. OBJECTIVE: The research progress of the three elements of data assimilation system has been quantitatively reviewed in this paper. And the relevant literature was quantitatively screened and reviewed to provide a systematic overview of the application of data assimilation in crop yield estimation. METHODS: In this study, the scientific background of the data assimilation system for crop yield estimations was described, and basic principles of data assimilation were introduced. A second part of this review screened and reviewed the relevant literature quantitatively. The answers to problems on: the most widely used crop model, the assimilation algorithm, and the assimilation variables were reported. Finally, a synthesis of the emerging directions and challenges of data assimilation systems for crop yield estimation were discussed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results show that: a) the sequential assimilation method is the most widely used algorithm in the field of data assimilation, especially EnKF. b) WOFOST, DSSAT, AquaCrop and SAFY are the most common models in the research of data assimilation for yield estimation. c) In terms of assimilation variables, LAI (leaf area index), SM (soil moisture), and VIs (vegetation indexes) are relatively common assimilation variables. Research progress of data assimilation system for crop yield estimation is summarized from the aspects of algorithm improvement, model coupling research, multi-source remote sensing data assimilation and multiple assimilation variables. SIGNIFICANCE: This review quantitatively examined and contrasted the research progress of data assimilation systems providing researchers with a more comprehensive background. It also suggests ideas and references for higher resolution, more accurate and reliable yield estimation for future research.

TI  - A framework combined stacking ensemble algorithm to classify crop in complex agricultural landscape of high altitude regions with Gaofen-6 imagery and elevation data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping crop distribution using satellite technology is an effective approach for gaining information about food production over broad, regional scales. However, crop classification in high altitude regions from satellite platforms remains challenging, due to the spatial heterogeneity caused by the complex planting patterns. Moreover, the frequent cloud cover makes it difficult to collect time-series imagery for these regions. Thus, this study used a mosaic of single images of Gaofen-6 data to map the crop distribution in high altitude regions of Xining City and Haidong City prefectures of Qinghai Province, China. To improve the accuracy of the crop classification, random forest-recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) was used to determine an optimal feature subset from existing spectral, texture and topographic features. Then, a two-layer stacking generalization ensemble model, incorporating Random Forest, XGBoost and AdaBoost, was trained. The results reveal that the stacking algorithm outperformed the other single classifiers, with overall accuracy higher than 85% (87.89% for the optimal feature subset and 85.38% for the original spectral band subset). In addition, the user's and pro-ducer's accuracies for wheat, rape and maize field all exceeded 90%. Elevation was the variable with the highest importance score, illustrating its importance in crop classification of high altitude regions. Overall, the frame-work, combining RF-RFE and a stacking algorithm, can improve the accuracy of the crop classification in high altitude regions.

TI  - An Australian-based nomogram predicting nodal positivity for breast cancer in older patients.
T2  - The surgeon : journal of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Ireland
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Regional nodal status is one of the most powerful prognosticators in breast cancer. The sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) evaluates the first node in the axillary lymphatic basin theorised to drain the anatomical region of breast cancer. Recent literature has appropriately raised the query of the need for SLNB for breast cancer in older patients (BCOP). Though some early-stage older patients may safely have SLNB omitted, we are potentially missing the under-represented aggressive cancers. No sentinel lymph node metastases nomogram has been developed solely from BCOP data to date. This study aimed to identify older patients with breast cancer at risk for nodal involvement using a nomogram developed from their data alone.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on BCOP (aged ≥70 years) was performed using the Breast Surgery Quality Audit (BQA). Inclusion criteria were T1-2 invasive breast cancer patients that underwent a SLNB from 1st January 2001 to 31st December 2019. The primary outcome was nodal involvement. Data obtained from the dataset included: age, tumour type, tumour size in millimeters, histological grade, lymphovascular invasion, oestrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, HER2 status and referral source. Binary logistic regression was used to develop a nomogram. The model was internally validated by splitting the data set (80% for training and 20% for testing). A receiver operating characteristic curve was developed, with the area under the curve (AUC) and a calibration plot.RESULTS: There were 22,313 patients of which 14,856 (66.6%) were symptomatic presentations and 7457 (33.4%) were screen-detected. Invasive tumour type, tumour size, tumour grade, lymphovascular invasion, oestrogen receptors, and referral source indicated a statistically significant effect on predicting a nodal positivity event (Table 1). The AUC was 0.782 (95% CI 0.776-0.789) (Fig.1a) and demonstrated good calibration (Fig.1b). The negative predictive value established was 85%.CONCLUSION: We have developed an Australian sentinel lymph node metastasis nomogram for BCOP using routine histopathological data obtained pre-operatively (Fig.2). This is the first Australian nomogram, as well as the first nomogram developed solely for BCOP - and maintains a superior AUC compared to other well-established nomograms.

TI  - Temporal variation of surface reflectance and cloud fraction used to identify background aerosol retrieval information over East Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal variation in cloud cover and surface conditions greatly affects estimation errors associated with reference surface reflectance and atmospheric composition retrievals. In this study, to determine an optimal temporal window for clear-sky composition methods that are used to identify surface reflectance for the retrieval of atmospheric properties, we analyzed temporal variation in surface reflectance and cloud fractions using longterm daily observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaing Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite. For the temporal variation in surface reflectance, gridded pixels with a standard deviation less than 0.025 represented 87.0%, 84.5%, 80.5%, and 77.3% of the total pixels for periods of 15, 20, 30, and 40 days, respectively. The temporal variability of surface reflectance was lowest in summer and highest in winter due to vegetation and snow cover changes over land surface in East Asia. For the temporal variation in cloud fractions, pixels with a cloud fraction <10% ranged from 91.2% (15-day) to 98.1% (40-day). Only temporal windows of 30 and 40 days satisfied the criterion of 95% cumulative distribution in the 10% cloud fraction range. Thus, and appropriate temporal window for clear-sky composition methods must be selected in consideration of the seasonal dependency of surface types and cloud cover variation. The temporal window for the clear-sky composition must be longer than 30 days considering the temporal variability of cloud cover, and shorter than 30 days considering that of surface reflectance. However, seasonal dependencies of surface reflectance and cloud fraction are also additionally considered to select the appropriated temporal window for the clear-sky composition.

TI  - Religious Coping and Mental Adjustment to Cancer Among Polish Adolescents
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Adults suffering from chronic illnesses are more likely to look to God for support (positive religious coping; PRC) than to fight against God (negative religious coping; NRC). What about when cancer occurs during adolescence-a period of questioning the worldview and values, and at the same time searching for the sacred? Our study aimed to establish the relationships between PRC, NRC, and mental adjustment to cancer among youth and determine support's role in these relationships. The study was conducted in Poland and included 88 adolescent cancer patients who completed the Brief RCOPE and the Mini-MAC. Additionally, general well-being and support were assessed. We found that PRC was positively related to constructive adjustment style (CAS), whereas NCR was related to destructive adjustment style (DAS). Adolescents with cancer were higher in PRC than in NRC and were higher in CAS than in DAS. In young women, CAS was higher than in men. Finally, at a level of received support rated as very high, PRC promoted fighting spirit and well-being.

TI  - Res-CN (Reservoir dataset in China): hydrometeorological time series and landscape attributes across 3254 Chinese reservoirs
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Dams and reservoirs are human-made infrastructures that have attracted increasing attention because of their societal and environmental significance. Towards better management and conservation of reservoirs, a dataset of reservoir-catchment characteristics is needed, considering that the amount of water and material flowing into and out of reservoirs depends on their locations on the river network and the properties of the upstream catchment. To date, no dataset exists for reservoir-catchment characteristics. The aim of this study is to develop the first database featuring reservoir-catchment characteristics for 3254 reservoirs with storage capacity totaling 682 595 km(3) (73.2 % of reservoir water storage capacity in China) to support the management and conservation of reservoirs in the context of catchment level. To ensure a more representative and accurate mapping of local variables of large reservoirs, reservoir catchments are delineated into full catchments (their full upstream contributing areas) and intermediate catchments (subtracting the area contributed by upstream reservoirs from the full upstream part of the current reservoir). Using both full catchments and intermediate catchments, characteristics of reservoir catchments were extracted, with a total of 512 attributes in six categories (i.e., reservoir and catchment body characteristics, topography, climate, soil and geology, land cover and use, and anthropogenic activity characteristics). Besides these static attributes, time series of 15 meteorological variables of catchments were extracted to support hydrological simulations for a better understanding of drivers of reservoir environment change. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive and extensive reservoir dataset on water level (data available for 20 % of 3254 reservoirs), water surface area (99 %), storage anomaly (92 %), and evaporation (98 %) from multisource satellites such as radar and laser altimeters and images from Landsat and Sentinel satellites. These products significantly enhance spatial and temporal coverage in comparison to existing similar products (e.g., 67 % increase in spatial resolution of water level and 225 % increase in storage anomaly) and contribute to our understanding of reservoir properties and functions within the Earth system by incorporated national or global hydrological modeling. In situ data of 138 reservoirs are employed in this study as a valuable reference for evaluation, thus enhancing our confidence in the data quality and enhancing our understanding of the accuracy of current satellite datasets. Along with its extensive attributes, the Reservoir dataset in China (Res-CN) can support a broad range of applications such as water resources, hydrologic/hydrodynamic modeling, and energy planning. Res-CN is on Zenodo through (Shen et al., 2022c).

TI  - Impact of cyclone Ockhi on phytoplankton size classes structure in the Arabian Sea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Short-term events like tropical cyclones often have a strong impact on the upper ocean, causing transient changes in the physical and chemical properties of the sea. These changes could potentially affect the distribution pattern of the phytoplankton community. The present study aims to investigate the impact of the distribution of phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) caused by the tropical cyclonic event Ockhi in the Arabian Sea (AS) in 2017. Multiple datasets, including satellite remote sensing and reanalysis data, were utilized to observe the biogeochemical variability and the corresponding changes in PSCs distribution caused by the Ockhi cyclone event. One of the predominant issues in using satellite remote sensing data is the loss of data due to overcast conditions, which was resolved by reconstructing the chl-a and SST using an empirical orthogonal function. The results show a short-term shift in the PSCs pattern from the pico and nano-rich region to the micro-dominated environment in the cyclone passage region during the post-cyclone period. When comparing the results with the physical and biochemical parameters, it was found that the cyclonic event triggered the deep-seated nutrients to the surface, which promoted favourable conditions for microorganisms to proliferate for a short span in the cyclone passage region. The overall study highlights the impact of the Ockhi cyclone on biogeochemical changes and corresponding shifts in the phytoplankton size distribution along the cyclone path.

TI  - The Evolving Treatment Landscape of Merkel Cell Carcinoma
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) has a high risk of recurrence and requires unique treatment relative to other skin cancers. The patient population is generally older, with comorbidities. Multidisciplinary and personalized care is therefore paramount, based on patient preferences regarding risks and benefits. Positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) is the most sensitive staging modality and reveals clinically occult disease in similar to 16% of patients. Discovery of occult disease spread markedly alters management. Newly diagnosed, localized disease is often managed with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), local excision, primary wound closure, and post-operative radiation therapy (PORT). In contrast, metastatic disease is usually treated systemically with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). However, one or more of these approaches may not be indicated. Criteria for such exceptions and alternative approaches will be discussed. Because MCC recurs in 40% of patients and early detection/treatment of advanced disease is advantageous, close surveillance is recommended. Given that over 90% of initial recurrences arise within 3 years, surveillance frequency can be rapidly decreased after this high-risk period. Patient-specific assessment of risk is important because recurrence risk varies widely (15 to > 80%: Merkelcell. org/recur) depending on baseline patient characteristics and time since treatment. Blood-based surveillance tests are now available (Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) antibodies and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)) with excellent sensitivity that can spare patients from contrast dye, radioactivity, and travel to a cancer imaging facility. If recurrent disease is locoregional, management with surgery and/or RT is typically indicated. ICIs are now the first line for systemic/advanced MCC, with objective response rates (ORRs) exceeding 50%. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is sometimes used for debulking disease or in patients who cannot tolerate ICI. ICI-refractory disease is the major problem faced by this field. Fortunately, numerous promising therapies are on the horizon to address this clinical need.

TI  - Evaluation of ground surface deformation in discontinuous permafrost regions along the China-Russia Crude Oil Pipelines in Northeast China using InSAR and ground surveys
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Adequately and timely measuring and evaluating the ground surface deformation (GSD) are keys to the prudent mitigation of frost hazards of foundation soils and thus to the safe and cost-effective operation of oil pipelines in permafrost regions. Thus, it is crucial to accurately evaluate the GSD along the route of China-Russia Crude Oil Pipelines (CRCOPs) for a better understanding of frequent and substantial (differential) frost heave and thaw settlement of pipeline foundation soils in permafrost regions. In this study, GSDs along the CRCOPs from Xiufeng town to Jinsong town, northern Heilongjiang Province were monitored in discontinuous permafrost regions in the northern Da Xing'anling Mountains, Northeast China. The Sentinel-1B images from 2017 to 2021 and the Small Baseline Subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology were used in combi-nation with the Geographical Detector (GeoDetector) for identifying the drivers for GSDs and with ground survey data for validation analysis of GSD at chosen sites (e.g., MDX304 and others). InSAR results show that most of the annual GSD rates along the CRCOPs range from-10 to 0 mm/a, with larger deformation rates in Ta'he, Cuigang, and Jinsong. GeoDetector analysis shows that latitude and soil types are the most important contributors to GSDs along the CRCOPs, and; GSDs are closely related to elevation, ground temperature at the depth of 1 m (GT1m), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), annual precipitation (AP), and slope aspects. Analyses of ground and oil-flow temperatures and survey results of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) show that permafrost along CRCOPs has been degrading and thawing, resulting in thaw settlement, consolidation, and deformation of pipeline foundation soils and underlying/lateral permafrost layers and subsequently, the ground surface subsi-dence. This study provides key deformation data for the assessment and mitigation of frost hazards along the CRCOPs.

TI  - A multi-dimensional nomogram to predict non-sentinel lymph node metastases in T1-2HR+breast cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAxillary lymph node dissection (ALND) could be omitted for T1-2 breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) after breast-conserving surgery when radiation is planned. However, whether ALND could be replaced by radiation in patients with 1-3 positive SLNs when no more non-SLN metastasis were observed after mastectomy are still controversial. The aim of our study was to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting the possibility of non-SLN metastasis in T1-2 and hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive SLNs after mastectomy. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed and analyzed the data including the basic information, preoperative sonographic characteristics, and pathological features in breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive SLNs in our medical center between Jan 2016 and Dec 2021. The Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, and t test were used for comparison of categorical and qualitative variables among patients with or without non-SLN metastasis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine the risk factors for non-SLN metastasis. These predictors were used to build the nomogram. The C-index and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the accuracy of the model. ResultsA total of 49 in 107 (45.8%) patients were identified with non-SLN metastasis. In multivariate analysis, four variables including younger age, lower estrogen receptor (ER) expression, higher histological score, and cortex thickening of the lymph nodes were determined to be significantly associated with non-SLN metastasis. An individualized nomogram was consequently established with a favorable C-index of 0.822 and verified via two internal validation cohorts. ConclusionsThe current study developed a nomogram predicting non-SLN metastasis for T1-2 and HR+ breast cancer with 1-3 positive SLNs after mastectomy and found that patients in the high-risk group exhibited worse relapse-free survival. The novel nomogram may further help surgeons to determine whether ALND could be omitted when 1-3 positive SLNs were observed in T1-2 and HR+ breast cancer patients.

TI  - A remote sensing-based approach for spatiotemporal refined assessment of freshwater wetland ecological risk in coastal zones: A case in Jiangsu's coastal zone
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Rapid, long-term, and robust wetland ecological risk assessment is critical for managing coastal zones. In view of the characteristics of frequent human activities and broken plots in the coastal zone, the traditional assessment method is not fine enough. Satellite earth observation provides an unparalleled source of data for rapidly monitoring and assessing coastal wetland ecological risks through time and across a large spatial range. With the support of multi-source remote sensing data such as precipitation, temperature, night light, land cover products, etc., a wetland ecological risk assessment method is established in this paper, and the wetland ecological risk is evaluated year by year by a grid. The evaluation results indicate that the ecological risk level of coastal wetlands in Jiangsu Province has shown an upward trend since 2015, with a high ecological risk in the north and a low ecological risk in the south, and the source area mainly appears in the northwest. Meanwhile, the year-by-year grid assessment can not only accurately describe the spatial and temporal distribution of wetland ecological risks but also clarify the spatial and temporal characteristics of risk source areas. Additionally, the results obtained by year-on-year assessment of consecutive years and clustering and zoning according to the time-series can better represent the risk status of the time period and exclude the impact of accidental factors on the evaluation results. Although optimization for different types of wetlands can improve the accuracy of assessment, more wetland risk assessment with a longer term and a larger scale, combined with carbon emissions, will provide a basis for global wetland management.

TI  - Trends of greening and browning in terrestrial vegetation in China from 2000 to 2020
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial vegetation condition is altering generally as a result of climate change and anthropogenic activity during the past few decades. To reveal the impact of long-term climate factors and artificial protection on multiple vegetation types, it is crucial to understand the spatial distribution of vegetation greening and browning and the effect of national ecological restoration programs. In this study, we established a persistent vegetation change index (P-value) to characterize greening (restoration) and browning (degradation) in China in 2000-2020. Firstly, we generated annual time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from MODIS product by averaging the monthly maximum NDVI values for each year. Secondly, we calculated the Pvalue to investigate the continuous change in vegetation state by incremental time interval. Finally, patterns and trends of greening and browning in forests, shrublands, and grasslands were quantified and mapped at pixel and sample point levels. The findings of our study revealed that Chinese wild vegetated lands greened up by -3.4 x 104 km2 (25%) and turned brown in -1.6 x 104 km2 (11%) between 2000 and 2020. Net greening was detected in all biomes, most conspicuously in several ecological program regions in northern China. The NDVI time-series data in 31% of field plots showed a consistent result, 11% of field plots showed a browning trend, and 58% of field plots showed a stable state. These results indicated a synergistic effect on forests, shrublands, and grasslands, but with regional variations attributed to differences in precipitation abundance, the implementation of positive ecological programs by the government and negative human activities. Additionally, these findings provide valuable insight into large-scale terrestrial vegetation transitions and have practical applications for decision-making and policy development in the assessment and restoration of ecosystems aimed at reducing carbon emissions, mitigating climate change, preserving biodiversity, and conserving water resources in China.

TI  - Dynamic deformation monitoring and scenario simulation of the Xiaomojiu landslide in the Jinsha River Basin, China
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Xiaomojiu landslide is a typical high-elevation, long-runout landslide located in the Jinsha River Corridor. In this study, sequential InSAR time-series estimation was used to calculate the line of sight (LOS) surface displacements with descending and ascending Sentinel-1 images, and it turned out that the cumulative LOS surface displacement of the landslide was up to -78.4 mm during the period from October 2017 to April 2021 with the maximum LOS surface displacement rate of -38.5 mm/year. The landslide body could be divided into five zones (A, B1, B2, B3, and C) according to its topographical characteristics together with the LOS surface displacement time series. Combining engineering geological characteristics, LOS cumulative surface displacements with site investigation suggest that the Xiaomojiu landslide is likely to be a precipitation-triggered ancient traction rock landslide at the accelerated deformation stage. A dynamic simulation of the Xiaomojiu landslide with the PFC3D software shows that it could take approximately 65 s for the Xiaomojiu landslide from start-up to acceleration to deceleration to build-up of a barrier lake, followed by a simulation from the barrier lake to outburst floods with the HEC-RAS software indicating that the maximum depth of the outburst floods could be 13.5 m (15%), 24.6 m (25%), 42.1 m (50%), and 50.3 m (75%) along Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Transportation Corridor (QTPTC). It is believed that the results of this study provide a reference for landslide prevention along the QTPTC and the Jinsha River.

TI  - A Spatial-Aware Neural Network for Inversion of Shallow Water Depth from WorldView-02 High-Spectral-Resolution Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Remote sensing shallow water depth inversion is to automatically predict the water depth value of 0-30 m based on the extraction of the significative spectral features. For governments, accurate shallow water depth inversion in real time is crucial to provide important scientific data for shipping safety, marine engineering and military marine. Recent research in machine learning have shown the dominance on shallow water depth inversion. However, previous methods based on machine learning basically stacked the single remote sensing depth pixel and failed to invert the continuous spatial relationship properly. In addition, the precision is limited by the simple structure and insufficient parameter training of classic artificial neural network (ANN). To remedy these issues, we proposed a spatial-aware neural network (SAN-Net) for shallow water depth inversion. The SAN-Net mainly consists of a spatial-aware feature extraction block (SAB) and a fully connected with dropout feature mapping sub-network (FCDN). The SAB consisting of two convolutional pooling operations can capture the spatial features of the neighborhood and improve the feature expression of shallow water depth inversion. The FCDN is constructed to integrate highly abstract features output from the SAB. Finally, the MSE loss with a regularization term is utilized to constrain the training process. Experiment results on the proposed Shallow Water depth Inversion from WorldView-02 in Mischief Reef (SWIW02-MR) dataset demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed several representative machine learning methods.

TI  - Bathymetry of shallow coastal environment using multi-spectral passive data under rapid sea-level change
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing imagery is by far one of the top-tier apparatuses employed in the estimation of water depth in particularly shallow coastal regions. Contra to traditional models, remote-sensing-directed bathymetry is considered a highly efficient approach, as it entails a significant increase in performance, all the while reducing costs. Fluctuations in the level of the Caspian Sea (CS) are one of the most important characteristics of the CS and Gomishan Lagoon, which is near the CS and is directly affected by its level. The main aim of this work is to first obtain the water depth up to similar to 7m based on field and Landsat data in 2016 in the southeast of the CS using multivariable regression. Therefore, we examined the linear model between the visible reflectance and the field data. Finally, the depth was calculated from different band combinations (BCs). In order to evaluate the accuracy of the used model, the depth of Gomishan Lagoon is estimated in 2000. The results show that the BC of 234 (blue, green, red) indicate the best BC in depth estimation. According to the linear model, the depth accuracy was obtained R2 = 0.94, MRE = 0.09 and RMSE = 0.35. The predicted depth for Gomishan Lagoon was in accordance with previous findings as well.

TI  - Impacts of urban land use and land cover change on wetland dynamics in Jimma city, southwestern Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Wetland was substantially decreased by anthropogenic activities worldwide, which needs argent conservation action. The present study aimed to analyze the effects of land use land cover change on wetland dynamics from 1992 to 2022 in Jimma City, Southwestern Ethiopia. Landsat TM of 1992, ETM+ of 2000, ETM+ of 2009 and OLI/TIRS of 2022 were used. ArcGIS 10.3 and ERDAS Imagine 2015 were used in the study. Landsat images were classified by using supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm. The results revealed that grassland, wetland and vegetation land cover classes were declined by 2,304.9 ha, 1410.2 ha and 820.5 ha, respectively whereas, farm land, settlement and bare land were increased by 2,199 ha, 2,111 ha and 225.4 ha, respectively from 1992 to 2022. Results show that the normalized difference water index (NDWI) has positive and negative strong relationship with normailized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built up index (NDBI) with the Coefficent determination (R-2) of 0.96 and 0.98, respectively. Due to rapid urbanization and declining of vegetation cover in the study area, about 98% of wetland land cover in the study area lost over the past decades. The governmental and non-governmental organization should give special attention to wetland restoration and management in the study area.

TI  - FIM-based DSInSAR method for mapping and monitoring of reservoir bank landslides: an application along the Lancang River in China
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The conventional multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) technology suffers from the problems of low spatial density of monitoring points (MPs) and poor interferogram quality in monitoring reservoir bank landslides in mountainous areas. To address it, this study builds upon the Eigendecomposition-based Maximum-likelihood estimator of Interferometric phase (EMI) method, introduces Fisher information to adjust the weight of each interferometric pair, and further develops a new distributed scatterer (DS) phase optimization method, which is referred to as FEMI-DSInSAR in the text. We applied the FEMI-DSInSAR to retrieve the deformation history of landslides along a similar to 100 km section of the Lancang River using 33 C-band Sentinel-1 images (January 2019-January 2022). The accuracy and reliability were validated by comparing the results with those obtained with EMI-DSInSAR and Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers-Small Baseline Subset (StaMPS-SBAS) methods in terms of both interferogram quality and large-area deformation results. The differential interferograms obtained by the FEMI-DSInSAR method not only show better quality fringes, but also reduce the sum of phase difference (SPD) and the standard deviation of the phase (PSD) values by 8.9% and 25.2%, respectively. Moreover, the FEMI-DSInSAR method yields the most significant number of MPs under various geomorphic regions and achieves reliable surface displacements, compared to 10 in situ GPS measurements. Finally, we projected the FEMI-DSInSAR-derived line of sight (LOS) deformation results onto the slope direction and successfully identified 4 previously mapped and 46 newly detected unstable slopes. The characteristics of whole-area landslide deformation characteristics and the influencing factors were analyzed.

TI  - Prediction of summer daytime land surface temperature in urban environments based on machine learning
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an important indicator of urban heat environments and can be largely influenced by the morphology factors of cities. However, previous studies mainly focus on large-scale and coarse-grained forecast modeling, making it hard to inform architects and urban designers without the advantage of quick, fine-grained prediction and visualization. The paper uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to address this gap by proposing a prediction model of city plans and corresponding LST heat maps. Taking New York City as an example, we use the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, Landsat Surface Temperature data, and other relevant data to build seven hundred image pairs as the training set to train the model of predicting LST distribution. Using untrained pairs as the test set, the model can generate LST maps relatively quickly and accurately with the input of city plans. Then after accuracy analysis, different scenarios are simulated to test the application of the model in predicting the environmental impacts of plan modifications on land surface temperature. Eventually, the principles proposed in this paper can be applied to the development of relevant interactive design and planning tools in the future.

TI  - Formulation of the cosmic ray-driven electron-induced reaction mechanism for quantitative understanding of global ozone depletion
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper formulates the cosmic ray-driven electron-induced reaction as a universal mechanism to provide a quantitative understanding of global ozone depletion. Based on a proposed electrostatic bonding mechanism for charge-induced adsorption of molecules on surfaces and on the measured dissociative electron transfer (DET) cross sections of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) adsorbed on ice, an analytical equation is derived to give atmospheric chlorine atom concentration: [Cl] = Sigma(k)i theta(i)(ODS) Phi(2)(e), where Phi(e) is the prehydrated electron (e(pre)(-)) flux produced by cosmic ray ionization on atmospheric particle surfaces, theta(i)(ODS) is the surface coverage of an ODS, and k(i) is the ODS's effective DET coefficient that is the product of the DET cross section, the lifetimes of surface-trapped e(pre)(-) and Cl-, and the particle surface area density. With concentrations of ODSs as the sole variable, our calculated results of time-series ozone depletion rates in global regions in the 1960s, 1980s, and 2000s show generally good agreement with observations, particularly with ground-based ozonesonde data and satellite-measured data over Antarctica and with satellite data in a narrow altitude band at 13 to 20 km of the tropics. Good agreements with satellite data in the Arctic and midlatitudes are also found. A previously unreported effect of denitrification on ozone loss is found and expressed quantitatively. But this equation overestimates tropospheric ozone loss at northern mid-latitudes and the Arctic, likely due to increased ozone production by the halogen chemistry in polluted regions. The results render confidence in applying the equation to achieve a quantitative understanding of global ozone depletion.

TI  - Wall-to-wall mapping of carbon loss within the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone after the 2020 catastrophic wildfire
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Key messageWe propose a framework to derive the direct loss of aboveground carbon stocks after the 2020 wildfire in forests of the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone using optical and radar Sentinel satellite data. Carbon stocks were adequately predicted using stand-wise inventory data and local combustion factors where new field observations are impossible. Both the standalone Sentinel-1 backscatter delta (before and after fire) indicator and radar-based change model reliably predicted the associated carbon loss.ContextThe Chornobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) is a mosaic forest landscape undergoing dynamic natural disturbances. Local forests are mostly planted and have low ecosystem resilience against the negative impact of global climate and land use change. Carbon stock fluxes after wildfires in the area have not yet been quantified. However, the assessment of this and other ecosystem service flows is crucial in contaminated (both radioactively and by unexploded ordnance) landscapes of the CEZ.AimsThe aim of this study was to estimate carbon stock losses resulting from the catastrophic 2020 fires in the CEZ using satellite data, as field visitations or aerial surveys are impossible due to the ongoing war.MethodsThe aboveground carbon stock was predicted in a wall-to-wall manner using random forest modelling based on Sentinel data (both optical and synthetic aperture radar or SAR). We modelled the carbon stock loss using the change in Sentinel-1 backscatter before and after the fire events and local combustion factors.ResultsRandom forest models performed well (root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 22.6 MgC & BULL;ha(-1) or 37% of the mean) to predict the pre-fire carbon stock. The modelled carbon loss was estimated to be 156.3 Gg C (9.8% of the carbon stock in burned forests or 1.5% at the CEZ level). The standalone SAR backscatter delta showed a higher RMSE than the modelled estimate but better systematic agreement (0.90 vs. 0.73). Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)-dominated stands contributed the most to carbon stock loss, with 74% of forests burned in 2020.ConclusionThe change in SAR backscatter before and after a fire event can be used as a rough proxy indicator of aboveground carbon stock loss for timely carbon map updating. The model using SAR backscatter change and backscatter values prior to wildfire is able to reliably estimate carbon emissions when on-ground monitoring is impossible.

TI  - Novel Dual Tracer Indocyanine Green and Radioisotope Versus Gold Standard Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: The GREENORBLUE Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background. The methods for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in breast cancer have been variable in type and number of tracers. Some units have abandoned the use of blue dye (BD) due to adverse reactions. Fluorescence-guided biopsy with indocyanine green (ICG) is a relatively novel technique. This study compared the clinical efficacy and costs between novel dual tracer ICG and radioisotope (ICG-RI) with "gold standard" BD and radioisotope (BD-RI).Methods. Single-surgeon study of 150 prospective patients with early breast cancer undergoing SLN biopsy (2021-2022) using ICG-RI compared with a retrospective cohort of 150 consecutive previous patients using BD-RI. Number of SLNs identified, rate of failed mapping, identification of metastatic SLNs, and adverse reactions were compared between techniques. Cost-minimisation analysis performed by using Medicare item numbers and micro-costing analysis.Results. Total number of SLNs identified with ICG-RI and BD-RI was 351 and 315, respectively. Mean number of SLNs identified with ICG-RI and BD-RI was 2.3 (standard deviation [SD] 1.4) and 2.1 (SD 1.1), respectively (p = 0.156). There were no cases of failed mapping with either dual technique. Metastatic SLNs were identified in 38 (25.3%) ICG-RI patients compared with 30 (20%) BD-RI patients (p = 0.641). There were no adverse reactions to ICG, whereas four cases of skin tattooing and anaphylaxis were associated with BD (p = 0.131). ICG-RI cost an additional AU$197.38 per case in addition to the initial cost for the imaging system. Clinical trial registration: ACTRN12621001033831.Conclusions. Novel tracer combination, ICG-RI, provided an effective and safe alternative to "gold standard" dual tracer. The caveat was the significantly greater costs associated with ICG.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The adjoining Luengue-Luiana and Mavinga national parks in southeastern Angola are two of the largest though least actively managed protected areas in Africa. The parks are home to a diversity of wildlife and are managed as a single unit. The area is characterised as a fire-dependent savanna, where fires may be naturally ignited (such as by lightning), but where the fires each year are frequently set by people. As a result of the lack of resource investment, uncontrolled fires dominate the region, potentially negatively affecting biodiversity. The past fire regimes (2001-2021) of the two parks were investigated with use of the MODIS and VIIRS remote-sensing instrument. Extremely short fire return intervals dominated the landscape, with almost half (47.8%) of the area experiencing a subsequent fire within a year of the previous fire, and an additional 30% of the area burning within two years after a preceding fire. Only 2.4% of the landscape was shown to remain fire-free for a period of ten years or more. Overall, the fire intensities were highest from August to October, with the largest areas burnt between August and September. Fire frequency, seasonality and intensity were influenced by the land-cover type, and a comparison of the different satellite products was made. This information is the first of its kind for the region and is intended to provide a basis from which fire management activities can be coordinated.

TI  - Nowcasting from space: tropical cyclones' impacts on Fiji's agriculture
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based disaster damage assessments typically take the form of a team of experts being sent to the affected areas to conduct a survey. This approach is time-consuming, difficult, and costly. An alternative to this is an assessment based on satellite data, which can provide faster, cheaper, and possibly accurate insights into disaster's specific impacts. An even timelier option of disaster 'nowcasting' is supposed to inform on impacts during or very shortly after the event. Typically, this has been done using risk models, but these usually do not account for compounding and cascading effects. We propose a novel nowcasting approach for tropical cyclones employing pre-existing socio-economic and demographic data and calibrated with satellite data. The method could be used to assess cyclone impacts based only on its known trajectory, and even before post-event satellite imagery is available. We investigate the feasibility of this approach focusing on Fiji and its agricultural sector. We link remote sensing data with available household surveys and the agricultural census data to identify potential correlates of vegetation damage from cyclones. If robust enough, these correlates could later be used for nowcasting cyclone impacts. We show that remote sensing data, when combined with pre-event socio-economic and demographic data, can be used for both nowcasting and post-disaster damage assessments.

TI  - Coupling SWAT and DPSIR models for groundwater management in Mediterranean catchments
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is an essential natural resource and has a significant role in human and environmental health as well as in the economy. Management of subsurface storage remains an important option to meet the combined demands of humans and ecosystems. The increasing need to find multi-purpose solutions to address water scarcity is a global challenge. Thus, the interactions leading to surface runoff and groundwater recharge have received particular attention over the last decades. Additionally, new methods are developed to incorporate the spatial-temporal variation of recharge in groundwater modeling. In this study, groundwater recharge was spatiotemporally quantified using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in the Upper Volturno-Calore hydrological basin in Italy and the results were compared with other two basins in Greece (Anthemountas and Mouriki). SWAT model was applied in actual and future projections (2022-2040) using the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 emissions scenario to evaluate changes in precipitation and assess the future hydrologic conditions, along with, the Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework that was applied in all the basins as a low-cost analysis of integrated physical, social, natural, and economic factors. According to the results, no significant variations in runoff are predicted in the Upper Volturno-Calore basin for the period 2020-2040 while the potential evapotranspiration percentage varies from 50.1% to 74.3% and infiltration around 5%. The limited primary data constitutes the main pressure in all sites and exaggerates the uncertainty of future projections.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of invasive alien plants (IAPs) is important for developing informed initiatives to assist environmentalists in managing the spread and impacts of IAPs. The Prosopis plant species is an aggressive IAP that has been considered a scourge in different regions of the globe. The aim of this study is to map the spatial distribution of the invasive alien Prosopis plant in southwestern Botswana using the higher spatial and spectral resolution Sentinel-2A (S2A) MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) satellite sensor data. Supervised parametric maximum likelihood classification (MLC) was compared with the nonparametric Random Forest (RF) classifier for the detection and mapping of the Prosopis using 10 m S2A sensor bands, integrated with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and Sentinel Improved Vegetation Index (SVI). Using S2A, S2A and NDVI, and S2A and SVI, MLC mapped the land use/land cover (LULC) in the study area with respective accuracies of 71.5%, 66.5%, and 79.9%, while RF mapped the LULC with accuracies of 93.2%, 77.3%, and 95.6%. Using RF, S2A multispectral data and the red edge wavelength-based SVI were found to be more suitable for mapping the distribution of Prosopis with classification accuracy of 18.3% higher than for NDVI. The study findings can be used by environmentalists, policy, and decision makers in the context of mapping, monitoring, and management of the invasive Prosopis.

TI  - Switching patterns of immediate-release forms of generic mixed amphetamine salts products among privately and publicly insured individuals aged 15-64 years in the United States, 2013-2019
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeImmediate-release forms of generic mixed amphetamine salts (MAS) have been the subject of passive surveillance reports signaling lack of effectiveness. We examined switching patterns that might suggest whether long-term users of specific MAS are more likely to switch away or switch back after use of the MAS of interest in the FDA's Sentinel Distributed Database. MethodsWe required at least 60-day continuous supply of selected MAS grouped by Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to describe patterns of switching away from and to generics approved under the ANDAs of interest among individuals ages 15-64 years with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or narcolepsy during 2013-2019. ResultsWe observed the greatest number of treatment episodes for ANDA 040422 (n = 525 771), followed by ANDA 202424 (n = 181 693), ANDA 040439 (n = 62 363), ANDA 040440 (n = 21 143), and ANDA 040480 (n = 8792). Of those with switches away from their original ANDA, episodes initiated on generic products under ANDA 040422 (48.6%) and ANDA 202424 (43.0%) were most likely to switch back, while those initiated on generic product under ANDA 040480 were least likely (24.1%). Of those episodes with switches to a generic under an ANDA of interest, about one-third (range 27.1% to 37.0%) switched back to the same product. These switches back had a median time to switch of about 30 days. ConclusionsThese descriptive analyses, although subject to limitations, did not suggest increased switching away or switching back after use of the generics of interest. Continued post-marketing surveillance is warranted.

AB  - Riparian systems across the Southwest United States are extremely valuable for the human and ecological communities that engage with them. However, they have experienced substantial changes and stresses over the past century, including non-native vegetation expansion, vegetation die-offs, and increased fire activity. Vegetation management approaches, such as ecological restoration, may address some of these stressors as well as reduce the risk of future impacts. We apply remote sensing to inform restoration priorities along the upper Gila River within the San Carlos Apache Reservation and Upper Gila River watershed. First, we develop a spatially and temporally explicit trend analysis across three observed climate periods (1985-1993, 1993-2014, 2014-2021) using the Landsat-derived indices to quantify changes in riparian vegetation conditions. These maps can be used to identify areas potentially more at risk for degradation. Second, we analyze changes in riparian vegetation within a climate framework to better understand trends and the potential effect of climate change. Vegetation greenness has largely increased throughout the watershed despite intensifying drought conditions across our study period, though areas within the lower watershed have shown increased stress and higher rates of wildfire and other disturbances over the past 5-years. Nevertheless, small-scale restoration activities appear to show improving vegetation conditions, suggesting efficacy of these restoration activities. Results from this study may be integrated with restoration objectives to develop a restoration plan that will help riparian vegetation communities adapt to change.

AB  - This paper evaluates the degrees of freedom and complexity warranted in temperature-index models to jointly simulate local snow measurements, remotely-sensed snow cover and runoff in mountainous areas. To address this issue, the snow- and ice-accounting routine (SIAR) on top of the GR4J model was developed on a dataset covering 17 mountainous catchments (45 to 3580 km2) in the French Alps and Pyrenees. Model calibration and control were based on streamflow series, fractional snow cover (FSC) computed from MODIS snow products and at least one chronicle of local measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) acquired in each catchment for the period 2004-2016. SIAR was applied according to an adaptable number of elevation bands and different parametrizations ranging from 11 free parameters (precipitation orographic correction, temperature lapse rate, variation in the temperature lapse rate, snowfall adjustment, rainfall lapse rate, thermal inertia of the snow pack, constant and variable part of the degree-day snow melt factor, degree-day ice melt factor, 2-parameter hysteresis between SWE and FSC), to only fixed parameters. Results showed that the one-free-parameter SIAR is as efficient as more parametrized versions in simulating both local and distributed snow dynamics as well as runoff. Interestingly, using SIAR without any free parameters by fixing the snowfall adjustment to a median value of 60% only led to slight impairment of local SWE dynamics. Certain processes represented in SIAR (glaciercomponent, sublimation, simple energy balance, snowpack cold-content, variable melt factor) were then alternatively turned off to justify those retained in its final version. The modeling performances were also compared by applying SIAR with different distribution options ranging from full distribution according to 0.25 km2 cells to lumped mode. A number of equal-area elevation bands according to the catchment hypsometry proved to be a good compromise as it allowed snow and runoff simulations of similar accuracy to the full distribution mode, while limiting computational time. Finally, SIAR was compared with the Cemaneige snow routine, which showed its modeling performance was better. These findings suggest that it is possible, and even advisable, to limit the number of free parameters in temperature-index models in order to reduce problems of over-parameterization and equifinality.

TI  - Patriarchal Populism: The Conservative Political Action Coalition (CPAC) and the Transnational Politics of Authoritarian Anti-Feminism
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SPECTATOR
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, populist movements and regimes have proliferated around the world, pledging to uphold the interests of the 'pure people' against corrupt 'elites.' Among right-wing populists, 'globalists' and feminists are cast in the latter role, framed as dangerous threats to the restoration of national greatness. Meanwhile, alleged 'gender ideology' is rebuked, while women's reproductive and LGBTQ equality rights are legally curtailed. We examine the convergence of populism and anti-feminism within the framework of patriarchal populism, analysing how proponents of this worldview coordinate across borders. To illustrate these trends, we focus on meetings of the Conservative Political Action Coalition (CPAC), a large and influential gathering begun in the United States (US) and increasingly dominated by the far-right, which is rapidly internationalising. Observing political discourse at CPAC Hungary and Texas in 2022, we identify common themes including advocacy of transnational right-wing coalitions, fearmongering about threats to the West, calls to control education and knowledge production, and bellicose advocacy of illiberal strongman leadership. Anti-feminism is woven throughout these frames, positioning right-wing populism as a significant challenge to women's and LGBTQ rights in the US and elsewhere.

TI  - NDVI-based spatial and temporal vegetation trends and their response to precipitation and temperature changes in the Mu Us Desert from 2000 to 2019
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the relationship between normalized vegetation index (NDVI) response to rainfall and temperature conditions by analyzing the spatial and temporal variation of vegetation cover (NDVI) in Mu Us Desert during 2000-2019. Based on MODIS remote sensing data, the NDVI of Mu Us Desert sandy land from 2000 to 2019 was analyzed by using the linear regression slope method. In 2000-2010 and 2010-2019, there was a difference in the change rate of vegetation index in Mu Us Desert, with the average slope of 0.0650/10a for the former and 0.0782/10a for the latter. In the northwestern and central parts of the Muus Desert, vegetation cover changed less, and the area of the study area with a significant decrease in vegetation cover was very sparse. The trends of NDVI values in the study area during 2000-2019 were roughly the same as those of precipitation, and slightly different from those of temperature, but the overall correlation between NDVI values and both was good. There is a significant positive correlation between NDVI and annual precipitation (0.687), and a weak correlation with temperature (0.264). The vegetation growth in Mu Us Desert is affected by both rainfall and temperature.

TI  - Comparative study on epidemiological and etiological characteristics of patients with acute diarrhea with febrile or non-febrile symptoms in China
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Acute diarrhea with fever can potentially represent a more severe form of the disease compared to non-febrile diarrhea. This study was to investigate the epidemiological characteristics and enteric pathogen composition of febrile-diarrheal patients, and to explore factors including pathogens associated with fever by age group.Methods A nationwide surveillance study of acute diarrheal patients of all ages was conducted in 217 sentinel hospitals from 31 provinces (autonomous regions or municipalities) in China between 2011 and 2020. Seventeen diarrhearelated pathogens, including seven viruses and ten bacteria, were investigated and their association with occurrence of fever symptoms was assessed using multivariate logistic analysis.Results A total of 146,296 patients with acute diarrhea (18.6% with fever) were tested. Th diarrheal children below 5 years had the highest frequency of fever (24.2%), and related to significantly higher prevalence of viral enteropathogens (40.2%) as compared with other age groups (P < 0.001). Within each age group, the febrile-diarrheal patients were associated with a significantly higher prevalence of bacterial pathogens than afebrile-diarrheal patients (all P < 0.01). There was discrepancy when each pathogen was compared, i.e., nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) was overrepresented in febrile vs non-febrile patients of all age groups, while the febrile vs non-febrile difference for diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) was only significant for adult groups. The multivariate analysis revealed significant association between fever and infection with rotavirus A among children [odds ratio (OR) = 1.60], for DEC in adult groups (OR = 1.64), for NTS in both children (OR = 2.95) and adults (OR = 3.59).Conclusions There are significant discrepancy of the infected enteric pathogens in patients with acute diarrhea with fever between age groups, and it is valuable for priority detection of NTS and rotavirus A in patients with children <5 years old and NTS and DEC in adult patients. The results may be useful in identifying dominant pathogen candidates for the application of diagnostic assays and prevention control.
