TI  - Combining airborne laser scanning and Landsat data for statistical modeling of soil carbon and tree biomass in Tanzanian Miombo woodlands
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Soil carbon and biomass depletion can be used to identify and quantify degraded soils, and by using remote sensing, there is potential to map soil conditions over large areas. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager satellite data and airborne laser scanning data were evaluated separately and in combination for model ing soil organic carbon, above ground tree biomass and below ground tree biomass. The test site is situated in the Liwale district in southeastern Tanzania and is dominated by Miombo woodlands. Tree data from 15 m radius field-surveyed plots and samples of soil carbon down to a depth of 30 cm were used as reference data for tree biomass and soil carbon estimations.Results: Cross-validated plot level error (RMSE) for predicting soil organic carbon was 28% using only Landsat 8,26% using laser only, and 23% for the combination of the two. The plot level error for above ground tree biomass was 66% when using only Landsat 8,50% for laser and 49% for the combination of Landsat 8 and laser data. Results for below ground tree biomass were similar to above ground biomass. Additionally it was found that an early dry season satellite image was preferable for modelling biomass while images from later in the dry season were better for modelling soil carbon.Conclusion: The results show that laser data is superior to Landsat 8 when predicting both soil carbon and biomass above and below ground in landscapes dominated by Miombo woodlands. Furthermore, the combination of laser data and Landsat data were marginally better than using laser data only.

TI  - Polarization-based enhancement of ocean color signal for estimating suspended particulate matter: radiative transfer simulations and laboratory measurements
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Absorption and scattering by molecules, aerosols and hydrosols, and the reflection and transmission over the sea surface can modify the original polarization state of sunlight. However, water-leaving radiance polarization, containing embedded water constituent information, has largely been neglected. Here, the efficiency of the parallel polarization radiance (PPR) for enhancing ocean color signal of suspended particulate matter is examined via vector radiative transfer simulations and laboratory experiments. The simulation results demonstrate that the PPR has a slightly higher ocean color signal at the top-of-atmosphere as compared with that of the total radiance. Moreover, both the simulations and laboratory measurements reveal that, compared with total radiance, PPR can effectively enhance the normalized ocean color signal for a large range of observation geometries, wavelengths, and suspended particle concentrations. Thus, PPR has great potential for improving the ocean color signal detection from satellite. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

TI  - A hyper-temporal remote sensing protocol for high-resolution mapping of ecological sites
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological site classification has emerged as a highly effective land management framework, but its utility at a regional scale has been limited due to the spatial ambiguity of ecological site locations in the U. S. or the absence of ecological site maps in other regions of the world. In response to these shortcomings, this study evaluated the use of hyper-temporal remote sensing (i. e., hundreds of images) for high spatial resolution mapping of ecological sites. We posit that hyper-temporal remote sensing can provide novel insights into the spatial variability of ecological sites by quantifying the temporal response of land surface spectral properties. This temporal response provides a spectral `fingerprint' of the soil-vegetation- climate relationship which is central to the concept of ecological sites. Consequently, the main objective of this study was to predict the spatial distribution of ecological sites in a semi-arid rangeland using a 28-year time series of normalized difference vegetation index from Landsat TM 5 data and modeled using support vector machine classification. Results from this study show that support vector machine classification using hyper-temporal remote sensing imagery was effective in modeling ecological site classes, with a 62% correct classification. These results were compared to Gridded Soil Survey Geographic database and expert delineated maps of ecological sites which had a 51 and 89% correct classification, respectively. An analysis of the effects of ecological state on ecological site misclassifications revealed that sites in degraded states (e. g., shrub-dominated/shrubland and bare/annuals) had a higher rate of misclassification due to their close spectral similarity with other ecological sites. This study identified three important factors that need to be addressed to improve future model predictions: 1) sampling designs need to fully represent the range of both within class (i. e., states) and between class (i. e., ecological sites) spectral variability through time, 2) field sampling protocols that accurately characterize key soil properties (e. g., texture, depth) need to be adopted, and 3) additional environmental covariates (e. g. terrain attributes) need to be evaluated that may help further differentiate sites with similar spectral signals. Finally, the proposed hyper-temporal remote sensing framework may provide a standardized approach to evaluate and test our ecological site concepts through examining differences in vegetation dynamics in response to climatic variability and other drivers of land-use change. Results from this study demonstrate the efficacy of the hyper-temporal remote sensing approach for high resolution mapping of ecological sites, (a)nd highlights its utility in terms of reduced cost and time investment relative to traditional manual mapping approaches.

TI  - Current remote sensing approaches to monitoring forest degradation in support of countries measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) systems for REDD
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Forest degradation is a global phenomenon and while being an important indicator and precursor to further forest loss, carbon emissions due to degradation should also be accounted for in national reporting within the frame of UN REDD+. At regional to country scales, methods have been progressively developed to detect and map forest degradation, with these based on multi-resolution optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and/or LiDAR data. However, there is no one single method that can be applied to monitor forest degradation, largely due to the specific nature of the degradation type or process and the timeframe over which it is observed. The review assesses two main approaches to monitoring forest degradation: first, where detection is indicated by a change in canopy cover or proxies, and second, the quantification of loss (or gain) in above ground biomass (AGB). The discussion only considers degradation that has a visible impact on the forest canopy and is thus detectable by remote sensing. The first approach encompasses methods that characterise the type of degradation and track disturbance, detect gaps in, and fragmentation of, the forest canopy, and proxies that provide evidence of forestry activity. Progress in these topics has seen the extension of methods to higher resolution (both spatial and temporal) data to better capture the disturbance signal, distinguish degraded and intact forest, and monitor regrowth. Improvements in the reliability of mapping methods are anticipated by SAR-optical data fusion and use of very high resolution data. The second approach exploits EO sensors with known sensitivity to forest structure and biomass and discusses monitoring efforts using repeat LiDAR and SAR data. There has been progress in the capacity to discriminate forest age and growth stage using data fusion methods and LiDAR height metrics. Interferometric SAR and LiDAR have found new application in linking forest structure change to degradation in tropical forests. Estimates of AGB change have been demonstrated at national level using SAR and LiDAR-assisted approaches. Future improvements are anticipated with the availability of next generation LiDAR sensors. Improved access to relevant satellite data and best available methods are key to operational forest degradation monitoring. Countries will need to prioritise their monitoring efforts depending on the significance of the degradation, balanced against available resources. A better understanding of the drivers and impacts of degradation will help guide monitoring and restoration efforts. Ultimately we want to restore ecosystem service and function in degraded forests before the change is irreversible.

TI  - Measurement of a Cosmographic Distance Ratio with Galaxy and Cosmic Microwave Background Lensing
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We measure the gravitational lensing shear signal around dark matter halos hosting constant mass galaxies using light sources at z similar to 1 (background galaxies) and at the surface of last scattering at z similar to 1100 (the cosmic microwave background). The galaxy shear measurement uses data from the CFHTLenS survey, and the microwave background shear measurement uses data from the Planck satellite. The ratio of shears from these cross-correlations provides a purely geometric distance measurement across the longest possible cosmological lever arm. This is because the matter distribution around the halos, including uncertainties in galaxy bias and systematic errors such as miscentering, cancels in the ratio for halos in thin redshift slices. We measure this distance ratio in three different redshift slices of the constant mass (CMASS) sample and combine them to obtain a 17% measurement of the distance ratio, r = 0.390(-0.062)(+0.070), at an effective redshift of z = 0.53. This is consistent with the predicted ratio from the Planck best-fit cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant cosmology of r = 0.419.

TI  - Variability of apparent and inherent optical properties of sediment-laden waters in large river basins - lessons from in situ measurements and bio-optical modeling
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the relationships between inherent and apparent optical properties (IOP and AOP, respectively) and suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in the main Amazonian river waters. In situ measurements of SSC, remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), the diffuse light attenuation coefficient (K-d) and the total and non-algal particle (NAP) absorption coefficients (a(TOT) and a(NAP), respectively) were conducted during three sampling trips along different streams of the Amazon River catchment (104 stations). The size distribution and chemical characteristics of the suspended sediment were also determined for 85 stations. We show that the particle size distribution (PSD) in the river water is best described by a segmented Junge power law distribution with a smaller slope value for the smallest particles (J(1) = 2.4) and a larger slope value (J(2) = 4.1) for the largest particles (> 10 mu m). A strong relationship was found between AOPs and IOPs and SSC when the entire data set was considered. However, for the Madeira River, the primary Amazon River tributary in terms of suspended sediment discharge, a significant dispersion was detected for the R-rs - SSC relationship but not for the d K-d - SSC relationship. This dispersion has been shown by a previous study, using MODIS data, to display a seasonal pattern, which we investigated in this study using Mie modeling calibrated with suspended sediment characteristics. In the Madeira River, suspended sediment had a finer distribution size and a different mineralogy (e.g., a greater smectite content and a lower kaolinite content) during the rising water stage. Spectral variations of the imaginary part n' (lambda) of the refraction index also showed significant differences during the rising water stage. In contrast, other streams of the Amazon basin had very stable properties with respect to granulometry and mineralogy. Model simulations made possible to reproduce both field and satellite observations, showing that the R-rs hysteresis observed in the Madeira River in the near infrared was mainly due to n' (lambda) seasonal variations, leading to a decrease of absorption during the rising water stage. K-d was shown to remain stable because of its strong dependency on scattering processes. The model was used to further understand how suspended sediment size distribution and refraction index drive the IOPs in large rivers: n' (lambda) variations were shown to control primarily the reflectance variability; R-rs (850) presented limited variations as a function of PSD in the range typical of large rivers (J(1) < 3) although it remained sensitive to particle mineralogical composition; R-rs (670) showed the opposite behavior with a higher sensitivity to PSD variation for coarser PSD. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of the R-rs ratio between the red and infrared channels allowed a reduction of the R-rs sensitivity in all cases, by an average of 50% with respect to changes in the mineral composition or size distribution of suspended sediment. In particular, the R-rs ratio varied by less than 5% for PSD representative of surface river waters. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

TI  - A large airborne survey of Earth's visible-infrared spectral dimensionality
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The intrinsic spectral dimensionality indicates the observable degrees of freedom in Earth's solar-reflected light field, quantifying the diversity of spectral content accessible by visible and infrared remote sensing. The solar-reflected regime spans the 0.38-2.5 mu m interval, and is captured by a wide range of current and planned instruments on both airborne and orbital platforms. To date there has been no systematic study of its spectral dimensionality as a function of space, time, and land cover. Here we report a multi-site, multi-year statistical survey by NASA's "Classic" Airborne Visible Near InfraRed Spectrometer (AVIRIS-C). AVIRIS-C measured large regions of California, USA, spanning wide latitudinal and elevation gradients containing all canonical MODIS land cover types. The spectral uniformity of the AVIRIS-C design enabled consistent in-scene assessment of measurement noise across acquisitions. The estimated dimensionality as a function of cover type ranged from the low 20s to the high 40s, and was approximately 50 for the combined dataset. This result indicates the high diversity of physical processes distinguishable by imaging spectrometers like AVIRIS-C for one region of the Earth. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

TI  - Effects of UV-B radiation on leaf hair traits of invasive plants-Combining historical herbarium records with novel remote sensing data
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation is a key but under-researched environmental factor that initiates diverse responses in plants, potentially affecting their distribution. To date, only a few macroecological studies have examined adaptations of plant species to different levels of UV-B. Here, we combined herbarium specimens of Hieracium pilosella L. and Echium vulgare L. with a novel UV-B dataset to examine differences in leaf hair traits between the plants' native and alien ranges. We analysed scans of 336 herbarium specimens using standardized measurements of leaf area, hair density (both species) and hair length (H. pilosella only). While accounting for other bioclimatic variables (i.e. temperature, precipitation) and effects of herbivory, we examined whether UV-B exposure explains the variability and geographical distribution of these traits in the native (Northern Hemisphere) vs. the alien (Southern Hemisphere) range. UV-B explained the largest proportion of the variability and geographical distribution of hair length in H. pilosella (relative influence 67.1%), and hair density in E. vulgare (66.2%). Corresponding with higher UV-B, foliar hairs were 25% longer for H. pilosella and 25% denser for E. vulgare in records from the Southern as compared to those from the Northern Hemisphere. However, focusing on each hemisphere separately or controlling for its effect in a regression analysis, we found no apparent influence of UV-B radiation on hair traits. Thus, our findings did not confirm previous experimental studies which suggested that foliar hairs may respond to higher UV-B intensities, presumably offering protection against detrimental levels of radiation. We cannot rule out UV-B radiation as a possible driver because UV-B radiation was the only considered variable that differed substantially between the hemispheres, while bioclimatic conditions (e.g. temperature, precipitation) and other considered variables (herbivory damage, collection date) were at similar levels. However, given that either non-significant or inconclusive relationships were detected within hemispheres, alternative explanations of the differences in foliar hairs are more likely, including the effects of environment, genotypes or herbivory.

TI  - Observational insights into chlorophyll distributions of subtropical South Indian Ocean eddies
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The South Indian Ocean subtropical gyre has been described as a unique environment where anticyclonic ocean eddies highlight enhanced surface chlorophyll in winter. The processes responsible for this chlorophyll increase in anticyclones have remained elusive, primarily because previous studies investigating this unusual behavior were mostly based on satellite data, which only views the ocean surface. Here we present in situ data from an oceanographic voyage focusing on the mesoscale variability of biogeochemical variables across the subtropical gyre. During this voyage an autonomous biogeochemical profiling float transected an anticyclonic eddy, recording its physical and biological state over a period of 6weeks. We show that several processes might be responsible for the eddy/chlorophyll relationship, including horizontal advection of productive waters and deeper convective mixing in anticyclonic eddies. While a deep chlorophyll maximum is present in the subtropical Indian Ocean outside anticyclonic eddies, mixing reaches deeper in anticyclonic eddy cores, resulting in increased surface chlorophyll due to the stirring of the deep chlorophyll maximum and possibly resulting in new production from nitrate injection below the deep chlorophyll maximum.

TI  - Reducing multisensor monthly mean aerosol optical depth uncertainty: 2. Optimal locations for potential ground observation deployments
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface remote sensing of aerosol properties provides ground truth for satellite and model validation and is an important component of aerosol observation system. Due to the different characteristics of background aerosol variability, information obtained at different locations usually has different spatial representativeness, implying that the location should be carefully chosen so that its measurement could be extended to a greater area. In this study, we present an objective observation array design technique that automatically determines the optimal locations with the highest spatial representativeness based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) theory. The ensemble is constructed using aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from five satellite sensors. The optimal locations are solved sequentially by minimizing the total analysis error variance, which means that observations at these locations will reduce the background error variance to the largest extent. The location determined by the algorithm is further verified to have larger spatial representativeness than some other arbitrary location. In addition to the existing active Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites, the 40 selected optimal locations are mostly concentrated on regions with both high AOD inhomogeneity and its spatial representativeness, namely, the Sahel, South Africa, East Asia, and North Pacific Islands. These places should be the focuses of establishing future AERONET sites in order to further reduce the uncertainty in the monthly mean AOD. Observations at these locations contribute to approximately 50% of the total background uncertainty reduction.

TI  - Daily estimates of the migrating tide and zonal mean temperature in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere derived from SABER data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites provide a global view of the structure in the fields that they measure. In the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, the dominant features in these fields at low zonal wave number are contained in the zonal mean, quasi-stationary planetary waves, and tide components. Due to the nature of the satellite sampling pattern, stationary, diurnal, and semidiurnal components are aliased and spectral methods are typically unable to separate the aliased waves over short time periods. This paper presents a data processing scheme that is able to recover the daily structure of these waves and the zonal mean state. The method is validated by using simulated data constructed from a mechanistic model, and then applied to Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) temperature measurements. The migrating diurnal tide extracted from SABER temperatures for 2009 has a seasonal variability with peak amplitude (20K at 95km) in February and March and minimum amplitude (less than 5K at 95km) in early June and early December. Higher frequency variability includes a change in vertical structure and amplitude during the major stratospheric warming in January. The migrating semidiurnal tide extracted from SABER has variability on a monthly time scale during January through March, minimum amplitude in April, and largest steady amplitudes from May through September. Modeling experiments were performed that show that much of the variability on seasonal time scales in the migrating tides is due to changes in the mean flow structure and the superposition of the tidal responses to water vapor heating in the troposphere and ozone heating in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere.

TI  - Predicting <i>Sargassum</i> blooms in the Caribbean Sea from MODIS observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recurrent and significant Sargassum beaching events in the Caribbean Sea (CS) have caused serious environmental and economic problems, calling for a long-term prediction capacity of Sargassum blooms. Here we present predictions based on a hindcast of 2000-2016 observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which showed Sargassum abundance in the CS and the Central West Atlantic (CWA), as well as connectivity between the two regions with time lags. This information was used to derive bloom and nonbloom probability matrices for each 1 degrees square in the CS for the months of May-August, predicted from bloom conditions in a hotspot region in the CWA in February. A suite of standard statistical measures were used to gauge the prediction accuracy, among which the user's accuracy and kappa statistics showed high fidelity of the probability maps in predicting both blooms and nonblooms in the eastern CS with several months of lead time, with overall accuracy often exceeding 80%. The bloom probability maps from this hindcast analysis will provide early warnings to better study Sargassum blooms and prepare for beaching events near the study region. This approach may also be extendable to many other regions around the world that face similar challenges and opportunities of macroalgal blooms and beaching events.Plain Language Summary Blooms of Sargassum seaweed appear to have increased in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean since 2011. These blooms provide important habitats for many marine animals (fish, turtles, shrimps, crabs, etc.) to maintain a healthy marine ecosystem, but large amounts of Sargassum deposition on the beaches have caused numerous problems to the local environment, tourism industry, and economy. There is currently little information on Sargassum distribution and bloom timing, not to mention a forecast system. In this work, based on satellite measurements and statistics, a forecast system has been developed for the Caribbean Sea. From this system, Sargassum blooms in May-August in the Caribbean can be predicted by the end of February, with overall accuracy often exceeding 80% in the eastern Caribbean. The system thus provides at least several months of lead time for the local residents and management agencies to better prepare for potential beaching events. The approach has significant implications for many other regions experiencing macroalgal blooms of either Sargassum or Ulva prolifera.

TI  - Specific leaf area estimation from leaf and canopy reflectance through optimization and validation of vegetation indices
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Specific leaf area (SLA), which is defined as the leaf area per unit of dry leaf mass is an important component when assessing functional diversity and plays a key role in ecosystem modeling, linking plant carbon and water cycles as well as quantifying plant physiological processes. However, studies of SLA variation across relevant spatial and temporal scales are lacking. While remote sensing is a fast and efficient approach to quantify vegetation parameters, there are insufficient studies estimating SLA from remotely sensed data. This article aims at finding efficient hyperspectral indices for fast and accurate estimation of SLA from leaf and canopy spectral measurements. Validation of our results with data measured at leaf and canopy scale as well as with experimental datasets simulated using PROSPECT (at leaf level) and INFORM (at canopy level) revealed SLA was predicted accurately by several indices, such as simple ratio and normalized index types. Most of the bands sensitive to SLA selected using these indices were in the 1300-1800 nm spectral region. At leaf level, a ratio index at bands1370 nm, 1615 nm performed strongly (R-2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 13.66 cm(2)/g) during cross-validation. The multiband indices with 920 nm, 1675 nm, 1335 nm and 1345 nm, 1675 nm, 1850 nm central wavelengths were also among the top performing indices, with R-2 > 0.90 for both measured and simulated leaf level data. At canopy level, the soil adjusted ratio vegetation index (with a band setting of 1537 nm, 1543 nm) showed that the hyperspectral data from HySpex airborne imagery accurately estimated SLA (R-2 = 0.88 and RMSE = 13.30 cm(2)/g). Generally at canopy level the potential indices for accurate retrieval of SLA from HySpex imagery were two-band indices with soil line information. The discrepancy observed in the performance and band combinations of vegetation indices at leaf and canopy scales can be explained by external factors such as canopy structure, soil background, illumination and sensor configuration which affect the signal when moving from leaf to canopy level. Our findings suggest the availability and suitability of a wide range of existing vegetation indices for assessing SLA accurately and rapidly from remotely sensed data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Altitudinal dynamics of glacial lakes under changing climate in the Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Himalaya ranges
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental challenges posed by global warming in the Himalayan region include early and rapid melting of snow and glaciers, creation of new lakes, and expansion of old ones posing a high risk of glacial lakes outburst flood (GLOF) hazard for downstream communities. According to various elevation ranges, 3044 lakes were analyzed basinwide in the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalaya (HKH) ranges of Pakistan using multisensor remote sensing data of the 2001-2013 period. An overall increase in glacial lakes was observed at various altitudinal ranges between 2500 and 5500, m out of which noticeable-change by number was within the 4000-4500 m range. The analysis carried out by glacial-fediakes and nonglacial-fed lakes in different river basins indicated variable patterns depending on the geographic location in the HKH region. The correlation analysis of parameters like lake area, expansion, rate, and elevation was performed with 617 glacial lakes distributed in various river basins of the three HKH ranges. Lake area (2013) and elevation showed a negative relationship for all basins except Hunza, Shigar, and Shyok. The correlation between the expansion rate of lakes and elevation was on the positive side for Swat, Gilgit, Shigar, and Shingo basins a situation that may be attributed to the variable altitudinal pattern of temperature and precipitation. In order to explore such diverse patterns of lake behavior and relationship with influential factors in the HKH, detailed studies based on using high resolution image data coupled with in situ information are a prerequisite. Although an increase in lake area observed below 3500 m would be favorable for water resource management, but could be alarming in context of glacial flood hazards that need to be monitored critically on a long-term basis.

TI  - Coral assemblages are structured along a turbidity gradient on the Southwestern Gulf of Mexico, Veracruz
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Corals on the reef corridor of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico have evolved on a terrigenous shallow continental shelf under the influence of several natural river systems. As a result, water turbidity on these reefs can be high, with visibility as low as < 1 m, depending on reef location and season. Using a presence-absence species database from field surveys, literature search, and satellite data on sea surface temperature, turbidity and chlorophyll-a, the coral species composition and environmental variables were analyzed for the three main reef systems of the reef corridor of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Completeness of the data set was assessed using species accumulation curves and non-parametric estimators of species richness. Differences in coral assemblages' composition between the reef systems were investigated using univariate (ANOVA) and multivariate (nMDS, ANOSIM, SIMPER) analyses and the relationship between the assemblages and environmental data was assessed.using a forward selection process in canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to eliminate non-significant environmental variables. The northern and central Veracruz reef systems share a similar number of coral species (p=0.78 mult. comp.) and both showed higher species richness than the southern system (p < 0.001 mult. comp.). In terms of the assemblages' structure, significant differences were found (ANOSIM R=0.3, p=0.001) with larger average dissimilitude between north-south (75.4% SIMPER) and central-south (74.2%) than north-central (27%) comparisons. Only environmental variables related to water turbidity and productivity were significant on the final CCA configuration, which showed a gradient of increasing turbidity from north to south. Reef geomorphology and the effect of turbidity help explain differences in coral assemblages' composition. More studies are necessary to establish if turbidity could function as a refuge for future environmental stress. Each Veracruz reef system is at the same time unique and shares a pool of coral species. To protect these ecosystems it is necessary to effectively manage water quality and consider coral diversity on the reef corridor of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.

TI  - Top-down approach from satellite to terrestrial rover application for environmental monitoring of landfills
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a methodology to perform chemical analyses in landfill areas by integrating multisource geomatic data. We used a top-down approach to identify Environmental Point of Interest (EPI) based on very high-resolution satellite data (Pleiades and WorldView 2) and on in situ thermal and photogrammetric surveys. Change detection techniques and geostatistical analysis supported the chemical survey, undertaken using an accumulation chamber and an RIIA, an unmanned ground vehicle developed by CNR IIA, equipped with a multiparameter sensor platform for environmental monitoring. Such an approach improves site characterization, identifying the key environmental points of interest where it is necessary to perform detailed chemical analyses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Recent slowdown and thinning of debris-covered glaciers in south-eastern Tibet
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent large-scale remote sensing studies have shown that glacier mass loss in south-eastern Tibet, specifically in the eastern Nyainqentanglha Range exceeds the average in High Asia. However, detailed studies at individual glaciers are scarce and the drivers behind the observed changes are poorly constrained to date. Employing feature tracking techniques on TerraSAR-X data for the periods 2008/2009, 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 we found measurable surface velocities through to the glacier terminus positions of five debris-covered glacier tongues. This is contrary to debris-covered glaciers in other parts of High Asia, where stagnant glacier tongues are common. Our feature tracking results for the 2013/2014 period suggest an average deceleration of 51% when compared with published Landsat velocities for the period 1999/2003. Further, we estimated surface elevation changes for the five glaciers from recently released one arc second resolution elevation data obtained during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission in 2000 and an interferometrical derived TanDEM-X elevation model for the year 2014. With an average rate of -0.83 +/- 0.57ma(-1) we confirm strong surface lowering in the region, despite the widely discussed insulation effect of debris cover. Beside the influence of thermokarst processes and delayed response times of debris-covered glaciers, we highlight that abundant monsoonal summer rainfall might contribute significantly to the pronounced negative mass balances in the study region.

TI  - NDVI, scale invariance and the modifiable areal unit problem: An assessment of vegetation in the Adelaide Parklands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research addresses the question as to whether or not the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is scale invariant (i.e. constant over spatial aggregation) for pure pixels of urban vegetation. It has been long recognized that there are issues related to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) pertaining to indices such as NDVI and images at varying spatial resolutions. These issues are relevant to using NDVI values in spatial analyses. We compare two different methods of calculation of a mean NDVI: 1) using pixel values of NDVI within feature/object boundaries and 2) first calculating the mean red and mean near-infrared across all feature pixels and then calculating NDVI. We explore the nature and magnitude of these differences for images taken from two sensors, a 1.24 m resolution WorldView-3 and a 0.1 m resolution digital aerial image. We apply these methods over an urban park located in the Adelaide Parklands of South Australia. We demonstrate that the MAUP is not an issue for calculation of NDVI within a sensor for pure urban vegetation pixels. This may prove useful for future rule-based monitoring of the ecosystem functioning of green infrastructure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Unsupervised change detection in a particular vegetation land cover type using spectral angle mapper
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new unsupervised change detection methodology for multispectral images applied to specific land covers. The proposed method involves comparing each image against a reference spectrum, where the reference spectrum is obtained from the spectral signature of the type of coverage you want to detect. In this case the method has been tested using multispectral images (SPOTS) of the community of Madrid (Spain), and multispectral images (Quickbird) of an area over Indonesia that was impacted by the December 26, 2004 tsunami; here, the tests have focused on the detection of changes in vegetation. The image comparison is obtained by applying Spectral Angle Mapper between the reference spectrum and each multitemporal image. Then, a threshold to produce a single image of change is applied, which corresponds to the vegetation zones. The results for each multitemporal image are combined through an exclusive or (XOR) operation that selects vegetation zones that have changed over time. Finally, the derived results were compared against a supervised method based on classification with the Support Vector Machine. Furthermore, the NDVI-differencing and the Spectral Angle Mapper techniques were selected as unsupervised methods for comparison purposes. The main novelty of the method consists in the detection of changes in a specific land cover type (vegetation), therefore, for comparison purposes, the best scenario is to compare it with methods that aim to detect changes in a specific land cover type (vegetation). This is. the main reason to select NDVI-based method and the post -classification method (SVM implemented in a standard software tool). To evaluate the improvements using a reference spectrum vector, the results are compared with the basic-SAM method. In SPOTS image, the overall accuracy was 99.36% and the K index was 90.11%; in Quickbird image, the overall accuracy was 97.5% and the ic index was 82.16%. Finally, the precision results of the method are comparable to those of a supervised method, supported by low detection of false positives and false negatives, along with a high overall accuracy and a high kappa index. On the other hand, the execution times were comparable to those of unsupervised methods of low computational load. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Regional transport of anthropogenic pollution and dust aerosols in spring to Tianjin - A coastal megacity in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Simultaneous measurements of columnar aerosol microphysical and optical properties, as well as PM2.5 chemical compositions, were made during two types of spring pollution episodes in Tianjin, a Coastal megacity of China. The events were investigated using field observations, satellite data, model simulations, and meteorological fields. The lower Angstrom Exponent and the higher aerosol optical depth on 29 March, compared with the earlier event on 26 March, implied a dominance of coarse mode particles this was consistent with the differences in volume-size distributions. Based on the single scattering spectra, the dominant absorber (at blue wavelength) changed from black carbon during less polluted days to brown carbon on 26 March and dust on 29 March. The concentrations of major PM2.5 species for these two episodes also differed, with the earlier event enriched in pollution-derived substances and the later with mineral dust elements. The formation mechanisms of these two pollution episodes were also examined. The 26 March episode was attributed to the accumulation of both local emissions and anthropogenic pollutants transported from the southwest of Tianjin under the control of high pressure system. While the high aerosol loading on 29 March was caused by the mixing of transported dust from northwest source region with local urban pollution. The mixing of transported anthropogenic pollutants and dust with local emissions demonstrated the complexity of springtime pollution in Tianjin. The synergy of multi-scale observations showed excellent potential for air pollution study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Hyperspectral data mining to identify relevant canopy spectral features for estimating durum wheat growth, nitrogen status, and grain yield
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - While hyperspectral sensors describe plant canopy reflectance in greater detail than multispectral sensors, they also suffer from issues with data redundancy and spectral autocorrelation. Data mining techniques that extract relevant spectral features from hyperspectral data will aid the development of novel sensors for plant trait estimation. The objectives of this research were to (1) compare broad-band reflectance, narrow-band reflectance, and spectral derivatives for estimation of durum wheat traits in the field and (2) develop a genetic algorithm to identify the most relevant spectral features for durum wheat trait estimation. Experiments at Maricopa, Arizona during the winters of 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 tested six durum wheat cultivars with six split-applied nitrogen (N) fertilization rates. Durum wheat traits, including leaf area index, canopy dry weight, and plant N content, were measured from destructive biomass samples on four occassions in each growing season. Grain yield and grain N content were also measured. Canopy spectral reflectance data in 701 narrow wavebands from 350 nm to 1050 nm were collected weekly using a field spectroradiometer. First-and second-order spectral derivatives were calculated using Savitzky-Golay filtering. The narrow-band data were also used to estimate reflectance in broad wavebands, as typically collected by two commercial multispectral instruments. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) compared the ability of each spectral data set to estimate each measured durum wheat trait. A genetic algorithm was developed to mine narrow-band canopy reflectance and spectral derivative data for spectral features that improved estimates of durum wheat traits. Multispectral data in 4 broad bands estimated leaf area index, canopy dry weight, and plant N content with root mean squared errors of cross validation (RMSECV) between 33.0% and 67.6%, while hyperspectral data in 701 narrow bands reduced RMSECV to values between 19.3% and 36.3%. Use of the genetic algorithm to identify less than 25 relevant spectral features further reduced RMSECV to values between 15.1% and 30.7%. Grain yield was optimally estimated from canopy spectral measurements between 110 and 130 days after planting with RMSECV less than 7.6% using the genetic algorithm approach. The timing corresponded to anthesis and early grain fill when presence of wheat heads likely affected canopy spectral reflectance. By using a genetic algorithm to mine hyperspectral reflectance and spectral derivative data, durum wheat traits were optimally estimated from a subset of relevant canopy spectral features.

TI  - Data mining techniques on satellite images for discovery of risk areas
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The high rates of cholera epidemic mortality in less developed countries is a challenge for health facilities to which it is necessary to equip itself with the epidemiological surveillance. To strengthen the capacity of epidemiological surveillance, this paper focuses on remote sensing satellite data processing using data mining methods to discover risk areas of the epidemic disease by connecting the environment, climate and health. These satellite data are combined with field data collected during the same set of periods in order to explain and deduct the causes of the epidemic evolution from one period to another in relation to the environment. The existing technical (algorithms) for processing satellite images are mature and efficient, so the challenge today is to provide the most suitable means allowing the best interpretation of obtained results. For that, we focus on supervised classification algorithm to process a set of satellite images from the same area but on different periods. A novel research methodology (describing pre-treatment, data mining, and post-treatment) is proposed to ensure suitable means for transforming data, generating information and extracting knowledge. This methodology consists of six phases: (1.A) Acquisition of information from the field about epidemic, (1.B) Satellite data acquisition, (2) Selection and transformation of data (Data derived from images), (3) Remote sensing measurements, (4) Discretization of data, (5) Data treatment, and (6) Interpretation of results. The main contributions of the paper are: to establish the nature of links between the environment and the epidemic, and to highlight those risky environments when the public awareness of the problem and the prevention policies are absolutely necessary for mitigation of the propagation and emergence of the epidemic. This will allow national governments, local authorities and the public health officials to effective management according to risk areas. The case study concerns the knowledge discovery in databases related to risk areas of the cholera epidemic in Mopti region, Mali (West Africa). The results generate from data mining association rules indicate that the level of the Niger River in the wintering periods and some societal factors have an impact on the variation of cholera epidemic rate in Mopti town. More the river level is high, at 66% the rate of contamination is high. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Measuring Transitions in Sexual Risk Among Men Who Have Sex With Men: The Novel Use of Latent Class and Latent Transition Analysis in HIV Sentinel Surveillance
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - New combination human acquired deficiency (HIV) prevention strategies that include biomedical and primary prevention approaches add complexity to the task of measuring sexual risk. Latent transition models are beneficial for understanding complex phenomena; therefore, we trialed the application of latent class and latent transition models to HIV surveillance data. Our aims were to identify sexual risk states and model individuals' transitions between states. A total of 4,685 HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) completed behavioral questionnaires alongside tests for HIV and sexually transmissible infections at one of 2 Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, general practices (2007-2013). We found 4 distinct classes of sexual risk, which we labeled "monogamous" (n = 1,224), "risk minimizer" ( n = 1,443), "risk potential" ( n = 1,335), and "risk taker" ( n = 683). A positive syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia test was significantly associated with class membership. Among a subset of 516 MSM who had at least 3 clinic visits, there was general stability across risk classes; MSM had on average a 0.70 (i.e., 70%) probability of remaining in the same class between visits 1 and 2 and between visits 2 and 3. Monogamous MSM were one exception; the probability of remaining in the monogamous class was 0.51 between visits 1 and 2. Latent transition analyses identified unobserved risk patterns in surveillance data, characterized high-( risk MSM, and quantified transitions over time.

AB  - Background. The ability to noninvasively assess arterial CD206(+) macrophages may lead to improved understanding of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cardiovascular disease.Methods. We trialed a novel macrophage-specific arterial imaging technique.Results. We demonstrated colocalization between technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept (Tc-99m-tilmanocept) and CD206(+) macrophages ex vivo. In vivo application of Tc-99m-tilmanocept single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography revealed high-level Tc-99m-tilmanocept uptake across 20.4% of the aortic surface volume among HIV-infected subjects, compared with 4.3% among non-HIV-infected subjects (P =.009). Among all subjects, aortic high-level Tc-99m-tilmanocept uptake was related to noncalcified aortic plaque volume (r = 0.87; P =.003) on computed tomographic angiography, and this relationship held when we controlled for HIV status.Conclusion. These first-in-human data introduce a novel macrophage-specific arterial imaging technique in HIV.

TI  - Long-term assessment of the CALIPSO Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR) calibration and stability through simulated and observed comparisons with MODIS/Aqua and SEVIRI/Meteosat
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality of the calibrated radiances of the medium-resolution Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR) onboard the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) satellite is quantitatively evaluated from the beginning of the mission in June 2006. Two complementary "relative" and "stand-alone" approaches are used, which are related to comparisons of measured brightness temperatures and to model-to-observations comparisons, respectively. In both cases, IIR channels 1 (8.65 mu m), 2 (10.6 mu m), and 3 (12.05 mu m) are paired with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Aqua Collection 5 "companion" channels 29, 31, and 32, respectively, as well as with the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI)/Meteosat companion channels IR8.7, IR10.8, and IR12, respectively. These pairs were selected before launch to meet radiometric, geometric, and space-time constraints. The prelaunch studies were based on simulations and sensitivity studies using the 4A/OP radiative transfer model and the more than 2300 atmospheres of the climatological Thermodynamic Initial Guess Retrieval (TIGR) input dataset further sorted into five air mass types. Using data from over 9.5 years of on-orbit operation, and following the relative approach technique, collocated measurements of IIR and of its companion channels have been compared at all latitudes over ocean, during day and night, and for all types of scenes in a wide range of brightness temperatures. The relative approach shows an excellent stability of IIR2-MODIS31 and IIR3-MODIS32 brightness temperature differences (BTDs) since launch. A slight trend within the IIR1-MODIS29 BTD, that equals 0.02Kyr 1 on average over 9.5 years, is detected when using the relative approach at all latitudes and all scene temperatures. For very cold scene temperatures (190-200 K) in the tropics, each IIR channel is warmer than its MODIS companion channel by 1.6K on average. For the stand-alone approach, clear sky measurements only are considered, which are directly compared with simulations using 4A/OP and collocated ERAInterim (ERA-I) reanalyses. The clear sky mask is derived from collocated observations from IIR and the CALIPSO lidar. Simulations for clear sky pixels in the tropics reproduce the differences between IIR1 and MODIS29 within 0.02K and between IIR2 and MODIS31 within 0.04 K, whereas IIR3-MODIS32 is larger than simulated by 0.26 K. The stand-alone approach indicates that the trend identified from the relative approach originates from MODIS29, whereas no trend (less than +/- 0.004Kyr(-1)) is identified for any of the IIR channels. Finally, using the relative approach, a year-by-year seasonal bias between nighttime and daytime IIRMODIS BTD was found at mid-latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. It is due to a nighttime IIR bias as determined by the stand-alone approach, which originates from a calibration drift during day-to-night transitions. The largest bias is in June and July when IIR2 and IIR3 are warmer by 0.4K on average, and IIR1 is warmer by 0.2 K.

TI  - Geographic variation within the military health system
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study seeks to quantify variation in healthcare utilization and per capita costs using system-defined geographic regions based on enrollee residence within the Military Health System (MHS).Methods: Data for fiscal years 2007 - 2010 were obtained from the Military Health System under a data sharing agreement with the Defense Health Agency (DHA). DHA manages all aspects of the Department of Defense Military Health System, including TRICARE. Adjusted rates were calculated for per capita costs and for two procedures with high interest to the MHS-back surgery and Cesarean sections for TRICARE Prime and Plus enrollees. Coefficients of variation (CoV) and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated and analyzed using residence catchment area as the geographic unit. Catchment areas anchored by a Military Treatment Facility (MTF) were compared to catchment areas not anchored by a MTF.Results: Variation, as measured by CoV, was 0.37 for back surgery and 0.13 for C-sections in FY 2010-comparable to rates documented in other healthcare systems. The 2010 CoV (and average cost) for per capita costs was 0.26 ($3,479.51). Procedure rates were generally lower and CoVs higher in regions anchored by a MTF compared with regions not anchored by a MTF, based on both system-wide comparisons and comparisons of neighboring areas.Conclusions: In spite of its centrally managed system and relatively healthy beneficiaries with very robust health benefits, the MHS is not immune to unexplained variation in utilization and cost of healthcare.

TI  - An offline-online Web-GIS Android application for fast data acquisition of landslide hazard and risk
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional landslide assessments and mapping have been effectively pursued by research institutions, national and local governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and different stakeholders for some time, and a wide range of methodologies and technologies have consequently been proposed. Land-use mapping and hazard event inventories are mostly created by remote-sensing data, subject to difficulties, such as accessibility and terrain, which need to be overcome. Likewise, landslide data acquisition for the field navigation can magnify the accuracy of databases and analysis. Open-source Web and mobile GIS tools can be used for improved ground-truthing of critical areas to improve the analysis of hazard patterns and triggering factors. This paper reviews the implementation and selected results of a secure mobile-map application called ROOMA (Rapid Offline-Online Mapping Application) for the rapid data collection of landslide hazard and risk. This prototype assists the quick creation of landslide inventory maps (LIMs) by collecting information on the type, feature, volume, date, and patterns of landslides using open-source Web-GIS technologies such as Leaflet maps, Cordova, GeoServer, PostgreSQL as the real DBMS (database management system), and PostGIS as its plug-in for spatial database management. This application comprises Leaflet maps coupled with satellite images as a base layer, drawing tools, geolocation (using GPS and the Internet), photo mapping, and event clustering. All the features and information are recorded into a GeoJSON text file in an offline version (Android) and subsequently uploaded to the online mode (using all browsers) with the availability of Internet. Finally, the events can be accessed and edited after approval by an administrator and then be visualized by the general public.

TI  - Improving PM<sub>2.5</sub> forecast over China by the joint adjustment of initial conditions and source emissions with an ensemble Kalman filter
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In an attempt to improve the forecasting of atmospheric aerosols, the ensemble square root filter algorithm was extended to simultaneously optimize the chemical initial conditions (ICs) and emission input. The forecast model, which was expanded by combining the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model and a forecast model of emission scaling factors, generated both chemical concentration fields and emission scaling factors. The forecast model of emission scaling factors was developed by using the ensemble concentration ratios of the WRF-Chem forecast chemical concentrations and also the time smoothing operator. Hourly surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) observations were assimilated in this system over China from 5 to 16 October 2014. A series of 48 h forecasts was then carried out with the optimized initial conditions and emissions on each day at 00:00UTC and a control experiment was performed without data assimilation. In addition, we also performed an experiment of pure assimilation chemical ICs and the corresponding 48 h forecasts experiment for comparison. The results showed that the forecasts with the optimized initial conditions and emissions typically outperformed those from the control experiment. In the Yangtze River delta (YRD) and the Pearl River delta (PRD) regions, large reduction of the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) was obtained for almost the entire 48 h forecast range attributed to assimilation. In particular, the relative reduction in RMSE due to assimilation was about 37.5% at nighttime when WRF-Chem performed comparatively worse. In the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (JJJ) region, relatively smaller improvements were achieved in the first 24 h forecast but then no improvements were achieved afterwards. Comparing to the forecasts with only the optimized ICs, the forecasts with the joint adjustment were always much better during the night in the PRD and YRD regions. However, they were very similar during daytime in both regions. Also, they performed similarly for almost the entire 48 h forecast range in the JJJ region.

TI  - Validation of digital elevation models (DEMs) and comparison of geomorphic metrics on the southern Central Andean Plateau
T2  - EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we validate and compare elevation accuracy and geomorphic metrics of satellite-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) on the southern Central Andean Plateau. The plateau has an average elevation of 3.7 km and is characterized by diverse topography and relief, lack of vegetation, and clear skies that create ideal conditions for remote sensing. At 30m resolution, SRTM-C, ASTER GDEM2, stacked ASTER L1A stereopair DEM, ALOS World 3D, and TanDEM-X have been analyzed. The higher-resolution datasets include 12m TanDEM-X, 10m single-CoSSC TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X DEMs, and 5m ALOS World 3D. These DEMs are state of the art for optical (ASTER and ALOS) and radar (SRTM-C and TanDEM-X) spaceborne sensors.We assessed vertical accuracy by comparing standard deviations of the DEM elevation versus 307 509 differential GPS measurements across 4000m of elevation. For the 30m DEMs, the ASTER datasets had the highest vertical standard deviation at > 6.5 m, whereas the SRTM-C, ALOS World 3D, and TanDEM-X were all < 3.5 m. Higher-resolution DEMs generally had lower uncertainty, with both the 12m TanDEM-X and 5m ALOSWorld 3D having < 2m vertical standard deviation. Analysis of vertical uncertainty with respect to terrain elevation, slope, and aspect revealed the low uncertainty across these attributes for SRTM-C (30 m), TanDEM-X (12-30 m), and ALOS World 3D (5-30 m). Single-CoSSC TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X 10m DEMs and the 30m ASTER GDEM2 displayed slight aspect biases, which were removed in their stacked counterparts (TanDEM-X and ASTER Stack).Based on low vertical standard deviations and visual inspection alongside optical satellite data, we selected the 30m SRTM-C, 12-30m TanDEM-X, 10m single-CoSSC TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X, and 5m ALOS World 3D for geomorphic metric comparison in a 66 km2 catchment with a distinct river knickpoint. Consistent m = n values were found using chi plot channel profile analysis, regardless of DEM type and spatial resolution. Slope, curvature, and drainage area were calculated and plotting schemes were used to assess basin-wide differences in the hillslope-to-valley transition related to the knickpoint. While slope and hillslope length measurements vary little between datasets, curvature displays higher magnitude measurements with fining resolution. This is especially true for the optical 5m ALOS World 3D DEM, which demonstrated high-frequency noise in 2-8 pixel steps through a Fourier frequency analysis. The improvements in accurate space-radar DEMs (e. g., TanDEM-X) for geomorphometry are promising, but airborne or terrestrial data are still necessary for meter-scale analysis.

TI  - Mortality and Cardiovascular Disease in Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes
T2  - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDLong-term trends in excess risk of death and cardiovascular outcomes have not been extensively studied in persons with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes.METHODSWe included patients registered in the Swedish National Diabetes Register from 1998 through 2012 and followed them through 2014. Trends in deaths and cardiovascular events were estimated with Cox regression and standardized incidence rates. For each patient, controls who were matched for age, sex, and county were randomly selected from the general population.RESULTSAmong patients with type 1 diabetes, absolute changes during the study period in the incidence rates of sentinel outcomes per 10,000 person-years were as follows: death from any cause, -31.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], -56.1 to -6.7); death from cardiovascular disease, -26.0 (95% CI, -42.6 to -9.4); death from coronary heart disease, -21.7 (95% CI, -37.1 to -6.4); and hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, -45.7 (95% CI, -71.4 to -20.1). Absolute changes per 10,000 person-years among patients with type 2 diabetes were as follows: death from any cause, -69.6 (95% CI, -95.9 to -43.2); death from cardiovascular disease, -110.0 (95% CI, -128.9 to -91.1); death from coronary heart disease, -91.9 (95% CI, -108.9 to -75.0); and hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, -203.6 (95% CI, -230.9 to -176.3). Patients with type 1 diabetes had roughly 40% greater reduction in cardiovascular outcomes than controls, and patients with type 2 diabetes had roughly 20% greater reduction than controls. Reductions in fatal outcomes were similar in patients with type 1 diabetes and controls, whereas patients with type 2 diabetes had smaller reductions in fatal outcomes than controls.CONCLUSIONSIn Sweden from 1998 through 2014, mortality and the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes declined substantially among persons with diabetes, although fatal outcomes declined less among those with type 2 diabetes than among controls.

TI  - Cross-calibration of S-NPP VIIRS moderate-resolution reflective solar bands against MODIS Aqua over dark water scenes
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is being used to continue the record of Earth Science observations and data products produced routinely from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements. However, the absolute calibration of VIIRS's reflected solar bands is thought to be biased, leading to offsets in derived data products such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) as compared to when similar algorithms are applied to different sensors. This study presents a cross-calibration of these VIIRS bands against MODIS Aqua over dark water scenes, finding corrections to the NASA VIIRS Level 1 (version 2) reflectances between approximately C 1 and 7% (dependent on band) are needed to bring the two into alignment (after accounting for expected differences resulting from different band spectral response functions), and indications of relative trending of up to similar to 0.35% per year in some bands. The derived calibration gain corrections are also applied to the VIIRS reflectance and then used in an AOD retrieval, and they are shown to decrease the bias and total error in AOD across the mid-visible spectral region compared to the standard VIIRS NASA reflectance calibration. The resulting AOD bias characteristics are similar to those of NASA MODIS AOD data products, which is encouraging in terms of multi-sensor data continuity.

TI  - Implementation of random forest algorithm for crop mapping across an aridic to ustic area of Indian states
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to effectively implement random forest algorithm for crop classification of large areas and to check the classification capability of different variables. To incorporate dependency of crops in different variables namely, texture, phenological, parent material and soil, soil moisture, topographic, vegetation, and climate, 35 digital layers are prepared using different satellite data (ALOS DEM, Landsat-8, MODIS NDVI, RISAT-1, and Sentinel-1A) and climatic data (precipitation and temperature). The importance of variables is also calculated based on mean decrease in accuracy and mean decrease in Gini score. Importance and capabilities of variables for crop mapping have been discussed. Variables associated with spectral responses have shown greater importance in comparison to topographic and climate variables. The spectral range (0.85 to 0.88 mu m) of the near-infrared band is the most useful variable with the highest scores. The topographic variable and elevation have secured the second place rank in the both scores. This indicates the importance of spectral responses as well as of topography in model development. Climate variables have not shown as much importance as others, but in association with others, they cause a decrease in the out of bag (OOB) error rate. In addition to the OOB data, a 20% independent dataset of training samples is used to evaluate RF model. Results showthatRF has good capability for crop classification.

TI  - Gamma probe and ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology of the sentinel node (GULF) trial - overview of the literature, pilot and study protocol
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel node (SN) biopsy (SNB) detects clinically occult metastases of breast cancer and melanoma in 20-30%. Wound infections, seroma and lymph edema occur in up to 10%. Targeted ultrasound (US) of the SN, (with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) if appropriate) has been investigated as a minimally invasive alternative, but reported sensitivity rates are too low to replace SNB. Our hypothesis is that the use of a handheld gamma probe concomitant with US may improve sensitivity.Our aim is to provide an overview of the current literature on preoperative nodal staging of clinical N0 melanoma patients, report on a pilot, and present a study protocol for a minimally invasive alternative to the SNB: Gamma probe and Ultrasound guided Fine needle aspiration cytology of the sentinel node (GULF trial).Methods: The GULF trial is a multicenter open single arm observational trial. Newly diagnosed cT1b-4N0M0 cutaneous melanoma or cT1-3N0M0 breast cancer patients, aged >18 years, presenting for SNB are eligible. 120 patients will be included for preoperative targeted gamma probe guided US and FNAC of the SN. Afterwards all patients proceed to surgical SNB. Primary endpoint is the sensitivity of FNAC. Secondary endpoints include SN identification rate and the histopathological compatibility of Core Needle Biopsy and FNAC vs. SNB. Secondary endpoints were investigated in a pilot with 10 FNACs and marker placements, and 10 FNACs combined with Core Needle Biopsy.Results: A pilot in 20 patients showed that SN identification rate was 90%, supporting the feasibility of this technique.Discussion: There is broad experience with US (in combination with FNAC) prior to SNB, but sensitivity and specificity are too low to completely abandon SNB. Promising alternative techniques potentially will replace SNB in the future but more evidence is needed in the form of prospective studies. Accurate identification of the SN for US-FNAC has been proven feasible in our pilot. When adequate sensitivity can be reached, US-FNAC provides a minimally invasive alternative for the surgical SNB procedure.

TI  - OMI air-quality monitoring over the Middle East
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) trace gas vertical column observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and glyoxal (CHOCHO), we have conducted a robust and detailed time series analysis to assess changes in local air quality for over 1000 locations (focussing on urban, oil refinery, oil port, and power plant targets) over the Middle East for 2005-2014. Apart from NO2, which is highest over urban locations, average tropospheric column levels of these trace gases are highest over oil ports and refineries. The highest average pollution levels over urban settlements are typically in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.We detect 278 statistically significant and real linear NO2 trends in total. Over urban areas NO2 increased by up to 12% yr(-1), with only two locations showing a decreasing trend. Over oil refineries, oil ports, and power plants, NO2 increased by about 2-9% yr(-1). For HCHO, 70 significant and real trends were detected, with HCHO increasing by 2-7% yr(-1) over urban settlements and power plants and by about 2-4% yr(-1) over refineries and oil ports. Very few SO2 trends were detected, which varied in direction and magnitude (23 increasing and 9 decreasing). Apart from two locations where CHOCHO is decreasing, we find that glyoxal tropospheric column levels are not changing over the Middle East. Hence, for many locations in the Middle East, OMI observes a degradation in air quality over 2005-2014. This study therefore demonstrates the capability of OMI to generate long-term air-quality monitoring at local scales over this region.

TI  - Structures of closed and open states of a voltage-gated sodium channel
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacterial voltage-gated sodium channels (BacNavs) serve as models of their vertebrate counterparts. BacNavs contain conserved voltage-sensing and pore-forming domains, but they are homotetramers of four identical subunits, rather than pseudotetramers of four homologous domains. Here, we present structures of two Na(V)Ab mutants that capture tightly closed and open states at a resolution of 2.8-3.2 angstrom. Introduction of two humanizingmutations in the S6 segment (Na(V)Ab/FY: T206F and V213Y) generates a persistently closed form of the activation gate in which the intracellular ends of the four S6 segments are drawn tightly together to block ion permeation completely. This construct also revealed the complete structure of the four-helix bundle that forms the C-terminal domain. In contrast, truncation of the C-terminal 40 residues in Na(V)Ab/1-226 captures the activation gate in an open conformation, revealing the open state of a BacNav with intact voltage sensors. Comparing these structures illustrates the full range of motion of the activation gate, from closed with its orifice fully occluded to open with an orifice of similar to 10 angstrom. Molecular dynamics and free-energy simulations confirm designation of Na(V)Ab/1-226 as an open state that allows permeation of hydrated Na+, and these results also support a hydrophobic gating mechanism for control of ion permeation. These two structures allow completion of a closed-open-inactivated conformational cycle in a single voltage-gated sodium channel and give insight into the structural basis for state-dependent binding of sodium channel-blocking drugs.

TI  - Does seasonal vaccination affect the clinical presentation of influenza among the elderly? A cross-sectional analysis in the outpatient setting in France, 2003-2014
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vaccine-induced protection against influenza is not optimal, however it has been suggested that the vaccine may reduce the severity of symptoms among those who develop illness despite being vaccinated. We tested this hypothesis within a countrywide, sentinel general practitioners-based surveillance system in France. We included 2277 individuals aged 65 years or older (of whom 1293 had been vaccinated against influenza, 56.8%) who consulted a general practitioner because of an acute respiratory infection (ARI) during 2003-2014. All patients were taken a nasopharyngeal swab, and information was collected on demographic characteristics and symptoms at disease onset. All specimens were tested for respiratory viruses and, if positive for influenza, the virus type and subtype were determined. We compared the average maximum temperature and the frequency of each symptom, between non-vaccinated and vaccinated influenza patients. We then used logistic regression models to calculate the odds of presenting with each symptom between vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated patients, adjusting by age group, virus (sub)type and season. Overall, 675 ARI patients (29.6%) tested positive for influenza. The A(H3) virus caused the majority of cases (55.1%), followed by influenza B (22.9%), A not-subtyped (11.7%), and A(H1) (10.3%) viruses. Compared to non-vaccinated influenza patients, those who had been vaccinated had a slightly reduced maximum temperature and presented less frequently with myalgia, shivering and headache. In stratified analyses, the observed effect was limited to patients infected with A(H3) or type B viruses. After adjusting by age group, virus (sub)type and season, the difference remained statistically significant only for headache, which was less frequent among vaccinated individuals (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence intervals 0.48-0.98). In conclusion, the vaccine was found to be modestly associated with less severe clinical presentation of influenza among the elderly. Our findings reinforce the need for influenza vaccines providing better protection. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Testing the use of standardised indices and GRACE satellite data to estimate the European 2015 groundwater drought in near-real time
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2015, central and eastern Europe were affected by a severe drought. This event has recently been studied from meteorological and streamflow perspective, but no analysis of the groundwater situation has been performed. One of the reasons is that real-time groundwater level observations often are not available. In this study, we evaluate two alternative approaches to quantify the 2015 groundwater drought over two regions in southern Germany and eastern Netherlands. The first approach is based on spatially explicit relationships between meteorological conditions and historic groundwater level observations. The second approach uses the Gravity Recovery Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage (TWS) and groundwater anomalies derived from GRACE-TWS and (near-) surface storage simulations by the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) models. We combined the monthly groundwater observations from 2040 wells to establish the spatially varying optimal accumulation period between the Standardised Groundwater Index (SGI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at a 0.25 degrees gridded scale. The resulting optimal accumulation periods range between 1 and more than 24 months, indicating strong spatial differences in groundwater response time to meteorological input over the region. Based on the estimated optimal accumulation periods and available meteorological time series, we reconstructed the groundwater anomalies up to 2015 and found that in Germany a uniform severe groundwater drought persisted for several months during this year, whereas the Netherlands appeared to have relatively high groundwater levels. The differences between this event and the 2003 European benchmark drought are striking. The 2003 groundwater drought was less uniformly pronounced, both in the Netherlands and Germany. This is because slowly responding wells (the ones with optimal accumulation periods of more than 12 months) still were above average from the wet year of 2002, which experienced severe flooding in central Europe. GRACE-TWS and GRACE-based groundwater anomalies did not capture the spatial variability of the 2003 and 2015 drought events satisfactorily. GRACE-TWS did show that both 2003 and 2015 were relatively dry, but the differences between Germany and the Netherlands in 2015 and the spatially variable groundwater drought pattern in 2003 were not captured. This could be associated with the coarse spatial scale of GRACE. The simulated groundwater anomalies based on GRACE-TWS deviated considerably from the GRACE-TWS signal and from observed groundwater anomalies. The uncertainty in the GRACE-based groundwater anomalies mainly results from uncertainties in the simulation of soil moisture by the different GLDAS models. The GRACE-based groundwater anomalies are therefore not suitable for use in real-time groundwater drought monitoring in our case study regions. The alternative approach based on the spatially variable relationship between meteorological conditions and groundwater levels is more suitable to quantify groundwater drought in near real-time. Compared to the meteorological drought and streamflow drought (described in previous studies), the groundwater drought of 2015 had a more pronounced spatial variability in its response to meteorological conditions, with some areas primarily influenced by short-term meteorological deficits and others influenced by meteorological deficits accumulated over the preceding 2 years or more.In drought management, this information is very useful and our approach to quantify groundwater drought can be used until real-time groundwater observations become readily available.

TI  - Study of channel instability in the braided Brahmaputra river using satellite imagery
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, instability of the river reach of Brahmaputra was analysed for braided belt width changes, braiding index and bar area. The river reach of the Brahmaputra from its confluence of Lohit, Dibang and Dihang to its confluence with the Tista river was studied from 1973 to 2009. The study was carried out using remotely sensed data from Landsat satellites at different dates. Discharge data synchronized with satellite data was collected by maintaining near-similar water level or discharge. Wavelet of the braided belt change was analysed to get the wavelet power and spatial extent of the changes. Finally, stream power was analysed from the average discharge data during the monsoon period to determine its effect on the instability of parameters considered. Results indicate that stream power does not directly relate to local changes in the braided belt or braiding index. However, with decrease in stream power, an increasing trend of bar area was found. Maximum wavelet power within a period showed a threshold behaviour at stream power of 5 W/km, beyond which the wavelet power raised sharply to a high value with increase in stream power. River response to the stream power was found at a global level rather than local level. Finally, a gradual decrease in stream power over time indicates the stable river reach. However, changes due to local bank erosion cannot be predicted using this analysis.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the HIV-infection related behaviors among unmarried youths in rural areas of Liangshan prefecture from 2011 to 2013 and factors that influencing the HIV transmission in the population under research. Methods: According to the HIV sentinel surveillance methods for data collection, EpiData 3.1 and SPSS 19.0 were used to handle data and both Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to explore the related factors. Results: A total number of 5 871 qualified youths were involved in this study from 2011 to 2013 with the prevalence rate on HIV infection among those unmarried youths from the rural areas as 3.45% (201/5 833). 27.56% (1 607/5 833) of them had been working outside their hometown area. 31.72% (1 850/5 833) of the unmarried youths had sexual experiences, with 41.46% (767/1 850) of them had casual sex but the rate of consistent condom use was only 3.46% (64/1 850). 5.04% (294/5 833) of the unmarried youths admitted of ever having used drugs, with 34.35% (101/294) of them having the experiences of injecting, with 84.16% (85/101) of them sharing needles. Rates on factors as: working outside the resident areas, ever having had casual sexual behaviors, drug use and injecting drug use were seen higher among HIV infections, with differences statistically significant (chi(2)=88.72, 104.43, 4.20, 154.39, 55.94, P<0.05). Results from the logistic regression showed that factors as: being male,Yi ethnicity, illiteracy, experience of working outside the resident area, never or casual condom use and needle-sharing drug use etc. would significantly increase the risk of HIV infection. Conclusions: HIV infection among unmarried youths from rural areas in Liangshan prefecture called for attention because of the high rates of risk behaviors. Factors as: having had sexual experiences with low condom use, popular injecting drug use with needle sharing, being male, under Yi ethnicity, with lower education level and ever working outside the resident area etc. were under risks that related to HIV infection for unmarried youths in this area.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To understand the epidemiological characteristics of diarrheagenic Escherichia (E.) coli (DEC) among diarrhea outpatients in China. Methods: Diarrhea surveillance program was conducted in outpatient and emergency departments from 170 hospitals that under the sentinel programs in 27 provinces, from 2012-2015. Clinical and epidemiological data regarding diarrhea patients were collected, with fecal specimens sampled and tested for DEC in 92 network-connected laboratories. Results: Among all the 46 721 diarrhea cases, 7.7% of them appeared DEC positive in those with geographic heterogeneity. In 2 982 cases (6.4%) with available data on PCR subtypes of DEC, enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC, 1 205 cases, 40.4%) appeared the most commonly seen pathogens, followed by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC, 815 cases, 27.3%), and enterotoxigenic E.coli (ETEC, 653 cases, 21.9%). The highest positive rate of DEC was observed in outpatients of 25-34 years old (10.1%), living in the warm temperate zones (11.1%), and with mucous-like stool (9.4%). The positive rate of DEC showed a strong seasonal pattern, with peaks in summer, for all the subtypes. Conclusions: DEC seemed easy to be detected among diarrhea outpatients in China, with EAEC, EPEC and ETEC the most commonly identified subtypes. Epidemiological characteristics regarding the heterogeneities of DEC appeared different, in regions, age groups and seasons. Long-term surveillance programs should be strengthened to better understand the epidemiology of DEC, in China.

TI  - Using energy budgets to combine ecology and toxicology in a mammalian sentinel species
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Process-driven modelling approaches can resolve many of the shortcomings of traditional descriptive and non-mechanistic toxicology. We developed a simple dynamic energy budget (DEB) model for the mink (Mustela vison), a sentinel species in mammalian toxicology, which coupled animal physiology, ecology and toxicology, in order to mechanistically investigate the accumulation and adverse effects of lifelong dietary exposure to persistent environmental toxicants, most notably polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Our novel mammalian DEB model accurately predicted, based on energy allocations to the interconnected metabolic processes of growth, development, maintenance and reproduction, lifelong patterns in mink growth, reproductive performance and dietary accumulation of PCBs as reported in the literature. Our model results were consistent with empirical data from captive and free-ranging studies in mink and other wildlife and suggest that PCB exposure can have significant population-level impacts resulting from targeted effects on fetal toxicity, kit mortality and growth and development. Our approach provides a simple and cross-species framework to explore the mechanistic interactions of physiological processes and ecotoxicology, thus allowing for a deeper understanding and interpretation of stressor-induced adverse effects at all levels of biological organization.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy and artemisinin resistance in northern Myanmar: evidence from in vivo and molecular marker studies
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In Myanmar, three types of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) are recommended as first-line treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria: artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artesunate-mefloquine (AS + MQ), and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP). Resistance to both artemisinins and ACT partner drugs has been reported from the Greater Mekong Sub-region, and regular efficacy monitoring of the recommended ACT is conducted in Myanmar. This paper reports on results from studies to monitor the efficacy of the three forms of ACT in sentinel sites in northern Myanmar, and investigations of mutations in the Kelch13 (k13) propeller domain.Methods: Seven therapeutic efficacy studies were conducted in 2011-12 and 2014 in three sentinel sites in Myanmar (Tamu, Muse, Tabeikkyin). Three studies were done for the evaluation of AL (204 patients), two studies for AS + MQ (119 patients) and two studies for DP (147 patients). These studies were done according to 2009 standard WHO protocol. Polymorphisms in the k13 propeller domain were examined in dried blood spots collected on day 0. The primary endpoint was adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) on day 28 for AL and on day 42 for DP and AS + MQ, corrected to exclude re-infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping. Safety data were collected through self-reporting.Results: PCR-corrected ACPR was 97.2-100% for AL, 98.6-100% for AS + MQ and 100% for DP across the study sites and years. All studies found a prevalence of k13 mutations (>440) above 23% in the day-0 samples. The F446I mutation was the most common mutation, making up 66.0% of the mutations found. Seven out of nine day-3 positive patients were infected with k13 wild type parasites. The remaining two cases with day-3 parasitaemia had the P574L mutation.Conclusions: The efficacy of AL, AS + MQ and DP remains high in northern Myanmar despite widespread evidence of k13 mutations associated with delayed parasite clearance. This study showed that already in 2012 there was a high frequency of k13 mutations in Myanmar on the border with India. The high efficacy of the recommended ACT gives confidence in the continued recommendation of the use of these treatments in Myanmar.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - International case definitions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) are commonly used for influenza surveillance. We evaluated clinical factors associated with the laboratoryconfirmed diagnosis of influenza and the performance of these influenza case definitions by using a complete dataset of 14,994 patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) from whom a specimen was collected between August 2009 and April 2014 by the Groupes Regionaux d'Observation de la Grippe (GROG), a French national influenza surveillance network. Cough and fever >= 39 degrees C most accurately predicted an influenza infection in all age groups. Several other symptoms were associated with an increased risk of influenza (headache, weakness, myalgia, coryza) or decreased risk (adenopathy, pharyngitis, shortness of breath, otitis/otalgia, bronchitis/bronchiolitis), but not throughout all age groups. The WHO case definition for influenza-like illness (ILI) had the highest specificity with 21.4%, while the ECDC ILI case definition had the highest sensitivity with 96.1%. The diagnosis among children younger than 5 years remains challenging. The study compared the performance of clinical influenza definitions based on outpatient surveillance and will contribute to improving the comparability of data shared at international level.

TI  - Using temporarily coherent point interferometric synthetic aperture radar for land subsidence monitoring in a mining region of western China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yuyang mine is located in the semiarid western region of China where, due to serious land subsidence caused by underground coal exploitation, the local ecological environment has become more fragile. An advanced interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique, temporarily coherent point InSAR, is applied to measure surface movements caused by different mining conditions. Fifteen high-resolution TerraSAR-X images acquired between October 2, 2012, and March 27, 2013, were processed to generate time-series data for ground deformation. The results show that the maximum accumulated values of subsidence and velocity were 86 mm and 162 mm/year, respectively; these measurements were taken above the fully mechanized longwall caving faces. Based on the dynamic land subsidence caused by the exploitation of one working face, the land subsidence range was deduced to have increased 38 m in the mining direction with 11 days' coal extraction. Although some mining faces were ceased in 2009, they could also have contributed to a small residual deformation of overlying strata. Surface subsidence of the backfill mining region was quite small, the maximum only 21 mm, so backfill exploitation is an effective method for reducing the land subsidence while coal is mined.

TI  - A 15-year record of CO emissions constrained by MOPITT CO observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term measurements from satellites and surface stations have demonstrated a decreasing trend of tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) in the Northern Hemisphere over the past decade. Likely explanations for this decrease include changes in anthropogenic, fires, and/or biogenic emissions or changes in the primary chemical sink hydroxyl radical (OH). Using remotely sensed CO measurements from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite instrument, in situ methyl chloroform (MCF) measurements from the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) and the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem model, we estimate the change in global CO emissions from 2001 to 2015. We show that the loss rate of MCF varied by 0.2% in the past 15 years, indicating that changes in global OH distributions do not explain the recent decrease in CO. Our two-step inversion approach for estimating CO emissions is intended to mitigate the effect of bias errors in the MOPITT data as well as model errors in transport and chemistry, which are the primary factors contributing to the uncertainties when quantifying CO emissions using these remotely sensed data. Our results confirm that the decreasing trend of tropospheric CO in the Northern Hemisphere is due to decreasing CO emissions from anthropogenic and biomass burning sources. In particular, we find decreasing CO emissions from the United States and China in the past 15 years, and unchanged anthropogenic CO emissions from Europe since 2008. We find decreasing trends of biomass burning CO emissions from boreal North America, boreal Asia and South America, but little change over Africa. In contrast to prior results, we find that a positive trend in CO emissions is likely for India and southeast Asia.

TI  - Excess all-cause and influenza-attributable mortality in Europe, December 2016 to February 2017
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since December 2016, excess all-cause mortality was observed in many European countries, especially among people aged >= 65 years. We estimated all-cause and influenza-attributable mortality in 19 European countries/regions. Excess mortality was primarily explained by circulation of influenza virus A(H3N2). Cold weather snaps contributed in some countries. The pattern was similar to the last major influenza A(H3N2) season in 2014/15 in Europe, although starting earlier in line with the early influenza season start.

TI  - Impact of the spatial resolution of satellite remote sensing sensors in the quantification of total suspended sediment concentration: A case study in turbid waters of Northern Western Australia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of anthropogenic activities on coastal waters is a cause of concern because such activities add to the total suspended sediment (TSS) budget of the coastal waters, which have negative impacts on the coastal ecosystem. Satellite remote sensing provides a powerful tool in monitoring TSS concentration at high spatiotemporal resolution, but coastal managers should be mindful that the satellite-derived TSS concentrations are dependent on the satellite sensor's radiometric properties, atmospheric correction approaches, the spatial resolution and the limitations of specific TSS algorithms. In this study, we investigated the impact of different spatial resolutions of satellite sensor on the quantification of TSS concentration in coastal waters of northern Western Australia. We quantified the TSS product derived from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua, Landsat-8 Operational Land Image (OLI), and WorldView-2 (WV2) at native spatial resolutions of 250 m, 30 m and 2 m respectively and coarser spatial resolution (resampled up to 5 km) to quantify the impact of spatial resolution on the derived TSS product in different turbidity conditions. The results from the study show that in the waters of high turbidity and high spatial variability, the high spatial resolution WV2 sensor reported TSS concentration as high as 160 mg L-1 while the low spatial resolution MODIS-Aqua reported a maximum TSS concentration of 23.6 mg L-1. Degrading the spatial resolution of each satellite sensor for highly spatially variable turbid waters led to variability in the TSS concentrations of 114.46%, 304.68% and 38.2% for WV2, Landsat-8 OLI and MODIS-Aqua respectively. The implications of this work are particularly relevant in the situation of compliance monitoring where operations may be required to restrict TSS concentrations to a pre-defined limit.

TI  - Evaluation of biosecurity measures to prevent indirect transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The effectiveness of biosecurity methods to mitigate the transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) via farm personnel or contaminated fomites is poorly understood. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of biosecurity procedures directed at minimizing transmission via personnel following different biosecurity protocols using a controlled experimental setting.Results: PEDV RNA was detected from rectal swabs of experimentally infected (INF) and sentinel pigs by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Virus shedding in INF pigs peaked at 1 day post infection (dpi) and viral RNA levels remained elevated through 19 dpi. Sentinel pigs in the low biosecurity group (LB) became PEDV positive after the first movement of study personnel from the INF group. However, rectal swabs from pigs in the medium biosecurity (MB) and high biosecurity (HB) groups were negative during the 10 consecutive days of movements and remained negative through 24 days post movement (dpm) when the first trial was terminated. Viral RNA was detected at 1 dpm through 3 dpm from the personal protective equipment (PPE) of LB personnel. In addition, at 1 dpm, 2 hair/face swabs from MB personnel were positive; however, transmission of virus was not detected. All swabs of fomite from the HB study personnel were negative.Conclusions: These results indicate that indirect PEDV transmission through contaminated PPE occurs rapidly (within 24 h) under modeled conditions. Biosecurity procedures such as changing PPE, washing exposed skin areas, or taking a shower are recommended for pig production systems and appear to be an effective option for lowering the risk of PEDV transmission between groups of pigs.

TI  - Possible connections of the opposite trends in Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice cover
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice is an important component of the global climate system and a key indicator of climate change. A decreasing trend in Arctic sea-ice concentration is evident in recent years, whereas Antarctic sea-ice concentration exhibits a generally increasing trend. Various studies have investigated the underlying causes of the observed trends for each region, but possible linkages between the regional trends have not been studied. Here, we hypothesize that the opposite trends in Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice concentration may be linked, at least partially, through interdecadal variability of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Although evaluation of this hypothesis is constrained by the limitations of the sea-ice cover record, preliminary statistical analyses of one short-term and two long-term time series of observed and reanalysis sea-ice concentrations data suggest the possibility of the hypothesized linkages. For all three data sets, the leading mode of variability of global sea-ice concentration is positively correlated with the AMO and negatively correlated with the PDO. Two wave trains related to the PDO and the AMO appear to produce anomalous surface-air temperature and low-level wind fields in the two polar regions that contribute to the opposite changes in sea-ice concentration.

TI  - Probing into the aging dynamics of biomass burning aerosol by using satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth and carbon monoxide
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbonaceous aerosol released into the atmosphere from open biomass burning (BB) is known to undergo considerable chemical and physical transformations (aging). However, there is substantial controversy about the nature and observable effects of these transformations. A shortage of consistent observational evidence on BB aerosol aging processes under different environmental conditions and at various temporal scales hinders development of their adequate representations in chemistry transport models (CTMs). In this study, we obtain insights into the BB aerosol dynamics by using available satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and carbon monoxide (CO). The basic concept of our method is to consider AOD as a function of the BB aerosol "photochemical age" (that is, the time period characterizing the exposure of BB aerosol emissions to atmospheric oxidation reactions) predicted by means of model tracers. We evaluate the AOD enhancement ratio (ER) defined as the ratio of optical depth of actual BB aerosol with respect to that of a modeled aerosol tracer that is assumed to originate from the same fires as the real BB aerosol but that is not affected by any aging processes. To limit possible effects of model transport errors, the AOD measurements are normalized to CO column amounts that are also retrieved from satellite measurements. The method is applied to the analysis of the meso-and synoptic-scale evolution of aerosol in smoke plumes from major wildfires that occurred in Siberia in summer 2012. AOD and CO retrievals from MODIS and IASI measurements, respectively, are used in combination with simulations performed with the CHIMERE CTM. The analysis indicates that aging processes strongly affected the evolution of BB aerosol in the situation considered, especially in dense plumes (with spatial average PM2.5 concentration exceeding 100 mu gm(-3)). For such plumes, the ER is found to increase almost 2-fold on the scale of similar to 10 h of daytime aerosol evolution (after a few first hours of the evolution that are not resolved in our analysis). The robustness of this finding is corroborated by sensitivity tests and Monte Carlo experiments. Furthermore, a simulation using the volatility basis set framework suggests that a large part of the increase in the ER can be explained by atmospheric processing of semivolatile organic compounds. Our results are consistent with findings of a number of earlier studies reporting considerable underestimation of AOD by CTMs in which BB aerosol aging processes have either been disregarded or simulated in a highly simplified way. In general, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using satellite measurements of AOD in biomass burning plumes in combination with aerosol tracer simulations for the investigation of BB aerosol evolution and validation of BB aerosol aging schemes in atmospheric models.

TI  - Impacts of Land-Use Changes on the Lakes across the Yangtze Floodplain in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The middle and lower Yangtze (MLY) floodplain has one of the most densely distributed lake clusters in China but suffered from long-term lake reclamation and wetland degradation due to intensive cultivation, fish rearing, and urban expansion over the past several decades. As a land-use alternation to support human life, the conversion of lakes to cropland, aquaculture ponds, and human settlements provides essential ecosystem goods at the expense of the deterioration of wetland environment. To quantify:- the driving factors of lake changes, we investigated the land-use transitions from lakes (>= 1 km(2)) between 1975 and 2015 using Landsat remote sensing data. We found that the dramatic decline in lake area (a net decrease of 13.8 +/- 1.4%) over the four decades was largely attributed to human-induced transformation from lakes to cropland, fish ponds, and built-up areas, accounting for 34.6%, 24.2%, and 2.5% of the total area reduction, respectively. The remaining loss, associated with vegetation (37.3%) and bare land (1.4%) and coming mainly from China's two largest freshwater lakes (Poyang and Dongting); can be explained by climate variation, sediment deposition, and hydrological regulation. These findings shed new light on the quantitative impacts of human activities and climate variation on lake changes and provide a scientific foundation for wetland management decision-making.

TI  - Precision global health in the digital age
T2  - SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision global health is an approach similar to precision medicine, which facilitates, through innovation and technology, better targeting of public health interventions on a global scale, for the purpose of maximising their effectiveness and relevance. Illustrative examples include: the use of remote sensing data to fight vector-borne diseases; large databases of genomic sequences of foodborne pathogens helping to identify origins of outbreaks; social networks and internet search engines for tracking communicable diseases; cell phone data in humanitarian actions; drones to deliver healthcare services in remote and secluded areas. Open science and data sharing platforms are proposed for fostering international research programmes under fair, ethical and respectful conditions. Innovative education, such as massive open online courses or serious games, can promote wider access to training in public health and improving health literacy. The world is moving towards learning healthcare systems. Professionals are equipped with data collection and decision support devices. They share information, which are complemented by external sources, and analysed in real time using machine learning techniques. They allow for the early detection of anomalies, and eventually guide appropriate public health interventions. This article shows how information- driven approaches, enabled by digital technologies, can help improving global health with greater equity.

TI  - Attribution of local climate zones using a multitemporal land use/land cover classification scheme
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide, the number of people living in an urban environment exceeds the rural population with increasing tendency. Especially in relation to global climate change, cities play a major role considering the impacts of extreme heat waves on the population. For urban planners, it is important to know which types of urban structures are beneficial for a comfortable urban climate and which actions can be taken to improve urban climate conditions. Therefore, it is essential to differ between not only urban and rural environments, but also between different levels of urban densification. To compare these built-up types within different cities worldwide, Stewart and Oke developed the concept of local climate zones (LCZ) defined by morphological characteristics. The original LCZ scheme often has considerable problems when adapted to European cities with historical city centers, including narrow streets and irregular patterns. In this study, a method to bridge the gap between a classical land use/land cover (LULC) classification and the LCZ scheme is presented. Multitemporal Landsat 8 data are used to create a high accuracy LULC map, which is linked to the LCZ by morphological parameters derived from a high-resolution digital surface model and cadastral data. A bijective combination of the different classification schemes could not be achieved completely due to overlapping threshold values and the spatially homogeneous distribution of morphological parameters, but the attribution of LCZ to the LULC classification was successful.

TI  - A New Approach to Extrapolate Forest Attributes from Field Inventory with Satellite and Auxiliary Data Sets
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed a tool called "Field And SatelliTe for Ecosystem MAPping (FastEmap)" based on an innovative algorithm. The tool assimilates measured point-specific estimates of forest biophysical characteristics, satellite images, and auxiliary data sets to map forest parameters at a 30-m resolution. Four major components are integrated into an automated production line: (1) creation of additional "virtual" field plots; (2) using stepwise regression to identify significant explanatory variables and create a spatial prediction; (3) iteratively establishing groups that are composed of similar pixels and imputing a group with the weighted mean of the plots that are within the group; and (4) local interpolating and strata median filling. Taking the complex Southern California area as an example, we used this tool to map aboveground live biomass from 156 Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots. The accuracy evaluation from an additional 36 FIA plots produced an R-2 of 0.78, a root mean square error of 28.3 tons/ha, and a mean absolute error of 22.7 tons/ha. Our results indicate that FastEmap is a promising tool to automatically map continuously varying forest attributes over large geographic extents. The next step is to test the performance of different settings and apply the tool to a broader area.

AB  - Due to background reflectance, it is difficult to accurately map sparse canopy vegetation using moderate resolution satellite imagery. Information contained in virtually all the pixels is a mix of leaf vegetation, soil, branches and shadow. Presented in this paper is a novel approach to improving the accuracy of mapping mangrove canopy using Landsat 8 imagery by incorporating seven indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Infrared Index, Leaf Area Index, Green Atmospherically Resistant Index, Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Built-up Index and Normalized Difference Water Index. Results demonstrated that the accuracy of mapping mangrove can be significantly improved using this approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Escherichia coli causes more than one-third of the bacteraemia cases in England each year, and the incidence of these infections is increasing.Aim: To determine the underlying risk factors associated with E. coli bacteraemia.Methods: A three-month enhanced sentinel surveillance study involving 35 National Health Service hospitals was undertaken in the winter of 2012/13 to collect risk factor information and further details on the underlying source of infection to augment data already collected by the English national surveillance programme. Antimicrobial susceptibility results for E. coli isolated from blood and urine were also collected.Findings: A total of 1731 cases of E. coli bacteraemia were included. The urogenital tract was the most frequently reported source of infection (51.2% of cases) with previous treatment for a urinary tract infection being the largest independent effect associated with this infection source. Half of all patients had previous healthcare exposure in the month prior to the bacteraemia with antimicrobial therapy and urinary catheterization being reported in one-third and one-fifth of these patients, respectively. Previous healthcare exposure was associated with a higher proportion of antibiotic non-susceptibility in the blood culture isolates (P = 0.001).Conclusion: Analysis of risk factors suggests the potential benefit of community-and hospital-related interventions, especially the better use of urinary catheters and improved antibiotic management of urinary tract infections. As part of the latter strategy, antibiotic resistance profiles need to be closely monitored to ensure that treatment guidelines are up to date to limit inappropriate empiric therapy.

TI  - Towards local governance of marine resources and ecosystems on Easter Island
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Social- ecological system sustainability depends in part upon the fit between ecosystems and institutions. 2. In 2014, the local community on Easter Island started a bottom- up process to improve marine resources conservation and management. 3. Local stakeholders formed a working group that has regular meetings and goals, such as creating a sea council and some basic action plans, thus initiating a local governance transformation process. 4. A participatory process was conducted together with a local organization that led the marine conservation issues on the island to define the factors that could favour and/ or undermine the formation of the sea council. Also, the stakeholders that must be present in such a sea council were identified. 5. Twelve factors that could facilitate or hinder the implementation of a sea council were identified. The lack of representativeness of public institutions is a major challenge. 6. Public institutions are designed to ensure compliance with central government strategies, but the decisions do not represent the worldview of islanders. 7. The results showed the potential value of conducting a participatory process to identify the key issues that could hinder or favour a desired governance transformation process. The participatory process also highlighted governance mismatches that are important to consider in attempts to pursue more effective fishery governance on Easter Island, and other Island communities. 8. Centralized governance systems do not respond rapidly to locally observed social and ecological dynamics. By contrast, a local decision- making system based on traditional laws and local governance can more rapidly respond to observed changes. 9. The participatory process presented here holds the potential to support local people in their planning and coordination for marine conservation and management in order to optimize bottom- up change processes involving multiple stakeholders with different interests, values and levels of power.

T2  - GEO-MARINE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) holds a high potential for remote sensing in intertidal areas. Geomorphic structures of the sediment surface generating patterns of water cover contrasting with exposed sediment surfaces can clearly be detected. This study explores intertidal bedforms on the upper flats bordering the island of Norderney in the German Wadden Sea using TerraSAR-X imagery from 2009 to 2015. Such bedforms are common in the Wadden Sea, forming crests alternating with water-covered troughs oriented in a north-easterly direction. In the western Norderney area, the crest-to-crest distance ranges from 50-130 m, and bedform length can reach 500 m. Maximum height differences between crests and troughs are 20 cm. A simple method is developed to extract the water-covered troughs from TerraSAR-X images for spatiotemporal analysis of bedform positions in a GIS. It is earmarked by unsupervised ISODATA classification of textural parameters, contrasting with various algorithm-based methods pursued in earlier studies of waterline detection. The high-frequency TerraSAR-X data reveal novel evidence of a bedform shift in an easterly direction during the study period. Height profiles measured with RTK-DGPS along defined transects support the findings from TerraSAR-X data. First investigations to characterise sediments and macrofauna show that benthic macrofauna community structure differs significantly between crests and troughs, comprising mainly fine sands. Evidently, bedform formation has implications for benthic faunal diversity in back-barrier settings of the Wadden Sea. SAR remote sensing provides pivotal data on bedform dynamics.

TI  - Integration of TerraSAR-X, RapidEye and airborne lidar for remote sensing of intertidal bedforms on the upper flats of Norderney (German Wadden Sea)
T2  - GEO-MARINE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Wadden Sea is a large coastal transition area adjoining the southern North Sea uniting ecological key functions with an important role in coastal protection. The region is strictly protected by EU directives and national law and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, requiring frequent quality assessments and regular monitoring. In 2014 an intertidal bedform area characterised by alternating crests and water-covered troughs on the tidal flats of the island of Norderney (German Wadden Sea sector) was chosen to test different remote sensing methods for habitat mapping: airborne lidar, satellite-based radar (TerraSAR-X) and electro-optical sensors (RapidEye). The results revealed that, although sensitive to different surface qualities, all sensors were able to image the bedforms. A digital terrain model generated from the lidar data shows crests and slopes of the bedforms with high geometric accuracy in the centimetre range, but high costs limit the operation area. TerraSAR-X data enabled identifying the positions of the bedforms reflecting the residual water in the troughs also with a high resolution of up to 1.1 m, but with larger footprints and much higher temporal availability. RapidEye data are sensitive to differences in sediment moisture employed to identify crest areas, slopes and troughs, with high spatial coverage but the lowest resolution (6.5 m). Monitoring concepts may differ in their remote sensing requirements regarding areal coverage, spatial and temporal resolution, sensitivity and geometric accuracy. Also financial budgets limit the selection of sensors. Thus, combining differing assets into an integrated concept of remote sensing contributes to solving these issues.

TI  - A Correlation-Based Joint CFAR Detector Using Adaptively-Truncated Statistics in SAR Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors only use the contrast information between ship targets and clutter, and they suffer probability of detection (PD) degradation in multiple target situations. This paper proposes a correlation-based joint CFAR detector using adaptively-truncated statistics (hereafter called TS-2DLNCFAR) in SAR images. The proposed joint CFAR detector exploits the gray intensity correlation characteristics by building a two-dimensional (2D) joint log-normal model as the joint distribution (JPDF) of the clutter, so joint CFAR detection is realized. Inspired by the CFAR detection methodology, we design an adaptive threshold-based clutter truncation method to eliminate the high-intensity outliers, such as interfering ship targets, side-lobes, and ghosts in the background window, whereas the real clutter samples are preserved to the largest degree. A 2D joint log-normal model is accurately built using the adaptively-truncated clutter through simple parameter estimation, so the joint CFAR detection performance is greatly improved. Compared with traditional CFAR detectors, the proposed TS-2DLNCFAR detector achieves a high PD and a low false alarm rate (FAR) in multiple target situations. The superiority of the proposed TS-2DLNCFAR detector is validated on the multi-look Envisat-ASAR and TerraSAR-X data.

TI  - Satellite-based estimation of actual evapotranspiration in the Buyuk Menderes Basin, Turkey
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the most important components of the hydrological cycle, but it is often the most difficult variable to determine at basin scale. Traditionally, ET is estimated using pointbased measurements collected at meteorological stations, but the non-spatial nature of these measurements often leads to significant errors when utilized at watershed scale. In this study, the METRIC (mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration) approach was evaluated using remotely sensed observations from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensor and data from meteorological stations in the lower catchment of the Buyuk Menderes Basin in western Turkey in the form of actual ET maps at daily and monthly intervals between 1st April and 30th September 2010. The energy fluxes and daily ET maps resulting from METRIC were compared with ET data estimated with the help of meteorological parameters. These results were found to be compatible with the ground-based estimations which suggest considerable potential for the METRIC model for estimating spatially distributed actual ET values with little ground-based weather data.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has prompted enhanced surveillance for respiratory infections among pilgrims returning from the Hajj, one of the largest annual mass gatherings in the world.Objectives: To describe the epidemiology and etiologies of respiratory illnesses among pilgrims returning to Jordan after the 2014 Hajj.Study design: Surveillance for respiratory illness among pilgrims returning to Jordan after the 2014 Hajj was conducted at sentinel health care facilities using epidemiologic surveys and molecular diagnostic testing of upper respiratory specimens for multiple respiratory pathogens, including MERS-CoV.Results: Among the 125 subjects, 58% tested positive for at least one virus; 47% tested positive for rhino/enterovirus. No cases of MERS-CoV were detected.Conclusions: The majority of pilgrims returning to Jordan from the 2014 Hajj with respiratory illness were determined to have a viral etiology, but none were due to MERS-CoV. A greater understanding of the epidemiology of acute respiratory infections among returning travelers to other countries after Hajj should help optimize surveillance systems and inform public health response practices.

AB  - The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of aqueous methanol extract of Grewia asiatica L. (500 mg/kg; p.o for 28 days) on lipid profile and coagulation parameters of Sprague Dawley rats and Swiss Albino mice. Lipid profile (triglyceride, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein in mg/dL) and coagulation parameters (thrombin, prothrombin, activated partial thromboplastin and fibrinogen time in s) were studied on 29th ZY day at the completion of treatment period using standard kits. Aqueous methanol extract at the dose of 500 mg/kg showed significant decrease in serum cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein level in both rats and mice as compared to control and hyperlipidemic group. Moreover, there was a significant increase in high density lipoprotein, thrombin, prothrombin, activated partial thromboplastin and fibrinogen time both in rats as well as mice. There was no mortality and sign of toxicity observed in the extract treated animals during the study.

TI  - An Analysis of the Discrepancies between MODIS and INSAT-3D LSTs in High Temperatures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In many disciplines, knowledge on the accuracy of Land Surface Temperature (LST) as an input is of great importance. One of the most efficient methods in LST evaluation is cross validation. Well-documented and validated polar satellites with a high spatial resolution can be used as references for validating geostationary LST products. This study attempted to investigate the discrepancies between a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and Indian National Satellite (INSAT-3D) LSTs for high temperatures, focusing on six deserts with sand dune land cover in the Middle East from 3 March 2015 to 24 August 2016. Firstly, the variability of LSTs in the deserts of the study area was analyzed by comparing the mean, Standard Deviation (STD), skewness, minimum, and maximum criteria for each observation time. The mean value of the LST observations indicated that the MYD-D observation times are closer to those of diurnal maximum and minimum LSTs. At all times, the LST observations exhibited a negative skewness and the STD indicated higher variability during times of MOD-D. The observed maximum LSTs from MODIS collection 6 showed higher values in comparison with the last versions of LSTs for hot spot regions around the world. After the temporal, spatial, and geometrical matching of LST products, the mean of the MODIS-INSAT LST differences was calculated for the study area. The results demonstrated that discrepancies increased with temperature up to +15.5 K. The slopes of the mean differences were relatively similar for all deserts except for An Nafud, suggesting an effect of View Zenith Angle (VZA). For modeling the discrepancies between two sensors in continuous space, the Diurnal Temperature Cycles (DTC) of both sensors were constructed and compared. The sample DTC models approved the results from discrete LST subtractions and proposed the uncertainties within MODIS DTCs. The authors proposed that the observed LST discrepancies in high temperatures could be the result of inherent differences in LST retrieval algorithms.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - ANTARES is currently the largest neutrino telescope operating in the Northern Hemisphere, aiming at the detection of high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources. Neutrino telescopes constantly monitor at least one complete hemisphere of the sky, and are thus well-suited to detect neutrinos produced in transient astrophysical sources. A time-dependent search has been applied to a list of 33 X-ray binaries undergoing high flaring activities in satellite data (RXTE/ASM, MAXI and Swift/BAT) and during hardness transition states in the 2008-2012 period. The background originating from interactions of charged cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere is drastically reduced by requiring a directional and temporal coincidence with astrophysical phenomena. The results of this search are presented together with comparisons between the neutrino flux upper limits and the neutrino flux predictions from astrophysical models. The neutrino flux upper limits resulting from this search limit the jet parameter space for some astrophysical models.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Mapping in a Heterogeneous Landscape Using Remote Sensing and Global Weather Datasets: Application to the Mara Basin, East Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration (ET) is a major water use flux in a basin water balance with crucial significance for water resources management and planning. Mapping ET with good accuracy has been the subject of ongoing research. Such mapping is even more challenging in heterogeneous and data-scarce regions. The main objective of our research is to estimate ET using daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) weather datasets based on the operational simplified surface energy balance (SSEBop) algorithm at a 1-km spatial scale and 8-day temporal resolution for the Mara Basin (Kenya/Tanzania). Unlike previous studies where the SSEBop algorithm was used, we use a seasonally-varying calibration coefficient for determining the "cold" reference temperature. Our results show that ET is highly variable, with a high inter-quartile range for wetlands and evergreen forest (24% to 29% of the median) and even up to 52% of the median for herbaceous land cover and rainfed agriculture. The basin average ET accounts for about 66% of the rainfall with minimal inter-annual variability. The basin scale validation using nine-years of monthly, gridded global flux tower-based ET (GFET) data reveals that our ET is able to explain 64% of the variance in GFET while the MOD16-NB (Nile Basin) explains 72%. We also observe a percent of bias (PBIAS) of 1.1% and 2.8%, respectively for SSEBop ET and MOD16-NB, indicating a good reliability in the ET estimates. Additionally, the SSEBop ET explains about 52% of the observed variability in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for a 16-day temporal resolution and 81% for the annual resolution, pointing to an increased reliability for longer aggregation periods. The annual SSEBop ET estimates are also consistent with the underlying primary (i.e., water and energy) and secondary (i.e., soil, topography, geology, land cover, etc.) controlling factors across the basin. This paper demonstrated how to effectively estimate and evaluate spatially-distributed and temporally-varying ET in data-scarce regions that can be applied elsewhere in the world where observed hydro-meteorological variables are limited.

TI  - Remotely-Sensed Early Warning Signals of a Critical Transition in a Wetland Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of an ecosystem to external drivers may not always be gradual and reversible. Discontinuous and sometimes irreversible changes, called 'regime shifts' or 'Critical transitions', can occur. The likelihood of such shifts is expected to increase for a variety of ecosystems, and it is difficult to predict how close an ecosystem is to a critical transition. Recent modelling studies identified indicators of impending regime shifts that can be used to provide early warning signals of a critical transition. The identification of such transitions crucially depends on the ability to monitor key ecosystem variables, and their success may be limited by lack of appropriate data. Moreover, empirical demonstrations of the actual functioning of these indicators in real-world ecosystems are rare. This paper presents the first study which uses remote sensing data to identify a critical transition in a wetland ecosystem. In this study, we argue that a time series of remote sensing data can help to characterize and determine the timing of a critical transition. This can enhance our abilities to detect and anticipate them. We explored the potentials of remotely sensed vegetation (NDVI), water (MNDWI), and vegetation- water (VWR) indices, obtained from time series of MODIS satellite images to characterize the stability of a wetland ecosystem, Dorge Sangi, near the lake Urmia, Iran, that experienced a regime shift recently. In addition, as a control case, we applied the same methods to another wetland ecosystem in Lake Arpi, Armenia which did not experience a regime shift. We propose a new composite index (MVWR) based on combining vegetation and water indices, which can improve the ability to anticipate a critical transition in a wetland ecosystem. Our results revealed that MVWR in combination with autocorrelation at-lag-1 could successfully provide early warning signals for a critical transition in a wetland ecosystem, and showed a significantly improved performance compared to either vegetation (NDVI) or water (MNDWI) indices alone.

TI  - Determination of As concentration in earthworm coelomic fluid extracts by total-reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry
T2  - SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART B-ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthworms are often used as sentinel organisms to study As bioavailability in polluted soils. Arsenic in earthworms is mainly, sequestrated in the coelomic fluids whose As content can therefore be used to asses As bioavalability. In this work, a method for determining As concentration in coelomic fluid extracts using total-reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF) is presented. For this purpose coelomic fluid extracts from earthworms living in three polluted soils and one non-polluted (control) soil have been collected and analysed. A very simple sample preparation was implemented, consisting of a dilution of the extracts with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) using a 1:8 ratio and dropwise deposition of the sample on the reflector. A detection limit of 02 mu g/1 and quantification limit of 0.6 mu g/1 was obtained in the diluted samples, corresponding to 2 mu g/I and 6 mu g/1 in the coelomic fluid extracts, respectively. This allowed to quantify As concentration in coelomic fluids extracted from earthworms living in soils polluted with As at concentrations higher than 20 mg/kg (considered as a pollution threshold for agricultural soils). The TXRF method has been validated by comparison with As concentrations in standards and by analysing the same samples by ICP-MS, after acid digestion of the sample. The low limit of detection, the proven reliability of the method and the little sample preparation make TXRF a suitable, cost-efficient and "green" technique for the analysis of As in earthworm coelomic fluid extracts for bioavailability studies.

TI  - The Nerd and His Discontent: The Seduction Community and the Logic of the Game as a Geeky Solution to the Challenges of Young Masculinity
T2  - MEN AND MASCULINITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the worldview of the seduction community operating within the homosocial spaces of North-American Guyland. This community provides seduction workshops catering mainly to men stereotyped as nerds who are situated at the bottom of the social-sexual hierarchy despite their privileged position in the postindustrial workplace. Based on content analysis of the community's self-help literature, the article argues that the community offers a geeky solution to the dilemmas of young masculinity and fosters a pickup model based on gaming logic. Courtship is construed as a standardized, rule-governed social skill and is characterized by hyperconsumerism and objectification of women. As part of his self-empowerment, the pickup artist adopts an avatar persona and employs teasing and make-believe techniques. As trainees aim to accomplish control over self and others in compliance with hegemonic masculinity, the strict reliance on gaming logic culminates in the dehumanization of all parties and suspends moral considerations.

TI  - "Sentinel Seizure" as a Warning Sign Preceding Fatal Rupture of a Giant Middle Cerebral Artery Aneurysm
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel headache is a well-known warning sign preceding subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) caused by rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. New-onset seizure or "sentinel seizure" preceding aneurysmal SAH, however, is uncommon.CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 51-year-old man with a new-onset seizure. Diagnostic workup revealed a giant middle cerebral artery aneurysm without evidence of subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage. Antiepileptic therapy was initiated, elective diagnostic angiography and subsequent treatment was scheduled, and the patient was discharged home. Four days later, he suddenly lost consciousness and subsequently died of a massive aneurysmal SAH.CONCLUSIONS: As with sentinel headache, new-onset seizures in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms might prompt immediate treatment to prevent imminent SAH with its subsequent high morbidity and mortality.

TI  - The rate, extent and spatial predictors of forest loss (2000-2012) in the terrestrial protected areas of the Philippines
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - While studies on deforestation of protected areas (PAs) have been conducted in many parts of the world, no comparative study has been done over an entire country in the tropics. Thus, we conducted a country-wide assessment of forest cover loss in all terrestrial protected areas of the Philippines, covering 198 PAs with a total area of 4.68 million ha. This study utilised Hansen's Landsat-derived global maps of forest cover change from 2000 to 2012, with tree canopy cover data for 2000 as the base year. Correlation and logistic regression analyses were employed to determine the significance and magnitude of the relationships between forest cover and 11 predictor variables. The assessment of forest loss reveals that the terrestrial protected areas are generally effective in reducing forest loss. Over the 12-year period, the average rate (2.59%) of forest clearing in protected areas is marginally lower by 0.1% than the entire country (2.69%). Within the same duration, the average forest loss rate within the 2-km buffer zones of selected protected areas is 1.4 times of those inside PAs. However, there was a significant number of PAs with phenomenal forest cover loss in terms of extent (48,583 ha over 12 years) and rate (up to 21%). We found that spatial predictor variables included in this study have weak or no relationships with forest cover, and hence they are not reliable inputs for predictive modelling. Comprehensive assessments of deforestation are needed at the micro-scale (e.g. single PA level) level and relatively shorter historical timeframe (e.g. less than a decade), to generate useful information for policy formulation, planning, and management.

TI  - Land-use/land-cover change: a key to understanding land degradation and relating environmental impacts in Northwestern Sinai, Egypt
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation and environmental impacts are major impediments to the utilization of land in many arid and semiarid regions of the world and are a major issue in the Northwestern Sinai (NWS), Egypt. Monitoring and detecting of land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) changes and land degradation are very important for the planners, governments and the scientific communities, particularly where there are increasing pressures from human and natural activities on the adjacent environment. Water-logged, saltaffected soils, coastal erosion and sand dunes encroachment are serious environmental hazards resulting in the wasteland and geoenvironmental risks. Presently, attempts have been made to analyze and determine the changes in LU/LC of NWS. The present work utilizes image processing and GIS techniques to determine most of the causes that result in intensive land degradations and recommends appropriate remedial measures within the NWS. Multi-temporal remote sensing data and ASTER GDEM were used to map the LU/ LC change areas. Many image processing techniques and statistical analysis were applied to draw numerous thematic and geospatial distribution maps for the degraded lands. The results showed that the rapid change in LC was attributed to human activities which led to heavy deteriorations of NWS environment. Also, the prevalence of natural risk corresponding to coastal erosion, water level rising and sand dunes encroachment increase the susceptibility of hazards to the NWS area. The current study provides decision makers and resources managers with appropriate remedial measures that are necessary to avoid severe future environmental difficulties within the NWS.

TI  - A Statistical Model for Describing the Texture of Cloud Cover Images from Satellite Data
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A statistical model is proposed which describes the texture of the images of 25 types of clouds from the MODIS satellite data with the spatial resolution of 250 m. A technique is presented which compiles the sets of image segments with typical textures for different cloud types. To describe the texture, the following statistical methods are applied: Gray-Level Co-occurrences Matrix, Gray-Level Difference Vector, and Sum and Difference Histogram. The correlation analysis is used to form the sets of informative textural features for the images of different cloud types. Two-parameter distribution laws and the estimates of their parameters are presented which describe fluctuations in the efficient set of textural features of different cloud types.

TI  - Heat Wave Vulnerability Mapping for India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing geographic variability in heat wave vulnerability forms the basis for planning appropriate targeted adaptation strategies. Given several recent deadly heatwaves in India, heat is increasingly being recognized as a public health problem. However, to date there has not been a country-wide assessment of heat vulnerability in India. We evaluated demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental vulnerability factors and combined district level data from several sources including the most recent census, health reports, and satellite remote sensing data. We then applied principal component analysis (PCA) on 17 normalized variables for each of the 640 districts to create a composite Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) for India. Of the total 640 districts, our analysis identified 10 and 97 districts in the very high and high risk categories (> 2SD and 2-1SD HVI) respectively. Mapping showed that the districts with higher heat vulnerability are located in the central parts of the country. On examination, these are less urbanized and have low rates of literacy, access to water and sanitation, and presence of household amenities. Therefore, we concluded that creating and mapping a heat vulnerability index is a useful first step in protecting the public from the health burden of heat. Future work should incorporate heat exposure and health outcome data to validate the index, as well as examine sub-district levels of vulnerability.

TI  - Flood Monitoring Using Satellite-Based RGB Composite Imagery and Refractive Index Retrieval in Visible and Near-Infrared Bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing provides significant information for the monitoring of natural disasters. Recently, on a global scale, floods have been increasing both in frequency and in magnitude. In order to map the inundation area, flooding events are investigated using unique RGB composite imagery based on the MODIS surface reflectance (MOD09GA) data obtained from the Terra satellite, which is used to visualize and analyze these events. This study proposes using an RGB combination of MODIS band 6 (1.64 mu m), band 5 (1.24 mu m), and band 2 (0.86 mu m) data from the visible and the near-infrared spectral ranges to map flood events. The flooding events that were investigated in this study occurred on 25 October 2015 along the Pampanga River in the Philippines, and on 28 July 2016 along the Poyang and Dongting Lakes in China. In the case of the Pampanga River, the inundated areas were estimated with surface reflectance (R) thresholds of 0.0 <= R-6 <= 0.102, 0.0 <= R-5 <= 0.138, and 0.03 <= R-2 <= 0.148 for MODIS bands 6, 5, and 2, respectively, which were determined using Otsu's method. The total inundated area was estimated to be 487.75 km(2). This estimate was indirectly compared with the results obtained from SENTINEL-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The total inundated area on 26 October 2015 for the case of the Pampanga River was estimated to be 486.37 km(2) using histogram analysis based on Otsu's method. For the flooding case in China, the total estimated inundated area using MODIS RGB imagery on 28 July 2016 and SAR on 3 August 2016 was 1148.25 km(2) and 1110.096 km(2), respectively. In addition, RGB imagery results using MODIS 6-5-2 bands were supported by the refractive index retrieval along the inundation area. A threshold of 1.6 for the real part of the complex refractive index allows for the discrimination between the flooded and non-flooded areas using the Hong and ASH approximations. This study shows that the RGB composite techniques using advanced sensors with more bands and higher spatio-temporal resolutions, and supported by the refractive index retrieval method, are useful for estimating flood events.

TI  - Curdlan induces selective mast cell degranulation without concomitant release of LTC<sub>4</sub>, IL-6 or CCL2
T2  - IMMUNOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mast cells are sentinel cells with a tissue-specific localization in the interface between the host and the external environment. Their quick and selective response upon encountering pathogens is part of the innate host response and typically initiates the following adaptive immune response. Among several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) involved in the recognition of pathogens by mast cells, the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1 has been associated with the recognition of fungi. OUr previous studies have shown that mast cells are the predominant cell type expressing Dectin-1 in human skin, and they also recognize and respond to Malassezia sympodialis by producing cytokines connected to the innate host response and upregulating the expression of Dectin-1. In the present study, we investigated mast cell responses to Curdlan, a beta-glucan that acts as an agonist for the fungi receptor Dectin-1, and found a unique response pattern with induced degranulation, but surprisingly without synthesis of Leukotriene C-4, IL-6 or CCL2. Since mast cells are the predominant Dectin-1 expressing cell in the human skin, this study suggests that mast cell degranulation in response to fungi is an important part of the first line of defense against these pathogens.

TI  - Was the extreme Northern Hemisphere greening in 2015 predictable?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The year 2015 was, at the time, the warmest since 1880, and many regions in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) registered record breaking annual temperatures. Simultaneously, a remarkable and widespread growing season greening was observed over most of the NH in the record from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). While the response of vegetation to climate change (i.e. the long term trend) is assumed to be predictable, it is still unclear whether it is also possible to predict the interannual variability in vegetation activity.Here, we evaluate whether the unprecedented magnitude and extent of the greening observed in 2015 corresponds to an expected response to the 2015 climate anomaly, or to a change in the sensitivity of NH vegetation to climate. We decompose NDVI into the long-term and interannual variability components, and find that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) explain about half of NDVI interannual variability. This response is in addition to the long-term temperature and human-induced greening trend. We use a simple statistical approach to predict the NDVI anomaly in 2015, using the PDO and AMO states as predictors for interannual variability, and temperature and precipitation trends for the long-term component.We show that the 2015 anomaly can be predicted as an expected vegetation response to temperature and water-availability associated with the very strong state of the PDO in 2015. The link found between climate variability patterns and vegetation activity should contribute to increase the predictability of carbon-cycle processes at interannual time-scales, which may be relevant, for instance, for optimizing land-management strategies.

TI  - Sentinel node metastasis mitotic rate (SN-MMR) as a prognostic indicator of rapidly progressing disease in patients with sentinel node-positive melanomas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Risk stratification of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB)-positive patients with malignant melanoma differs among current classification systems. To improve classification of patients with rapidly progressive disease who may profit from adjuvant therapy with novel immune or targeted treatment modalities, a single-center retrospective analysis was performed including all melanoma patients diagnosed with a positive SN at a university-based skin cancer center over a 10-year period (2002-2012) ( 96 of 419 patients). Sentinel node metastasis mitotic rate (SN-MMR) and further histologic parameters were determined by blinded histological re-evaluation and correlated with clinical follow-up (overall [OS], melanoma-specific [MSS], and diseasefree survival [DFS]). Median follow-up was 53 months. In univariate analyses, SN tumor penetrative depth (TPD), maximum tumor diameter (MTD), number of positive SN,SN-MMR and the S-, Rotterdam, RDC, Hannover I and II classification systems correlated with OS, MSS and DFS. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that a binary classification system based only on the SN-MMR (< 1 vs. >= 1 mitoses/mm(2)) was the strongest independent prognostic indicator for all endpoints analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analyses confirmed binary SN-MMR to be superior to stratify patients into high-and low-risk groups (45.45% vs. 87.92% 5-yr MSS). The general prognostic validity of the published SN classification systems was confirmed. The novel SNMMR classification system may improve discrimination of patients with slowly and rapidly progressive disease. We therefore propose its implementation into clinical practice as the SN-MMR can be easily and reliably determined in routine pathology reports. Its prognostic value for the selection of patients amenable to adjuvant therapies should be studied in clinical trials.

TI  - Deforestation and cattle expansion in the Paraguayan Chaco 1987-2012
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The dry forests of Latin America are among the most dynamic deforestation frontiers in the world and are important carbon and biodiversity reservoirs. Our knowledge on the spatial patterns of deforestation and its proximate drivers remains partial though. We used the full Landsat image archive to reconstruct deforestation and post-deforestation dynamics between 1987 and 2012 for the entire Paraguayan Chaco, where deforestation has been rampant recently. Our classification resulted in reliable land-use change maps (86.16%), highlighting drastic forest losses of almost 44,000 km(2) between 1987 and 2012, equaling a deforestation rate of 27% and about 1% yearly, predominantly for grasslands. These likely represented new pastures, making pasture expansion the dominant proximate cause of deforestation. Cropland expansion, in contrast, only played a minor role as a proximate deforestation cause in the Paraguayan Chaco. Deforestation more than doubled between 2001 and 2012 (similar to 29,000 km(2)) compared to 1987-2000 (similar to 14,000 km(2)), due to leakage effects from the deforestation ban in the Paraguayan Atlantic Forests in 2004. Interestingly, while grasslands expanded in the Paraguayan Chaco between 1987 and 2000, cattle numbers decreased during the same time period, though strongly increased since. This apparent decoupling of area change and land-use intensity may indicate that the Paraguayan Chaco experienced an amplification period during the 1990s followed by an intensification period since 2001. Thus, our results highlight the need for both, a more detailed monitoring of post-deforestation dynamics and a land systems perspective in order to understand deforestation frontiers and thus ultimately to identify strategies to better balance production and conservation goals.

TI  - Leaf reflectance and transmission properties (350-2500 nm): Implications for vegetation indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - At moderate to high leaf area index (values 3-5), many ratio-based vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), reach an asymptote where the linear relationship between leaf area index and vegetation index value breaks down. The red and near infrared channels are used to calculate most ratio vegetation indices when using sensors such as Landsat; however, these channels sense very different depths in vegetation canopies due to differences in transmittance, which may explain this breakdown of vegetation indices. In laboratory-simulated canopies composed of four deciduous species, visible wavelengths (similar to 400-700 nm) were mostly attenuated by the first or second leaf layer, while near infrared wavelengths were substantially transmitted beyond the sixth or seventh leaf layer. Absolute changes in reflectance > 1% were seen in some canopies up to four leaf layers thick in the near infrared wavelengths. Therefore, in natural canopies, near infrared wavelengths have a greater probability of penetrating to the soil/litter background than visible wavelengths, which may impact vegetation indices that use both visible and near infrared wavelengths for canopies between two and seven layers thick. While this was a preliminary study that isolated the canopy depth variable, polynomial regression analysis showed that differences in canopy thickness explained most of the observed variability in canopy reflectance. These results will facilitate the development and assessment of spectral vegetation indices that would probe canopies to consistent depths.

TI  - Biomass Estimation of Xerophytic Forests Using Visible Aerial Imagery: Contrasting Single-Tree and Area-Based Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A large part of arid areas in tropical and sub-tropical regions are dominated by sparse xerophytic vegetation, which are essential for providing products and services for local populations. While a large number of researches already exist for the derivation of wall-to-wall estimations of above ground biomass (AGB) with remotely sensed data, only a few of them are based on the direct use of non-photogrammetric aerial photography. In this contribution we present an experiment carried out in a study area located in the Santiago Island in the Cape Verde archipelago where a National Forest Inventory (NFI) was recently carried out together with a new acquisition of a visible high-resolution aerial orthophotography. We contrasted two approaches: single-tree, based on the automatic delineation of tree canopies; and area-based, on the basis of an automatic image classification. Using 184 field plots collected for the NFI we created parametric models to predict AGB on the basis of the crown projection area (CPA) estimated from the two approaches. Both the methods produced similar root mean square errors (RMSE) at pixel level 45% for the single-tree and 42% for the area-based. However, the latest was able to better predict the AGB along all the variable range, limiting the saturation problem which is evident when the CPA tends to reach the full coverage of the field plots. These findings demonstrate that in regions dominated by sparse vegetation, a simple aerial orthophoto can be used to successfully create AGB wall-to-wall predictions. The level of these estimations' uncertainty permits the derivation of small area estimations useful for supporting a more correct implementation of sustainable management practices of wood resources.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 4th JCOMM Workshop on Advances in Marine Climatology (CLIMAR)
CL  - Asheville, NC
AB  - The in situ surface marine climate observing system includes contributions from several different types of observing platforms. Most observations come from mobile platforms, e.g. ships or surface drifting buoys. Climate applications using marine observations often require fields of environmental parameters to be constructed on regular spatiotemporal grids. User requirements are therefore typically presented in terms of parameter uncertainty at particular space and timescales. It is therefore important to relate the characteristics of marine observations, in terms of their expected quality and sampling distribution, to these requirements. A simple method to estimate the instrumental uncertainty in fields derived from a mixture of observation types is presented. This method enables preliminary assessment of the extent to which the available observations meet the stated user requirements. Example observing system adequacy assessments are presented for two climate variables, sea surface temperature (SST) and marine air temperature (MAT) using in situ data. The method is also applicable to gridded data sets constructed from combined in situ and satellite data. While the global metrics for SST show an improvement in observing system adequacy over time, the adequacy for MAT is declining. The assessments can determine the most efficient approach to improving observing system adequacy. For in situSST the best approach would be to increase the number of different platforms making observations. For MAT, increasing the number of observations overall, regardless of platform and increasing the geographical coverage is required to reduce the uncertainty. The assessments would be improved by more extensive evaluation of uncertainties associated with each different variable for each platform type. It would also be beneficial to review the completeness of the user requirements: e.g. to include user requirements relating to the stability of averages on large space and timescales required for climate monitoring, or for constructing estimates of air-sea exchange.

TI  - National Inventory of Rabi Pulses in India Using Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A scheme called National Food Security Mission was launched by Government of India in 2007 for wheat, rice and pulses crops. At the request of Ministry of Agriculture for monitoring intensification of pulses a project called Pulses Intensification was taken up in Rabi season 2012-2013. Reliable statistics using advanced methods is very important for variety of pulse crops. Remotely sensed data can help in pre-harvest area estimation of pulse crops. Pulses in India are grown as partly scattered and partly contiguous crop. Growth in scattered areas and poor vegetation canopy of some of the pulse crops poses a challenge in its identification and discrimination using remotely sensed data. National Inventory of Rabi pulse crops in major growing regions of northern and southern parts of India was attempted. Multi-date AWiFS data and multi-date NDVI products of AWiFS of Rabi season 2014-2015 were used to study spectral-temporal behavior of pulse crops. Pulse crops accuracies of more than 95 % was observed in contiguous areas and 50-80.77 % in scattered regions. All India area estimate of Rabi pulses for the year 2014-2015 was 8963.327 '000 ha.

TI  - Developing theories and models to serve: A manifesto for indigenous psychologists
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - This article reviews the theoretical foundations of Height Psychology, which proposes that researchers not only do research but act on their ideas to make the world a better place. It is posited that researchers should be passionate humanist whose thoughts propel actions and whose actions propel new thoughts, and they should be engaged change agents who work with communities in defining and solving problems rather than being disinterested scientists who are only interested in creating a body of objective knowledge. This approach is likely to fit the worldview of non-western psychologists engaged in indigenous psychology, and also allow the development of global psychology that is culturally integrated and not excessively biased toward western or experimental psychology.

TI  - High and Medium Resolution Satellite Imagery to Evaluate Late Holocene Human-Environment Interactions in Arid Lands: A Case Study from the Central Sahara
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present preliminary results of an Earth observation approach for the study of past human occupation and landscape reconstruction in the Central Sahara. This region includes a variety of geomorphological features such as palaeo-oases, dried river beds, alluvial fans and upland plateaux whose geomorphological characteristics, in combination with climate changes, have influenced patterns of human dispersal and sociocultural activities during the late Holocene. In this paper, we discuss the use of medium-and high-resolution remotely sensed data for the mapping of anthropogenic features and paleo-and contemporary hydrology and vegetation. In the absence of field inspection in this inaccessible region, we use different remote sensing methods to first identify and classify archaeological features, and then explore the geomorphological factors that might have influenced their spatial distribution.

TI  - A regional water balance indicator inferred from satellite images of an Andean endorheic basin in central-western Argentina
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Central Andes of Argentina (30-37 degrees S), snowmelt is the main source of freshwater, an essential natural resource for similar to 2.2 million people in the adjacent arid lowlands. In this region, Laguna Llancanelo collects the water inputs from the Malargue endorheic basin. Previous studies concerning the annual and intra-annual variations of this lagoon and its relationship with regional climate are rare. We obtained a monthly record for the Laguna Llancanelo area (LLA, 1984-2013) using the modified normalized difference water index derived from Landsat images. Monthly LLA ranges between 35 km(2) and 411km(2) and is significantly related to variations of the Rio Malargue, the main snow-fed tributary to the lagoon. There is no long-term relationship between LLA and local rainfall, but rapid increases in LLA result from heavy rainfall around the lagoon. Conversely, rapid reductions in LLA encompass periods with both reduced discharge from the Rio Malargue and low local rainfall. The LLA integrates moisture of both Pacific (snowfall in the upper Andes) and Atlantic (lowland rainfall) origins; therefore, we propose using LLA as an indicator of regional water balance.

TI  - The sentinel and the rebel. Multi-choice policing in Burundi and the state-centered approach of security sector reform
T2  - CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article seeks to develop a back-to-back approach to the notions of 'security governance' and 'security sector reform'. It draws on two small-scale grassroots policing arrangements in Burundi, arguably falling out-of-scope of state management, to question the notion of 'wide security sector reform' as promoted by the development aid community. The use of informal sentinels, guarding almost every commercial and domestic buildings in Bujumbura and the reconversion of bandits into guards in the countryside, make both a case for considering the grassroots policing arrangements in Burundi as blind spots of security sector reform. Accordingly, the article shows how, in a transitioning context where different agents and normativities - namely the government, the police, corporate security actors, donor states and institutions, individuals, transnational norms on (private) security and local dynamics - are intertwined in the provision of security, discrepancies between donor discourses and local dynamics remain at work. While recent conceptualizations of security sector reform formally depart from state-centered views of security governance, implementation on the ground still resists holistic approaches of security. To a certain extent, these discrepancies reflect the theoretical debate over the state's role in security governance, particularly in contexts where concerns about democratic oversight, the rule of law and accountability arise. In this sense, the article intends to contribute to recent insights on critical security sector reform and nodal security governance.

TI  - Validation of MODIS and VIIRS derived aerosol optical depth over complex coastal waters
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the,Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) was applied to both MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suits (VIIRS) images to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) over water for blue, green and red wavelengths at 500 m (MODISSARA) and 750 m (VIIRSSARA) resolutions, respectively. Retrievals were compared with the Terra-MODIS Dark Target (DT) AOD at 3 km resolution (MODIS3K) and the VIIRS Environmental Data Record (VIIRSEDR) AOD at 6 km resolution, Validation was conducted using 86 Microtops II Sun photometer AOD measurements collected over different classes of water quality (low to high sediment levels) for seven days (6, 8, 9,13, and 15, 16 and 17 October 2014) between 10:00 to 15:00 local time. Thirty-eight to fifty percent and 44-54% of the MODIS3K and the VIIRSEDR AOD retrievals respectively, fall within the expected error (EE) with root mean square error from 0.12 to 0.14 and mean absolute error from 0.10 to 0.11. The MODISSARA and the VIIRSSARA AOD retrievals are well correlated with the ground-based measurements (R: MODISSARA = 0.86-0.89 and VIIRSSARA = 0.85-0.94), with a larger number of retrievals falling within the EE MODISSARA = 73-77% and VIIRSSARA = 71,82%) than MODIS3K and VIIRSEDR. The results indicate that the SARA algorithm is more robust than MODIS3K and VIIRSEDR global AOD products, and can retrieve accurate AOD over low to highly sedimented water surfaces, similar to good AOD retrievals over land.

TI  - Comparisons of Global Terrestrial Surface Water Datasets over 15 Years
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Continental surface water extents and dynamics are key information to model Earth's hydrological and biochemical cycles. This study presents global and regional comparisons between two multisatellite surface water extent datasets, the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) and the Surface Water Microwave Product Series (SWAMPS), for the 1993-2007 period, along with two widely used static inundation datasets, the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD) and the Matthews and Fung wetland estimates. Maximum surface water extents derived from these datasets are largely different: similar to 13 x 10(6) km(2) from GLWD, 5.3 x 10(6) km(2) from Matthews and Fung, similar to 6.2 x 10(6) km(2) from GIEMS, and similar to 10.3 x 10(6) km(2) from SWAMPS. SWAMPS global maximum surface extent reduces by nearly 51% (to similar to 5 x 10(6) km(2)) when applying a coastal filter, showing a strong contamination in this retrieval over the coastal regions. Anomalous surface waters are also detected with SWAMPS over desert areas. The seasonal amplitude of the GIEMS surface waters is much larger than the SWAMPS estimates, and GIEMS dynamics is more consistent with other hydrological variables such as the river discharge. Over the Amazon basin, GIEMS and SWAMPS show a very high time series correlation (95%), but with SWAMPS maximum extent half the size of that from GIEMS and from previous synthetic aperture radar estimates. Over the Niger basin, SWAMPS seasonal cycle is out of phase with both GIEMS and MODIS-derived water extent estimates, as well as with river discharge data.

TI  - Am I My Sister's Keeper? Linking Domestic Violence Attitudes to Black Racial Identity
T2  - JOURNAL OF BLACK PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This exploratory online investigation sought to examine the links between African American college women's gender role attitudes, Black racial identity attitudes, and domestic violence attitudes toward African American women in heterosexual marital relationships where domestic violence occurs (N = 192). Less sophisticated Black racial identity attitudes (i.e., pre-encounter and immersion-emersion) predicted greater self-reports of justifying domestic violence toward African American women and believing that African American women benefit from abuse. Pre-encounter and immersion-emersion attitudes also predicted less willingness to help victims. An Afrocentric worldview (i.e., internalization Afrocentricity) was positively predictive of believing that African American women benefit from domestic violence as well as greater willingness to help victims. Appreciating one's African American identity and other racial and ethnic groups (i.e., internalization multiculturalist inclusive) predicted less justification, fewer reports that African American women benefit from abuse, and a greater willingness to help victims. Post hoc mediation analyses revealed that gender role attitudes and an investment in protecting African American male domestic violence perpetrators (i.e., Black male victimage and justification beliefs) mediated the link between internalization Afrocentricity attitudes and the belief that African American women benefit from abuse.

TI  - Preferential processing of emotionally and self-relevant stimuli persists in unconscious N2 sleep
T2  - BRAIN AND LANGUAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Information processing has been suggested to depend on the current state of the brain as well as stimulus characteristics (e.g. salience). We compared processing of salient stimuli (subject's own names [SONS] and angry voice [AV] stimuli) to processing of unfamiliar names (UNs) and neutral voice (NV) stimuli across different vigilance stages (i.e. wakefulness as well as sleep stages N1 and N2) by means of event-related oscillatory responses during wakefulness and a subsequent afternoon nap. Our findings suggest that emotional prosody and self-relevance drew more attentional resources during wakefulness with specifically AV stimuli being processed more strongly. During NI, SONs were more arousing than UNs irrespective of prosody. Moreover, emotional and self-relevant stimuli evoked stronger responses also during N2 sleep suggesting a 'sentinel processing mode' of the brain during this state of naturally occurring unconsciousness. Finally, this initial preferential processing of salient stimuli during N2 sleep seems to be followed by an inhibitory sleep-protecting process, which is reflected by a K-complex-like response.

TI  - WILL DRONES REDUCE INVESTIGATOR DISTURBANCE TO SURFACE-NESTING BIRDS?
T2  - MARINE ORNITHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many colonial-nesting seabird species are highly threatened, and their conservation is a global priority. Yet long-term population data for many species are sporadic. given the location. physical nature of many colonies, and known negative impacts of investigator interaction. The low cost of unmanned aerial systems (UASs), or drones, has democratized access to remote sensing data with high spatial and temporal resolution. Although there are limitations and risks of employing drones for conservation and data-collection purposes, the benefits include the ability to monitor a greater number of colonies at higher spatial and temporal resolutions than traditional field methods. The establishment of drone-operation guidelines, however, is an important first-step in minimizing disturbance to surface-nesting birds, given that many surface-nesting birds are particularly vulnerable to disturbances that can reduce reproductive output and increase stress responses. Research on the disturbance to wildlife from drones is in its infancy, but here we briefly review whether and how studies have evaluated the impact of drones on their study species. We review as well the variability in physiological and behavioural responses observed, and whether the studies evaluated the risk of malfunction or crashes, common with off-the-shelf drone platforms. We found that attention to evaluating disturbance and risk assessments has been limited, but preliminary evidence suggests drones can reduce disturbance impacts on some species. On the other hand, in the face of widespread drone deployment, inexpensive and rapid data collection should not be put ahead of the potential risk and impact on species.

TI  - Contribution of SPECT/CT for sentinel node localization in patients with ipsilateral breast cancer relapse
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years repeat sentinel node (SN) biopsy has been proven to be feasible in local breast cancer recurrence (LBCR). However, in these patients SNs outside the ipsilateral axilla are frequently observed. This study evaluates the contribution of SPECT/CT for SN localization and surgical adjustment in LBCR patients.SN biopsy was performed in 122 LBCR patients (median age 60.5 years, range 24-87), enrolled from August 2006 to July 2015. Median disease-free time lapse was 109.5 months (range 9-365). Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) had previously been performed in 55 patients, SN biopsy in 44, both techniques in 13 and fine-needle aspiration in 10. Primary breast cancer treatment included radiotherapy in 104 patients (85.3 %) and chemotherapy in 40 (32.8 %). Preoperative lymphatic mapping, using planar scintigraphy (PS) and SPECT/CT included report of SN location according to lymph node territory. In case of a territorial PS-SPECT/CT mismatch, surgery was adjusted according to SPECT/CT findings.SPECT/CT SN visualization rate was higher than PS (53.3 % vs. 43.4 %, p n.s.) with, in total, 19 additional SN (118 vs. 99, p n.s.). PS-SPECT/CT territory mismatch, found in 60 % (39/65) of patients with SN visualization, led to surgical adjustment in 21.3 % (26/122) of patients. The SN procedure was finally performed in 104 patients resulting in a 65.7 % surgical retrieval rate with a total of 132 removed SNs (1.86/patient). SN metastases were found in 17/71 patients (23.9 %), in 16 of them (94 %) in ipsilateral basins outside the axilla or in the contralateral axilla.Using SPECT/CT there is a trend to visualize more SNs in LBCR, providing at the same time important anatomical information to adjust intraoperative SN procedures. The addition of SPECT/CT to the standard imaging protocol may lead to better staging mainly in patients presenting drainage outside the ipsilateral axilla.

TI  - Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lip-A Review of Squamous Cell Carcinogenesis of the Mucosal and Cutaneous Junction
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND The lip is an anatomic junction for 2 disparate groups of cancer. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a common malignancy with a favorable prognosis, whereas oral-mucosal squamous cell carcinoma (omSCC) is associated with significantly higher rates of nodal disease and worse outcomes. The squamous cell carcinoma of the lip (lip SCC) is more aggressive than cSCC but less aggressive than omSCC. However, work-up and treatment vary between specialties.OBJECTIVES The authors sought to review and compare the risk factors and clinical behavior of cSCC, omSCC, and lip SCC, review tumor biology of squamous cell carcinoma, and compare work-up and treatment algorithms for lip SCC.METHODS A comprehensive PubMed and MEDLINE database search was performed with comparison of primary literature on cSCC, omSCC, and lip SCC.RESULTS Lip SCC exhibits rates of nodal metastasis and death that are intermediate between cSCC and omSCC, and shares many similar biologic mechanisms. There are variations in the treatment guidelines between dermatology and otolaryngology for lip SCC.CONCLUSION Lip SCC is an overlapping entity that poses many challenges to clinicians. Specialists should be aware of current staging modalities as well as imaging and treatment recommendations to optimize patient outcomes.

TI  - Mapping boreal peatland ecosystem types from multitemporal radar and optical satellite imagery
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to distinguish peatland types at the landscape scale has implications for inventory, conservation, estimation of carbon storage, fuel loading, and postfire carbon emissions, among others. This paper presents a multisensor, multiseason remote sensing approach to delineate boreal peatland types (wooded bog, open fen, shrubby fen, treed fen) using a combination of multiple dates of L-band (24 cm) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) from ALOS PALSAR, C-band (similar to 5.6 cm) from ERS-1 or ERS-2, and Landsat 5 TM optical remote sensing data. Imagery was first evaluated over a small test area of boreal Alberta, Canada, to determine the feasibility of using multisensor SAR and optical data to discriminate peatland types. Then object-based and (or) machine-learning classification algorithms were applied to 3.4 million ha of peatland-rich subregions of Alberta, Canada, and the 4.24 million ha region of Michigan's Upper Peninsula where peatlands are less dominant. Accuracy assessments based on field-sampled sites show high overall map accuracies (93%-94% for Alberta and Michigan), which exceed those of previous mapping efforts.

M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection is one of the main applications in earth observation but currently there are only a few approaches based on radar imagery. Available techniques strongly focus on optical data. These techniques are often limited to static analyses of image pairs and are frequently lacking results which address the requirements of the user. Some of these shortcomings include integration of user's expertise, transparency of methods, and communication of results in a comprehensive understandable way. This study introduces an index describing changes in the savanna ecosystem around the refugee camp Djabal, Eastern Chad, based on a time-series of ALOS PALSAR data between 2007 and 2017. Texture based land-use/land cover classifications are transferred to values of natural resources which include comprehensive pertinent expert knowledge about the contributions of the classes to environmental integrity and human security. Changes between the images are analyzed, within grid cells of one kilometer diameter, according to changes of natural resources and the variability of these changes. Our results show the highest resource availability for the year of 2008 but no general decline in natural resources. Largest loss of resources occurred between 2010 and 2011 but regeneration could be observed in the following years. Neither the settlements nor the wadi areas of high ecologic importance underwent significant changes during the last decade.

TI  - Delayed Tumor Seeding Along Axillary Lymph Node Biopsy Tract Visualized on FDG PET/CT
T2  - CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - A 59-year-old woman with right breast cancer underwent an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of a right axilla lymph node. Pathology results revealed metastases from breast cancer. The patient had serial FDG PET/CT scans for further workup and therapy assessment during the disease course. Hypermetabolic tumor seeding along the needle biopsy tract was not evident at FDG PET/CT scan performed 5 weeks after biopsy but became apparent at 10 weeks after biopsy and progressed subsequently.

TI  - An update on the latest evidence for managing the clinically negative neck (cN0) in oral squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - ORAL DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - The single most important prognostic indicator for survival in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the presence of lymph node metastases in the neck. While the treatment of the clinically node positive (cN+) neck is well established, the management of the clinically negative neck (cN0) is controversial. Various strategies have been advocated including close observation including regular ultrasound imaging, elective neck dissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Neck dissection surgery is not without potential morbidity with shoulder dysfunction being the main complication. A number of factors are associated with increased risk of neck node metastasis including primary tumour thickness and peri-neural invasion. A recent prospective randomised trial has found survival benefit following neck dissection even in patients with a cN0 neck at presentation. We discuss the latest evidence for managing the cN0 in OSCC and include our own experience on the role of neck dissection in certain cases.

TI  - In aid of (re)discovered species: maximizing conservation insights from minimal data
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - New species discoveries or the rediscovery of species once considered extinct or extirpated is good news, and yet prospects for long-term survival may be bleak if remnant populations are small and isolated. Because (re)discovered species are commonly rare or cryptic, data to inform appropriate conservation actions are usually sparse. We demonstrate how to make the most of available data, using the recent rediscovery in Ghana of sitatunga Tragelaphus spekei as an illustrative case study. Sitatunga were thought extinct in Ghana for over 50years, but were rediscovered' by science in Avu Lagoon in 1998. Little is known about this species, especially West African populations, given its cryptic nature and inaccessible wetland habitat. Our approach to maximizing insights given limited data first paired observations of occurrence with landscape characteristics derived from open-access remote sensing data, creating the first ever habitat suitability model for sitatunga. This model then served to: (1) elucidate habitat preferences; (2) assess possible existence and connectivity of remnant populations elsewhere in Ghana; and (3) estimate maximum total and effective population size. Moreover, the timing of occurrence sightings provided insights into behavior. Sitatunga sightings were rare, heavily male-biased and mostly occurred between 6pm and 6am. Suitable habitat was limited, suggesting that habitat in and near Avu Lagoon is insufficient to ensure long-term population viability, and the existence of other, connected populations in Ghana is improbable. Without continued protection, and possibly additional interventions to augment population numbers or gene flow, the sitatunga in Avu Lagoon will likely go extinct. Our case study demonstrates the conservation challenges associated with the rediscovery of relict populations, and the utility of applying tools such as habitat suitability models to sparse data. Moreover, our research stresses the need to implement immediate conservation action upon species (re)discoveries to prevent (regional) extinction.

TI  - Local temperature response to land cover and management change driven by non-radiative processes
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Following a land cover and land management change (LCMC), local surface temperature responds to both a change in available energy and a change in the way energy is redistributed by various non-radiative mechanisms. However, the extent to which non-radiative mechanisms contribute to the local direct temperature response for different types of LCMC across the world remains uncertain. Here, we combine extensive records of remote sensing and in situ observation to show that non-radiative mechanisms dominate the local response in most regions for eight of nine common LCMC perturbations. We find that forest cover gains lead to an annual cooling in all regions south of the upper conterminous United States, northern Europe, and Siberia-reinforcing the attractiveness of re-/afforestation as a local mitigation and adaptation measure in these regions. Our results affirm the importance of accounting for non-radiative mechanisms when evaluating local land-based mitigation or adaptation policies.

TI  - Spatial prediction of rainfall-induced landslides for the Lao Cai area (Vietnam) using a hybrid intelligent approach of least squares support vector machines inference model and artificial bee colony optimization
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study is to produce a landslide susceptibility map for the Lao Cai area (Vietnam) using a new hybrid intelligent method based on least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) and artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, namely LSSVM-BC. LSSVM and ABC are state-of-the-art soft computing techniques that have been rarely utilized in landslide susceptibility assessment. LSSVM is adopted to develop landslide prediction model whereas ABC was used to optimize the prediction model by identifying an appropriate set of the LSSVM hyper-parameters. To establish the hybrid intelligent method, a GIS database with ten landslide-influencing factors and 340 landslide locations that occurred mainly during the last 20-years was constructed. These historical landslide locations were collected from the existing inventories that sourced from (i) five landslide projects carried out in this study areas before and (ii) interpretations of SPOT satellite images with resolution of 2.5 m. The study area was geographically split into two different parts, with landslides located in the first part was used for building models whereas the other landslides in the second part was used for the model validation. Performance of the LSSVM-BC model was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC). Result shows that the prediction power of the model is good with the area under the curve (AUC) = 0.900. Experiments have pointed out the prediction power of the LSSVM-BC is better than that obtained from the popular support vector machines. Therefore, the proposed model is a promising tool for spatial prediction of landslides at the study area. The landslide susceptibility map is useful for landuse planning for the Lao Cai area.

TI  - Predictive Model for Non-Sentinel Lymph Node Status in Thai Breast Cancer Patients with Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
T2  - Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a standard procedure for axillary staging in breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillary nodes. Several models were developed to predict the probability of non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastases. However, differences in technique and setting may impact the accuracy of the models.Objective: To create novel models for predicting the probability of NSLN metastases and to validate the existing models in Thai breast cancer patients.Material and Method: Breast cancer patients who underwent SLN biopsy at the Division of Head Neck and Breast Surgery, Department of Surgery, Siriraj Hospital from January 2009 to October 2013 were recruited. All SLN biopsies were identified by blue dye and immediately examined by frozen section. All frozen SLNs were defrosted and confirmed by permanent section. The patients with positive SLN (either from frozen or permanent section) underwent axillary dissection. Associations between clinico-pathological parameters and NSLN status were determined by Chi-square statistics. Logistic regression was performed to create the predictive models.Results: Four hundred and thirty breast cancer patients who had positive SLN and underwent axillary lymph node dissection were recruited. NSLN metastasis accounted for 48.37% of the patients with positive SLN. In frozen section model, tumor type, tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, and ratio of positive SLN were associated with NSLN status. Tumor type, tumor size, ratio of positive SLN, and presence of extranodal extension of SLN were associated with NSLN status in permanent section model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) = 0.754 for frozen section model and 0.781 for permanent section model. Validation of the models in 56 patients revealed AUC of 0.788 and 0.831 for frozen and permanent section, respectively. The novel models better predict NSLN metastasis, when compared to the previously published models.Conclusion: The authors created two models using frozen and permanent section status of SLN which were practical and accurately predict NSLN status for Thai breast cancer patients.

TI  - Multiple spectral indices to predict the variability of structural and functional attributes in arid areas
T2  - Ecologia Austral
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Argentinean Patagonia, the main driving forces of degradation are the extractive activities (oil and mining) and sheep ranching. Determine the ability of spectral indices to predict the spatial variability of structural and functional attributes of arid ecosystems would help to identify patterns associated with desertification or passive restoration. One of the main problems in these environments is their large territorial extension. Thus, remote sensing indices could be useful tools for assessing these areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of multiple spectral indices SPOT 5 satellite to predict the spatial variability of a structural attribute (perennial vegetation cover) and of a functional attribute (forage production) in arid areas. We assessed the relationship of seven spectral indices obtained from the satellite SPOT 5 in 39 sites located in three landscape units: coastal valleys (n=7), plateaus (n=18) and eastern valleys (n=18) in central Patagonia (Argentina). The green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), the two modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI2), the ratio vegetation index (RVI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were the best predictors of perennial vegetation cover at landscape level. The spectral indices accounted for more than 34% of the variation in forage production in whole study area and for more than 60% in the western valleys. Our results show that spectral indices from satellite SPOT 5, mainly the GNDVI, the MSAVI2, the NDVI and the RVI, are appropriate tools to predict changes of the structure and function of the vegetation at landscape units level in arid zones.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the application of image enhancement techniques on high resolution and multi-spectral WorldView 2 satellite images in aid of remote sensing a past gold trading trail in Northwestern Luzon that was used from the PreSpanish Contact Period 10th to 16th c and the Spanish Contact Period (17th to 19th c). In delineating the corridor for the research, several ethnohistorical accounts were followed as interlocutors. The article posits that segments of the Aringay-Tonglo-Balatok gold trail are still visible on the landscape while other segments may have been converted to contemporary farm-to-market roads. Identification of the segments was made possible by application of image enhancement techniques on WorldView2 satellite imagery including resolution merge using Brovey transform, unsupervised classification using a fusion of built-up index and vegetation index. Satellite band combination for mining operations (yellow-NIR1-red edge), modified false color Infrared (NIR1-green-blue), and soils and constructions (red-blue-yellow) have also been of immense utility.

TI  - Climate- and human-induced changes in suspended particulate matter over Lake Hongze on short and long timescales
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in global climate drivers have multiple impacts on lake ecosystems, as rain and wind conditions control catchment surface runoff and lake mixing regimes. However, human activities in lakes and their watersheds may have direct and indirect impacts on aquatic optical properties. Therefore, identifying key drivers that can be controlled (human) from those that cannot (climate) represents an important objective. In the present study, we develop an algorithm to estimate the concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in Lake Hongze (the fourth largest freshwater lake in China) using MODIS/Aqua images with concurrent data collected from six cruise surveys. The algorithm resulted in root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 7.64-7.86 mg/L for SPM ranging from 10 to 80 mg/L. The algorithm was applied to 1602 cloud-free MODIS/Aqua images from 2002 to 2015. Our results show: (1) inter-annual and seasonal variations of SPM concentrations in lake Hongze are divided into two distinct periods between 2002 and 2011 and 2012-2015, with the transition associated to intensive dredging activities that were initiated in 2012. (2) SPM concentrations exhibit four typical patterns of spatial distribution which depend on local meteorological (wind speed and wind direction) and hydrological conditions (catchment rainfall and Huai River flowrate). Based on these results, a new spatial zoning of the lake is derived to support government and agency monitoring. The study shows additive and synergistic effects of climate change and human activities on SPM concentrations over short and long timescales and the possibility to monitor these changes by remote sensing in shallow optically complex lakes.

TI  - Threefold increase in marine-terminating outlet glacier retreat rates across the Atlantic Arctic: 1992-2010
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IGS Symposium
CL  - Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA
AB  - Accelerated discharge through marine-terminating outlet glaciers has been a key component of the rapid mass loss from Arctic glaciers since the 1990s. However, glacier retreat and its climatic controls have not been assessed at the pan-Arctic scale. Consequently, the spatial and temporal variability in the magnitude of retreat, and the possible drivers are uncertain. Here we use remotely sensed data acquired over 273 outlet glaciers, located across the entire Atlantic Arctic (i.e. areas potentially influenced by North Atlantic climate and/or ocean conditions, specifically: Greenland, Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land and Svalbard), to demonstrate high-magnitude, accelerating and near-ubiquitous retreat between 1992 and 2010. Overall, mean retreat rates increased by a factor of 3.5 between 1992 and 2000 (-30.5 m a(-1)) and 2000-10 (-105.8 m a(-1)), with 97% of the study glaciers retreating during the latter period. The Retreat was greatest in northern, western and south-eastern Greenland and also increased substantially on the Barents Sea coast of Novaya Zemlya. Glacier retreat showed no significant or consistent relationship with summer air temperatures at decadal timescales. The rate of frontal position change showed a significant, but weak, correlation with changes in sea-ice concentrations. We highlight large variations in retreat rates within regions and suggest that fjord topography plays an important role. We conclude that marine-terminating Arctic outlet glaciers show a common response of rapid and accelerating retreat at decadal timescales.

TI  - NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS APPLIED TO FIRE FOCI OBTAINED BY METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE MCD12Q1 PRODUCT IN THE STATE OF RIO DE JANEIRO, SOUTHEAST BRAZIL
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study shows the relationship between the fire foci and the MCD12Q1 product (MODIS) for the land use and occupation in the state of Rio de Janeiro (SRJ) and evaluates the growth and decay of trends fire foci through nonparametric tests, applied to the number of fire foci in the 2000-2012 period. The study period was divided into (1) 2001 to 2013 for assessment of the product MCD12Q1 back for the land use and occupation and application of nonparametric tests and (2) 2000 to 2012 for the descriptive statistics (total and percentage-%) of fire foci geared for regional assessment. To evaluate growth trends and decay of fire foci, the nonparametric tests (Mann-Kendall and Pettitt) were utilized. Based on data obtained by Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE), the land use and occupation in the SRJ has been modified from the last two census years (1995 and 2006). The Mann-Kendall test was significant for the year 2001, with trends of 0.19 and 0.08 (Mann-Kendall). Fire foci for the years 2001 and 2013 grew with an increase of 0.05 and 0.01 per year, respectively. The Pettitt statistic test applied for the year 2001 showed that almost 70% of the studied municipalities were above the critical threshold, which has not occurred for the year 2013. The North Fluminense Region with 596 fire foci (30.35%) was the one with the largest number of fire foci, and the municipality of Campos dos Goytacazes was the largest contributor, with 344 fire foci (57.72%). The Pasturage class (MCD12Q1 product) had the biggest number of fire foci, with 354 foci (56.64%) in 2001 and 564 foci (42.28%) in 2013 and the largest amount in the north of the SRJ. The study indicated that there was a significant increase in average fire foci. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

M3  - Article
AB  - Morphological attribute profiles are multilevel decompositions of images obtained with a sequence of transformations performed by connected operators. They have been extensively employed in performing multiscale and region-based analysis in a large number of applications. One main, still unresolved, issue is the selection of filter parameters able to provide representative and non-redundant threshold decomposition of the image. This paper presents a framework for the automatic selection of filter thresholds based on Granulometric Characteristic Functions (GCFs). GCFs describe the way that non-linear morphological filters simplify a scene according to a given measure. Since attribute filters rely on a hierarchical representation of an image (e.g., the Tree of Shapes) for their implementation, GCFs can be efficiently computed by taking advantage of the tree representation. Eventually, the study of the GCFs allows the identification of a meaningful set of thresholds. Therefore, a trial and error approach is not necessary for the threshold selection, automating the process and in turn decreasing the computational time. It is shown that the redundant information is reduced within the resulting profiles (a problem of high occurrence, as regards manual selection). The proposed approach is tested on two real remote sensing data sets, and the classification results are compared with strategies present in the literature.

TI  - Preclinical Evaluation of Cathepsin-Based Fluorescent Imaging System for Cytoreductive Surgery
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) is a treatment option for peritoneal surface malignancies. The ability to detect microscopic foci of peritoneal metastasis intraoperatively may ensure the completeness of cytoreduction. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of a hand-held cathepsin-based fluorescent imaging system for intraoperative detection of appendiceal and colorectal peritoneal metastasis.Methods. Peritoneal tumors and normal peritoneal tissues were collected from patients with appendiceal and colorectal peritoneal metastasis. Expression of different cathepsins (CTS-B, -D, -F, -G, -K, -L, -O, and -S) was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The hand-held cathepsin-based fluorescent imaging system was used to detect peritoneal xenografts derived from human colon cancer cells (HT29, LoVo and HCT116) in nu/nu mice.Results. While the expression levels of CTS-B, -D, -L, and -S could be higher in peritoneal tumors than normal peritoneum with a median (range) of 6.1 (2.9-25.8), 2.0 (1.0-15.8), 1.4 (0.8-7.0), and 2.1 (1.6-13.9) folds by quantitative RT-PCR, respectively, CTS-B was consistently the major contributor of the overall cathepsin expression in appendiceal and colonic peritoneal tumors, including adenocarcinomas and low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms. Using peritoneal xenograft mouse models, small barely visible colonic peritoneal tumors (< 2.5 mm in maximum diameter) could be detected by the hand-held cathepsin-based fluorescent imaging system.Conclusions. Because cathepsin expression is higher in peritoneal tumors than underlying peritoneum, the hand-held cathepsin-based fluorescent imaging system could be useful for intraoperative detection of microscopic peritoneal metastasis during CRS-HIPEC and clinical trial is warranted.

TI  - Comparison of SPECT/CT and Planar Lympho-scintigraphy in Sentinel Node Biopsies of Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinomas.
T2  - Indian journal of nuclear medicine : IJNM : the official journal of the Society of Nuclear Medicine, India
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Evidence supporting the use of Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for nodal staging of early oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) appears to be very promising. Pre-operative lymphatic mapping using planar lymphoscinitigraphy (PL) with or without SPECT/CT in the SNB procedure is useful in sentinel node localization and for planning appropriate surgery. Recently, a large prospective multi-centric study evaluating SNB in cutaneous melanoma, breast and pelvic malignancies, demonstrated that adding SPECT to PL leads to surgical adjustments in a considerable number of patients. Our aim of this study was to evaluate the incremental value of additional SPECT/CT over PL alone in SNB for OSCC.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 44 patients (40- tongue, 4- buccal mucosa) with T1-T2, clinically N0 oral cavity SCC who underwent sentinel node biopsy procedure. PL and SPECT lymphoscinitigraphy images were compared for pre-operative mapping of sentinel nodes.RESULTS: Using a handheld gamma probe, a total of 179 sentinel nodes were harvested, with a mean of 4.06 per patient. PL revealed 75 hotspots with a mean of 1.70 per patient, and SPECT/CT revealed 92 hotspots with a mean of 2.09 per patient. Additional hotpots were identified in 14 patients on SPECT/CT, which included 4 patients, where PL did not detect any sentinel nodes.CONCLUSION: Pre-operative SPECT/CT in addition to planar lympho-scinitigraphy in sentinel node biopsies of oral cavity SCC detects more number of sentinel nodes compared to planar imaging alone. The higher sensitivity of SPECT combined with better anatomical localization using diagnostic CT may further improve the precision of SNB procedure.

TI  - The impact of seasonalities on direct radiative effects and radiative heating rates of absorbing aerosols above clouds
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of seasonalities on direct radiative effects (DREs) and radiative heating rates (RHRs) of absorbing aerosols above clouds in the southeast Atlantic is examined using radiative transfer calculations. For an aerosol optical thickness of 0.6 located between 0 and 4 km, a cloud optical thickness of 9.0 and a cloud effective radius of 12.8 mu m at 0.55 mu m located between 1 and 2 km, the diurnally averaged RHR at noon in the aerosol layer increases from similar to 6.6 K day(-1) in June to similar to 8.9 K day(-1) in October. In June (October), the RHR in the cloud layer at noon is 1.3 (1.7) K day(-1) higher than the case of pristine clouds. However, an elevated aerosol layer (2-4 km) reduces the RHR by similar to 0.2 K day(-1) in the cloud layer relative to a pristine cloudy case. The DRE at top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reaches its peak when the solar zenith angle (SZA) is 54 degrees. The DRE increases (decreases) with SZA for SZA less (greater) than 54 degrees. The primary peak DRE is similar to 29.5 W m(-2) at 5.0 degrees S 5.0 degrees E, occurring at 0800 UTC. At noon, the DRE at TOA is similar to 18.9, similar to 20.5 and similar to 23.1W m(-2) at 5.0 degrees S, 15.0 degrees S and 25.0 degrees S along 5.0 degrees E, respectively. This study provides data and theoretical understanding to help positioning science flights that target measurements of above-cloud aerosol radiative effects.

TI  - Aqua and Terra MODIS RSB Calibration Comparison Using BRDF Modeled Reflectance
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The intercomparison of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflective solar bands onboard Aqua and Terra is very important for the assessment of each instrument's calibration. One of the limitations is the lack of simultaneous nadir overpasses. Their measurements over a selected Earth view target have significant differences in solar and view angles, which magnify the effects of atmospheric scattering and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). In this paper, an intercomparison technique is formulated after correction for site's BRDF and atmospheric effects. The reflectance measurements over Libya desert sites 1, 2, and 4 from both the Aqua and Terra MODIS are regressed to a BRDF model with an adjustable coefficient accounting for calibration difference. The ratio between Aqua and Terra reflectance measurements is derived for bands 1-9 and the results from different sites show good agreement. For year 2003, the ratios are in the range of 0.985-1.010 for bands 1-9. Band 3 shows the lowest ratio 0.985 and band 1 shows the highest ratio 1.010. For the year 2014, the ratio ranges from approximately 0.983 for bands 2 and 1.012 for band 8. The BRDF corrected reflectance for the two instruments is also derived for every year from 2003 to 2014 for stability assessment. Bands 1 and 2 show greater than 1% differences between the two instruments. Aqua bands 1 and 2 show downward trends while Terra bands 1 and 2 show upward trends. Bands 8 and 9 of both Aqua and Terra show large variations of reflectance measurement over time.

TI  - Validation of soil moisture derived from water balance method and satellite observation
T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the present study estimation of high resolution soil moisture (SM) under Pan India mode using simple water balance method and from satellite data has been explored. It aims at the simple calculation of soil moisture followed by verification with ground truth data of SM on spatial and temporal scale (WC) as climatic input. The model has been verified for winter (January-February), pre-monsoon (March-May), monsoon (June-September) and post monsoon (October-December) seasons of year 2013. The comparison of model estimates with the in-situ data from 17 ground stations (for 396 paired datasets) over different seasons produced a better correlation coefficient varying from 0.46 to 0.60. The spatial comparison of SM estimated from model and satellite SM for the monsoon season shows a greater degree of coherence over most parts of India. Model derived weekly gridded SM combined with higher resolution satellite SM could use simple formulation and minimum inputs in conjunction with geographic information system (GIS). The SM is calculated on weekly basis and using gridded rainfall, potential evapotranspiration (PET) and field capacity (FC) and wilting point be used for better accuracy of the proposed block level agrometadvisory services.

TI  - Prototyping of LAI and FPAR Retrievals from MODIS Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by vegetation are key variables in many global models of climate, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecology. These parameters are being operationally produced from Terra and Aqua MODIS bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) data. The MODIS science team has developed, and plans to release, a new version of the BRF product using the multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) algorithm from Terra and Aqua MODIS observations. This paper presents analyses of LAI and FPAR retrievals generated with the MODIS LAI/FPAR operational algorithm using Terra MAIAC BRF data. Direct application of the operational algorithm to MAIAC BRF resulted in an underestimation of the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) LAI standard product by up to 10%. The difference was attributed to the disagreement between MAIAC and MODIS BRFs over the vegetation by -2% to +8% in the red spectral band, suggesting different accuracies in the BRF products. The operational LAI/FPAR algorithm was adjusted for uncertainties in the MAIAC BRF data. Its performance evaluated on a limited set of MAIAC BRF data from North and South America suggests an increase in spatial coverage of the best quality, high-precision LAI retrievals of up to 10%. Overall MAIAC LAI and FPAR are consistent with the standard C6 MODIS LAI/FPAR. The increase in spatial coverage of the best quality LAI retrievals resulted in a better agreement of MAIAC LAI with field data compared to the C6 LAI product, with the RMSE decreasing from 0.80 LAI units (C6) down to 0.67 (MAIAC) and the R-2 increasing from 0.69 to 0.80. The slope (intercept) of the satellite-derived vs. field-measured LAI regression line has changed from 0.89 (0.39) to 0.97 (0.25).

TI  - Surface Motion and Structural Instability Monitoring of Ming Dynasty CityWalls by Two-Step Tomo-PSInSAR Approach in Nanjing City, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne Multi-Temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry (MT-InSAR) has been a valuable tool in mapping motion phenomena in different scenarios. Recently, the capabilities of MT-InSAR for risk monitoring and preventive analysis of heritage sites have increasingly been exploited. Considering the limitations of conventional MT-InSAR techniques, in this study a two-step Tomography-based Persistent Scatterers (PS) Interferometry (Tomo-PSInSAR) approach is proposed for monitoring ground deformation and structural instabilities over the Ancient City Walls (Ming Dynasty) in Nanjing city, China. For the purpose of this study we utilized 26 Stripmap acquisitions from TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X missions, spanning from May 2013 to February 2015. As a first step, regional-scale surface deformation rates on single PSs were derived (ranging from 40 to +5 mm/year) and used for identifying deformation hotspots as well as for the investigation of a potential correlation between urbanization and the occurrence of surface subsidence. As a second step, structural instability parameters of ancient walls (linear motion rates, non-linear motions and material thermodynamics) were estimated by an extended four-dimensional Tomo-PSInSAR model. The model applies a two-tier network strategy; that is, the detection of most reliable single PSs in the first-tier Delaunay triangulation network followed by the detection of remaining single PSs and double PSs on the second-tier local star network referring to single SPs extracted in the first-tier network. Consequently, a preliminary phase calibration relevant to the Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) is not needed. Motion heterogeneities in the spatial domain, either caused by thermal kinetics or displacement trends, were also considered. This study underlines the potential of the proposed Tomo-PSInSAR solution for the monitoring and conservation of cultural heritage sites. The proposed approach offers a quantitative indicator to local authorities and planners for assessing potential damages as well as for the design of remediation activities.

TI  - Toward a theory of backpacker personal development: Cross-cultural validation of the BPD scale
T2  - TOURISM MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at building a theory of backpacker personal development (BPD) by cross-culturally validating the scale developed by Chen, Bao, and Huang (2014). While the original scale was developed by studying Chinese backpackers, this study focuses on Western backpackers to further validate the scale and advance the studies of backpacker personal development. The study involves two samples in two stages (Study 1, n = 382; Study 2, n = 120) to verify the psychometric properties of the backpacker personal development scale (BPDS). Results show that the five dimensions of the BPDS (i.e., capability, emotion, skill, worldview, and self-consciousness), also apply to Western backpackers; the BPDS demonstrates cross-cultural validity and reliability in measuring backpacker personal development. The current research suggests that Western backpackers see backpacking as a more 'individualistic' way of personal development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimation of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter From Landsat-8 Imagery for Complex Inland Water: Case Study of Lake Huron
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral reflectance data, including irradiance reflectance (R-t) and remote sensing reflectance (R-rs, sr(-1)), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficients a(CDOM)(440), were collected in the Saginaw River and Kawkawlin River plume regions of Lake Huron. We developed an empirical band ratio algorithm to derive a(CDOM)(440) that could be directly applicable to Landsat-8 imagery. A model ranking method is used to determine the best band ratios as well as their empirical functions. One problem of previous CDOM estimations from Landsat imagery is that they usually use R-t or R-t/pi rather than the real R-rs as the input data, but as a result of our study, algorithms derived using R-rs performed much better than using R-t. The green/red band ratio gave the best accuracies by fitting with power and exponential models (power model: R-2 = 0.819 and RMSE = 0.889 m(-1) and exponential model: R-2 = 0.829 and RMSE = 0.863 m(-1)). The power and exponential models were further validated using an independent data group, achieving excellent results with the RMSE of 0.642 and 0.504 m(-1), respectively. The application of the exponential model a(CDOM)(440) = 40.75e(-2.463x), x = R-rs(B3)/R-rs(B4) on two Landsat-8 images demonstrated that estimating CDOM from to Landsat-8 imagery has potential applications for monitoring water quality in long term and large scale.

TI  - Object-Oriented Landslide Mapping Using ZY-3 Satellite Imagery, Random Forest and Mathematical Morphology, for the Three-Gorges Reservoir, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide mapping (LM) has recently become an important research topic in remote sensing and geohazards. The area near the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) along the Yangtze River in China is one of the most landslide-prone regions in the world, and the area has suffered widespread and significant landslide events in recent years. In our study, an object-oriented landslide mapping (OOLM) framework was proposed for reliable and accurate LM from 'ZY-3' high spatial resolution (HSR) satellite images. The framework was based on random forests (RF) and mathematical morphology (MM). RF was first applied as an object feature information reduction tool to identify the significant features for describing landslides, and it was then combined with MM to map the landslides. Three object-feature domains were extracted from the 'ZY-3' HSR data: layer information, texture, and geometric features. A total group of 124 features and 24 landslides were used as inputs to determine the landslide boundaries and evaluate the landslide classification accuracy. The results showed that: (1) the feature selection (FS) method had a positive influence on effective landslide mapping; (2) by dividing the data into two sets, training sets which consisted of 20% of the landslide objects (OLS) and non-landslide objects (ONLS), and test sets which consisted of the remaining 80% of the OLS and ONLS, the selected feature subsets were combined for training to obtain an overall classification accuracy of 93.3% +/- 0.12% of the test sets; (3) four MM operations based on closing and opening were used to improve the performance of the RF classification. Seven accuracy evaluation indices were used to compare the accuracies of these landslide mapping methods. Finally, the landslide inventory maps were obtained. Based on its efficiency and accuracy, the proposed approach can be employed for rapid response to natural hazards in the Three Gorges area.

TI  - Variations of the relativistic electron flux after a magnetospheric compression event
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - On January 21, 2015, a sharp increase of the solar wind dynamic pressure impacted the magnetosphere. The magnetopause moved inward to the region L<8 without causing a geomagnetic storm. The flux of the relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt decreased by half during this event based on the observations of the particle radiation monitor (PRM) of the fourth of the China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellites (CBERS-4). The flux remained low for approximately 11 d; it did not recover after a small magnetic storm on January 26 but after a small magnetic storm on February 2. The loss and recovery of the relativistic electrons during this event are investigated using the PRM data, medium-and high-energy electron observations of NOAA-15 and the Van Allen Probes, medium-energy electron observations of GOES-13, and wave observations of the Van Allen Probes. This study shows that the loss of energetic electrons in this event is related to magnetospheric compression. The chorus waves accelerate the medium-energy electrons, which causes the recovery of relativistic electrons. The Van Allen Probes detected strong chorus waves in the region L = 3-6 from January 21 to February 2. However, the flux of medium-energy electrons was low in the region. This implies that the long-lasting lack of recovery of the relativistic electrons after this event is due to the lack of the medium-energy "seed" electrons. The medium-energy electrons in the outer radiation belt may be a clue to predict the recovery of relativistic electrons.

TI  - Preoperative Sentinel Node Mapping in Sentinel Node Biopsy in Early Breast Cancers is - It Cost-Effective?
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Many centers internationally still routinely perform preoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. A recent review in 2015 also concluded that SLN mapping is playing an important role in SLN biopsy. However, in some financially less-privileged regions or localities where healthcare system is largely subsidized by the government, the extra cost incurred from the use of SLN mapping has significant implications on public health economics. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy as well as the cost-effectiveness of preoperative SLN mapping for early breast cancers.Introduction: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is currently the gold standard of treatment in early breast cancers. Identification of SLNs by preoperative scintigraphy has been carried out to improve the detection of SLNs intra-operatively, but the evidence of its cost-effectiveness is lacking. Here, we analyze the cost-effectiveness of the utilization of scintigraphy in detection of SLNs. Patients and Methods: Clinical and operative details were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. The resources and cost data from each patient who had undergone SLN biopsy with preoperative scintigraphy were retrieved. Results: From January 2008 to December 2012, 400 patients underwent SLN biopsy for breast cancer. A total of 329 had preoperative SLN mapping with scintigraphy, Baseline patient demographic data for both arms were comparable. The relapse and recurrence rate of both arms were not statistically different. The detection rate of SLNs of both arms was the same (100%), and there were no grade 2 or above lymphedema in both groups of patients. However, the cost of each patient undergoing SLN mapping was USD $345.8. Conclusion: Preoperative SLN mapping does not improve the SLN detection rate. In addition, it does not affect the surgical outcomes in terms of complication, local relapse, and recurrence. The use of preoperative SLN mapping is no longer cost-effective. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - How Similar Are Forest Disturbance Maps Derived from Different Landsat Time Series Algorithms?
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbance is a critical ecological process in forested systems, and disturbance maps are important for understanding forest dynamics. Landsat data are a key remote sensing dataset for monitoring forest disturbance and there recently has been major growth in the development of disturbance mapping algorithms. Many of these algorithms take advantage of the high temporal data volume to mine subtle signals in Landsat time series, but as those signals become subtler, they are more likely to be mixed with noise in Landsat data. This study examines the similarity among seven different algorithms in their ability to map the full range of magnitudes of forest disturbance over six different Landsat scenes distributed across the conterminous US. The maps agreed very well in terms of the amount of undisturbed forest over time; however, for the similar to 30% of forest mapped as disturbed in a given year by at least one algorithm, there was little agreement about which pixels were affected. Algorithms that targeted higher-magnitude disturbances exhibited higher omission errors but lower commission errors than those targeting a broader range of disturbance magnitudes. These results suggest that a user of any given forest disturbance map should understand the map's strengths and weaknesses (in terms of omission and commission error rates), with respect to the disturbance targets of interest.

TI  - The use of CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite) to trace the dynamics of total suspended matter at an urbanized coastal area
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of organic and inorganic particles in the water column, or the total suspended matter (TSM), responds to local and remote oceanographic and meteorological processes, potentially impacting biogeochemical cycles. In shallow coastal areas, where particles have distinct origins and compositions and vary in different time scales, the use of remote sensing tools for monitoring and tracing this material is highly encouraged due to the high temporal and spatial data resolution. The objective of this work was to understand the variability of in situ TSM at Santos Bay (Southeastern Brazil) and its response to oceanographic and meteorological conditions. We also aimed to verify the applicability of the satellite data from CBERS-2 sensor in order to map the dynamics of TSM in this region. Our results have shown that the distribution of TSM in Santos Bay varied consistently with winds, currents and tidal cycles, with significant relationships emphasizing the role of south-western winds and spring tides. Neap tides and eastern winds, along with rainfall, play an important role in the input of organic matter into the bay. In conclusion, our analyses showed that the main patterns observed in situ regarding the responses of TSM to the ocean-meteorological processes could be reproduced in the CBERS-2 satellite data, after simple and standard methods of images processing. TSM data retrieval from CBERS-2 or other satellite sensors were shown to be feasible, becoming an essential tool for synoptic observations of the composition and quality of water, especially at urbanized and impacted coastal areas.

TI  - Mobile DOAS Observations of Tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> Using an UltraLight Trike and Flux Calculation
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we report on airborne Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) observations of tropospheric NO2 using an Ultralight Trike (ULT) and associated flux calculations. The instrument onboard the ULT was developed for measuring the tropospheric NO2 Vertical Column Density (VCD) and it was operated for several days between 2011 and 2014, in the South-East of Romania. Collocated measurements were performed using a car-DOAS instrument. Most of the airborne and mobile ground-based measurements were performed close to an industrial platform located nearby Galati city (45.43 degrees N, 28.03 degrees E). We found a correlation of R = 0.71 between tropospheric NO2 VCDs deduced from airborne DOAS observations and mobile ground-based DOAS observations. We also present a comparison between stratospheric NO2 Slant Column Density (SCD) derived from the Dutch OMI NO2 (DOMINO) satellite data product and stratospheric SCDs obtained from ground and airborne measurements. The airborne DOAS observations performed on 13 August 2014 were used to quantify the NO2 flux originating from an industrial platform located nearby Galati city. Measurements during a flight above the industrial plume showed a maximum tropospheric NO2 VCD of (1.41 +/- 0.27) x 10(16) molecules/cm(2) and an associated NO2 flux of (3.45 +/- 0.89) x 10(3) kg/s.

TI  - Disturbance impacts on land surface temperature and gross primary productivity in the western United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbances influence forest structure, composition, and function and may impact climate through changes in net radiation or through shifts in carbon exchange. Climate impacts vary depending on environmental variables and disturbance characteristics, yet few studies have investigated disturbance impacts over large, environmentally heterogeneous, regions. We used satellite data to objectively determine the impacts of fire, bark beetles, defoliators, and unidentified disturbances (UDs) on land surface temperature (LST) and gross primary productivity (GPP) across the western United States (U.S.). We investigated immediate disturbance impacts, the drivers of those impacts, and long-term postdisturbance LST and GPP recovery patterns. All disturbance types caused LST increases (degrees C; fire: 3.453.02, bark beetles: 0.763.04, defoliators: 0.493.12, and UD: 0.763.03). Fire and insects resulted in GPP declines (%; fire: -25.05 +/- 21.67, bark beetles: -2.84 +/- 21.06, defoliators: -0.23 +/- 15.40), while UDs resulted in slightly enhanced GPP (1.89 +/- 24.20%). Disturbance responses also varied between ecoregions. Severity and interannual changes in air temperature were the primary drivers of short-term disturbance responses, and severity also had a strong impact on long-term recovery patterns. These results suggest a potential climate feedback due to disturbance-induced biophysical changes that may strengthen as disturbance regimes shift due to climate change.

TI  - Multidetector CT improving surgical outcomes in breast cancer (MISO-BC): A randomised controlled trial
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Early diagnosis of malignant axillary nodes in breast cancer guides the extent of axillary surgery: patients with known axillary malignancy receive a more extensive single operation at the same time as surgery to their breast. A multicentre randomised controlled trial assessed whether a Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the axilla could more accurately diagnose malignant axillary lymph node involvement in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer when compared to usual care.Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer (identified via screening and symptomatic pathways) at two NHS Trusts in the North East of England were recruited and randomised in equal numbers. Both groups received routine diagnostic and surgical care. In addition, one group received a CT scan of their axilla on the same side as the breast cancer. The primary endpoint was the need to undergo a second axillary surgical procedure.Findings: The trial recruited 297 patients of whom 291 contributed to findings. The proportion of patients undergoing a second operation was similar (CT vs UC: 19.4% vs. 19.7%; CT-UC: -0.3%, 95% CI: = -9.5% to 8.9%, c(2) [1]: p = 1.00). Patients in the two groups were similar before treatment, had similar types and grade of cancer, experienced similar patterns of post-operative complications and reported similar experiences of care.Interpretation: CT scan-guided care did not result in a change in the number of patients requiring a second operation; similar numbers of patients needed further axillary surgery in both groups. New diagnostic imaging technologies regularly enter NHS centres. It is important these are evaluated rigorously before becoming routine care. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Monte Carlo simulation-aided analytical hierarchy process (AHP) for flood susceptibility mapping in Gabes Basin (southeastern Tunisia)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods are among the most severe hazards which have disastrous environmental, human, and economic impacts. This study is interested in the characterization of flood hazard in Gabes Catchment (southeastern Tunisia), considered as an important step for flood management in the region. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and geographic information system are applied to delineate and characterize flood areas. A spatial database was developed based on geological map, digital elevation model, land use, and rainfall data in order to evaluate the different factors susceptible to affect flood analysis. However, the uncertainties that are associated with AHP techniques may significantly impact the results. Flood susceptibility is analyzed as a function of weights using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and Global sensitivity analysis. AHP and MC-AHP models gave similar results. However, compared to AHP approach, MC-AHP confidence intervals (95%) of the overall scores had small overlaps. Results obtained were validated by remote sensing data for the zones that showed very high flood hazard during the extreme rainfall event of June 2014 that hit the study basin.

TI  - Daily Practice Management of pT1a-b pN0 Breast Carcinoma: A Prospective French ODISSEE Cohort Study
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The subgroup of breast cancer tumors 510 mm requiring adjuvant systemic therapy is currently not well defined. A prospective cohort study was conducted in patients with unifocal, invasive pT1a-b pN0 non-metastatic breast cancer to describe the daily adjuvant management and outcome after surgery. In this study, most patients had conservative surgery followed by radiotherapy and hormone therapy; however the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab remains controversial.Background: Most breast cancer (BC) tumors <= 10 mm have an excellent prognosis. The subgroups with a higher risk for distant recurrence requiring adjuvant systemic therapy are not precisely defined in current international guidelines. Patients and Methods: The OBSERVATOIRE DES PETITS CANCERS DU SEIN HER2 +/- (ODISSEE) study was a prospective, multicenter, cohort study that aimed to describe the daily adjuvant management and outcome of 616 patients with unifocal, invasive pT1a-b pN0 nonmetastatic BC who underwent surgery. Results: At the time of diagnosis, the median age of patients was 61 years. Tumor was detected on imaging or during a screening program in 397 patients (64.6%). Most patients (96%) underwent conservative surgery with sentinel node biopsy (89%), completed with axillary lymph node dissection in 15%. At inclusion, 82% of tumors were pT1b, 73% were pN0 (i-), 53% were Scarff Bloom Richardson Grade I, 91 % were estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, 5% overexpressed/amplified HER2, and 5% were triple negative (TNBC). Adjuvant treatments were radiotherapy (95%), hormone therapy (82%), chemotherapy (7%), and trastuzumab (3.5%). In patients with TNBC and HER2-positive BC, chemotherapy and trastuzumab (if needed) were administered in 45% and 68%, respectively. After 5 years of follow-up, 7 patients had contralateral BC, 7 had locoregional recurrence, and 1 had distant metastasis. At 5 years, overall survival, disease-free survival, and recurrence-free survival were: 98.4% (96.9%-99.1%), 94.7% (92.4%-96.3%), and 97.1 % (95.2%-98.2%), respectively. Conclusion: This prospective cohort study showed that in France, the routine practice in pT1a-b pN0 breast cancers follows international standard guidelines for practice including conservative surgery followed by radiotherapy and endocrine therapy for ER -positive patients. Adjuvant chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab was used but their benefit in breast cancer of <= 10 mm remains controversial. (C)2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Correlates of Prenatal and Early-Life Tobacco Smoke Exposure and Frequency of Common Gene Deletions in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tobacco smoke exposure has been associated with risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Understanding the relationship between tobacco exposures and specific mutations may yield etiologic insights. We carried out a case-only analysis to explore whether prenatal and early-life tobacco smoke exposure influences the formation of leukemogenic genomic deletions. Somatic copy number of 8 genes frequently deleted in ALL (CDKN2A, ETV6, IKZF1, PAX5, RB1, BTG1, PAR1 region, and EBF1) was assessed in 559 pretreatment tumor samples from the California Childhood Leukemia Study. Parent and child's passive tobacco exposure was assessed using interview-assisted questionnaires as well as DNA methylation in aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR), a sentinel epigenetic biomarker of exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy. Multivariable Poisson regressions were used to test the association between the smoking exposures and total number of deletions. Deletion burden varied by subtype, with a lower frequency in high-hyperdiploid and higher frequency in ETV6-RUNX1 fusion ALL. The total number of deletions per case was positively associated with tobacco smoke exposure, in particular for maternal ever-smoking (ratio of means, RM, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08-1.59), maternal smoking during pregnancy (RM, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.12-1.94), and during breastfeeding (RM, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.48-3.02). The magnitude of association with maternal ever-smoking was stronger in male children compared with females (Pinteraction 0.04). The total number of deletions was also associated withDNAmethylation at the AHRR epigenetic biomarker (RM, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02-1.69). Our results suggest that prenatal and early-life tobacco smoke exposure increase the frequency of somatic deletions in children who develop ALL.

TI  - EXCESS RIVER SEDIMENTATION AT BRIDGES IN THE RAYA GRABEN (NORTHERN ETHIOPIA)
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the temporal variability and effects of bio-climatic factors and bridges on local hydro-geomorphic conditions that cause excess sedimentation and flood hazard in ephemeral rivers of the Raya graben (northern Ethiopia). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was analyzed using Landsat imageries of 1972, 1986, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2014. Daily rainfall data of three meteorological stations were considered to analyze the temporal trends and return time intervals of rainfall intensity in 24 h. Stream-bed gradient and bed material grain size were measured in 20 river reaches. Results show that the maximum NDVI values were recorded in the time interval from 2000 to 2014. Nevertheless, during this decade, the study bridges experienced the largest excess sedimentation, in some bridges up to 1.6 m. Different factors to account for it are discussed as no evidence of rainfall pattern, accountable for an increase in sediment delivery from the headwaters, is found. The field data show that channel narrowing at bridges is the main cause of thick upstream sedimentation and of increasing frequency of overbank flows during the last 15 years. A simple hydraulic approach is presented to explain the variability of sediment deposition at bridges and change in bed material grain size between the main stem and the reach right upstream of the bridge.

TI  - A Global Multilayer Cloud Identification with POLDER/P<i>ARASOL</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of multilayer cloud situations is important for satellite retrieval algorithms and for many climate-related applications. In this paper, the authors describe an algorithm based on the exploitation of the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) observations to identify monolayered and multilayered cloudy situations along with a confidence index. The authors' reference comes from the synergy of the active instruments of the A-Train satellite constellation. The algorithm is based upon a decision tree that uses a metric from information theory and a series of tests on POLDER level-2 products. The authors obtain a multilayer flag as the final result of a tree classification, which takes discrete values between 0 and 100. Values closest to 0 (100) indicate a higher confidence in the monolayer (multilayer) character. This indicator can be used as it is or with a threshold level that minimizes the risk of misclassification, as a binary index to distinguish between monolayer and multilayer clouds. For almost fully covered and optically thick enough cloud scenes, the risk of misclassification ranges from 29% to 34% over the period 2006-10, and the average confidences in the estimated monolayer and multilayer characters of the cloud scenes are 74.0% and 58.2%, respectively. With the binary distinction, POLDER provides a climatology of the mono-multilayer cloud character that exhibits some interesting features. Comparisons with the performance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) multilayer flag are given.

TI  - Assessment of the modulation effect of rainfall on solar radiation availability at the Earth's surface
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A significant proportion of the solar irradiance that reaches the Earth's surface is normally attenuated by atmospheric properties and overcast conditions related to the rainy season. The Solar Analyst (SA) model, irradiance and long term precipitation data were used to assess this relationship in Guadalajara, Mexico. A spatial analysis based on morphological and statistical criteria increased the model's certainty. The SA model explains 95.4% of the irradiation variability observed on the ground, with average uncertainties of 3.7% during clear sky conditions in the dry season and 4.4% on sunny days in the wet season. The meteorological data analysis shows that total precipitation in 2014 had an atypical temporal distribution and was slightly lower (12.6%) than the average from 1991 to 2012. A deficit of 39% in precipitation compared to the long term average was found in the first half of the season, which was later partially compensated. This deficit was interpreted as a temporary delay in high values of precipitation. Based on the potential average irradiation from the SA model and field observations, it can be concluded that overcast conditions related to rainfall through 2014 attenuated approximately 28.5% of the incoming solar energy. Taking the global energy balance into account, this fraction was higher in comparison to the energy proportion reflected by the cloud's albedo (ca 23%). These results suggest that both the high proportion of energy attenuated and atypical weather conditions may be local effects of large-scale phenomena such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.

TI  - Automated Improvement of Geolocation Accuracy in AVHRR Data Using a Two-Step Chip Matching Approach-A Part of the TIMELINE Preprocessor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geolocation of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data is known to be imprecise due to minor satellite position and orbit uncertainties. These uncertainties lead to distortions once the data are projected based on the provided orbit parameters. This can cause geolocation errors of up to 10 km per pixel which is an obstacle for applications such as time series analysis, compositing/mosaicking of images, or the combination with other satellite data. Therefore, a fusion of two techniques to match the data in orbit projection has been developed to overcome this limitation, even without the precise knowledge of the orbit parameters. Both techniques attempt to find the best match between small image chips taken from a reference water mask in the first, and from a median Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) mask in the second round. This match is determined shifting around the small image chips until the best correlation between reference and satellite data source is found for each respective image part. Only if both attempts result in the same shift in any direction, the position in the orbit is included in a third order polynomial warping process that will ultimately improve the geolocation accuracy of the AVHRR data. The warping updates the latitude and longitude layers and the contents of the data layers itself remain untouched. As such, original sensor measurements are preserved. An included automated quality assessment generates a quality layer that informs about the reliability of the matching.

TI  - Ocean surface currents from satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The atmosphere drives entire ocean motions, and yet the exchange of momentum between the atmosphere and ocean occurs in the thin layer where they meet, involving the smallest scales of turbulence. The Ocean Surface Current Analyses Real-time (OSCAR) project attempts to better understand this exchange using satellite observations with simplified physics to calculate global ocean currents. The goal is to continually improve the physics in OSCAR and more accurately model the currents. The theoretical study will help coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling efforts whereas the societal benefits of measuring ocean currents are broad, e.g., fish larval dispersion, heat transport, commercial shipping, and search and rescue.

TI  - Continental mapping of groundwater dependent ecosystems: A methodological framework to integrate diverse data and expert opinion
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: Australian continent.Study focus: With increasing groundwater development around the world, a method is required to identify and map groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) across broad landscape scales. Identifying the location of GDEs, will ensure that the environmental impacts of increasing water development are understood and will lead to better management of water resources to protect GDEs. In this study, a method is demonstrated that underpinned the development of an online national GDE mapping tool in Australia (GDE Atlas; http://www.bom.gov.au/water/groundwater/gde/map.shtml). Known GDEs and their locations were extrapolated to regional scales using a process that relied on the integration of expert opinion, remote sensing data obtained between 2000 and 2010 and GIS analysis.New hydrological insights: It was identified that 34% of Australias landscape potentially contains GDEs of which 5% are classified with a high GDE potential. In addition, new continental scale insights into landscape processes where provided by the derivation and integration of remote sensing products using MODIS and Landsat. These products identify landscapes which are 'wetter' or 'greener' than surrounding areas, indicating these landscapes are accessing additional water, such as groundwater, supplementary to rainfall. The method reported also demonstrates the importance of expert knowledge, obtained through literature and expert elicitation, in order to provide a conceptual understanding of regional ecohydrological processes to develop rules of GDE dependency that would guide the extrapolation of known GDEs.

M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, most Landsat satellites are deployed in the low earth orbit (LEO) to obtain high-resolution data of the Earth surface and atmosphere. However, the return channels of LEO satellites are unstable and discontinuous intrinsically, resulting from the high orbital velocity, long revisit interval, and limited ranges of ground-based radar receivers. Space-based information networks, in which data can be delivered by the cooperative transmission of relay satellites, can greatly expand the spatial transport connection ranges of LEO satellites. While different types of these relay satellites deployed in orbits of different altitudes represent distinctive performances when they are participating in forwarding. In this paper, we consider the cooperative mechanism of relay satellites deployed in the geosynchronous orbit (GEO) and LEO according to their different transport performances and orbital characteristics. To take full advantage of the transmission resource of different kinds of cooperative relays, we propose amultiple access and bandwidth resource allocation strategy for GEO relay, in which the relay can receive and transmit simultaneously according to channel characteristics of space-based systems. Moreover, a time-slot allocation strategy that is based on the slotted time division multiple access is introduced for the system with LEO relays. Based on the queueing theoretic formulation, the stability of the proposed systems and protocols is analyzed and the maximum stable throughput region is derived as well, which provides the guidance for the design of the system optimal control. Simulation results exhibit multiple factors that affect the stable throughput and verify the theoretical analysis.

TI  - Recent Landslide Movement in Tsaoling, Taiwan Tracked by TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X DEM Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tsaoling Landslide in Taiwan has captured attentions of researchers worldwide due to its frequent catastrophic failure and distinctive features. Thanks to the launch of TerraSAR- X/TanDEM- X (TSX/TDX) constellation, retrieval of global DEM with high spatial resolution and accuracy becomes possible, which is extremely useful for the study of natural hazards (e.g., landslides) globally. We attempt here for the first time to track recent landslide movements in Tsaoling Taiwan by analyzing DEM time series reconstructed from TSX/TDX image pairs. Quality improvement of InSAR derived DEM through an iterated differential operation is addressed during the data processing. Five cliffs and the Chingshui River are selected to determine the spatial pattern of morphologic changes of the landslide. The results show that: (a) A large amount of collapses occurred on dip slopes in the period from 2011 to 2014 and on surrounding debris deposits during the rainy seasons; (b) The average recession rate of the Chunqui Cliff decreased from 24.4 m/yr to 19.6 m/yr compared with the result between 1999 and 2009; (c) The Tsaoling Landslide has lost 6.90 x 10(6) m(3) of soil from November of 2011 to April of 2014, which shows a positive correlation of 0.853 with rainfall; (d) The Chingshui River is undergoing a gradual bed erosion with a volumes of 1.84 x 10(6) m(3).

TI  - Cross-satellite comparison of operational land surface temperature products derived from MODIS and ASTER data over bare soil surfaces
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The collection 6 (C6) MODIS land surface temperature (LST) product is publicly available for the user community. Compared to the collection 5 (C5) MODIS LST product, the C6 MODIS LST product has been refined over bare soil pixels. Assessing the accuracy of the C6 MODIS LST product will help to facilitate the use of the LST product in various applications. In this study, we present a cross-satellite comparison to evaluate the accuracy of the C6 MODIS LST product (MOD11_L2) over bare soil surfaces under various atmospheric and surface conditions using the ASTER LST product as a reference. For comparison, the C5 MODIS LST product was also used in the analysis. The absolute biases (0.2-1.5 K) of the differences between the C6 MODIS LST and ASTER LST over bare soil surfaces are approximately two times less than those (0.6-3.8 K) of the differences between the C5 MODIS LST and ASTER LST. Furthermore, the RMSEs (0.7-2.3 K) over bare soil surfaces for the C6 MODIS LST are significantly smaller than those (0.9-4.2 K) for the C5 MODIS LST. These results indicate that the accuracy of the C6 MODIS LST product is much better than that of the C5 MODIS LST product. We recommend that the user community employs the C6 MODIS LST product in their applications. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

TI  - Accounting for nonsampling error in estimates of HIV epidemic trends from antenatal clinic sentinel surveillance
T2  - AIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to propose and demonstrate an approach to allow additional nonsampling uncertainty about HIV prevalence measured at antenatal clinic sentinel surveillance (ANC-SS) in model-based inferences about trends in HIV incidence and prevalence.DESIGN: Mathematical model fitted to surveillance data with Bayesian inference.METHODS: We introduce a variance inflation parameter sigma(2)(in fl) that accounts for the uncertainty of nonsampling errors in ANC-SS prevalence. It is additive to the sampling error variance. Three approaches are tested for estimating sigma(2)(in fl) using ANC-SS and household survey data from 40 subnational regions in nine countries in sub-Saharan, as defined in UNAIDS 2016 estimates. Methods were compared using in-sample fit and out-of-sample prediction of ANC-SS data, fit to household survey prevalence data, and the computational implications.RESULTS: Introducing the additional variance parameter sigma(2)(in fl) increased the error variance around ANC-SS prevalence observations by a median of 2.7 times (interquartile range 1.9-3.8). Using only sampling error in ANC-SS prevalence sigma(2)(in fl)=0 ), coverage of 95% prediction intervals was 69% in out-of-sample prediction tests. This increased to 90% after introducing the additional variance parameter sigma(2)(in fl). The revised probabilistic model improved model fit to household survey prevalence and increased epidemic uncertainty intervals most during the early epidemic period before 2005. Estimating sigma(2)(in fl) did not increase the computational cost of model fitting.CONCLUSIONS: We recommend estimating nonsampling error in ANC-SS as an additional parameter in Bayesian inference using the Estimation and Projection Package model. This approach may prove useful for incorporating other data sources such as routine prevalence from Prevention of mother-to-child transmission testing into future epidemic estimates.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel node (SN) biopsy is regarded as standard of care for patients (pts) with cutaneous melanoma ae1.0 mm of thickness. In the recent AJCC classification, findings in the SN are simply classified as positive or negative. In our analyses, we were interested whether quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is able to predict disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) depending on tumour burden in the SN.One hundred and forty-five pts were analysed using qRT-PCR for tyrosinase. Results were analysed using accelerated failure time survival model and cox proportional hazards models using the R statistics framework.Forty-one pts (28%) were positive according to qRT-PCR. In total, 12 of 41 pts showed tumour deposits in the SN using S100 and/or HMB-45-labelled immunohistochemistry as well. One patient had micrometastases detected by immunohistochemistry staining but failed in the qRT-PCR. After 10 years of follow-up, 34 patients recurred and 27 patients died. Significant differences for DFS and OS were detected for sex, increasing tumour thickness, ulceration of the primary tumour, and metastatic spread in the SN determined by histology as well as qRT-PCR.Quantitative analyses showed a logarithmic correlation between tumour burden and prognosis. However, as multivariate analyses reveal qRT-PCR was not superior compared to classical histology or immunohistology.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of the phytoplankton biomass in the Levantine basin between 2002 and 2015 using MODIS products
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Levantine basin in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea is subject to spatial and seasonal variations in primary production and physical-chemical properties both on a short and long-term basis. In this study, the monthly means of daily MODIS product images were averaged between 2002 and 2015, and used to characterize the phytoplankton blooms in different bioregions of the Levantine basin. The selected products were the sea surface temperature (SST), the chlorophyll-alpha concentration (Chl-alpha), the diffuse attenuation coefficient for down welling irradiance at 490 nm (Kd_490) and the colored dissolved organic matter index (CDO-M_index). Our results showed that phytoplankton blooms were spatially and temporally variable. They occurred in late autumn at the Nile Delta, in early spring and late summer at the eastern coastline, and in spring at the northeastern coastline. The northern coastline and the open water had a common bloom occurring in winter. The Nile Delta was found to be the most productive area of the Levantine basin showing high Chl-alpha. Kd_490 and Chl-alpha present a parallel co-variation indicating a dominance of Case 1 waters in the Levantine basin. The CDOM_index shows a phase shift with the Chl-alpha fluctuation. A strong inverse correlation was observed between both Chl-alpha and CDOM_index with SST, connoting an indirect relation represented by a depression of CDOM in summer by photobleaching, and a suppression of the chlorophyll-alpha concentration due to water stratification, together with nutrient stress. An overestimation of the Chl-alpha values had been signaled by the use of the CDOM_index, suggesting a correction plan in a latter study.

TI  - Insights on the formation of longitudinal surface structures on ice sheets from analysis of their spacing, spatial distribution, and relationship to ice thickness and flow
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Longitudinal surface structures (LSSs) are prevalent upon the ice streams, ice shelves, and outlet glaciers of ice sheets. These features inform our understanding of past and present ice sheet behavior. However, consensus regarding their genesis has not been reached. Here we analyze 42,311 LSS segments mapped across Antarctica together with geophysical data to determine their morphological and glaciological properties. Most LSSs are spaced 450 to 1500m apart, a distance positively correlated with the width of the ice flow unit on which they occur. The start points (upstream end locations) of LSSs have diverse ice thicknesses and velocities. The majority of LSSs occur where ice flow is converging or broadly parallel, and they are prominent at ice confluences. Some occur at slow-flowing ice stream onsets. Occasionally, LSSs relate to sudden variations in basal shear stress due to basal perturbations. From these observations, we argue that LSSs are the consequence of increased strain which occurs during the lateral compression and longitudinal extension of ice: (i) converging/flowing into a channel (this scenario characterizes most LSSs), (ii) at the onset of ice streaming, (iii) at flow unit confluence, and (iv) as ice flows over and around a basal perturbation.

TI  - Current status and challenges in sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Although a number of feasibility studies for sentinel node (SN) concepts in gastric cancer have been conducted since 2000, there remains a debate regarding detailed detection techniques and oncological safety. Two important multicenter phase II clinical trials were performed in Japan that used different methods and reached different conclusions; one confirmed acceptable results with a false-negative rate of 7%, and the other showed an unacceptably high false-negative rate of 46.4%. The Sentinel Node Oriented Tailored Approach (SENORITA) trial is a multicenter randomized controlled phase III trial being performed in Korea. Patient enrollment is now complete and the long-term results are currently awaited. Recently, an image-guided SN mapping technique using infrared ray/fluorescence was introduced. This method might be a promising technology because it allows the clear visualization of SNs. With regard to the primary tumor, the non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery technique and non-exposure endolaparoscopic full-thickness resection with simple suturing technique have been reported. These methods prevent abdominal infection and tumor seeding and can be good alternatives to conventional laparoscopic gastric wedge resection. For indications, SN navigation surgery can be extended to patients who underwent non-curative endoscopic resection. Although a few studies have been performed on these patients, sentinel concepts may be beneficial to patients as they omit the need for additional gastrectomy. SN navigation surgery can lead to actual organ-preserving surgery and plays a key role in improving the quality of life of patients with early gastric cancer in the future.

We prospectively assessed the effect of Sentinel node mapping on staging and survival in patients with non-metastatic colon cancer.Methods An observational and prospective study was designed. 105 patients with colon cancer were selected. Patients were classified according to node involvement as: N1, with node invasion detected by the conventional techniques; up-staged, with node invasion detected only by sentinel node mapping; and N0, with negative lymph node involvement by both techniques. Five-year survival and disease-free survival rates were analysed. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for disease-free and overall survival.Results Sentinel node mapping was successfully applied in 78 patients: 33 % were N1; 24.5 % were up-staged (18 patients with isolated tumour cells and 1 patient with micrometastases); and 42.5 % were N0. N1 patients had the poorest overall 5-year survival (65.4 %) and 5-year disease-free survival (69.2 %) rates compared with the other two groups. No significant 5-year survival differences were observed between N0 patients (87.9 %) and up-staged patients (84.2 %).Conclusions Patients up-staged after sentinel node mapping do not have a poorer prognosis than patients without node involvement. Detection of isolated cancer cells was not a poor prognosis factor in these patients.

AB  - An epidemiological analysis of the temporal and spatial patterns of LSD epidemics and of the risk factors for LSD spread in south-eastern Europe was performed, based on the data collected from affected and at risk countries. Since 2015, the extent of the LSD epidemics in south-eastern Europe was over 7,600 LSD outbreaks with 12,800 affected animals, with most outbreaks occurring between May and August. Most LSD spread occurs over a relatively small distance, approximately between 10 and 20 km, and the speed of propagation was estimated to be mostly up 2 km/ day, in agreement with the vector-borne pattern of LSD. Proximity to affected farms, warm temperatures and related vector abundance were among the main risk factors for LSD spread. Within a few months' at least 90% of the animal population had been vaccinated with live homologous vaccine against LSD in south-eastern Europe. Where almost total vaccination coverage was achieved, no further outbreaks were reported. The vaccination effectiveness in Albania was estimated to be around 70% at farm level and 77% at animal level. Possible adverse effects to live homologous vaccine, including fever, decreased milk production and oedema at injection site were reported in Croatia (a LSD-free country) mostly within 2 weeks after vaccination, in 0.09% of the vaccinated animals. Unique farm identifiers should be always used across all databases, so to allow further analysis especially on improving the mathematical models for more robust estimates of transmission parameters applicable to the region, and for better estimation of vaccination effectiveness. All suspected clinical cases in vaccinated animals should be confirmed by differentiating field virus from vaccine strain. Trapping surveys for estimation of vector abundance can be carried out by targeting some sentinel farms, to be followed up during the whole LSD season, while long-term studies can give more accurate information about species composition and seasonality of potential LSD vectors.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite renewed efforts to better understand glacier change and recognize glacier change trends in the Andes, relatively large areas in the Andes of Argentina and Chile are still not investigated. In this study, we report on glacier elevation and mass changes in the outer region of the Northern and Southern Patagonian Icefields in the Southern Patagonian Andes. A newly-compiled Landsat ETM+ derived glacier inventory (consisting of 2253 glaciers and similar to 1314 +/- 66 km(2) of ice area) and differencing of the SRTM and SPOT5 DEMs were used to derive glacier-specific elevation changes over the 2000-12 period. The investigated glaciers showed a volume change of -0.71 +/- 0.55 km(3) a(-1), yielding a surface lowering of 0.52 +/- 0.35 m a(-1) on average and an overall mass loss of 0.46 +/- 0.37 m w.e. a(-1). Highly variable individual glacier responses were observed and interestingly, they were less negative than previously reported for the neighboring Patagonian Icefields.

TI  - Early detection of West Nile virus in France: quantitative assessment of syndromic surveillance system using nervous signs in horses
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a growing public health concern in Europe and there is a need to develop more efficient early detection systems. Nervous signs in horses are considered to be an early indicator of WNV and, using them in a syndromic surveillance system, might be relevant. In our study, we assessed whether or not data collected by the passive French surveillance system for the surveillance of equine diseases can be used routinely for the detection of WNV. We tested several pre-processing methods and detection algorithms based on regression. We evaluated system performances using simulated and authentic data and compared them to those of the surveillance system currently in place. Our results show that the current detection algorithm provided similar performances to those tested using simulated and real data. However, regression models can be easily and better adapted to surveillance objectives. The detection performances obtained were compatible with the early detection of WNV outbreaks in France (i.e. sensitivity 98%, specificity >94%, timeliness 2.5 weeks and around four false alarms per year) but further work is needed to determine the most suitable alarm threshold for WNV surveillance in France using cost-efficiency analysis.

TI  - Examining Spatial Distribution and Dynamic Change of Urban Land Covers in the Brazilian Amazon Using Multitemporal Multisensor High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam began in 2011, resulting in rapidly increased population from less than 80,000 persons before 2010 to more than 150,000 persons in 2012 in Altamira, Para State, Brazil. This rapid urbanization has produced many problems in urban planning and management, as well as challenging environmental conditions, requiring monitoring of urban land-cover change at high temporal and spatial resolutions. However, the frequent cloud cover in the moist tropical region is a big problem, impeding the acquisition of cloud-free optical sensor data. Thanks to the availability of different kinds of high spatial resolution satellite images in recent decades, RapidEye imagery in 2011 and 2012, Pleiades imagery in 2013 and 2014, SPOT 6 imagery in 2015, and CBERS imagery in 2016 with spatial resolutions from 0.5 m to 10 m were collected for this research. Because of the difference in spectral and spatial resolutions among these satellite images, directly conducting urban land-cover change using conventional change detection techniques, such as image differencing and principal component analysis, was not feasible. Therefore, a hybrid approach was proposed based on integration of spectral and spatial features to classify the high spatial resolution satellite images into six land-cover classes: impervious surface area (ISA), bare soil, building demolition, water, pasture, and forest/plantation. A post-classification comparison approach was then used to detect urban land-cover change annually for the periods between 2011 and 2016. The focus was on the analysis of ISA expansion, the dynamic change between pasture and bare soil, and the changes in forest/plantation. This study indicates that the hybrid approach can effectively extract six land-cover types with overall accuracy of over 90%. ISA increased continuously through conversion from pasture and bare soil. The Belo Monte dam construction resulted in building demolition in 2015 in low-lying areas along the rivers and an increase in water bodies in 2016. Because of the dam construction, forest/plantation and pasture decreased much faster, while ISA and water increased much faster in 2011-2016 than they had between 1991 and 2011. About 50% of the increased annual deforestation area can be attributed to the dam construction between 2011 and 2016. The spatial patterns of annual urban land-cover distribution and rates of dynamic change provided important data sources for making better decisions for urban management and planning in this city and others experiencing such explosive demographic change.

TI  - Generating Up-to-Date and Detailed Land Use and Land Cover Maps Using OpenStreetMap and GlobeLand30
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the opening up of the Landsat archive, global high resolution land cover maps have begun to appear. However, they often have only a small number of high level land cover classes and they are static products, corresponding to a particular period of time, e.g., the GlobeLand30 (GL30) map for 2010. The OpenStreetMap (OSM), in contrast, consists of a very detailed, dynamically updated, spatial database of mapped features from around the world, but it suffers from incomplete coverage, and layers of overlapping features that are tagged in a variety of ways. However, it clearly has potential for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. Thus the aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the OSM can be converted into a LULC map and how this OSM-derived LULC map can then be used to first update the GL30 with more recent information and secondly, enhance the information content of the classes. The technique is demonstrated on two study areas where there is availability of OSM data but in locations where authoritative data are lacking, i.e., Kathmandu, Nepal and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The GL30 and its updated and enhanced versions are independently validated using a stratified random sample so that the three maps can be compared. The results show that the updated version of GL30 improves in terms of overall accuracy since certain classes were not captured well in the original GL30 (e.g., water in Kathmandu and water/wetlands in Dar es Salaam). In contrast, the enhanced GL30, which contains more detailed urban classes, results in a drop in the overall accuracy, possibly due to the increased number of classes, but the advantages include the appearance of more detailed features, such as the road network, that becomes clearly visible.

TI  - Detection of terrain indices related to soil salinity and mapping salt-affected soils using remote sensing and geostatistical techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional surveying methods of soil properties over landscapes are dramatically cost and time-consuming. Thus, remote sensing is a proper choice for monitoring environmental problem. This research aims to study the effect of environmental factors on soil salinity and to map the spatial distribution of this salinity over the southern east part of Tunisia by means of remote sensing and geostatistical techniques. For this purpose, we used Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer data to depict geomorphological parameters: elevation, slope, plan curvature (PLC), profile curvature (PRC), and aspect. Pearson correlation between these parameters and soil electrical conductivity (ECsoil) showed that mainly slope and elevation affect the concentration of salt in soil. Moreover, spectral analysis illustrated the high potential of short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands to identify saline soils. To map soil salinity in southern Tunisia, ordinary kriging (OK), minimum distance (MD) classification, and simple regression (SR) were used. The findings showed that ordinary kriging technique provides the most reliable performances to identify and classify saline soils over the study area with a root mean square error of 1.83 and mean error of 0.018.

TI  - Protestant Unity and Anti-Catholicism: The Irenicism and Philo-Semitism of John Dury in Context
T2  - JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the religious and political worldview of the Scottish minister John Dury during the English Revolution of the mid-seventeenth century. It argues that Dury's activities as an irenicist and philo-semite must be understood as interrelated aspects of an expansionist Protestant cause that included Britain, Ireland, continental Europe, and the Atlantic world. Dury sought to imitate and counter what he perceived to be the principal strengths of early modern Catholicism: confessional unity, imperial expansion, and the coordination of global missionary efforts. The 1640s and 1650s saw the scope of Dury's long-standing vision grow to encompass colonial expansion in Ireland and America, where English and continental Protestants might work together to fortify their position against Spain and its growing Catholic empire. Both Portuguese Jews and American Indians appear in this vision as victims of Spanish Catholicism in desperate need of Protestant help. This article thus offers new perspectives on several aspects of Dury's career, including his relationship with displaced Anglo-Irish Protestants in London, his proposal to establish a college for the study of Jewish learning and Oriental languages, his speculation regarding the Lost Tribes of Israel in America, and his cautious advocacy for the toleration of Jews in England.

TI  - Transit probabilities around hypervelocity and runaway stars
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the blooming field of exoplanetary science, NASA's Kepler Space Telescope has revolutionized our understanding of exoplanets. Kepler's very precise and long-duration photometry is ideal for detecting planetary transits around Sun-like stars. The forthcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is expected to continue Kepler's legacy. Along with transits, the Doppler technique remains an invaluable tool for discovering planets. The next generation of spectrographs, such as G-CLEF, promise precision radial velocity measurements. In this paper, we explore the possibility of detecting planets around hypervelocity and runaway stars, which should host a very compact system as consequence of their turbulent origin. We find that the probability of a multiplanetary transit is 10(-3) less than or similar to P less than or similar to 10(-1). We therefore need to observe similar to 10-1000 high-velocity stars to spot a transit. However, even if transits are rare around runaway and hypervelocity stars, the chances of detecting such planets using radial velocity surveys is high. We predict that the European Gaia satellite, along with TESS and the new-generation spectrographs G-CLEF and ESPRESSO, will spot planetary systems orbiting high-velocity stars.

TI  - Prospective cohort study assessing chronic pain in patients following minor surgery for breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Pain after tumorectomy and sentinel lymph node dissection is poorly reported in the literature. We carried out a prospective survey aimed at assessing pain three months after such minor surgery for breast cancer.The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Most surgeries followed a standard protocol involving general anesthesia with no regional analgesia technique, laryngeal mask, sufentanil and propofol for induction, and multimodal analgesia during the postoperative period. Three months after the surgery, a questionnaire was sent to the patients with a pre-stamped envelope for return. The questions probed responses required to calculate a Brief Pain Inventory score and modified neuropathic pain score (DN3).Over a 5-month period, 150 patients (aged 60 (11) years, body mass index of 25 (6) kg/m(2)) were included in the final analysis. In the recovery room, 43% of patients required morphine at a mean dose of 5.2 (1.8) mg. Three months post surgery, 60 patients (40%) reported persistent pain for which 62% took analgesic drugs. We found no risk factor associated with this persistent pain among our studied population. Neuropathic pain was noted in 61% of patients who reported persistent pain primarily associated with periareolar incision.Pain persisted up to three months after minor surgery for breast cancer in 40% of patients with mostly a neuropathic component (61%).

AB  - The vegetation coverage from multi-source at multi-scale and multi-source at the same scale in urban area was studied. The Landsat 7 ETM +, SPOT 5 and IKONOS remote sensing image data were taken as the data source. The vegetation coverage with different spatial resolutions derived from a 1:500 topographic map as the reference map by grid method was taken as reference. The accuracies of fraction vegetation coverage extracted from the images, wich were radiometrically corrected using different models, were compared. An optimal radiometric correction model for the extraction of fraction vegetation coverage in urban areas was proposed. The results show that ICM model is the best radiometric correction model for estimating fraction vegetation coverage in urban area. NDVI is. the best vegetation index for fraction vegetation coverage estimation for high resolution remote sensing images, while the best vegetation indices for estimating fraction vegetation coverage from moderate spatial resolution images are the RVI and MSAVI. For the studies area, the GI model is more accurate than. the CR model in estimating the vegetation coverage.

TI  - Extrapolating Forest Canopy Fuel Properties in the California Rim Fire by Combining Airborne LiDAR and Landsat OLI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate, spatially explicit information about forest canopy fuel properties is essential for ecosystem management strategies for reducing the severity of forest fires. Airborne LiDAR technology has demonstrated its ability to accurately map canopy fuels. However, its geographical and temporal coverage is limited, thus making it difficult to characterize fuel properties over large regions before catastrophic events occur. This study presents a two-step methodology for integrating post-fire airborne LiDAR and pre-fire Landsat OLI (Operational Land Imager) data to estimate important pre-fire canopy fuel properties for crown fire spread, namely canopy fuel load (CFL), canopy cover (CC), and canopy bulk density (CBD). This study focused on a fire prone area affected by the large 2013 Rim fire in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, USA. First, LiDAR data was used to estimate CFL, CC, and CBD across an unburned 2 km buffer with similar structural characteristics to the burned area. Second, the LiDAR-based canopy fuel properties were extrapolated over the whole area using Landsat OLI data, which yielded an R-2 of 0.8, 0.79, and 0.64 and RMSE of 3.76 Mg.ha(-1), 0.09, and 0.02 kg.m(-3) for CFL, CC, and CBD, respectively. The uncertainty of the estimates was estimated for each pixel using a bootstrapping approach, and the 95% confidence intervals are reported. The proposed methodology provides a detailed spatial estimation of forest canopy fuel properties along with their uncertainty that can be readily integrated into fire behavior and fire effects models. The methodology could be also integrated into the LANDFIRE program to improve the information on canopy fuels.

TI  - Review of sentinel node procedure in cN0 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Guidelines from the French evaluation cooperative subgroup of GETTEC
T2  - EUROPEAN ANNALS OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - The reliability of the sentinel lymph node (SN) technique has been established for more than ten years in T1-T2 oral cavity and oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma. Although most authors stress the necessity of rigorous implementation, there are no agreed guidelines. Moreover, other indications have been described, in other anatomical areas of the upper aerodigestive tract and in case of previous surgery or radiotherapy. SN expert teams, under the GETTEC head and neck tumor study group, conducted a review of the key points for implementation in head and neck cancers through guidelines and a review of classical and extended indications. Reliability depends on respecting key points of preoperative landmarking by lymphoscintigraphy, and intraoperative SN sampling and histological analysis. The SN technique is the best means of diagnosing occult lymph node involvement, whatever the primary tumor location, T stage or patient history. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

It remains a matter of debate, whether SLND and hence, removal of potential lymph node micrometastasis will alter survival outcome.ObjectiveThe aim of this group-matched analysis was to compare survival data of a large cohort of melanoma patients who were treated by wide local excision only (WLE) and nodal observation (WLE group) to a group of patients treated with WLE plus SLND group to investigate the potential therapeutic benefit of SLND in the treatment of patients with melanoma.Methods and materialsA total of 596 consecutive patients who had undergone WLE plus SLND between 1996 and 2003 were assessed. As a historical control group 596 patients treated with WLE and nodal observation but without SLND between 1986 and 1995 were selected. The groups were matched according to sex, age, Breslow tumour thickness and localization of primary tumour. The adjuvant treatment and follow-up examinations were performed according to protocols of the German Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group (DeCOG) and applicable study protocols that our clinic participated in; and hence, subject to change over time.ResultsKaplan-Meier testing revealed significant differences in survival in favour of the SLND group. Mean overall tumour-specific survival (OS) was 102.7 months in the SLND group vs. 97.0 months in the WLE group respectively (P-value: 0.024). Disease-free survival (log-rank test: 0.003) and time to lymph node progression (P-value: <0.01) also differed significantly between the two groups.ConclusionSLND is not only an important diagnostic procedure, but might also be of therapeutic benefit in terms of disease-free and overall tumour-specific survival of melanoma patients.

TI  - Sentinel node detection in early breast cancer with intraoperative portable gamma camera: UK experience
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Access to nuclear medicine department for sentinel node imaging remains an issue in number of hospitals in the UK and many parts of the world. Sentinella is a portable imaging camera used intraoperatively to produce real time visual localisation of sentinel lymph nodes.Methods: Sentinella was tested in a controlled laboratory environment at our centre and we report our experience on the first use of this technology from UK. Moreover, preoperative scintigrams of the axilla were obtained in 144 patients undergoing sentinel node biopsy using conventional gamma camera. Sentinella scans were done intra-operatively to correlate with the pre -operative scintigram and to determine presence of any residual hot node after the axilla was deemed to be clear based on the silence of the hand held gamma probe.Results: Sentinella detected significantly more nodes compared with CGC (p < 0.0001). Sentinella picked up extra nodes in 5/144 cases after the axilla was found silent using hand held gamma probe. In 2/ 144 cases, extra nodes detected by Sentinella confirmed presence of tumour cells that led to a complete axillary clearance.Conclusions: Sentinella is a reliable technique for intra-operative localisation of radioactive nodes. It provides increased nodal visualisation rates compared to static scintigram imaging and proves to be an important tool for harvesting all hot sentinel nodes. This portable gamma camera can definitely replace the use of conventional lymphoscintigrams saving time and money both for patients and the health system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Using Satellite and Lightning Data to Track Rapidly Developing Thunderstorms in Data Sparse Regions
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar systems provide the most useful information about the intensity, movement, and characteristics of severe thunderstorms, but are expensive to maintain and require extensive maintenance. In South Africa, some areas are not covered by radar systems, while very few operational radar systems exist in other southern African countries. Despite these shortcomings, all meteorological centers still have to warn the public of pending severe weather events. The Nowcasting Satellite Application Facility (NWC SAF) in Europe developed software that utilizes satellite data to identify and track rapidly developing thunderstorms (RDT). The NWC software was installed at the South African Weather Service in 2014. Initially, the RDT product was validated against lightning data and the results showed that the RDT product could provide very useful information on possible severe or intense convective storms. This study focusses on the effects of including lightning as an ancillary dataset into the algorithms and then validating the RDT product against radar data. Twenty-five summer cases were considered to determine whether the inclusion of lightning data had a positive effect on the accuracy of the RDT product, when compared to radar data. The results of this study show that in the majority of the cases, the inclusion of lightning data was beneficial to the RDT product. On average the Probability of Detection (POD) improved by 6.6%, the Heidke Skill Score (HSS) by 4.6%, and the False alarm ratio (FAR) by 0.1%. To our knowledge, South Africa is the only African country which is running the NWC SAF software operationally and which has performed an evaluation of the product over Africa against observations from radar systems and lightning sensors. The outcomes of this study are very encouraging for other countries in Africa where convection and severe convection often occur and sophisticated data sources are absent. Initial studies over East Africa indicate that the RDT product can benefit operational practices for the nowcasting of severe convection events.

TI  - Techniques for abdominal wall reconstruction in intestinal transplantation
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewOne of the most important challenges in the intestinal ( ITx) and multivisceral transplant ( MVTx) is to achieve a successful abdominal wall closure.Recent findingsA tension-free primary closure should be our aim. In most of the cases, we need to perform a component separation technique, alone or combined, to the use of a synthetic mesh. If those options are not feasible, the abdominal wall composite vascularized allograft transplant ( AW-CVA) utilizing direct orthotopic vascularization can be considered. The nonvascularized abdominal rectus fascia has also become an alternative method used worldwide, proving to be simple and well tolerated procedure. Furthermore, the use of the AW has been recently proposed as a new tool for a sentinel monitoring of the intestinal or pancreas allograft.SummaryThere are different validated options for abdominal wall closure following intestinal transplantation. The long-term benefits of transplanting the abdominal wall, full or partial thickness and vascularized or nonvascularised, were shown. New developments might help to expand their applications in different areas such as reconstructive surgery and immunology.

TI  - Bare soil hydrological balance model "MHYSAN": Calibration and validation using SAR moisture products and continuous thetaprobe network measurements over bare agricultural soils (Tunisia)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study highlights the potential of multi-temporal X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) moisture products to be used for the calibration of a model reproducing soil moisture (SM) variations. We propose the MHYSAN model (Modele de bilan HYdrique des Sols Agricoles Nus) for simulating soil water balance of bare soils. This model was used to simulate surface evaporation fluxes and SM content at daily time scale over a semi-arid, bare agricultural site in Tunisia (North Africa). Two main approaches are considered in this study. Firstly, the MHYSAN model was successfully. calibrated for seven sites using continuous thetaprobe measurements at two depths. Then the possibility to extrapolate local SM simulations at distant sites, based on soil texture similarity only, was tested. This extrapolation was assessed using SAR estimates and manual thetaprobe measurements of SM recorded at these distant sites. The results reveal a bias of approximately 0.63% and 3.04%, and an RMSE equal to 6.11% and 4.5%, for the SAR volumetric SM and manual thetaprobe measurements, respectively. In a second approach, the MHYSAN model was calibrated using seven very high-resolution SAR (TerraSAR-X) SM outputs ranging over only two months. The simulated SM were validated using continuous thetaprobe measurements during 15 months. Although the SM was measured on only seven different dates for the purposes of calibration, satisfactory results were obtained as a result of the wide range of SM values recorded in these seven images. This led to good overall calibration of the soil parameters, thus demonstrating the considerable potential of Sentinel-1 images for daily soil moisture monitoring using simple models.

TI  - Drought impacts on vegetation activity in the Mediterranean region: An assessment using remote sensing data and multi-scale drought indicators
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work analyzes the drought impacts on vegetation over the entire Mediterranean basin, with the purpose of determining the vegetation communities, regions and seasons at which vegetation is driven by drought. Our approach is based on the use of remote sensing data and a multi-scalar drought index. Correlation maps between fields of monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at different time scales (1-24 months) were computed for representative months of winter (Feb), spring (May), summer (Aug) and fall (Nov). Results for the period from 1982 to 2006 show large areas highly controlled by drought, although presenting high spatial and seasonal differences, with a maximum influence in August and a minimum in February. The highest correlation values are observed in February for 3 months' time scale and in May for 6 and 12 months. The higher control of drought on vegetation in February and May is obtained mainly over the drier vegetation communities (Mediterranean Dry and Desertic) at shorter time scales (3 to 9 months). Additionally, in February the impact of drought on vegetation is lower for Temperate Oceanic and Continental vegetation types and takes place at longer time scales (18-24). The dependence of drought time-scale response with water balance, as obtained through a simple difference between precipitation and reference evapotranspiration, varies with vegetation communities. During February and November low water balance values correspond to shorter time scales over dry vegetation communities, whereas high water balance values implies longer time scales over Temperate Oceanic and Continental areas. The strong control of drought on vegetation observed for Mediterranean Dry and Desertic vegetation types located over areas with high negative values of water balance emphasizes the need for an early warning drought system covering the entire Mediterranean basin. We are confident that these results will provide a useful tool for drought management plans and play a relevant role in mitigating the impact of drought episodes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Some attributes of snow occurrence and snowmelt/sublimation rates in the Lesotho Highlands: environmental implications
T2  - WATER SA
M3  - Article
AB  - We present attributes of snow occurrence and dissipation rates ( melt and sublimation) for the Lesotho Highlands, based on remotely-sensed MODIS images from 2003-2016. Multi-temporal imagery is used, with SNOMAP and NDSI algorithms applied to MODIS Rapid Response images. The spatial extent of snow loss was determined by daily repeat measurements of snow coverage, which was calculated from each filtered and trimmed MODIS SNOMAP image using the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst tool. Results indicate an average of 11.5 snowfalls per annum for the years 2003-2016; with snow longevity averaging ca. 10 days following individual snowfalls in mid-winter. Snow cover on the highest south-facing slopes persists longest during the months of June to August, in particular along the southern Drakensberg where it averages ca. 58 days during these 3 months. Mean daily melt increases by 1.6% per 1 degrees C rise during the first 5 days post-snowfall, and by 3.3% per 1 degrees C rise for 6 to 10 days post-snowfall. However, snowmelt rates are spatially highly variable given other factors such as wind deflation and wind-induced sublimation. The observed snow trends have important implications for biosystem functioning, regional climate and hydrology, earth surface processes, and rural livelihoods in the Lesotho Highlands.

TI  - An Open-Source Semi-Automated Processing Chain for Urban Object-Based Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the development of a semi-automated processing chain for urban object-based land-cover and land-use classification. The processing chain is implemented in Python and relies on existing open-source software GRASS GIS and R. The complete tool chain is available in open access and is adaptable to specific user needs. For automation purposes, we developed two GRASS GIS add-ons enabling users (1) to optimize segmentation parameters in an unsupervised manner and (2) to classify remote sensing data using several individual machine learning classifiers or their prediction combinations through voting-schemes. We tested the performance of the processing chain using sub-metric multispectral and height data on two very different urban environments: Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso in sub-Saharan Africa and Liege, Belgium in Western Europe. Using a hierarchical classification scheme, the overall accuracy reached 93% at the first level (5 classes) and about 80% at the second level (11 and 9 classes, respectively).

TI  - Attitudes toward prenatal genetic testing and therapeutic termination of pregnancy among parents of offspring with Prader-Willi syndrome
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Prenatal diagnosis (PND) raises ethical dilemmas such as the option of termination of pregnancy (TOP) in cases with severe outcome. Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a complex neurogenetic syndrome with high morbidity and mortality throughout life. Recently, a unique prenatal phenotype was reported and TOP becomes a possibility.Objective: To explore factors influencing the attitudes of parents of PWS children toward PND and TOP concerning a hypothetical pregnancy with a PWS fetus.Methods: All 85 parents of individuals with PWS were interviewed regarding their attitudes towards PND and TOP using semi-structured questionnaire.Results: Fifty-seven parents were supportive of invasive PND and 28 of non-invasive tests only; none opposed PND. Thirty eight favored TOP, additional 31 supported TOP under certain conditions such as spiritual advice, 15 were categorically against TOP. Attitudes correlated with religiosity (p < 0.025), mother's education (p < 0.001), mother's work status (p < 0.001), current age of the child with PWS (p < 0.008). Couples had similar attitudes regarding PND and TOP. No correlation was found with gender, genetic subtype and parental age.Conclusions: Most parents of individuals with PWS support PND, however less than half support TOP. Religiosity was the most influential factor. Familial worldview should be taken into account during prenatal counseling. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Birds and flame retardants: A review of the toxic effects on birds of historical and novel flame retardants
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Flame retardants (FRs) are a diverse group of chemicals, many of which persist in the environment and bioaccumulate in biota. Although some FRs have been withdrawn from manufacturing and commerce (e.g., legacy FRs), many continue to be detected in the environment; moreover, their replacements and/or other novel FRs are also detected in biota. Here, we review and summarize the literature on the toxic effects of various FRs on birds. Birds integrate chemical information (exposure, effects) across space and time, making them ideal sentinels of environmental contamination. Following an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) approach, we synthesized information on 8 of the most commonly reported endpoints in avian FR toxicity research: molecular measures, thyroid-related measures, steroids, retinol, brain anatomy, behaviour, growth and development, and reproduction. We then identified which of these endpoints appear more/most sensitive to FR exposure, as determined by the frequency of significant effects across avian studies. The avian thyroid system, largely characterized by inconsistent changes in circulating thyroid hormones that were the only measure in many such studies, appears to be moderately sensitive to FR exposure relative to the other endpoints; circulating thyroid hormones, after reproductive measures, being the most frequently examined endpoint. A more comprehensive examination with concurrent measurements of multiple thyroid endpoints (e.g., thyroid gland, deiodinase enzymes) is recommended for future studies to more fully understand potential avian thyroid toxicity of FRs. More research is required to determine the effects of various FRs on avian retinol concentrations, inconsistently sensitive across species, and to concurrently assess multiple steroid hormones. Behaviour related to courtship and reproduction was the most sensitive of all selected endpoints, with significant effects recorded in every study. Among domesticated species (Galliformes), raptors (Accipitriformes and Falconiformes), songbirds (Passeriformes), and other species of birds (e.g. gulls), raptors seem to be the most sensitive to FR exposure across these measurements. We recommend that future avian research connect biochemical disruptions and changes in the brain to ecologically relevant endpoints, such as behaviour and reproduction. Moreover, connecting in vivo endpoints with molecular endpoints for non-domesticated avian species is also highly important, and essential to linking FR exposure with reduced fitness and population-level effects.

TI  - French updated recommendations in Stage I to III melanoma treatment and management
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As knowledge continues to develop, regular updates are necessary concerning recommendations for practice. The recommendations for the management of melanoma stages I to III were drawn up in 2005. At the request of the Societe Francaise de Dermatologie, they have now been updated using the methodology for recommendations proposed by the Haute Autorite de Sante in France. In practice, the principal recommendations are as follows: for staging, it is recommended that the 7th edition of AJCC be used. The maximum excision margins have been reduced to 2 cm. Regarding adjuvant therapy, the place of interferon has been reduced and no validated emerging medication has yet been identified. Radiotherapy may be considered for patients in Stage III at high risk of relapse. The sentinel lymph node technique remains an option. Initial examination includes routine ultrasound as of Stage II, with other examinations being optional in stages IIC and III. A shorter strict follow-up period (3 years) is recommended for patients, but with greater emphasis on imaging.

TI  - Evaluation of the trend uncertainty in summer ozone valley over the Tibetan Plateau in three reanalysis datasets
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Trend uncertainty in the ozone valley over the Tibetan Plateau (OVTP) and the South Asian high (SAH) during 1979-2009 in ERA-Interim (interim reanalysis data from the ECMWF), JRA-55 (55-yr reanalysis data from the Japan Meteorological Agency), and NCEP-CFSR (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis) datasets was evaluated. The results showed that the NCEP-CFSR OVTP became strong in the summers of 1979-2009, whereas it became weak according to ERA-Interim and JRA-55. Satellite data merged with TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) agreed with the OVTP trend of NCEP-CFSR. The OVTP strengthening in NCEP-CFSR may have been caused by SAH intensification, a rising tropopause, and increasing ozone over non-TP (non-Tibetan Plateau) areas (27A degrees-37A degrees N, < 75A degrees E and > 105A degrees E). Analogously, the OVTP weakening in ERA-Interim and JRA-55 may have been affected by weakening SAH, descending tropopause, and decreasing non-TP ozone.

TI  - Variations in Growing-Season NDVI and Its Response to Permafrost Degradation in Northeast China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost is extremely sensitive to climate change. The degradation of permafrost has strong and profound effects on vegetation. The permafrost zone of northeastern China is the second largest region of permafrost in China and lies on the south edge of the Eurasian cryolithozone. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of the growing-season Normalization Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the permafrost zone of northeastern China and analyzed the correlation between NDVI and ground surface temperatures (GST) during the years 1981-2014. Mean growing-season NDVI (MGS-NDVI) experienced a marked increase of 0.003 year 1 across the entire permafrost zone. The spatial dynamics of vegetation cover had a high degree of heterogeneity on a per pixel scale. The MGS-NDVI value increased significantly (5% significance level) in 80.57%, and this increase was mostly distributed in permafrost zone except for the western steppe region. Only 7.72% experienced a significant decrease in NDVI, mainly in the cultivated and steppe portions. In addition, MGS-NDVI increased significantly with increasing growing-season mean ground surface temperature (GS-MGST). Our results suggest that a warming of GS-MGST (permafrost degradation) in the permafrost region of northeastern China played a positive role in increasing plant growth and activities. Although increasing ground surface temperature resulted in increased vegetation cover and growth in the short time of permafrost degradation, from the long term point of view, permafrost degradation or disappearance may weaken or even hinder vegetation activities.

TI  - A Review of Wetland Remote Sensing
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Wetlands are some of the most important ecosystems on Earth. They play a key role in alleviating floods and filtering polluted water and also provide habitats for many plants and animals. Wetlands also interact with climate change. Over the past 50 years, wetlands have been polluted and declined dramatically as land cover has changed in some regions. Remote sensing has been the most useful tool to acquire spatial and temporal information about wetlands. In this paper, seven types of sensors were reviewed: aerial photos coarse-resolution, medium-resolution, high-resolution, hyperspectral imagery, radar, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. This study also discusses the advantage of each sensor for wetland research. Wetland research themes reviewed in this paper include wetland classification, habitat or biodiversity, biomass estimation, plant leaf chemistry, water quality, mangrove forest, and sea level rise. This study also gives an overview of the methods used in wetland research such as supervised and unsupervised classification and decision tree and object-based classification. Finally, this paper provides some advice on future wetland remote sensing. To our knowledge, this paper is the most comprehensive and detailed review of wetland remote sensing and it will be a good reference for wetland researchers.

TI  - Improving Fractional Impervious Surface Mapping Performance through Combination of DMSP-OLS and MODIS NDVI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface area (ISA) is an important parameter for many studies such as urban climate, urban environmental change, and air pollution; however, mapping ISA at the regional or global scale is still challenging due to the complexity of impervious surface features. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) data have been used for ISA mapping, but high uncertainty existed due to mixed-pixel and data-saturation problems. This paper presents a new index called normalized impervious surface index (NISI), which is an integration of DMSP-OLS and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, in order to reduce these problems. Meanwhile, this newly developed index is compared with previously used indices-Human Settlement Index (HSI) and Vegetation Adjusted Nighttime light Urban Index (VANUI)-in ISA mapping performance. We selected China as an example to map fractional ISA distribution through a support vector regression approach based on the relationship between the index and Landsat-derived ISA data. The results indicate that the proposed NISI provided better ISA estimation accuracy than HSI and VANUI, especially when the fractional ISA in a pixel is relatively large (i.e., >0.6) or very small (i.e., <0.2). This approach can be used to rapidly update ISA datasets at regional and global scales.

TI  - Simulating climate change impact on soil erosion using RUSLE model - A case study in a watershed of mid-Himalayan landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change, particularly due to the changed precipitation trend, can have a severe impact on soil erosion. The effect is more pronounced on the higher slopes of the Himalayan region. The goal of this study was to estimate the impact of climate change on soil erosion in a watershed of the Himalayan region using RUSLE model. The GCM (general circulation model) derived emission scenarios (HadCM3 A2a and B2a SRES) were used for climate projection. The statistical downscaling model (SDSM) was used to downscale the precipitation for three future periods, 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2099, at large scale. Rainfall erosivity (R) was calculated for future periods using the SDSM downscaled precipitation data. ASTER digital elevation model (DEM) and Indian Remote Sensing data - IRS LISS IV satellite data were used to generate the spatial input parameters required by RUSLE model. A digital soil-landscape map was prepared to generate spatially distributed soil erodibility (K) factor map of the watershed. Topographic factors, slope length (L) and steepness (S) were derived from DEM. Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the satellite data was used to represent spatial variation vegetation density and condition under various land use/land cover. This variation was used to represent spatial vegetation cover factor. Analysis revealed that the average annual soil loss may increase by 28.38, 25.64 and 20.33% in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively under A2 scenario, while under B2 scenario, it may increase by 27.06, 25.31 and 23.38% in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively, from the base period (1985-2013). The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the possible future scenario of soil erosion in the mid-Himalaya for scientists and policy makers.

TI  - Update on Glucose Management Among Noncritically Ill Patients Hospitalized on Medical and Surgical Wards.
T2  - Journal of the Endocrine Society
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Hyperglycemia is a common issue affecting inpatient care. Although this is in part because of the higher rate of hospitalization among patients with preexisting diabetes, multiple factors complicate inpatient glucose management, including acute stress from illness or surgery, erratic dietary intake, and contribution of medications. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that poorly controlled blood glucose levels are associated with negative clinical outcomes, such as increased mortality, higher rate of surgical complications, and longer length of hospital stay. Given these concerns, there has been extensive study of the optimal strategy for management of glucose levels, with the bulk of existing literature focusing on insulin therapy in the intensive care unit setting. This review shifts the focus to the general adult medical and surgical wards, using clinical guidelines and sentinel studies to describe the scientific basis behind the current basal-bolus insulin-based approach to blood sugar management among noncritically ill inpatients. Patient-centered clinical trials looking at alternative dosing regimens and insulin analog and noninsulin agents, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist therapies, introduce safe and effective options in the management of inpatient hyperglycemia. Data from these studies reveal that these approaches are of comparable safety and efficacy to the traditional basal-bolus insulin regimen, and may offer additional benefit in terms of less monitoring requirements and lower rates of hypoglycemia. Although existing data are encouraging, outcome studies will be needed to better establish the clinical impact of these more recently proposed approaches in an effort to broaden and improve current clinical practices in inpatient diabetes care.

TI  - Implications of atmospheric conditions for analysis of surface temperature variability derived from landscape-scale thermography
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) cameras perfectly bridge the gap between (i) on-site measurements of land surface temperature (LST) providing high temporal resolution at the cost of low spatial coverage and (ii) remotely sensed data from satellites that provide high spatial coverage at relatively low spatio-temporal resolution. While LST data from satellite (LSTsat) and airborne platforms are routinely corrected for atmospheric effects, such corrections are barely applied for LST from ground-based TIR imagery (using TIR cameras; LSTcam). We show the consequences of neglecting atmospheric effects on LSTcam of different vegetated surfaces at landscape scale. We compare LST measured from different platforms, focusing on the comparison of LST data from on-site radiometry (LSTosr) and LSTcam using a commercially available TIR camera in the region of Bozen/Bolzano (Italy). Given a digital elevation model and measured vertical air temperature profiles, we developed a multiple linear regression model to correct LSTcam data for atmospheric influences. We could show the distinct effect of atmospheric conditions and related radiative processes along the measurement path on LSTcam, proving the necessity to correct LSTcam data on landscape scale, despite their relatively low measurement distances compared to remotely sensed data. Corrected LSTcam data revealed the dampening effect of the atmosphere, especially at high temperature differences between the atmosphere and the vegetated surface. Not correcting for these effects leads to erroneous LST estimates, in particular to an underestimation of the heterogeneity in LST, both in time and space. In the most pronounced case, we found a temperature range extension of almost 10 K.

TI  - GIS based landslide hazard evaluation and zonation - A case from Jeldu District, Central Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study landslide hazard evaluation and zonation (LHZ) was carried out in Jeldu District in Central Ethiopia, about 156 km West of Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Through field based inventory mapping and image interpretation 34 past landslides were mapped in the study area. The governing factors; aspect, slope and elevation, were determined from the digital elevation model (DEM), which was obtained from the ASTER satellite. Lithology was adopted from the geological map of Ethiopia (1:2,000,000), while the soil and land use/land cover were processed from Landsat + ETM satellite data. All governing factors were statistically analyzed to find the correlation with the past landslides. In this study, statistical - probabilistic approach was used to rate the governing factors and then customized raster calculation was made in GIS environment to develop the LHZ map.The results revealed that 12% (5.64 km(2)) of the study area falls under no hazard, 27% (12.69 km(2)) as low hazard, 32% (15.04 km(2)) as moderate hazard, 21% (9.87 km(2)) as high hazard and the rest 8% (3.76 km(2)) as very high hazard. The validation of LHZ map shows that, 92% of past landslides fall in high or very high hazard zones, while 6% fall in medium and only 2% in low landslide hazard zones. The validation of LHZ map thus, reasonably showed that the adopted methodology produced satisfactory results and the delineated hazard zones may practically be applied for the regional planning and development of infrastructures in the area.

TI  - Effect of terracing project on temporal-spatial variation of non-point source pollution load in Hujiashan watershed, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking Hujiashan small watershed as the study area, based on the classified result of Landsat TM/ETM images of 2005, 2010 and 2015, combined with long-term field observation data, and used the export coefficient model, our study explored the effect of small watershed management project on temporal and spatial variation of total nitrogen ( TN ) load of non-point source pollution under the support of GIS technology. The results indicated that, due to the implementation of slope modification project, the area of cultivated land was significantly increased, while forest and bare-land were decreased. The load of non-point source TN increased from 63208 kg in 2005 to 72778 kg in 2010, but reduced to 46876 kg in 2015. The contribution rate from residential areas was higher, the average contribution rate of the three periods was 53.5%, but it showed a decreasing trend year by year. The contribution rate of land use types was 45%, which showed an increasing trend year by year. The contribution rate of livestock was always low. From the spatial distribution, TN loading intensity was changed obviously after the terracing project. High load intensity zone was mainly concentrated on the slope of 5 degrees-15 degrees before terracing project. Nevertheless, high load intensity zone was concentrated on the slope of 15 degrees-35 degrees after terracing project, and 5 degrees-8 degrees had become a low load strength area. The TN load intensity changed little with time on the slope of 0 degrees-8 degrees, and it increased first and then decreased on the slope above 8 degrees. With the treatment of sewage, garbage and livestock manure in rural areas, the output of nitrogen in the living and livestock breeding were significantly reduced. Due to the implementation of the project, the cultivated land area increased by 31%.

TI  - Using satellite and reanalysis data to evaluate the representation of latent heating in extratropical cyclones in a climate model
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extratropical cyclones are a key feature of the weather in the extratropics, which climate models need to represent in order to provide reliable projections of future climate. Extratropical cyclones produce significant precipitation and the associated latent heat release can play a major role in their development. This study evaluates the ability of a climate model, HiGEM, to represent latent heating in extratropical cyclones. Remote sensing data is used to investigate the ability of both the climate model and ERA-Interim (ERAI) reanalysis to represent extratropical cyclone cloud features before latent heating itself is assessed. An offline radiance simulator, COSP, and the ISCCP and CloudSat datasets are used to evaluate comparable fields from HiGEM and ERAI. HiGEM is found to exhibit biases in the cloud structure of extratropical cyclones, with too much high cloud produced in the warm conveyor belt region compared to ISCCP. Significant latent heating occurs in this region, derived primarily from HiGEM's convection scheme. ERAI is also found to exhibit biases in cloud structure, with more clouds at lower altitudes than those observed in ISCCP in the warm conveyor belt region. As a result, latent heat release in ERAI is concentrated at lower altitudes. CloudSat indicates that much precipitation may be produced at too low an altitude in both HiGEM and ERAI, particularly ERAI, and neither capture observed variability in precipitation intensity. The potential vorticity structure in composite extratropical cyclones in HiGEM and ERAI is also compared. A more pronounced tropopause ridge evolves in HiGEM on the leading edge of the composite as compared to ERAI. One future area of research to be addressed is what impact these biases in the representation of latent heating have on climate projections produced by HiGEM. The biases found in ERAI indicate caution is required when using reanalyses to study cloud features and precipitation processes in extratropical cyclones or using reanalysis to evaluate climate models' ability to represent their structure.

TI  - Attribute Learning for SAR Image Classification
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a classification approach based on attribute learning for high spatial resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To explore the representative and discriminative attributes of SAR images, first, an iterative unsupervised algorithm is designed to cluster in the low-level feature space, where the maximum edge response and the ratio of mean-to-variance are included; a cross-validation step is applied to prevent overfitting. Second, the most discriminative clustering centers are sorted out to construct an attribute dictionary. By resorting to the attribute dictionary, a representation vector describing certain categories in the SAR image can be generated, which in turn is used to perform the classifying task. The experiments conducted on TerraSAR-X images indicate that those learned attributes have strong visual semantics, which are characterized by bright and dark spots, stripes, or their combinations. The classification method based on these learned attributes achieves better results.

M3  - Article
AB  - In consideration of the high accuracy and stability of GPS radio occultation (RO) data in the stratosphere, COSMIC data is used to validate the Microwave Temperature Sounder (MWTS) channel 4 (ch4) measurements on serial FY-3 satellite platforms. A 2-year comparison between the simulated and observed T-b for MWTS ch4 shows that both observed MWTS ch4 T-b on FY3A/3B are overestimated, especially in the tropic and summer of polar region. The trends of T-b bias are more consistent on both FY3A/3B satellites and in the two years. The variations of T-b bias for MWTS ch4 in different latitude-zones are quite different, for instance, the T-b bias is obviously positive about 2 similar to 4 K in the tropic, and is stably positive about 1 K in the mid-latitude, while the T-b bias is evidently varied with seasons from negative in winter to positive in summer in high latitude, particularly in south pole the difference of T-b bias among seasons is about 5 K, such strong dependence on environment temperature for T-b bias is not mainly caused by the sensor central frequency shifting. In the tropic the difference of the observed and simulated T-b is more significant, and the influence of the samples in the tropic on the global T-b bias is more than 20%, which implies that it should be cautious to use the validating results derived from COSMIC in the tropical.

TI  - Wide Variation and Excessive Dosage of Opioid Prescriptions for Common General Surgical Procedures
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To examine opioid prescribing patterns after general surgery procedures and to estimate an ideal number of pills to prescribe.Background: Diversion of prescription opioids is a major contributor to the rising mortality from opioid overdoses. Data to inform surgeons on the optimal dose of opioids to prescribe after common general surgical procedures is lacking.Methods: We evaluated 642 patients undergoing 5 outpatient procedures: partial mastectomy (PM), partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy (PM SLNB), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIH), and open inguinal hernia repair (IH). Postoperative opioid prescriptions and refill data were tabulated. A phone survey was conducted to determine the number of opioid pills taken.Results: There was a wide variation in the number of opioid pills prescribed to patients undergoing the same operation. The median number (and range) prescribed were: PM 20 (0-50), PM SLNB 20 (0-60), LC 30 (0-100), LIH 30 (15-70), and IH 30 (15-120). Only 28% of the prescribed pills were taken. This percentage varied by operation: PM 15%, PM SLNB 25%, LC 33%, LIH 15%, and IH 31%. Less than 2% of patients obtained refills. We identified the number of pills that would fully supply the opioid needs of 80% of patients undergoing each operation: PM 5, PM SLNB 10, LC 15, LIH 15, and IH 15. If this number were prescribed, the number of opioid initially prescribed would be 43% of the actual number prescribed.Conclusions: There is wide variability in opioid prescriptions for common general surgery procedures. In many cases excess pills are prescribed. Using our ideal number, surgeons can adequately treat postoperative pain and markedly decrease the number of opioids prescribed.

TI  - Monitoring drought vulnerability using multispectral indices observed from sequential remote sensing (Case Study: Tuy Phong, Binh Thuan, Vietnam)
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study applies multispectral band ratios to examine vegetation density and vegetation health to assess drought conditions over nearly 30 years (1989-2016) in Tuy Phong district, Binh Thuan province, Vietnam using a sequence of Landsat imagery (TM and OLI). Our research area has a distinctive climate, characterized by arid and semiarid areas adjacent to Binh Thuan's coastline. Drought is likely intensified by rain shadow effects of the Central Highlands (part of the Truong Son- or the Annamese Cordillera, positioned immediately west of the province). The seasonal Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated to derive three other indices: Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI). Results show that approximately two-thirds of Tuy Phong district was influenced by mid-to-severe drought. During the dry season (November to the following April), severity of drought has increased both intensively and extensively toward the North. Hypotheses testing of correlation between LST and NDVI also revealed a significantly negative relationship - increasing surface temperature and decreasing NDVI. To validate our results, we applied the same procedure for generating the VHI from MODIS data. Despite the absence of historical datasets for our region, Landsat data shows many advantages in monitoring drought in remote and small areas compared to MODIS. Our research strategies may be effective in other regions without sufficient climatic records for conventional climatic analysis.

TI  - Planning study for Merkel cell carcinoma based on the relapse pattern
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To develop a technique for radiation (RT) of in-transit path ways (IT) in Merkel cell carcinoma.Method: In the planning study, IT were ink-marked on the skin during sentinel lymphscintigraphy and wire-marked in planning-CT. Pre- and post-operative planning-CTS were acquired. The clinical target volume (CTV) included tumor bed plus safety margin, IT and draining nodes, the planning volume (PTV) the CTV plus 0.5-1 cm margin. VMAT plans with 2-3 arcs were analyzed.Results: A planning study was performed for five pts. including two pts. with primary tumor (PT) in head and neck, 1 pt. each with PT of elbow, forearm and upper leg respectively. Plans showed satisfactory PTV coverage: D-mean 100% +/- 0%, D-98% 92.4% +/- 2.24%, homogeneity index (HI) 0.095 +/- 0.01, conformation number (CN) 0.84 +/- 0.01 and conformality index (CI) 0.95 +/- 0.01.Conclusion: The planning study confirms feasibility of highly conformal irradiation of IT pathways based on individualized target delineation. Currently, patients referred for non-metastatic MCC are encouraged to enroll in a prospective clinical study that evaluates the feasibility of radiation of IT pathways. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Consequences of Dam Removal on Mussel Assemblages (Unionidae) in the Cuyahoga River
T2  - Ohio Journal of Science
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary objective of a new survey of the Cuyahoga River was to assess species richness and population abundance of various mussel species in the family Unionidae throughout the Middle Cuyahoga River and upper parts of the Lower Cuyahoga River. Historically, few records existed for this river between Lake Rockwell and the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, a region in which four dams have been removed in the past 12 years. Timed visual surveys were conducted during low flow conditions and by using tactile techniques in deeper water. Throughout the survey, only 37 live animals were located across the 18 Middle Cuyahoga River sites inspected, which included only Lampsilis siliquoidea, Pyganodon grandis and the state-endangered Ligumia nasuta. No live mussels were found between the Gorge and the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. That 434 shells and valves were collected, and all but two were classified as long dead, attests that mussels had been more abundant, and that at least nine of the ten species known to be present above Lake Rockwell had lived in the Middle Cuyahoga River. Remote sensing data and aerial photographs were used to characterize change in opening up the river, but benefits to water quality and stream flow subsequent to dam removal must be tempered with the apparent loss of an assemblage of mussels better adapted to lentic conditions.

TI  - A comparative assessment between linear and quadratic discriminant analyses (LDA-QDA) with frequency ratio and weights-of-evidence models for forest fire susceptibility mapping in China
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire is known as an important natural hazard in many countries which causes financial damages and human losses; thus, it is necessary to investigate different aspects of this phenomenon. In this study, performance of four models of linear and quadratic discriminant analysis (LDA and QDA), frequency ratio (FR), and weights-of-evidence (WofE) was investigated to model forest fire susceptibility in the Yihuang area, China. For this purpose, firstly, a forest fire locations map was prepared implementing MODIS satellite images and field surveys. Then, it was classified into two groups including training (70%) and validation (30%) by a random algorithm. In addition, 13 forest fire effective factors were prepared and used such as slope degree, slope aspect, altitude, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), plan curvature, land use, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), annual rainfall, distance from roads and rivers, wind effect, annual temperature, and soil texture. Using the training dataset and effective factors, LDA, QDA, FR, and WofE models were applied and forest fire susceptibility maps were prepared. Finally, area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) was implemented for investigating the performance of the models. The results depicted that WofE had the best performance (AUC=82.2%), followed by FR (AUC=80.9%), QDA(AUC=78.3%), and LDA(AUC=78%), respectively. The results of this study showed the high contribution of altitude, slope degree, and temperature. On the other hand, it was seen that slope aspect and soil had the lowest importance in forest fire susceptibility mapping. From the AUC results, it can be concluded that FR, WofE, LDA, and QDA had acceptable performance and could be used for forest fire susceptibility mapping at the regional scale.

TI  - Comparing and Combining Landsat Satellite Imagery and Participatory Data to Assess Land-Use and Land-Cover Changes in a Coastal Village in Papua New Guinea
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In regions lacking socio-economic data, pairing satellite imagery with participatory information is essential for accurate land-use/cover (LULC) change assessments. At the village scale in Papua New Guinea we compare swidden LULC classifications using remote sensing analyses alone and analyses that combine participatory information and remotely sensed data. These participatory remote sensing (PRS) methods include participatory land-use mapping, household surveys, and validation of image analysis in combination with remotely sensed data. The classifications of the swidden area made using only remote sensing analysis show swidden areas are, on average, two and a half times larger than land managers reported for 1999 and 2011. Classifications made using only remote sensing analysis are homogeneous and lack discrimination among swidden plots, fallow land, and non-swidden vegetation. The information derived from PRS methods allows us to amend the remote sensing analysis and as a result swidden areas are more similar to actual swidden area found when ground-truthing. We conclude that PRS methods are needed to understand swidden system LULC complexities.

TI  - Remote estimation of biomass of <i>Ulva prolifera</i> macroalgae in the Yellow Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2008, macroalgal blooms of Ulva prolifera (also called green tides) occurred every summer in the Yellow Sea (YS), causing environmental and economic problems. A number of studies have used satellite observations to estimate the severity of the blooms through estimating the bloom size and duration. However, a critical bloom parameter, namely biomass, has never been objectively determined due to lack of measurements. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to measure U. prolifera biomass (wet weight) per unit area and the corresponding spectral reflectance, through which a robust relationship has been established to link biomass per area to the reflectance-based floating algae index (FAI). The lab-based model has been validated with in situ measurements, with an estimated relative uncertainty of < 16% for algae with FAI values < 0.2 (corresponding to 2 Icg/m(2) biomass and accounting for > 99.5% of the algae-containing pixels in satellite images). The model was further transferred to MODIS Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc), where aerosol impacts on the model were simulated under various atmospheric conditions. The simulations showed an average of 6.5% (up to 12.3% for the extreme case) uncertainties in biomass estimates when MODIS R-rc data were used as the model inputs. The dry biomass per wet biomass and carbon and nitrogen contents per dry biomass were also determined through lab experiments, thus making their estimation possible from MODIS R-rc data. The model was then applied to time-series of MODIS observations over the YS between 2008 and 2015 to determine the inter-annual variability of these critical parameters. Results showed maximum daily biomass of > 1.7 million tons during June 2015 and minimum daily biomass of < 0.09 million tons during 2012. The ability to estimate U. prolifera biomass at given locations from the near real-time MODIS images is expected to significantly enhance the capacity of an existing monitoring system to provide quantitative information for decision making. 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Urban expansion and local land-cover change both significantly contribute to urban warming, but their relative importance changes over time
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context The urban heat island (UHI) affects both biogeochemical cycles and human society. Previous studies of UHI indicate urban expansion and local land-cover change can lead to higher temperatures in cities compared to the adjacent countryside. Few studies have examined the joint effects of city- and local-scale factors on urban warming, and their relative importance.Objectives We examined the overall impact of urbanization on urban warming from 1983 to 2011 in Beijing, investigated how city size and the proportion of local developed land jointly influenced the air temperature, and quantified their relative importance over time.Methods We compared temperature trends between urban and reference stations and conducted linear regressions to evaluate the city- and local-scale influences, based on meteorological data and remote sensing data.Results Urbanization significantly influenced trends of the air temperature, especially in summer. Trends of the mean temperature caused by urbanization was 0.3-0.4 A degrees C decade(-1) yearly and 0.4-0.6 A degrees C decade(-1) in summer. The increase of city size and the proportion of local developed land both contributed to urban warming, but their relative importance changed over time and varied seasonally. The local-scale factor played a vital role for the air temperature when the city size was relatively small, and were more important in summer when there was more greenspace at the local scale. However, the city-scale factor may cause stronger heat stress in summer, if there was less greenspace locally. When the city size was very large, the city-scale factor became the only significant factor affecting the air temperature.Conclusion When a city is relatively small, optimizing the composition or configuration of the local land cover could effectively alleviate UHI effects. However, when the city is already large, a more effective way is to control additional sprawl.

TI  - AntarcticaLC2000: The new Antarctic land cover database for the year 2000
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctica plays a key role in global energy balance and sea level change. It has been conventionally viewed as a whole ice body with high albedo in General Circulation Models or Regional Climate Models and the differences of land cover has usually been overlooked. Land cover in Antarctica is one of the most important drivers of changes in the Earth system. Detailed land cover information over the Antarctic region is necessary as spatial resolution improves in land process models. However, there is a lack of complete Antarctic land cover dataset derived from a consistent data source. To fill this data gap, we have produced a database named Antarctic Land Cover Database for the Year 2000 (AntarcticaLC2000) using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data acquired around 2000 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images acquired in the austral summer of 2003/2004 according to the criteria for the 1:100000-scale. Three land cover types were included in this map, separately, ice-free rocks, blue ice, and snow/firn. This classification legend was determined based on a review of the land cover systems in Antarctica (LCCSA) and an analysis of different land surface types and the potential of satellite data. Image classification was conducted through a combined usage of computer-aided and manual interpretation methods. A total of 4067 validation sample units were collected through visual interpretation in a stratified random sampling manner. An overall accuracy of 92.3% and the Kappa coefficient of 0.836 were achieved. Results show that the areas and percentages of ice-free rocks, blue ice, and snow/firn are 73268.81 km(2) (0.537%), 225937.26 km(2) (1.656%), and 13345460.41 km(2) (97.807%), respectively. The comparisons with other different data proved a higher accuracy of our product and a more advantageous data quality. These indicate that AntarcticaLC2000, the new land cover dataset for Antarctica entirely derived from satellite data, is a reliable product for a broad spectrum of applications.

TI  - Lung pericyte-like cells are functional interstitial immune sentinel cells
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LUNG CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pericytes are perivascular PDGF receptor-beta(+) (PDGFR beta(+)) stromal cells required for vasculogenesis and maintenance of microvascular homeostasis in many organs. Because of their unique juxtaposition to microvascular endothelium, lung PDGFR beta(+) cells are well situated to detect proinflammatory molecules released following epithelial injury and promote acute inflammatory responses. Thus we hypothesized that these cells represent an unrecognized immune surveillance or injury-sentinel interstitial cell. To evaluate this hypothesis, we isolated PDGFR beta(+) cells from murine lung and demonstrated that they have characteristics consistent with a pericyte population (referred to as pericyte-like cells for simplicity hereafter). We showed that pericyte-like cells expressed functional Toll-like receptors and upregulated chemokine expression following exposure to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) collected from mice with sterile lung injury. Interestingly, BALF from mice without lung injury also induced chemokine expression in pericyte-like cells, suggesting that pericyte-like cells are primed to sense epithelial injury (permeability changes). Following LPS-induced lung inflammation, increased numbers of pericyte-like cells expressed IL-6, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand-1, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2/monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and ICAM-1 in vivo. Sterile lung injury in pericyteablated mice was associated with decreased inflammation compared with normal mice. In summary, we found that pericyte-like cells are immune responsive and express diverse chemokines in response to lung injury in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, pericyte-like cell ablation attenuated inflammation in sterile lung injury, suggesting that these cells play an important functional role in mediating lung inflammatory responses. We propose a model in which pericyte-like cells function as interstitial immune sentinels, detecting proinflammatory molecules released following epithelial barrier damage and participating in recruitment of circulating leukocytes.

TI  - Regional-Scale Models for Predicting Overwinter Survival of Juvenile Ungulates
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Juvenile survival is highly variable in ungulate populations and often influences their dynamics. However, this vital rate is difficult to estimate with common wildlife management methods. Yet managers would benefit from being able to predict juvenile survival to reliably assess population dynamics for harvest management. In the case of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), previous studies reported that overwinter survival is the demographic parameter that influences population dynamics. We predicted winter survival of mule deer fawns under a range of habitat quality, weather, and predation regimes. We modeled overwinter survival of 2,529 fawns within 11 Population Management Units (PMU) in Idaho, 2003-2013. We used remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a measure of summer plant productivity and both Moderate Resolution Infrared Spectroscopy Snow Data (MODIS SNOW) and the modeled Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) as measures of winter snow conditions to capture spatiotemporal variation in winter survival. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate survival, including covariates at the appropriate spatial and temporal resolution for each level: individual, capture site, PMU, and ecotype scales. We evaluated the predictive capacity of models using internal validation and external (out-of-sample) validation procedures comparing non-parametric Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival estimates with estimates from Bayesian hierarchical models. Statewide survival of fawns from 16 December to 1 June ranged from 0.32 to 0.71 during 2003 to 2013, with relatively low survival in 2006, 2008, and 2011 in most Game Management Units. Survival for individualPMUs ranged from 0.09 in theWeiser-McCallPMUin 2011 to 0.95 in the same PMU in 2005. Internal validation revealed models predictedKMsurvival well, over a range of R-2 from 0.78 to 0.82, with the most complex model explaining the most variance as expected. However, because our goal was to predict winter survival of mule deer in the future, we evaluated our candidate models by withholding 2 years of data and then predicted those years with each model. The best-supported predictive model was our simplest model with 3 covariates, accounting for 71% of the variance in withheld years. Forage quality in late summerfall increased winter mule deer survival, whereas early and late winter snow cover decreased survival. At finerspatial scales within ecotypes, our internal validation was slightly better in aspen (0.86), similar in conifer (0.80), and poorer in shrub-steppe (0.60) ecotypes than our best statewide overall survival models, which accounted for 82% of the variance. Our analyses demonstrate the generality versus precision tradeoff across ecotypes and spatial scales to understand the extent that our survival models may be applied to different landscapes with varied predator communities, climate, and plant nutrition.

TI  - Mapping the Expansion of Boom Crops in Mainland Southeast Asia Using Dense Time Stacks of Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We performed a multi-date composite change detection technique using a dense-time stack of Landsat data to map land-use and land-cover change (LCLUC) in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) with a focus on the expansion of boom crops, primarily tree crops. The supervised classification was performed using Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are supervised non-parametric statistical learning techniques. To select the most suitable SMV classifier and the related parameter settings, we used the training data and performed a two-dimensional grid search with a three-fold internal cross-validation. We worked in seven Landsat footprints and found the linear kernel to be the most suitable for all footprints, but the most suitable regularization parameter C varied across the footprints. We distinguished a total of 41 LCLUCs (13 to 31 classes per footprint) in very dynamic and heterogeneous landscapes. The approach proved useful for distinguishing subtle changes over time and to map a variety of land covers, tree crops, and transformations as long as sufficient training points could be collected for each class. While to date, this approach has only been applied to mapping urban extent and expansion, this study shows that it is also useful for mapping change in rural settings, especially when images from phenologically relevant acquisition dates are included.

TI  - New data-driven estimation of terrestrial CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in Asia using a standardized database of eddy covariance measurements, remote sensing data, and support vector regression
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of a standardized database of eddy covariance observations has been an obstacle for data-driven estimation of terrestrial CO2 fluxes in Asia. In this study, we developed such a standardized database using 54 sites from various databases by applying consistent postprocessing for data-driven estimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). Data-driven estimation was conducted by using a machine learning algorithm: support vector regression (SVR), with remote sensing data for 2000 to 2015 period. Site-level evaluation of the estimated CO2 fluxes shows that although performance varies in different vegetation and climate classifications, GPP and NEE at 8days are reproduced (e.g., r(2)=0.73 and 0.42 for 8day GPP and NEE). Evaluation of spatially estimated GPP with Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 sensor-based Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence shows that monthly GPP variations at subcontinental scale were reproduced by SVR (r(2)=1.00, 0.94, 0.91, and 0.89 for Siberia, East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, respectively). Evaluation of spatially estimated NEE with net atmosphere-land CO2 fluxes of Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) Level 4A product shows that monthly variations of these data were consistent in Siberia and East Asia; meanwhile, inconsistency was found in South Asia and Southeast Asia. Furthermore, differences in the land CO2 fluxes from SVR-NEE and GOSAT Level 4A were partially explained by accounting for the differences in the definition of land CO2 fluxes. These data-driven estimates can provide a new opportunity to assess CO2 fluxes in Asia and evaluate and constrain terrestrial ecosystem models.

TI  - Dealing with the other between the ethical and the moral: albinism on the African continent
T2  - THEORETICAL MEDICINE AND BIOETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Albinism is a global public health issue but it assumes a peculiar nature in the African continent due, in part, to the social stigma faced by persons with albinism (PWAs) in Africa. I argue that there are two essential reasons for this precarious situation. First, in the African consciousness, albinism is an alterity or otherness. The PWA in Africa is not merely a physical other but also an ontological other in the African community of beings, which provides a hermeneutic for the stigmatising separateness or difference of the PWA. The second reason hinges on a distinction drawn by Jurgen Habermas between the ethical point of view and the moral point of view. While the former consists of the ethos, customs, or idea of the good shared by a group of persons with a shared tradition or way of life, the latter consists of what is good for all and transcends particular traditions or ways of life. Consequently, the African ethical point of view, the ethics of solidarity, justifies within the African worldview the established alterity and, by implication, stigmatization of PWAs. On this view, actions that promote harmony and prevent discord and disequilibrium among accepted beings in the African community are permissible. I further show that unless there is a change in the physical and ontological conception of PWAs and a leap from the ethical point of view to the moral point of view, the negative attitudes toward PWAs will not change. The leap to the moral point of view does not suggest an abandonment of the ethical point of view but only recommends that the two meet halfway in respect for universally accepted norms of human actions. To achieve this, I will show that much needs to be done in the areas of policy formulation, law, health care services, and education.

TI  - Correlation between infectious disease and soil radiation in Japan: an exploratory study using national sentinel surveillance data
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the relationship between epidemics and soil radiation through an exploratory study using sentinel surveillance data (individuals aged <20 years) during the last three epidemic seasons of influenza and norovirus in Japan. We used a spatial analysis method of a geographical information system (GIS). We mapped the epidemic spreading patterns from sentinel incidence rates. We calculated the average soil radiation [dm (mu Gy/h)] for each sentinel site using data on uranium, thorium, and potassium oxide in the soil and examined the incidence rate in units of 0.01 mu Gy/h. The correlations between the incidence rate and the average soil radiation were assessed. Epidemic clusters of influenza and norovirus infections were observed in areas with relatively high radiation exposure. A positive correlation was detected between the average incidence rate and radiation dose, at r = 0.61-0.84 (P <0.01) for influenza infections and r = 0.61-0.72 (P <0.01) for norovirus infections. An increase in the incidence rate was found between areas with radiation exposure of 0 <dm <0.01 and 0.154dm <0.16, at 1.80 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47-2.12] times higher for influenza infection and 2.07 (95% CI 1.53-2.61) times higher for norovirus infection. Our results suggest a potential association between decreased immunity and irradiation because of soil radiation. Further studies on immunity in these epidemic-prone areas are desirable.

TI  - SATELLITE THERMOGRAPHY FOR SOIL SALINITY ASSESSMENT OF CROPPED AREAS IN UZBEKISTAN
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A change of canopy temperature can indicate stress in vegetation. Use of canopy temperature to assess salt stress in specific plant species has been well studied in laboratory and greenhouse experiments, but its potential for use in landscape-level studies using remote sensing techniques has not yet been explored. Our study investigated the application of satellite thermography to assess soil salinity of cropped areas at the landscape level. The study region was Syrdarya Province, a salt-affected, irrigated semi-arid province of Uzbekistan planted mainly to cotton and wheat. We used moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellite images as an indicator for canopy temperature and the provincial soil salinity map as a ground truth dataset. Using analysis of variance, we examined relations among the soil salinity map and canopy temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, and digital elevation model. The results showed significant correlations between soil salinity and canopy temperature, but the strength of the relation varied over the year. The strongest relation was observed for cotton in September. The calculated F values were higher for canopy temperature than for the other indicators investigated. Our results suggest that satellite thermography is a valuable landscape-level approach for detecting soil salinity in areas under agricultural crops. (C) 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Analysis of Dual- and Full-Circular Polarimetric SAR Modes for Rice Phenology Monitoring: An Experimental Investigation through Ground-Based Measurements
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Circularly polarized synthetic aperture radar (CP-SAR) is known to be insensitive to polarization mismatch losses caused by the Faraday rotation effect and antenna misalignment. Additionally, the dual-circular polarimetric (DCP) mode has proven to have more polarimetric information than that of the corresponding mode of linear polarization, i.e., the dual-linear polarimetric (DLP) mode. Owing to these benefits, this paper investigates the feasibility of CP-SAR for rice monitoring. A ground-based CP-radar system was exploited, and C-band anechoic chamber data of a self-cultivated Japanese rice paddy were acquired from germination to ripening stages. Temporal variations of polarimetric observables derived from full-circular polarimetric (FCP) and DCP as well as synthetically generated DLP data are analyzed and assessed with regard to their effectiveness in phenology retrieval. Among different observations, the H/(alpha) over bar a plane and triangle plots obtained by three scattering components (surface, double-bounce, and volume scattering) for both the FCP and DCP modes are confirmed to have reasonable capability in discriminating the relevant intervals of rice growth.

TI  - A Knowledge-Based Search Strategy for Optimally Structuring the Terrain Dependent Rational Function Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the optimal structure of terrain dependent Rational Function Models (RFMs) not only decreases the number of Ground Control Points (GCPs) required, but also increases the accuracy of the model, by reducing the multi-collinearity of Rational Polynomials Coefficients (RPCs) and avoiding the ill-posed problem. Global optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), evaluate the different combinations of parameters effectively. Therefore, they have a high ability to detect the optimal structure of RFMs. However, one drawback of these algorithms is their high computation cost. This article proposes a knowledge-based search strategy to overcome this deficiency. The backbone of the proposed method relies on the technical knowledge about the geometric condition of image at the time of acquisition, as well as the effect of external factors such as terrain relief on the image. This method was evaluated on four different datasets, including a SPOT-1A, a SPOT-1B, an IKONOS-Geo image, and a GeoEye-Geo imagery, using various number of GCPs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method to achieve a sub-pixel accuracy using few GCPs (only 4-6 points) in all datasets. The results also indicate that the proposed method improves the computation speed by 140 times when comparing with GA.

TI  - Modelling Seasonal GWR of Daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> with Proper Auxiliary Variables for the Yangtze River Delta
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decades, regional haze episodes have frequently occurred in eastern China, especially in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Satellite derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) has been used to retrieve the spatial coverage of PM2.5 concentrations. To improve the retrieval accuracy of the daily AOD-PM2.5 model, various auxiliary variables like meteorological or geographical factors have been adopted into the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model. However, these variables are always arbitrarily selected without deep consideration of their potentially varying temporal or spatial contributions in the model performance. In this manuscript, we put forward an automatic procedure to select proper auxiliary variables from meteorological and geographical factors and obtain their optimal combinations to construct four seasonal GWR models. We employ two different schemes to comprehensively test the performance of our proposed GWR models: (1) comparison with other regular GWR models by varying the number of auxiliary variables; and (2) comparison with observed ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. The result shows that our GWR models of "AOD + 3" with three common meteorological variables generally perform better than all the other GWR models involved. Our models also show powerful prediction capabilities in PM2.5 concentrations with only slight overfitting. The determination coefficients R-2 of our seasonal models are 0.8259 in spring, 0.7818 in summer, 0.8407 in autumn, and 0.7689 in winter. Also, the seasonal models in summer and autumn behave better than those in spring and winter. The comparison between seasonal and yearly models further validates the specific seasonal pattern of auxiliary variables of the GWR model in the YRD. We also stress the importance of key variables and propose a selection process in the AOD-PM2.5 model. Our work validates the significance of proper auxiliary variables in modelling the AOD-PM2.5 relationships and provides a good alternative in retrieving daily PM2.5 concentrations from remote sensing images in the YRD.

TI  - The potential of more accurate InSAR covariance matrix estimation for land cover mapping
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Interferometric SAR (InSAR) provide both structural and electromagnetic information for the ground surface and therefore have been widely used for land cover classification. However, relatively few studies have developed analyses that investigate SAR datasets over richly textured areas where heterogeneous land covers exist and intermingle over short distances. One of main difficulties is that the shapes of the structures in a SAR image cannot be represented in detail as mixed pixels are likely to occur when conventional InSAR parameter estimation methods are used. To solve this problem and further extend previous research into remote monitoring of urban environments, we address the use of accurate InSAR covariance matrix estimation to improve the accuracy of land cover mapping. The standard and updated methods were tested using the HH-polarization TerraSAR-X dataset and compared with each other using the random forest classifier. A detailed accuracy assessment complied for six types of surfaces shows that the updated method outperforms the standard approach by around 9%, with an overall accuracy of 82.46% over areas with rich texture in Zhuhai, China. This paper demonstrates that the accuracy of land cover mapping can benefit from the 3 enhancement of the quality of the observations in addition to classifiers selection and multi-source data ingratiation reported in previous studies.

TI  - Winter wheat yield estimation based on multi-source medium resolution optical and radar imaging data and the AquaCrop model using the particle swarm optimization algorithm
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate estimation of winter wheat yield at a regional scale is crucial for national food policy and security assessments. Near-infrared reflectance is not sensitive to the leaf area index (LAI) and biomass of winter wheat at medium to high canopy cover (CC), and most of the vegetation indices displayed saturation phenomenon. However, LAI and biomass at medium to high CC can be efficiently estimated using imaging data from radar with stronger penetration, such as RADARSAT-2. This study had the following three objectives: (i) to combine vegetation indices based on our previous studies for estimating CC and biomass for winter wheat using HJ-1A/B and RADARSAT-2 imaging data; (ii) to combine HJ-1A/B and RADARSAT-2 imaging data with the AquaCrop model using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to estimate winter wheat yield; and (iii) to compare the results from the assimilation of HJ-1A/B + RADARSAT-2 imaging data, HJ-1A/13 imaging data, and RADARSAT-2 imaging data into the AquaCrop model using the PSO algorithm. Remote sensing data and concurrent LAI, biomass, and yield of sample fields were acquired in Yangling District, Shaanxi, China, during the 2014 winter wheat growing season. The PSO optimization algorithm was used to integrate the AquaCrop model and remote sensing data for yield estimation. The modified triangular vegetation index 2 (MTVI2) x radar vegetation index (RVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) x RVI had good relationships with CC and biomass, respectively. The results indicated that the predicted and measured yield (R-2 = 0.31 and RMSE = 0.94 ton/ha) had agreement when the estimated CC from the HJ-1A/B and RADARSAT-2 data was used as the dynamic input variable for the AquaCrop model. When the estimated biomass from the HJ-1A/B and RADARSAT-2 data was used as the dynamic input variable for the AquaCrop model, the predicted yield showed agreement with the measured yield (R-2 = 0.42 and RMSE = 0.81 ton/ha). These results show that using the biomass as the dynamic input variable provides a better yield estimation than using the CC as the dynamic variable. The predicted biomass and yield were more accurately estimated by combining the HJ-1A/B and RADARSAT-2 data with the AquaCrop model than by combining the only HJ-1A/B or RADARSAT-2 data with the AquaCrop model using the PSO algorithm. The results indicated that the PSO-based assimilation method could be used to estimate the winter wheat yield from the spot to the regional scale.

TI  - Measurement of precise three-dimensional volcanic deformations via TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture radar interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple-aperture SAR interferometry (MAI) is an advanced technique that is used to retrieve actual surface motions by complementing missing components of InSAR measurements. Despite the wide use of the MAI method in the geosciences, X-band SAR has rarely been applied in MAI-based studies due to the relatively shorter decorrelation periods involved. Thus, we need to evaluate the MAI measurements from X-band SAR for the use in the geosciences. In this paper, an assessment of the MAI performance for TerraSAR-X system was carried out at the test site, Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, focusing on the Kamoamoa fissure eruption episode that occurred on March 6-10, 2011. The root-mean-square (RMS) errors of single MAI interferograms were 3.26 +/- 1.32 cm and 2.95 +/- 0.77 cm for descending and ascending datasets, respectively. Multi-stacked MAI interferograms showed reduced error levels of 1.77 and 2.04 cm for descending and ascending datasets, respectively. In addition, empirical uncertainty models of the MAI measurements were generated with respect to the interferometric coherence of single-and multi-stacked MAI measurements, and these regression models enabled us to confirm the difference between the theoretical and practical accuracies of the MAI measurements. Moreover, the MAI-based 3D model based on high accuracy 3D maps showed some possibilities of new findings and interpretations of the geologic sources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assimilating synthetic hyperspectral sounder temperature and humidity retrievals to improve severe weather forecasts
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assimilation of hyperspectral sounder data into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models has provenvital to generating accurate model analyses of tropospheric temperature and humidity where few conventional observations exist. Applications to storm-scale models are limited since the low temporal resolution provided by polar orbiting sensors cannot adequately sample rapidly changing environments associated with high impact weather events. To address this limitation, hyperspectral sounders have been proposed for geostationary orbiting satellites, but these have yet to be built and launched in part due to much higher engineering costs and a lack of a definite requirement for the data.This study uses an Observation System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) approach to simulate temperature and humidity profiles from a hypothetical geostationary-based sounder from a nature run of a high impact weather event on 20 May 2013. The simulated observations are then assimilated using an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter approach, testing both hourly and 15 minute cycling to determine their relative effectiveness at improving the near storm environment Results indicate that assimilating both temperature and humidity profiles reduced mid-tropospheric both mean and standard deviation of analysis and forecast errors compared to assimilating conventional observations alone. The 15 minute cycling generally produced the lowest errors while also generating the best 2-4 hour updraft helicity forecasts of ongoing convection. This study indicates the potential for significant improvement in short-term forecasting of severe storms from the assimilation of hyperspectral geostationary satellite data. However, more studies are required using improved OSSE designs encompassing multiple storm environments and additional observation types such as radar reflectivity to fully define the effectiveness of assimilating geostationary hyperspectral observations for high impact weather forecasting applications.

TI  - Locating Potential Zones for Cultivating <i>Stevia rebaudiana</i> in Mexico: Weighted Linear Combination Approach
T2  - SUGAR TECH
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to search for alternative sweeteners for human beings, researchers are recently focusing their attention to find natural sweeteners that have low caloric values and are highly beneficial for the health. Stevia rebaudiana is one of the alternative crops as it produces steviol glycosides with high intense sweeteners. This study introduces a novel application of weighted linear combination approach at pixel level for locating potential zones for cultivating the S. rebaudiana in the Huasteca Potosina region of Mexico. Climatic, topography, soil conditions as well as the proximity to roads for transporting the product were considered the essential requirements for this crop, while soil type and the available land obtained from a classification of Landsat imagery (2014) and Boolean land-use constraints were investigated as spatial constraints. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the stability of outcomes under two approaches: equal weights for the factors and different weights obtained from experts. The results revealed that the area with very high land suitability determined by the expert judgment approach is decreasing which in turns impose restrictions on the cropping of S. rebaudiana. Therefore, this research allowed determining land suitability at pixel level for cultivating S. rebaudiana in the Huasteca Potosina region at the spatial resolution of 30 m.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synoptic monitoring of estuaries, some of the most bio-diverse and productive environments on Earth, is essential to study small-scale water dynamics and its role on spatiotemporal variation in water quality important to indigenous marine species and surrounding human settlements. We present a detailed study of turbidity, an optical index of water quality, in Apalachicola Bay, Florida (USA) using historical in situ measurements and Landsat 5 TM data archive acquired from 2004 to 2011. Data mining techniques such as time-series decomposition, principal component analysis, and classification tree-based models were utilized to decipher time-series for examining variations in physical forcings, and their effects on diurnal and seasonal variability in turbidity in Apalachicola Bay. Statistical analysis showed that the bay is highly dynamic in nature, both diurnally and seasonally, and its water quality (e.g., turbidity) is largely driven by interactions of different physical forcings such as river discharge, wind speed, tides, and precipitation. River discharge and wind speed are the most influential forcings on the eastern side of river mouth, whereas all physical forcings were relatively important to the western side close to the major inlet, the West Pass. A bootstrap-optimized and atmospheric-corrected single-band empirical relationship (Turbidity (NTU) = 6568.23 x (Reflectance (Band 3))(1.95); R-2 = 0.77 +/- 0.06, range = 0.50-0.91, N = 50) is proposed with seasonal thresholds for its application in various seasons. The validation of this relationship yielded R-2 = 0.70 +/- 0.15 (range = 0.96-0.97; N = 38; RMSE = 7.78 +/- 2.59 NTU; Bias (%) = 8.70 +/- 11.48). Complex interactions of physical forcings and their effects on water dynamics have been discussed in detail using Landsat 5 TM-based turbidity maps during major events between 2004 and 2011. Promising results of the single-band turbidity algorithm with Landsat 8 OLI imagery suggest its potential for long-term monitoring of water turbidity in a shallow water estuary such as Apalachicola Bay.

TI  - Squamous cell carcinoma complicating a chronic lesion of hidradenitis suppurativa: a case report and review of the literature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL WOUND JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) arising from chronic hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is rare; however, the morbidity associated with this presentation is high and management has not been standardised or optimised. We present a case of HS of the perineum and buttocks complicated by SCC, requiring multiple extensive surgical resections. Adjuvant radiotherapy was withheld initially because of concern for poor healing of the surgical wound but was eventually initiated after a second recurrence was identified. The patient ultimately expired 4 years after the initial diagnosis of SCC. We also review 80 cases of SCC complicating HS found in the English literature. Case reports and mechanistic studies suggest the possibility that human papilloma virus and smoking may be risk factors associated with SCC in HS. Despite the majority of SCC cases being well-differentiated tumours in HS, the highly aggressive nature of SCC in HS and its high likelihood for rapid progression, recurrence, metastasis and highmortality suggests the need to advocate for aggressive treatment. We recommend an aggressive approach to management at the time of SCC diagnosis in HS, which includes appropriate imaging to establish the extent of the tumour, large and deep surgical excision, sentinel lymph node evaluation, consultation with radiation oncology for potential adjuvant radiation therapy and close surveillance.

TI  - Bayesian principal component regression model with spatial effects for forest inventory variables under small field sample size
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing observations are extensively used for analysis of environmental variables. These variables often exhibit spatial correlation, which has to be accounted for in the calibration models used in predictions, either by direct modelling of the dependencies or by allowing for spatially correlated stochastic effects. Another feature in many remote sensing instruments is that the derived predictor variables are highly correlated, which can lead to unnecessary model over-training and at worst, singularities in the estimates. Both of these affect the prediction accuracy, especially when the training set for model calibration is small. To overcome these modelling challenges, we present a general model calibration procedure for remotely sensed data and apply it to airborne laser scanning data for forest inventory. We use a linear regression model that accounts for multicollinearity in the predictors by principal components and Bayesian regularization. It has a spatial random effect component for the spatial correlations that are not explained by a simple linear model. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme is used to account for the uncertainty in all the model parameters. We tested the proposed model against several alternatives and it outperformed the other linear calibration models, especially when there were spatial effects, multicollinearity and the training set size was small.

TI  - Crop Evapotranspiration Estimation for Wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) Using Remote Sensing Data in Semi-Arid Region of Maharashtra
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Penman-Monteith method adapted to satellite data was used for the estimation of wheat crop evapotranspiration during the entire growth period using satellite data together with ground meteorological measurements. The IRS-1D/IRS-P6 LISS-III sensor data at 23.5 m spatial resolution for path 096 and row 059 covering the study area were used to derive, albedo, normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area index and crop height and then to estimate wheat crop evapotranspiration referred to as actual evapotranspiration (ETact). The ETact varied from 0.86 to 3.41 mm/day during the crop growth period. These values are on an average 16.40 % lower than wheat crop potential evapotranspiration (ETc) estimated as product of reference crop evapotranspiration estimated by Penman-Monteith method and lysimetric crop coefficient (Kc). The deviation of ETact from ETc is significant, when both the values were compared with t test for paired two sample means. Though the observations on ETact were taken from well maintained unstressed experimental plot of 120 x 120 m size, there was significant deviation. This deviation could be attributed to, the satellite images representing the actual crop evapotranspiration as function crop canopy biophysical parameters, condition of the crop stand, climatic and soil conditions and the microclimate variation over area of one hectare. However, Penman-Monteith method represents a flat rate of specific growth stage of the crop.

TI  - Thin Melanoma with Nodal Involvement: Analysis of Demographic, Pathologic, and Treatment Factors with Regard to Prognosis
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Although only a small proportion of thin melanomas result in lymph node metastasis, the abundance of these lesions results in a relatively large absolute number of patients with a diagnosis of nodal metastases, determined by either sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy or clinical nodal recurrence (CNR).Methods. Independent cohorts with thin melanoma and either SLN metastasis or CNR were identified at two melanoma referral centers. At both centers, SLN metastasis patients were included. At center 1, the CNR cohort included patients with initial negative clinical nodal evaluation followed by CNR. At center 2, the CNR cohort was restricted to those presenting in the era before the use of SLN biopsy. Uni- and multivariable analyses of melanoma-specific survival (MSS) were performed.Results. At center 1, 427 CNR patients were compared with 91 SLN+ patients. The 5- and 10-year survival rates in the SLN group were respectively 88 and 84 % compared with 72 and 49 % in the CNR group (p < 0.0001). The multivariate analysis showed age older than 50 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1.5; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.2-1.9), present ulceration (HR 1.9; 95 % CI 1.2-2.9), unknown ulceration (HR 1.6; 95 % CI 1.3-2.1), truncal site (HR 1.6; 95 % CI 1.2-2.2), and CNR (HR 3.3; 95 % CI 1.8-6.0) to be associated significantly with decreased MSS (p < 0.01 for each). The center 2 cohort demonstrated remarkably similar findings, with a 5-year MSS of 88 % in the SLN (n = 29) group and 76 % in the CNR group (n = 39, p = 0.09).Conclusions. Patients with nodal metastases from thin melanomas have a substantial risk of melanoma death. This risk is lower among patients whose disease is discovered by SLN biopsy rather than CNR.

TI  - Building Damage Assessment Using Multisensor Dual-Polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar Data for the 2016 M 6.2 Amatrice Earthquake, Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 24 August 2016, the M 6.2 Amatrice earthquake struck central Italy, well-known as a seismically active region, causing considerable damage to buildings in the town of Amatrice and the surrounding area. Damage from this earthquake was assessed quantitatively by means of multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) coherence and SAR intensity methods using dual-polarized SAR data obtained from the Sentinel-1 (VV, VH) and ALOS-2 (HH, HV) satellites. We developed linear discriminant functions based on three items: (1) the differential coherence values; (2) the differential backscattering intensity values of pre- and post-event images; and (3) a binary damage map of the optical pre- and post-event imagery. The accuracy of the proposed model was 84% for the Sentinel-1 data and 76% for the ALOS-2 data. The damage proxy maps deduced from the linear discriminant functions can be useful in the parcel-by-parcel assessment of building damage and development of spatial models for the allocation of urban search and rescue operations.

TI  - Spatiotemporal downscaling approaches for monitoring 8-day 30 m actual evapotranspiration
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of actual evapotranspiration (ET) is critical for water resources management at both regional and local scales. Although the MODIS ET product (MOD16A2) provides viable sources for ET monitoring at 8-day intervals, the spatial resolution (1 km) is too coarse for local scale applications. In this study, we propose a machine learning and spatial temporal fusion (STF)-integrated approach in order to generate 8-day 30 m ET based on both MOD16A2 and Landsat 8 data with three schemes. Random forest machine learning was used to downscale MODIS 1 km ET to 30 m resolution based on nine Landsat-derived indicators including vegetation indices (VIs) and land surface temperature (LST). STF-based models including Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model and Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion Model were used to derive synthetic Landsat surface reflectance (scheme 1)/VIs (scheme 2)/ET (scheme 3) on Landsat-unavailable dates. The approach was tested over two study sites in the United States. The results showed that fusion of Landsat VIs produced the best accuracy of predicted ET (R-2 = 0.52-0.97, RMSE = 0.47-3.0 mm/8 days and rRMSE = 6.4-37%). High density of cloud-clear Landsat image acquisitions and low spatial heterogeneity of Landsat VIs benefit the ET prediction. The downscaled 30 m ET had good agreement with MODIS ET (RMSE = 0.42-3.4 mm/8 days, rRMSE = 3.226%). Comparison with the in situ ET measurements showed that the downscaled ET had higher accuracy than MODIS ET. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

TI  - Efficient use of sentinel sites: detection of invasive honeybee pests and diseases in the UK
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel sites, where problems can be identified early or investigated in detail, form an important part of planning for exotic disease outbreaks in humans, livestock and plants. Key questions are: how many sentinels are required, where should they be positioned and how effective are they at rapidly identifying new invasions? The sentinel apiary system for invasive honeybee pests and diseases illustrates the costs and benefits of such approaches. Here, we address these issues with two mathematical modelling approaches. The first approach is generic and uses probabilistic arguments to calculate the average number of affected sites when an outbreak is first detected, providing rapid and general insights that we have applied to a range of infectious diseases. The second approach uses a computationally intensive, stochastic, spatial model to simulate multiple outbreaks and to determine appropriate sentinel locations for UK apiaries. Both models quantify the anticipated increase in success of sentinel sites as their number increases and as non-sentinel sites become worse at detection; however, unexpectedly sentinels perform relatively better for faster growing outbreaks. Additionally, the spatial model allows us to quantify the substantial role that carefully positioned sentinels can play in the rapid detection of exotic invasions.

TI  - Riparian forest structure and stream geomorphic condition: implications for flood resilience
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Managing riparian corridors for flood resilience requires understanding of linkages between vegetation condition and stream geomorphology. Stream assessment approaches increasingly use channel morphology as an indicator of stream condition, with only cursory examination of riparian vegetation. Our research (i) examines relationships between stream geomorphic condition, as assessed by Rapid Geomorphic Assessment (RGA) scores, and riparian forest structure, and (ii) investigates scale dependencies in the linkages between land cover and stream geomorphology. Wesampled vegetation structure and composition and assessed geomorphic condition at 32 stream reaches within the Lake Champlain Basin, USA. RGA scores were modeled as a function of structural attributes using classification and regression trees. Landsat coverages were used to delineate land uses within five nested spatial scales. Generalized linear models (GLM) evaluated relationships between land cover and RGA scores. Standard deviation of basal area partitioned the greatest variability in RGA scores, but dead tree density and basal area (positively) and shrub density (negatively) were also significant predictors. RGA was related to forest and agricultural cover at the two finest scales. Riparian forest structure is highly dynamic in relation to stand development and disturbance history; simple forest cover information does not capture these differences or their influences on stream geomorphic condition.

TI  - Aqua MODIS Band 24 Crosstalk Striping
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite, unlike its predecessor Terra MODIS, had always been thought to have been spared from significant deleterious impacts of electronic crosstalk on its imagery. However, recent efforts brought to our attention the presence of striping artifacts in Aqua MODIS images from band 24 (4.47 mu m), which upon further inspection proved to have a noticeable impact on the quality of the L1B product and to have been present since the beginning of the mission, in 2002. Using images of the moon from scheduled lunar observations, we linked the artifacts with electronic crosstalk contamination of the response of detector 1 of band 24 by signal sent from the detector 10 of band 26 (1.375 mu m), a neighboring band in the same focal plane assembly. In this letter, we report on these findings, the artifact mitigation strategy adopted by us, and on our success in restoring band 24 detector 1 behavior and image quality.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILD AND FAMILY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this meta-analysis is to explore relations between children's perceptions of parental hostility/aggression, and their psychological maladjustment, and negative personality dispositions as postulated in interpersonal acceptance and rejection theory. The meta-analysis was based on 35 studies from 16 countries in four continents involving 13,406 children (52% boys and 48% girls). All studies included in the meta-analysis, used child versions of the Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire for Mothers and for Fathers (Child PARQ: Mothers and Fathers), as well as the child version of the Personality Assessment Questionnaire (Child PAQ). Results showed that both maternal and paternal hostility/aggression correlated significantly with the psychological maladjustment and with all seven negative personality dispositions, including (1) hostility/aggression, (2) dependence or defensive independence, (3) negative self-esteem, (4) negative self-adequacy, (5) emotional instability, (6) emotional unresponsiveness, and (7) negative worldview of children across ethnicities, cultures, and geographical boundaries. Results further revealed that perceived maternal than paternal hostility/aggression has significantly stronger relations with children's psychological maladjustment globally.

TI  - Surface Soil Moisture Retrieval Using the L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar Onboard the Soil Moisture Active-Passive Satellite and Evaluation at Core Validation Sites
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the retrieval of soil moisture in the top 5-cm layer at 3-km spatial resolution using L-band dual-copolarized Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data that mapped the globe every three days from mid-April to early July, 2015. Surface soil moisture retrievals using radar observations have been challenging in the past due to complicating factors of surface roughness and vegetation scattering. Here, physically based forward models of radar scattering for individual vegetation types are inverted using a time-series approach to retrieve soil moisture while correcting for the effects of static roughness and dynamic vegetation. Compared with the past studies in homogeneous field scales, this paper performs a stringent test with the satellite data in the presence of terrain slope, subpixel heterogeneity, and vegetation growth. The retrieval process also addresses any deficiencies in the forward model by removing any time-averaged bias between model and observations and by adjusting the strength of vegetation contributions. The retrievals are assessed at 14 core validation sites representing a wide range of global soil and vegetation conditions over grass, pasture, shrub, woody savanna, corn, wheat, and soybean fields. The predictions of the forward models used agree with SMAP measurements to within 0.5 dB unbiased-root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) and -0.05 dB (bias) for both copolarizations. Soil moisture retrievals have an accuracy of 0.052 m(3)/m(3) ubRMSE, -0.015 m(3)/m(3) bias, and a correlation of 0.50, compared to in situ measurements, thus meeting the accuracy target of 0.06 m(3)/m(3) ubRMSE. The successful retrieval demonstrates the feasibility of a physically based time series retrieval with L-band SAR data for characterizing soil moisture over diverse conditions of soil moisture, surface roughness, and vegetation.

TI  - Diagnostic Performance of Fused Diffusion-Weighted Imaging Using T1-Weighted Imaging for Axillary Nodal Staging in Patients With Early Breast Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate the diagnostic performance of fused diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for axillary nodal staging in patients with early breast cancer. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of both readers for axillary nodal staging were 0.676 and 0.603 for non-fat-suppressed (non-FS) T1WI, 0.749 and 0.727 for T2WI, and 0.838 and 0.790 for fused DWI. Fused DWI showed better diagnostic performance than conventional T2WI and non-FS T1WI.Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of fused diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) using T1-weighted imaging (T1W1) for axillary nodal staging in patients with early breast cancer (stage I or II). Materials and Methods: We enrolled 149 axillae in 147 consecutive patients who performed preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and definitive surgery. All patients underwent T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), fused DWI using T1WI, and non fat-suppressed (non-FS) T1WI. Two radiologists scored each axillary nodal status by using a 5-point scale and independently measured the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the most suspicious lymph node and an index tumor. Diagnostic performance was calculated on a patient-by-patient basis. Results: Macrometastasis was present in 26.2%, micro metastasis in 7.4%, and benign lymph nodes in 66.4%. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of both readers for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis were 0.676 and 0.603 for non-FS T1WI, 0.749 and 0.727 for T2WI, 0.838 and 0.790 for fused DWI, and 0.868 and 0.837 for the combined reading using ADC. AUCs of tumor ADC were 0.709 and 0.737, whereas those of lymph node ADC were 0.818 and 0.781 for both readers. With stepwise addition of tumor ADC, lymph node ADC, and lymphovascular invasion status to the fused DWI, the AUCs gradually increased from 0.838, 0.892, and 0.908 to 0.924 for reader 1 and from 0.790, 0.863, and 0.901 to 0.908 for reader 2. Conclusion: Fused DWI using T1WI showed better diagnostic performance than conventional T2WI and non-FS T1WI for the prediction of lymph node metastasis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Paddy Field Mapping Using Topographic and Scattering Features of PolSAR Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigated rice fields in Asia have a distinct topography and scattering mechanisms. Because of these factors, many studies using radar backscattering information have been conducted to improve the mapping accuracy; however, relatively little attention has been paid to the topographic features (TF) provided by polarimetric synthetic aperture Radar (PolSAR) data. To address this issue, this letter presents a simple rice field mapping method in its late-vegetative stage using both the TF and scattering features (SF) of the PolSAR data. First, two TF, the polarization orientation angle and the dominant beta angle from the PolSAR data, were analyzed with respect to the slope from a digital elevation model. The results indicated that this feature pair had a moderately high correlation. As a result, flat areas were easily extracted using these two TF. Second, to use the SF of rice in the late-vegetative stage, the copolarized ratio and the copolarized phase difference were simply combined to map only paddy fields, of which scattering was dominated by the double-bounce scattering caused by the ground and canopy reflection. The results using C-band Radarsat-2 data were compared with a support vector machine classifier and demonstrated that the proposed mapping method provided an overall better performance. The proposed method might also be efficiently applied, with modification, for the aforementioned purpose in inaccessible areas.

TI  - Landsat Identification of Tornado Damage by Land Cover and an Evaluation of Damage Recovery in Forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral satellite imagery provides a spaceborne perspective on tornado damage identification; however, few studies have explored how tornadoes alter the spectral signature of different land-cover types. In part 1 of this study, Landsat surface reflectance is used to explore how 17 tornadoes modify the spectral signature, NDVI, and "Tassled Cap'' parameters inside forest (N = 16), grassland (N = 10), and urban (N 5 17) land cover. Land cover influences the magnitude of change observed, particularly in spring/summer imagery, with most tornado-damaged surfaces exhibiting a higher median reflectance in the visible and shortwave infrared, and a lower median reflectance in the near-infrared spectral ranges. These changes result in a higher median Tasseled Cap brightness, lower Tasseled Cap greenness and wetness, and lower NDVI relative to unaffected areas. Other factors affecting the magnitude of change in reflectance include season, vegetation condition, land-cover heterogeneity, and tornado strength. While vegetation indices like NDVI provide a quick way to identify damage, they have limited utility when monitoring recovery because of the cyclical seasonal vegetation cycle. Since tornado damage provides an analogous spectral signal to that of forest clearing, NDVI is compared with a forest disturbance index (DI) across a 5-yr Landsat climatology surrounding the 27 April 2011 tornado outbreak in part 2 of this study. Preoutbreak DI values remain relatively stable across seasons. In the five tornado-damaged areas evaluated, DI values peak within 6 months followed by a decline coincident with ongoing recovery. DI-like metrics provide a seasonally independent mechanism to fill the gap in identifying damage and monitoring recovery.

TI  - Toward Generic Models for Green LAI Estimation in Maize and Soybean: Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Informative spectral bands for green leaf area index (LAI) estimation in two crops were identified and generic models for soybean and maize were developed and validated using spectral data taken at close range. The objective of this paper was to test developed models using Aqua and Terra MODIS, Landsat TM and ETM+, ENVISAT MERIS surface reflectance products, and simulated data of the recently-launched Sentinel 2 MSI and Sentinel 3 OLCI. Special emphasis was placed on testing generic models which require no re-parameterization for these species. Four techniques were investigated: support vector machines (SVM), neural network (NN), multiple linear regression (MLR), and vegetation indices (VI). For each technique two types of models were tested based on (a) reflectance data, taken at close range and resampled to simulate spectral bands of satellite sensors; and (b) surface reflectance satellite products. Both types of models were validated using MODIS, TM/ETM+, and MERIS data. MERIS was used as a prototype of OLCI Sentinel-3 data which allowed for assessment of the anticipated accuracy of OLCI. All models tested provided a robust and consistent selection of spectral bands related to green LAI in crops representing a wide range of biochemical and structural traits. The MERIS observations had the lowest errors (around 11%) compared to the remaining satellites with observational data. Sentinel 2 MSI and OLCI Sentinel 3 estimates, based on simulated data, had errors below 8%. However the accuracy of these models with actual MSI and OLCI surface reflectance products remains to be determined.

TI  - Hybrid Surgical Guidance: Does Hardware Integration of γ- and Fluorescence Imaging Modalities Make Sense?
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The clinically applied hybrid tracer indocyanine green-Tc-99m-nanocolloid enables combined radio-and fluorescence image guidance during sentinel node (SN) biopsy procedures. To provide optimal surgical guidance, this tracer requires the presence of both gamma- and fluorescence modalities in the operating room. We reasoned that the combination or integration of these modalities could further evolve the hybrid surgical guidance concept. To study this potential, we clinically applied 2 setups that included the combination of gamma-detection modalities and an open surgery fluorescence camera. Methods: To attach the fluorescence camera (VITOM) to either a gamma-ray detection probe (GP; VITOM-GP) or a portable gamma-camera (GC; Vitom GC), clip on brackets were designed and printed in 3-dimensional sterilizable RC31. Both combined modalities were evaluated in, respectively, 5 and 6 patients with penile cancer during an SN biopsy procedure using indocyanine green-Tc-99m-nanocolloid. Intraoperatively, radio and fluorescence-guided SN detection rates were scored at working distances of 0, 10, 20, and 30 cm for both combinations. Results: Using the VITOM-GP combination, we evaluated 9 SNs. gamma-tracing rates were shown to be 100%, 88.9%, 55.6%, and 55.6% at a respective working distance of 0, 10, 20, and 30 cm. Detection rates for the fluorescence imaging-based detection were found to be 100%, 77.8%, and 77.8%, at respective working distances of 10, 20, and 30 cm. When the VITOM-GC setup was used, all 10 intraoperatively evaluated SNs could be visualized with the -y-camera independent of the working distance. Fluorescence detection rates were 90%, 80%, and 80% at 10-, 20-, and 30 -cm working distances. The integrated detection modalities were shown to work synergistically; overall the, GC was most valuable for rough localization (10 to 30 -cm range) of the SNs, the GP for providing convenient realtime acoustic feedback, whereas fluorescence guidance allowed detailed real-time SN visualization. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that full integration of a fluorescence camera with gamma-detector (GP or GC) can be of value when a hybrid, radioactive and fluorescent tracer is used.

TI  - Tropical Cyclone Outflow and Warm Core Structure as Revealed by HS3 Dropsonde Data
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Dropsonde data collected during the NASA Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) field campaign from 16 research missions spanning 6 tropical cyclones (TCs) are investigated, with an emphasis on TC outflow and the warm core. The Global Hawk (GH) AV-6 aircraft provided a unique opportunity to investigate the outflow characteristics due to a combination of 181-h flight durations and the ability to release dropsondes from high altitudes above 100 hPa. Intensifying TCs are found to be associated with stronger upper-level divergence and radial outflow relative to nonintensifying TCs in the sample, regardless of current intensity. A layer of 2-4ms 21 inflow 20-50 hPa deep is also observed 50-100 hPa above the maximum outflow layer, which appears to be associated with lower-stratospheric descent above the eye. The potential temperature of the outflow is found to be more strongly correlated with the equivalent potential temperature of the boundary layer inflow than to the present storm intensity, consistent with the outflow temperature having a stronger relationship with potential intensity than actual intensity. Finally, the outflow originates froma region of low inertial stability that extends above the cyclone from 300 to 150 hPa and from 50- to 200-km radius.The unique nature of this dataset allows the height and structure of the warm core also to be investigated. The magnitude of the warm core was found to be positively correlated with TC intensity, while the height of the warm core was weakly positively correlated with intensity. Finally, neither the height nor magnitude of the warm core exhibits any meaningful relationship with intensity change.

TI  - Sensitivity of grassland productivity to aridity controlled by stomatal and xylem regulation
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial water and carbon cycles are coupled through plant regulation of stomatal closure. Both soil moisture and vapour pressure deficit-the amount of moisture in the air relative to its potential maximum-can govern stomatal closure, which reduces plant carbon uptake. However, plants vary in the degree to which they regulate their stomata-and in association, xylem conductance-in response to increasing aridity: isohydric plants exert tight regulation of stomata and the water content of the plant, whereas anisohydric plants do not. Here we use remote-sensing data sets of anisohydricity and vegetation greenness to show that productivity in United States grasslands-especially anisohydric ones-is far more sensitive to variations in vapour pressure deficit than to variations in precipitation. Anisohydric ecosystem productivity is over three times more sensitive to vapour pressure deficit than isohydric ecosystem productivity. The precipitation sensitivity of summer productivity increases with anisohydricity only for the most anisohydric ecosystems. We conclude that increases in vapour pressure deficit rather than changes in precipitation-both of which are expected impacts of climate change-will be a dominant influence on future grassland productivity.

TI  - Object-Based Detection of Lakes Prone to Seasonal Ice Cover on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau, the world's largest orogenic plateau, hosts thousands of lakes that play prominent roles as water resources, environmental archives, and sources of natural hazards such as glacier lake outburst floods. Previous studies have reported that the size of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau has changed rapidly in recent years, possibly because of atmospheric warming. Tracking these changes systematically with remote sensing data is challenging given the different spectral signatures of water, the potential for confusing lakes with glaciers, and difficulties in classifying frozen or partly frozen lakes. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) offers new opportunities for automated classification in this context, and we have explored this method for mapping lakes from LANDSAT images and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data. We tested our algorithm for most of the Tibetan Plateau, where lakes in tectonic depressions or blocked by glaciers and sediments have different surface colours and seasonal ice cover in images obtained in 1995 and 2015. We combined a modified normalised difference water index (MNDWI) with OBIA and local topographic slope data in order to classify lakes with an area > 10 km(2). Our method derived 323 water bodies, with a total area of 31,258 km(2), or 2.6% of the study area (in 2015). The same number of lakes had covered only 24,892 km(2) in 1995; lake area has increased by -26% in the past two decades. The classification had estimated producer's and user's accuracies of 0.98, with a Cohen's kappa and F-score of 0.98, and may thus be a useful approximation for quantifying regional hydrological budgets. We have shown that our method is flexible and transferable to detecting lakes in diverse physical settings on several continents with similar success rates.

TI  - Capturing the Diversity of Deprived Areas with Image-Based Features: The Case of Mumbai
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many cities in the Global South are facing rapid population and slum growth, but lack detailed information to target these issues. Frequently, municipal datasets on such areas do not keep up with such dynamics, with data that are incomplete, inconsistent, and outdated. Aggregated census-based statistics refer to large and heterogeneous areas, hiding internal spatial differences. In recent years, several remote sensing studies developed methods for mapping slums; however, few studies focused on their diversity. To address this shortcoming, this study analyzes the capacity of very high resolution (VHR) imagery and image processing methods to map locally specific types of deprived areas, applied to the city of Mumbai, India. We analyze spatial, spectral, and textural characteristics of deprived areas, using a WorldView-2 imagery combined with auxiliary spatial data, a random forest classifier, and logistic regression modeling. In addition, image segmentation is used to aggregate results to homogenous urban patches (HUPs). The resulting typology of deprived areas obtains a classification accuracy of 79% for four deprived types and one formal built-up class. The research successfully demonstrates how image-based proxies from VHR imagery can help extract spatial information on the diversity and cross-boundary clusters of deprivation to inform strategic urban management.

TI  - VEGETATION AND CLIMATE INTERACTION PATTERNS IN KYRGYZSTAN: SPATIAL DISCRETIZATION BASED ON TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
T2  - ERDKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal variations of climate-vegetation interactions in Central Asia have been given a lot of attention recently. However some serious methodological drawbacks of previous studies prevented thorough assessment of such interactions. In order to avoid the limitations and improve the analysis we used spatially explicit time series of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), temperature and precipitation which were decomposed to seasonal and trend components on perpixel basis using STL (seasonal decomposition of time series by loess). Trend and seasonal components of NDVI, precipitation and temperature were assessed pixelwise for temporal correlations with different lags to understand the patterns of their interaction in Kyrgyzstan and adjoining regions. Based on these results a coefficient of determination was calculated to understand the extent to which NDVI is conditioned by precipitation and temperature variations. The images with the lags of time series correlation minima and maxima for each pixel and coefficients of NDVI determination by temperature and precipitation were subjected to cluster analysis to identify interaction patterns over the study area. The approach used in this research differs from previous regional studies by implementation of seasonal decomposition and analyzing the full data without spatial or seasonal averaging within predetermined limits prior to the analysis. NDVI response to temperature and precipitation was assumed to be spatially variable in its sign, strength and lag, thus a separate model was developed for each pixel. The results were assessed with cluster analysis to identify spatial patterns of temporal interactions, decrease dimensionality and facilitate their comprehensiveness. The research resulted in 5 spatial clusters with different patterns of NDVI interaction with temperature and precipitation on intra-and interannual scales. The highest correlation scores between NDVI and temperature at the seasonal scale were found at 0-4 months lag and between NDVI and precipitation at 1-5 months lag. At high elevations of 3000-4000 m above sea level, both precipitation and temperature occurred to be facilitating factors for vegetation development, whereas temperature was rather a limiting factor at lower elevations of 200-1300 m a. s. l. We developed maps of the NDVI coefficient of determination by both temperature and precipitation. Only deserts and glaciers had low coefficients of determination (adjusted R2) on the seasonal scale (0.1-0.3), whereas areas with vegetation were greatly conditioned by temperature and precipitation (0.7-0.95). On the trend scale, dense vegetation and bare areas had low coefficient of determination (0.1-0.3), whereas areas with average vegetation cover were greatly controlled by the climatic factors (0.7-0.9).

TI  - Estimation of underwater visibility in coastal and inland waters using remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An optical method is developed to estimate water transparency (or underwater visibility) in terms of Secchi depth (Z(sd)), which follows the remote sensing and contrast transmittance theory. The major factors governing the variation in Z(sd), namely, turbidity and length attenuation coefficient (1/(c + K-d), c = beam attenuation coefficient; K-d = diffuse attenuation coefficient at 531 nm), are obtained based on band rationing techniques. It was found that the band ratio of remote sensing reflectance (expressed as (R-rs(443) + R-rs(490))/ (R-rs(555) + R-rs(670)) contains essential information about the water column optical properties and thereby positively correlates to turbidity. The beam attenuation coefficient (c) at 531 nm is obtained by a linear relationship with turbidity. To derive the vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) at 531 nm, K-d(490) is estimated as a function of reflectance ratio (R-rs(670)/R-rs(490)), which provides the bio-optical link between chlorophyll concentration and K-d(531). The present algorithm was applied to MODIS-Aqua images, and the results were evaluated by matchup comparisons between the remotely estimated Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) in coastal waters off Point Calimere and its adjoining regions on the southeast coast of India. The results showed the pattern of increasing Z(sd) from shallow turbid waters to deep clear waters. The statistical evaluation of the results showed that the percent mean relative error between the MODIS-Aqua-derived Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) values was within +/- 25%. A close agreement achieved in spatial contours of MODIS-Aqua-derived Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) for the month of January 2014 and August 2013 promises the model capability to yield accurate estimates of Zsd in coastal, estuarine, and inland waters. The spatial contours have been included to provide the best data visualization of the measured, modeled (in situ), and satellite-derived Z(sd) products. The modeled and satellite-derived Z(sd) values were compared with measurement data which yielded RMSE = 0.079, MRE = -0.016, and R-2 = 0.95 for the modeled Z(sd) and RMSE = 0.075, MRE = 0.020, and R-2 = 0.95 for the satellite-derived Z(sd) products.

TI  - The application of the piecewise linear approximation to the spectral neighborhood of soil line for the analysis of the quality of normalization of remote sensing materials
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of soil line can be to describe the temporal distribution of spectral characteristics of the bare soil surface. In this case, the soil line can be referred to as the multi-temporal soil line, or simply temporal soil line (TSL). In order to create TSL for 8000 regular lattice points for the territory of three regions of Tula oblast, we used 34 Landsat images obtained in the period from 1985 to 2014 after their certain transformation. As Landsat images are the matrices of the values of spectral brightness, this transformation is the normalization of matrices. There are several methods of normalization that move, rotate, and scale the spectral plane. In our study, we applied the method of piecewise linear approximation to the spectral neighborhood of soil line in order to assess the quality of normalization mathematically. This approach allowed us to range normalization methods according to their quality as follows: classic normalization > successive application of the turn and shift > successive application of the atmospheric correction and shift > atmospheric correction > shift > turn > raw data. The normalized data allowed us to create the maps of the distribution of a and b coefficients of the TSL. The map of b coefficient is characterized by the high correlation with the ground-truth data obtained from 1899 soil pits described during the soil surveys performed by the local institute for land management (GIPROZEM).

The bacterial species were determined by conventional methods, and disc diffusion was used to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial isolates.results A total of 249 (42.2%) specimens were culture-positive yielding a total of 377 isolates. A wide range of bacteria was isolated, the most predominant being Gram-negative bacteria: Proteus spp. (n =48, 12.7%), Escherichia coli (n =44, 11.7%), Pseudomonas spp. (n =40, 10.6%) and Klebsiella spp (n =38, 10.1%). Wound infections were characterised by multiple isolates (n =293, 77.7%), with the most frequent being Proteus spp. (n =44, 15%), Pseudomonas (n =37, 12.6%), Staphylococcus (n =29, 9.9%) and Klebsiella spp. (n =28, 9.6%). All Staphylococcus aureus tested were resistant to penicillin (n =22, 100%) and susceptible to vancomycin. Significant resistance to cephalosporins such as cefazolin (n =62, 72.9%), ceftriaxone (n =44, 51.8%) and ceftazidime (n =40, 37.4%) was observed in Gram-negative bacteria, as well as resistance to cefoxitin (n =6, 27.3%) in S. aureus.conclusion The study has revealed a wide range of causative agents, with an alarming rate of resistance to the commonly used antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, the bacterial spectrum differs from those often observed in high-income countries. This highlights the imperative of regular generation of data on aetiological agents and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns especially in infectious disease endemic settings. The key steps would be to ensure the diagnostic capacity at a sufficient number of sites and implement structures to routinely exchange, compare, analyse and report data. Sentinel sites (hospitals) across the country (and region) should report on a representative subset of bacterial species and their susceptibility to drugs at least annually. A central organising body should collate the data and report to relevant national and international stakeholders.

TI  - Yield variability prediction by remote sensing sensors with different spatial resolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL AGROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, remote sensing sensors are very popular for crop monitoring and yield prediction. This paper describes how satellite images with moderate (Landsat satellite data) and very high (QuickBird and WorldView-2 satellite data) spatial resolution, together with GreenSeeker hand held crop sensor, can be used to estimate yield and crop growth variability. Winter barley (2007 and 2015) and winter wheat (2009 and 2011) were chosen because of cloud-free data availability in the same time period for experimental field from Landsat satellite images and QuickBird or WorldView-2 images. Very high spatial resolution images were resampled to worse spatial resolution. Normalised difference vegetation index was derived from each satellite image data sets and it was also measured with GreenSeeker handheld crop sensor for the year 2015 only. Results showed that each satellite image data set can be used for yield and plant variability estimation. Nevertheless, better results, in comparison with crop yield, were obtained for images acquired in later phenological phases, e.g. in 2007 - BBCH 59 - average correlation coefficient 0.856, and in 2011 - BBCH 59-0.784. GreenSeeker handheld crop sensor was not suitable for yield estimation due to different measuring method.

TI  - Seasonal hydrologic buffer on continents: Patterns, drivers and ecological benefits
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Continental precipitation returns to the atmosphere and the ocean with a delay that is critical in regulating seasonal water supply to ecosystems and societies. We quantify the magnitude and spatial patterns of this seasonal hydrologic buffer, its climatic and terrain drivers, and its apparent benefits to ecosystems using observed precipitation, climate reanalysis evaporation, GRACE seasonal water storage change, and MODIS vegetation index for a 1 degrees x 1 degrees global grid. We found that (1) seasonal hydrologic buffering is widespread and averages 241 mm.yr(-1) on land (a quarter of continental precipitation); it supports evaporation 3-to-9 months of the year over all regions except the per-humid tropics and energy limited high latitudes, (2) the seasonal climatic water imbalance, with surplus in some months and deficit in others, drives hydrologic buffering in lower latitudes, while it is controlled by snow/ice storage in high latitudes, (3) the main terrain effect at our scale of analysis is grid-to-grid water transfer via large rivers providing lateral subsidy to lowland basins, and (4) buffering is manifested in global patterns of plant water use, as shown by high evaporation levels in water deficit conditions, particularly under tropical monsoonal climate. Our results highlight the paramount role of seasonal land water storage and redistribution in supporting ecosystem productivity, and provide a reference to understanding likely impacts of global change on the water cycle and ecosystem dynamics in the future.

TI  - Correlation between Desertification and Environmental Variables Using Remote Sensing Techniques in Hogno Khaan, Mongolia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we used Landsat thematic mapper (TM) and enhanced thematic mapper (ETM) data from 1990, 2002, and 2011 to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of desertification using seven factors; the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the topsoil grain size index (TGSI), land surface albedo, the topographic wetness index (TWI), land surface temperature (LST), the perpendicular drought index (PDI), and the elevation of Hogno Khaan, which lies in a semiarid region of central Mongolia. We normalized the indicators, determined their weights, and defined five levels of desertification; none, low, medium, high, and severe. Sets of rules were constructed, and a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) approach was used to assess desertification and test the correlations between the seven variables in comparison to the different levels of desertification, with field and reference data used for accuracy. We provide a review of the literature on MCE applied to desertification assessment issues based on satellite data. At the first step, major desertification factors were computed for satellite data. The next step was the construction of pairwise comparison matrix. Then, the weight of each factor was determined by the contribution of an analytical hierarchy process. Finally, the susceptible areas to desertification in the study area were identified using a multi-criteria evaluation method. We found that more than 15% of the total land area in Hogno Khaan suffered from severe desertification in 2011, increasing from 7% in 1990. Our analysis showed that the highest correlations were between TGSI and albedo, PDI and TGSI, and PDI and albedo at all levels of desertification. LST was less strongly correlated with TGSI, albedo, and PDI. The correlation of TWI with PDI and NDVI in the non-and low desertification areas produced R values of 0.15 and 0.58, respectively. The correlation analysis indicated a significant positive correlation between TWI and both NDVI and PDI for all years in non-and low desertification areas. Comparing elevation and NDVI, the highest correlation was found for severe desertification in 2002, although correlations for severe desertification were lower in 1990 and 2011.

TI  - Spatial Open Data for Monitoring Risks and Preserving Archaeological Areas and Landscape: Case Studies at Kom el Shoqafa, Egypt and Shush, Iran
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Instrumental to the concept of sustainability must be the search for feasible ways to implement sustainability, especially connecting heritage and tourism. This should be understood in relationship with the persistence in time and the current and future conception of the human-made environment. This study deals with the spatial characterization over time of the urban sprawl close to and around two important archaeological areas: Kom el Shoqafa, Egypt and Shush, Iran. For both of the investigated sites, change detection analyses have been conducted using satellite declassified Corona and multidate Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery available for free from the USGS Earth Explorer. The study involves the collection of Corona 1964, Landsat TM 1984, Landsat ETM+ 1998 and L8 2016. The past and current urban and agricultural areas have been extracted by using consolidated classification techniques. Analyses and quantification of the spatial dimension of the urban expansion showed that, for both the study sites, urban areas have expanded to a significant percentage. In particular, the analysis of Corona and Landsat TM, ETM+, L8 imagery in Kom el Shoqafa revealed that, for the urban area, the evaluation of the change detection presented generally increasing chronology in both of the study areas, but for the agriculture lands, we can see that the changes sometimes decreased and sometimes increased. As a whole, outputs from our investigations clearly highlight that the current availability free of charge of long term satellite time series provides an excellent low cost tool for several applications including environmental monitoring and change detection to observe and quantify urban and land use changes from a global down to a local scale. We examine the capabilities of integrating remote sensing and GIS and suggest some innovative solutions to preserve the archaeological sites.

TI  - Digital Terrain Analysis Reveals New Insights into the Topographic Context of Australian Aboriginal Stone Arrangements
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived surface elevation models are an important resource for landscape archaeological studies. Digital elevation data is useful for classifying land features, characterizing terrain morphology, and discriminating the geomorphic context of archaeological phenomena. This paper shows how remotely sensed elevation data obtained from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Advanced Land Observing Satellite was integrated with local land system spatial data to digitally classify the topographic slope position of seven broad land classes. The motivation of our research was to employ an objective method that would allow researchers to geomorphometrically discriminate the topographic context of Aboriginal stone arrangements, an important archaeological site type in the Pilbara region of northwest Australia. The resulting digital terrain model demonstrates that stone arrangement sites are strongly correlated with upper topographic land features, a finding that contradicts previous site recordings and fundamentally changes our understanding of where stone arrangement sites are likely to have been constructed. The outcome of this research provides investigators with a stronger foundation for testing hypotheses and developing archaeological models. To some degree, our results also hint at the possible functions of stone arrangements, which have largely remained enigmatic to researchers. (c) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - What has Driven Deforestation in Developing Countries Since the 2000s? Evidence from New Remote-Sensing Data
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Using newly-released and globally available high-resolution remote sensing data on forest loss, we update the assessment of the cross-country determinants of deforestation in developing countries.We validate most of the major determinants found in the previous literature, generally based on earlier time-periods, except for the role of institutional quality. Agricultural trade, hitherto relatively neglected, is found to be one of the main factors causing deforestation. Focusing on the effect of international trade, we show that countries with different levels of relative forest cover react differently to a shock in agricultural exports' value. We also emphasize that taking countries' development into account may be critical in assessing global deforestation trends. The impact of trade is high in countries still endowed with a large proportion of forest cover while it is lower in countries with smaller remaining forest cover.We finally estimate, through a simple calibration exercise, the requirements for a cost-effective REDD+ policy for compensating trade losses in an open economy exporting agricultural commodities and endowed with tropical forests. We conclude that, in a world with increasing global demand, it might be costly to compensate totally and thus to offer the right incentives for developing countries to limit deforestation.

TI  - Assessing post-industrial land cover change at the Pine Point Mine, NWT, Canada using multi-temporal Landsat analysis and landscape metrics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates land cover change near the abandoned Pine Point Mine in Canada's Northwest Territories. Industrial mineral development transforms local environments, and the effects of such disturbances are often long-lasting, particularly in subarctic, boreal environments where vegetation conversion can take decades. Located in the Boreal Plains Ecozone, the Pine Point Mine was an extensive open pit operation that underwent little reclamation when it shut down in 1988. We apply remote sensing and landscape ecology methods to quantify land cover change in the 20 years following the mine's closure. Using a time series of near-anniversary Landsat images, we performed a supervised classification to differentiate seven land cover classes. We used raster algebra and landscape metrics to track changes in land cover composition and configuration in the 20 years since the mine shut down. We compared our results with a site in Wood Buffalo National Park that was never subjected to extensive anthropogenic disturbance. This space-for-time substitution provided an analog for how the ecosystem in the Pine Point region might have developed in the absence of industrial mineral development. We found that the dense conifer class was dominant in the park and exhibited larger and more contiguous patches than at the mine site. Bare land at the mine site showed little conversion through time. While the combination of raster algebra and landscape metrics allowed us to track broad changes in land cover composition and configuration, improved access to affordable, high-resolution imagery is necessary to effectively monitor land cover dynamics at abandoned mines.

TI  - Sentinel Node Mapping Using a Fluorescent Dye and Visible Light During Laparoscopic Gastrectomy for Early Gastric Cancer <i>Result of a Prospective Study From a Single Institute</i>
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of sentinel node mapping using a fluorescent dye and visible light in patients with gastric cancer.Background: Recently, fluorescent imaging technology offers improved visibility with the possibility of better sensitivity or accuracy in sentinel node mapping.Methods: Twenty patients with early gastric cancer, for whom laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with standard lymphadenectomy had been planned, were enrolled in this study. Before lymphadenectomy, the patients received a gastrofiberoscopic peritumoral injection of fluorescein solution. The sentinel basin was investigated via laparoscopic fluorescent imaging under blue light (wavelength of 440-490 nm) emitted from an LED curing light. The detection rate and lymph node status were analyzed in the enrolled patients. In addition, short-term clinical outcomes were also investigated.Results: No hypersensitivity to the dye was identified in any enrolled patients. Sentinel nodes were detected in 19 of 20 enrolled patients (95.0%), and metastatic lymph nodes were found in 2 patients. The latter lymph nodes belonged to the sentinel basin of each patient. Meanwhile, 1 patient (5.0%) experienced a postoperative complication that was unrelated to sentinel node mapping. No mortality was recorded among enrolled cases.Conclusions: Sentinel node mapping with visible light fluorescence was a feasible method for visualizing sentinel nodes in patients with early gastric cancer. In addition, this method is advantageous in terms of visualizing the concrete relationship between the sentinel nodes and surrounding structures.

TI  - Fluorescence-Based Molecular Imaging of Porcine Urinary Bladder Sentinel Lymph Nodes
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary objective was to test the ability of a laparoscopic camera system to detect the fluorescent signal emanating from sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) approximately 2 d after injection and imaging of a positron-emitting molecular imaging agent into the submucosa of the porcine urinary bladder. Methods: Three female pigs underwent a submucosal injection of the bladder with fluorescent-tagged tilmanocept, radiolabeled with both Ga-68 and Tc-99m. One hour after injection, a pelvic PET/CT scan was acquired for preoperative SLN mapping. Approximately 36 h later, robotic SLN mapping was performed using a fluorescence-capable camera system. After identification of the fluorescent lymph nodes, a pelvic lymph node dissection was completed with robotic assistance. All excised nodal packets (n = 36) were assayed for Tc-99m activity, which established a lymph node as an SLN. Tc-99m activity was also used to calculate the amount of dye within each lymph node. Results: All of the SLNs defined by the ex vivo gamma-well assay of Tc-99m activity were detected by fluorescence mode imaging. The time between injection and robotic SLN mapping ranged from 32 to 38 h. A total of 5 fluorescent lymph nodes were detected; 2 pigs had 2 fluorescent lymph nodes and 1 pig exhibited a single lymph node. Four of the 5 SLNs exhibited increased SUVs of 12.4-139.0 obtained from PET/CT. The dye content of the injection sites ranged from 371 to 1,441 pmol, which represented 16.5%-64.1% of the injected dose; the amount of dye within the SLNs ranged from 8.5 to 88 pmol, which was equivalent to 0.38%-3.91% of the administered dose. Conclusion: Fluorescent-labeled Ga-68-tilmanocept allows for PET imaging and real-time intraoperative detection of SLNs during robotic surgery.

TI  - Estuarine Plume: A Case Study by Satellite SAR Observations and <i>In Situ</i> Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuary plumes on the western Louisiana continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico, outside of constricted channels of the Sabine and Calcasieu Lakes were observed on two RADARSAT-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The in situ data showed a change in salinity of similar to 2-3 PSUs across the front on the northwest edge of the plume, corresponding to locations of vertical salinity variation of 5.5-7.5 PSU. Velocity magnitude outside of the inlet reached more than 2.3 ms(-1) seaward and a brackish lens in the upper 4.5 m of the water column, the spread of which contributed to the development of a plume. The volume of brackish water within the plume was estimated an order of magnitude larger than the volume output from the Calcasieu River within an entire ebb tidal period. This implies that the plume was formed during multiple tidal cycles and it sustained during the flood tides because only weak diurnal tides exist. Both satellite and in situ observations showed an interesting western intensification of the plume. An analysis to the momentum/vorticity equations suggests that the western intensification is due to the asymmetry of the vorticity-divergence relationship under the Coriolis force. This can also be enhanced by an ambient coastal current that strengthens the convergence at the front. Estuary plumes are shown as bright and dark features in two SAR images. Results from a radar model simulation and in situ water temperature data showed that the SAR observed plume features were dominated by the water temperature differences.

TI  - Using Land Long-Term Data Records to Map Land Cover Changes in China Over 1981-2010
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China has undergone significant land cover changes since the 1980s. However, there are limited consistent and continuous dataset of national scale. Using advanced very high resolution radiometer and moderate resolution imaging spectrometer data from the land long-term data record, we developed a large-scale classification approach to produce a decadal 5-km resolution land cover dataset for China (ChinaLC) from 1981 to 2010. A total of 19 classes of training and validation samples were obtained from visual interpretation of high-resolution Google Earth images and historical vegetation maps. Combined efforts of standard criteria, rigid check, and detailed recording were conducted to strengthen the robustness of the multitemporal samples. The different compositions ofmetrics and parameters were tested to obtain the optimal support vector machine (SVM) classification results. The ChinaLC dataset has an average overall accuracy of approximately 75%, which is much higher compared with other large-scale land cover datasets. Furthermore, a high consistency was found between the land cover changes of ChinaLC and other studies using higher spatial resolution data. The decadal spatial-temporal transition patterns were analyzed and the important reasons for accelerated landscape changes were also explained over the 30 years.

TI  - Evolution Characteristics of Landscape Ecological Risk Patterns in Coastal Zones in Zhejiang Province, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing evolution characteristics of landscape ecological risk patterns would help establish ecological risk early warning mechanism, reduce the ecological risk probability and promote coastal landscape pattern optimization. In this study, landscape pattern indices were first calculated by using multitemporal Landsat TM images acquired in years 1990, 2000 and 2010, then landscape ecological risk pattern evolution models and the spatiotemporal evolutions of ecological risk patterns of coastal zones in Zhejiang province, China were constructed and analyzed. The results demonstrate that (1) greater changes have taken place in landscape structures during the two decades, and (2) the areas of cropland, sea, woodland and water surface have decreased significantly, while the areas of built-up land, unused land and aquaculture land have increased. In 1990, coastal landscapes were mainly occupied by extremely low and low ecological risk areas. However, by 2010, the low ecological risk area apparently decreased compared to that in 1990, while extremely high and high ecological risk areas increased significantly, occupying spatial regions where originally the extremely low and low ecological risk zones located. Transition rates of ecological risk grades in the second ten years (2000-2010) were significantly lower than in the first ten years (1990-2000). The result suggests that people who originally urged to accelerate coastal landscape exploitation and development have started to concern the ecological environment protection and to pursue a mode that economic development and ecological protection are synchronously conducted.

TI  - Assimilating leaf area index of three typical types of subtropical forest in China from MODIS time series data based on the integrated ensemble Kalman filter and PROSAIL model
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Subtropical forest ecosystems play essential roles in the global carbon cycle and in carbon sequestration functions, which challenge the traditional understanding of the main functional areas of carbon sequestration in the temperate forests of Europe and America. The leaf area index (LAI) is an important biological parameter in the spatiotemporal simulation of the carbon cycle, and it has considerable significance in carbon cycle research. Dynamic retrieval based on remote sensing data is an important method with which to obtain large-scale high-accuracy assessments of LAI. This study developed an algorithm for assimilating LAI dynamics based on an integrated ensemble Kalman filter using MODIS LAI data, MODIS reflectance data, and canopy reflectance data modeled by PROSAIL, for three typical types of subtropical forest (Moso bamboo forest, Lei bamboo forest, and evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest) in China during 2014-2015. There were some errors of assimilation in winter, because of the bad data quality of the MODIS product. Overall, the assimilated LAI well matched the observed LAI, with R-2 of 0.82, 0.93, and 0.87, RMSE of 0.73, 0.49, and 0.42, and aBIAS of 0.50, 0.23, and 0.03 for Moso bamboo forest, Lei bamboo forest, and evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest, respectively. The algorithm greatly decreased the uncertainty of the MODIS LAI in the growing season and it improved the accuracy of the MODIS LAI. The advantage of the algorithm is its use of biophysical parameters (e.g., measured LAI) in the LAI assimilation, which makes it possible to assimilate long-term MODIS LAI time series data, and to provide high-accuracy LAI data for the study of carbon cycle characteristics in subtropical forest ecosystems.

TI  - Evaluation of different evapotranspiration products in the middle Yellow River Basin, China
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) is a central process in the climate system and a nexus of the water and energy cycles. This study assesses the hydrological performance of the four categories of ETa products (i. e., land surface models (LSMs), reanalysis, model tree ensemble, and diagnostic models (DMs)) for use in the middle Yellow River Basin (MYRB) using water balance methods. The results show the following. (1) The water storage changes significantly at annual scale and cannot be neglected when calculating the reference ETa by the water balance methods. (2) ETa from LSMs, considering the precipitation input, exhibits the best performance in capturing the reference ETa variation. The MET ETa (AET(JUNG)), based on eddy covariance, has fair performance with a small underestimation, followed by the DMs, including MODIS and ZhangKe. Poor performance is found in reanalysis ETa (JRA55), due to overestimations precipitation and radiation. (3) The reference ETa showed decreased and then increased trend. ETa from the LSMs-Noah model captures the trend well, followed by the LSMs-variable infiltration capacity model. Our results are not only meaningful for better understanding ETa variability in the MYRB, but also significant for improving global ETa products models' performance in semi-arid and semi-humid regions.

TI  - Air pockets and water lenses in the ice cover of the Slave River
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Communities along the Slave River are concerned about changes in the river ice cover, such as the formation of air pockets and double layers of ice in the ice cover. These anomalies make it challenging to find suitable locations for river ice crossings in winter, necessary for the transportation of goods to and from remote regions and to access hunting, trapping and fishing areas. This study utilized satellite imagery and field observations to document these anomalies of the river ice during the winters from November 2013 to March 2016. Backscatter analysis of the satellite imagery identified low and high density areas of air pockets along the river. Satellite images also revealed cracks and flooding of the river ice, particularly along the downstream reach of the river. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Exhaustive pathologic work-up in sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma: is it necessary?
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to determine whether a less exhaustive pathologic work-up to detect melanoma metastasis is clinically useful and does not affect patient prognosis. The success and evolution of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) depends on histological techniques. Several exhaustive protocols of SLN analysis have been published, but are time and cost consuming, with slight increases in the rates of metastasis detection. From 281 patients with SLN biopsy, each SLN was sectioned every 2mm and from each paraffin block, 2-3 histological sections were evaluated. The patients were divided as follows: the first group (n=185) was subjected to extensive SLN examination (eSLNe) and the second group (n=96) was not subjected to an extensive SLN examination (wSLNe). The average SLN resected was 2 (range: 1-7), evaluating one in 50.9%. The SLN metastasis detection rate was 28.5%, whereas eSLNe increased by 3.2%. During follow-up, 4/26 (17.4%) cases in the wSLNe group showed recurrence in the SLN basin. Factors associated with decreased survival in univariant analysis were recurrence, Breslow thickness, advanced clinical stage, ulceration, and SLN metastasis. eSLNe did not affect disease-specific survival. Multivariate analysis showed recurrence (hazard ratio 23.475, 95% confidence interval: 1903-4559, P<0.001) and Breslow thickness of more than 3.5mm (hazard ratio 15.222, 95% confidence interval: 1448-3059, P<0.001) as independent risk factors for decreased survival. Our routine for SLN examination enabled an adequate rate of SLN metastasis detection and the eSLNe increased the rate of detection in 3.2%, but did not affect the survival. We did not find any benefit from performing the eSLNe in patients with Breslow thickness less than 3.5mm.

TI  - Performance of AMSR_E soil moisture data assimilation in CLM4.5 model for monitoring hydrologic fluxes at global scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the performance of community land surface model (CLM4.5) to simulate the hydrologic fluxes, such as, soil moisture (SM), evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff with (without) remote sensing data assimilation. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR_E) daily SM (both ascending and descending) are incorporated into the CLM4.5 model using data assimilation (DA) technique. The GLDAS data is used to validate the AMSR_E SM data and evaluate the performance of CLM4.5 simulations. The AMSR_E SM data are rescaled to meet the resolution of CLM4.5 model. By assimilating the AMSRE SM data into the CLM4.5 model can improve the SM simulations, especially over the climate transition zones in Africa, East Australia, South South America, Southeast Asia, and East North America in summer season. The Local Ensemble Kalman Filter (LEnKF) technique improves the performance of CLM4.5 model compared to the directly substituted method. The improvement in ET and surface runoff simulations from CLM4.5 model assimilated with AMSR_E SM data shares similar spatial patterns with SM. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To explore the clinical value of indocyanine green (ICG) for the fluorescence-guided detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) during sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with early breast cancer.Methods This retrospective study included female patients with breast cancer. Patients were administered methylene blue and ICG using standard techniques. All SLNs that were collected during surgery were submitted for pathological examination. SLNs were defined as those that were either fluorescent, blue, fluorescent and blue or palpably suspicious. Surgical complications, axillary recurrence, distant metastasis and overall survival rates were observed postoperatively.Results A total of 60 patients were enrolled in the study. The fluorescence detection rate of SLNs was 100% (n=177), with a mean of 2.95 SLNs per patient. The methylene blue staining rate was 88.3% (n=106), with a mean of 1.77 SLNs per patient. Pathological assessment of intraoperative frozen specimens revealed SLN metastases in 10 patients, who immediately underwent axillary lymph node dissection. No patient had axillary recurrence or distant metastases, with a survival rate of 100%. Patients who underwent SLNB showed good appearance in the axillary wound, with no limited shoulder joint abduction and upper limb oedema.Conclusion Fluorescence-guided SLNB has several advantages and is suitable for clinical application.

TI  - Comparison and Evaluation of Three Methods for Estimating Forest above Ground Biomass Using TM and GLAS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium spatial resolution biomass is a crucial link from the plot to regional and global scales. Although remote-sensing data-based methods have become a primary approach in estimating forest above ground biomass (AGB), many difficulties remain in data resources and prediction approaches. Each kind of sensor type and prediction method has its own merits and limitations. To select the proper estimation algorithm and remote-sensing data source, several forest AGB models were developed using different remote-sensing data sources (Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data and Thematic Mapper (TM) data) and 108 field measurements. Three modeling methods (stepwise regression (SR), support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF)) were used to estimate forest AGB over the Daxing'anling Mountains in northeastern China. The results of models using different datasets and three approaches were compared. The random forest AGB model using Landsat5/TM as input data was shown the acceptable modeling accuracy (R-2 = 0.95 RMSE = 17.73 Mg/ha) and it was also shown to estimate AGB reliably by cross validation (R-2 = 0.71 RMSE = 39.60 Mg/ha). The results also indicated that adding GLAS data significantly improved AGB predictions for the SVR and SR AGB models. In the case of the RF AGB models, including GLAS data no longer led to significant improvement. Finally, a forest biomass map with spatial resolution of 30 m over the Daxing'anling Mountains was generated using the obtained optimal model.

TI  - Combining Airborne and Terrestrial Laser Scanning Technologies to Measure Forest Understorey Volume
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A critical component of the forest ecosystem, the understorey supports the vast majority of wildlife habitat and total ecosystem floristic diversity. Remote sensing data have been developed to provide information at different scales for surveys of forest ecosystems, but obtaining information about the understorey remains a challenge. As rapid and efficient tools for forest structure attribute estimation, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) have attracted much attention. We examine the relationship between ALS and TLS data and detect changes in the forest understorey caused by forest-tending events in the study area. We conducted trials in five plots within a young Khasi pine (Pinus kesiya Royle ex Gord.) plantation in Yunnan province, China, before and after forest tending. We collected bi-temporal ALS data in this area and TLS data from 10 scanning stations. Canopy height profiles were retrieved from ALS and TLS data, and understorey material volume retrieved from filled TLS voxels volume agreed well with the understorey point clouds percentile distribution (PD) obtained from ALS data. The PD value for the understorey from ALS multiplied by the percentage of ALS return points in the overstorey had a stronger correlation (R-2 = 0.90) with the TLS- derived understorey material volume than did the ALS PD value for the understorey only (R-2 = 0.71). Taking the effect of the overstorey into consideration will improve evaluations of forest understorey parameters from ALS data. This study confirmed the potential of TLS as a validation tool to assess the accuracy of forest understorey material volume estimation at large scales using ALS data.

TI  - Examining spectral reflectance features related to Arctic percent vegetation cover: Implications for hyperspectral remote sensing of Arctic tundra
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigated the utility of hyperspectral remote sensing data for estimating green percent vegetation cover (PVC) for a study site in the Canadian High Arctic. A field experiment was conducted on Sabine Peninsula (76 degrees 27' N, 108 degrees 33' W), Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada to collect field spectra and PVC for five vegetation types, i.e., polar semi-desert (PD), dry mesic tundra (DMT), mesic tundra (MT), wet mesic tundra (WMT) and wet sedge/moss (WSM). Based on field spectra, two types of 2-band hyperspectral (i.e., Hyperion) and multi spectral (i.e., WorldView-3) vegetation indices (VIs) were derived using all possible band combinations. Optimal spectral bands were identified based on their correlations with green PVC. In addition, VIs designed for other landscapes were examined for their ability to estimate green PVC in an Arctic environment. The results indicate that PVC and spectral features for Arctic vegetation types were related to moisture content: (1) vegetation types with dry to intermediate soil moisture (e.g., PD, DMT and MT) possessed large amounts of bare soil and exhibited spectral properties similar to bare soil; and (2) vegetation types with high moisture content (e.g., WMT and WSM) exhibited spectra similar to senescent vegetation given the substantial proportion of senescent vegetation in these vegetation types. The optimal Hyperion spectral bands for estimating green PVC were located at the absorption features observed in Arctic vegetation spectra, including 681.20 nm (leaf pigment absorption); 721.90 nm and 732.07 nm (along the red-edge slope); 1174.77 nm and 1184.87 nm (leaf water absorption); and 1447.14 nm, 1457.23 nm, 2072.65 nm and 2102.94 nm (leaf cellulose and lignin absorption). Narrowband Vls exhibited a stronger correlation with green PVC than broadband Vls due to the finer spectral features sampled by hyperspectral data. Further, VIs designed to estimate leaf pigment and dry matter content (e.g., lignin and cellulose) showed strong correlations with green PVC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integrating Entropy-Based Naive Bayes and GIS for Spatial Evaluation of Flood Hazard
T2  - RISK ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional flood risk caused by intensive rainfall under extreme climate conditions has increasingly attracted global attention. Mapping and evaluation of flood hazard are vital parts in flood risk assessment. This study develops an integrated framework for estimating spatial likelihood of flood hazard by coupling weighted naive Bayes (WNB), geographic information system, and remote sensing. The north part of Fitzroy River Basin in Queensland, Australia, was selected as a case study site. The environmental indices, including extreme rainfall, evapotranspiration, net-water index, soil water retention, elevation, slope, drainage proximity, and density, were generated from spatial data representing climate, soil, vegetation, hydrology, and topography. These indices were weighted using the statistics-based entropy method. The weighted indices were input into the WNB-based model to delineate a regional flood risk map that indicates the likelihood of flood occurrence. The resultant map was validated by the maximum inundation extent extracted from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. The evaluation results, including mapping and evaluation of the distribution of flood hazard, are helpful in guiding flood inundation disaster responses for the region. The novel approach presented consists of weighted grid data, image-based sampling and validation, cell-by-cell probability inferring and spatial mapping. It is superior to an existing spatial naive Bayes (NB) method for regional flood hazard assessment. It can also be extended to other likelihood-related environmental hazard studies.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of MODIS Land Surface Temperature With <i>In Situ</i> Meteorological Observation and ERA-Interim Reanalysis: The Option of Model Calibration
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface temperature (Ts) is an important parameter in land surface and atmosphere studies. A set of synchronously observed "ground-truth" temperature as training data is required for some empirical/semiempirical statistical and neural network methods for retrieving Ts from passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing data. To provide information for the choice of the most suitable dataset in Ts retrieval of PMWremote sensing, the spatiotemporal comparison between the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer Ts (MODIS Ts), the meteorologically observed Ts (in situ Ts), themeteorologically observed near-surface air temperature (in situ Ta), and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast reanalysis products, the ERA-Interim Ts (ERA Ts), in South China for each season's daytime and nighttime is conducted in this paper. Results show that a large discrepancy between the MODIS Ts and the in situ Ts exists, whereas the discrepancies between the MODIS Ts, the in situ Ta and the ERA Ts are relatively smaller in daytime. For nighttime period, the differences between each dataset are relatively much smaller. Because the MODIS Ts is representative at the satellite pixel scale, it has a smaller spatial-scale mismatch with PMW data compared to in situ meteorological observation. The MODIS Ts is suitable for both the daytime and the nighttime PMW Ts model calibration if it is synchronously observed under almost clear-sky condition. By contrast, for the PMW Ts model calibration within the daytime period, the synchronously obtained in situ Ts is not suitable to be used as training data. If the ground temperature of daytime period derived from PMW is required, but the MODIS Ts is unavailable, the in situ Ta should be selected as the "ground truth" for the model calibration. However, it should be noticed that the inversion results are the near-surface air temperature rather than the Ts. Remarkably, reanalysis products such as the ERA Ts presents an alternative choice for both the daytime and the nighttime Ts model calibration if there are no MODIS Ts products or in situ temperature available. After the comparison, an example of PMW Ts retrieval for nighttime period was given, showing a promising performance on deriving an applicable PMW Ts inversion model based on the selection of an appropriate training dataset.

TI  - Expanding temporal resolution in landscape transformations: Insights from a landsat-based case study in Southern Chile
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding temporal and spatial dimensions of land cover dynamics is a critical factor to link ecosystem transformation to land and environmental management. The trajectory of land cover change is not a simple difference between two conditions, but a continuous process. Therefore, there is a need to integrate multiple time periods to identify slow and rapid transformations over time. We mapped land cover composition and configuration changes using time series of Landsat TM/ETM+ images (1985-2011) in Southern Chile to understand the transformation process of a temperate rainforest relict and biodiversity hotspot. Our analysis builds on 28 Landsat scenes from 1985 to 2011 that have been classified using a random forests approach. Base on the high temporal data set we quantify land cover change and fragmentation indices to fully understand landscape transformation in this area. Our results show a high deforestation process for old growth forest strongest at the beginning of the study period (1985-1986-1998-1999) followed by a progressive slowdown until 2011. Within different study periods deforestation rates were much larger than the average rate over the complete study period (0.65%), with the highest annual deforestation rate of 1.2% in 1998-1999. The deforestation resulted in a low connectivity between native forest patches. Old-growth forest was less fragmented, but was concentrated mainly in two large regions (the Andes and Coastal mountain range) with almost no connection in between. Secondary forest located in more intensively used areas was highly fragmented. Exotic forest plantation areas, one of the most important economic activities in the area, increased sevenfold (from 12,836 to 103,540 ha), especially during the first periods at the expense of shrubland, secondary forest, grassland/arable land and old grown forest. Our analysis underlines the importance of expanding temporal resolution in land cover/use change studies to guide sustainable ecosystem management strategies as increase landscape connectivity and integrate landscape planning to economic activities. The study is highlighting the key role of remote sensing in the sustainable management of human influenced ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine whether neighbourhood walkability is associated with clinical measures of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia in an urban adult population.Design: Observational cross-sectional study.Setting: Urban primary care patients.Participants: 78 023 Toronto residents, aged 18 years and over, who were formally rostered or had at least 2 visits between 2012 and 2014 with a primary care physician participating in the University of Toronto Practice Based Research Network (UTOPIAN), within the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN).Main outcome measures: Differences in average body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride between residents in the highest versus the lowest quartile of neighbourhood walkability, as estimated using multivariable linear regression models and stratified by age. Outcomes were objectively measured and were retrieved from primary care electronic medical records. Models adjusted for age, sex, smoking, medications, medical comorbidities and indices of neighbourhood safety and marginalisation.Results: Compared with those in the lowest walkability quartile, individuals in the highest quartile had lower mean BMI (-2.64 kg/m(2), 95% CI -2.98 to -2.30; p<0.001), systolic blood pressure (-1.35 mm Hg, 95% CI -2.01 to -0.70; p<0.001), diastolic blood pressure (-0.60 mm Hg, 95% CI 1.06 to -0.14; p=0.010) and HbA1c (-0.063%, 95% CI -0.11 to -0.021; p=0.003) and higher mean HDL (0.052 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.029 to 0.075; p<0.001). In age-stratified analyses, differences in the mean BMI were consistently observed for adults aged 18 to under 40 (-4.44 kg/m(2), 95% CI -5.09 to -3.79; p<0.001), adults aged 40-65 (-2.74 kg/m(2), 95% CI -3.24 to -2.23; p<0.001) and adults aged over 65 (-0.87 kg/m(2), 95% CI -1.48 to -0.26; p=0.005).Conclusions: There was a clinically meaningful association between living in the most walkable neighbourhoods and having lower BMI in adults of all ages.

TI  - Human and remote sensing data to investigate the frontiers of urbanization in the south of Mexico City
T2  - Data in Brief
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The data presented here were originally collected for the article "Frontiers of Urbanization: Identifying and Explaining Urbanization Hot Spots in the South of Mexico City Using Human and Remote Sensing" (Rodriguez et al. 2017) [4]. They were divided into three databases (remote sensing, human sensing, and census information), using a multi-method approach with the goal of analyzing the impact of urbanization on protected areas in southern Mexico City. The remote sensing database was prepared as a result of a semi-automatic classification, dividing the land cover data into urban and non-urban classes. The second data set details an alternative view of the phenomena of urbanization by concentrating on illegal settlements in the conservation zone. It was based on voluntary complaints about environmental and land use offences filed at the Procuraduria Ambiental y del Ordenamiento Territorial del Distrito Federal (PAOT), which is a governmental entity responsible for reviewing and processing grievances on five basic topics: illegal land use, deterioration of green areas, waste, noise/vibrations, and animals. Anyone can file a PAOT complaint by phone, electronically, or in person. The complaint ends with a resolution, act of conciliation, or recommendation for action by other actors, such as the police or health office. The third data about unemployment was extracted from Mexico's National Census 2010 database available via public access. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier lnc.

TI  - Retrieval of vegetation height in rice fields using polarimetric SAR interferometry with TanDEM-X data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents for the first time a demonstration with satellite data of polarimetric SAR interferometry (PolInSAR) applied to the retrieval of vegetation height in rice fields. Three series of dual-pol interferometric SAR data acquired with large baselines (2-3 km) by the TanDEM-X system during its science phase (April September 2015) are exploited. A novel inversion algorithm especially suited for rice fields cultivated in flooded soil is proposed and evaluated. The validation is carried out over three test sites located in geographically different areas: Sevilla (SW Spain), Valencia (E Spain), and Ipsala (W Turkey), in which different rice types are present. Results are obtained during the whole growth cycle and demonstrate that PolInSAR is useful to produce accurate height estimates (RMSE 10-20 cm) when plants are tall enough (taller than 25-40 cm), without relying on external reference information.

AB  - Loturco, I, Kobal, R, Moraes, JE, Kitamura, K, Cal Abad, CC, Pereira, LA, and Nakamura, FY. Predicting the maximum dynamic strength in bench press: the high precision of the bar velocity approach. J Strength Cond Res 31(4): 1127-1131, 2017The aim of this study was to determine the force-velocity relationship and test the possibility of determining the 1 repetition maximum (1RM) in free weight and Smith machine bench presses. Thirty-six male top-level athletes from 3 different sports were submitted to a standardized 1RM bench press assessment (free weight or Smith machine, in randomized order), following standard procedures encompassing lifts performed at 40-100% of 1RM. The mean propulsive velocity (MPV) was measured in all attempts. A linear regression was performed to establish the relationships between bar velocities and 1RM percentages. The actual and predicted 1RM for each exercise were compared using a paired t-test. Although the Smith machine 1RM was higher (10% difference) than the free weight 1RM, in both cases the actual and predicted values did not differ. In addition, the linear relationship between MPV and percentage of 1RM (coefficient of determination 95%) allow determination of training intensity based on the bar velocity. The linear relationships between the MPVs and the relative percentages of 1RM throughout the entire range of loads enable coaches to use the MPV to accurately monitor their athletes on a daily basis and accurately determine their actual 1RM without the need to perform standard maximum dynamic strength assessments.

TI  - A New Spatial Attraction Model for Improving Subpixel Land Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Subpixel mapping (SPM) is a technique that produces hard classification maps at a spatial resolution finer than that of the input images produced when handling mixed pixels. Existing spatial attraction model (SAM) techniques have been proven to be an effective SPM method. The techniques mostly differ in the way in which they compute the spatial attraction, for example, from the surrounding pixels in the subpixel/pixel spatial attraction model (SPSAM), from the subpixels within the surrounding pixels in the modified SPSAM (MSPSAM), or from the subpixels within the surrounding pixels and the touching subpixels within the central pixel in the mixed spatial attraction model (MSAM). However, they have a number of common defects, such as a lack of consideration of the attraction from subpixels within the central pixel and the unequal treatment of attraction from surrounding subpixels of the same distance. In order to overcome these defects, this study proposed an improved SAM (ISAM) for SPM. ISAM estimates the attraction value of the current subpixel at the center of a moving window from all subpixels within the window, and moves the window one subpixel per step. Experimental results from both Landsat and MODIS imagery have proven that ISAM, when compared with other SAMs, can improve SPM accuracies and is a more efficient SPM technique than MSPSAM and MSAM.

TI  - Estimating urban vegetation fraction across 25 cities in pan-Pacific using Landsat time series data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization globally is consistently reshaping the natural landscape to accommodate the growing human population. Urban vegetation plays a key role in moderating environmental impacts caused by urbanization and is critically important for local economic, social and cultural development. The differing patterns of human population growth, varying urban structures and development stages, results in highly varied spatial and temporal vegetation patterns particularly in the pan-Pacific region which has some of the fastest urbanization rates globally. Yet spatially-explicit temporal information on the amount and change of urban vegetation is rarely documented particularly in less developed nations. Remote sensing offers an exceptional data source and a unique perspective to map urban vegetation and change due to its consistency and ubiquitous nature. In this research, we assess the vegetation fractions of 25 cities across 12 pan-Pacific countries using annual gap-free Landsat surface reflectance products acquired from 1984 to 2012, using sub-pixel, spectral unmixing approaches. Vegetation change trends were then analyzed using Mann-Kendall statistics and Theil-Sen slope estimators. Unmixing results successfully mapped urban vegetation for pixels located in urban parks, forested mountainous regions, as well as agricultural land (correlation coefficient ranging from 0.66 to 0.77). The greatest vegetation loss from 1984 to 2012 was found in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Dalian in China. In contrast, cities including Vancouver (Canada) and Seattle (USA) showed stable vegetation trends through time. Using temporal trend analysis, our results suggest that it is possible to reduce noise and outliers caused by phenological changes particularly in cropland using dense new Landsat time series approaches. We conclude that simple yet effective approaches of unmixing Landsat time series data for assessing spatial and temporal changes of urban vegetation at regional scales can provide critical information for urban planners and anthropogenic studies globally.

TI  - Modeling Biomass Production in Seasonal Wetlands Using MODIS NDVI Land Surface Phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant primary production is a key driver of several ecosystem functions in seasonal marshes, such as water purification and secondary production by wildlife and domestic animals. Knowledge of the spatio-temporal dynamics of biomass production is therefore essential for the management of resources-particularly in seasonal wetlands with variable flooding regimes. We propose a method to estimate standing aboveground plant biomass using NDVI Land Surface Phenology (LSP) derived from MODIS, which we calibrate and validate in the Donana National Park'smarsh vegetation. Out of the different estimators tested, the Land Surface Phenology maximum NDVI (LSP-Maximum-NDVI) correlated best with ground-truth data of biomass production at five locations from 2001-2015 used to calibrate the models (R-2 = 0.65). Estimators based on a single MODIS NDVI image performed worse (R-2 <= 0.41). The LSP-Maximum- NDVI estimator was robust to environmental variation in precipitation and hydroperiod, and to spatial variation in the productivity and composition of the plant community. The determination of plant biomass using remote-sensing techniques, adequately supported by ground-truth data, may represent a key tool for the long-term monitoring and management of seasonal marsh ecosystems.

TI  - Estimating aboveground biomass of broadleaf, needleleaf, and mixed forests in Northeastern China through analysis of 25-m ALOS/PALSAR mosaic data
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) of temperate forest plays an important role in global carbon cycles and needs to be estimated accurately. ALOS/PALSAR (Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) data has recently been used to estimate forest AGB. However, the relationships between AGB and PALSAR backscatter coefficients of different forest types in Northeastern China remain unknown. In this study, we analyzed PALSAR data in 2010 and observed AGB data from 104 forest plots in 2011 of needleleaf forest, mixed forest, and broadleaf forest in Heilongjiang province of Northeastern China. "Poisson" regression in generalized linear models (GLMs) and BRT (boosted regression tree) analysis in generalized boosted models (GBMs) were used to test whether the constructed PALSAR/AGB models based on individual forest types have better performance. We also investigated whether adding topographical and stand structure factors into the regression models can enhance the model performance. Results showed that GBM model had a better performance in fitting the relationships between AGB and PALSAR backscatter coefficients than did GLM model for needleleaf forest (RMSE = 3.81 Mg ha(-1), R-2 = 0.98), mixed forest (RMSE = 17.72 Mg ha(-1), R-2 = 0.96), and broadleaf forest (RMSE = 19.94 Mg ha(-1), R-2 = 0.96), and performance of nonlinear regression models constructed on individual forest types were higher than that on all forest plots. Moreover, fitting results of GLM and GBM models were both enhanced when topographical and stand structure factors were incorporated into the predictor variables. Regression models constructed based on individual forest types outperform than that based on all forest plots, and the model performance will be enhanced when incorporating topographical and stand structure factors. With information of forest types, topography, and stand features, PALSAR data can express its full ability in accurate estimation of forest AGB. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact Assessment of <i>Himawari</i>-<i>8</i> AHI Data Assimilation in NCEP GDAS/GFS with GSI
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the first of the next-generation geostationary meteorological satellites, Himawari-8 was successfully launched in October 2014 by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and placed over the western Pacific Ocean domain at 140.7 degrees E. It carries the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), which provides full-disk images of Earth at 16 bands in the visible and infrared domains every 10 min. Efforts are currently ongoing at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS)/Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) to assimilate Himawari-8 AHI radiance measurements into the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation analysis system (GSI). All software development within the GSI to allow for assimilation of Himawari-8 AHI radiance has been completed.This study reports on the assessment of AHI preassimilation data quality by comparing observed clear-sky ocean-only radiances to those simulated using collocated ECMWF analysis, as well as describing procedures implemented for quality control. The impact of the AHI data assimilation on the resulting analyses and forecasts is then assessed using the NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS). A preliminary assessment of the assimilation of AHI data from infrared water vapor channels and atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) on top of the current global observing system shows neutral to marginal positive impact on analysis and forecast skill relative to an assimilation without AHI data. The main positive impact occurs for short-to medium-range forecasts of global upper-tropospheric water vapor. The results demonstrate the feasibility of direct assimilation of AHI radiances and highlight how humidity information can be extracted within the assimilation system.

TI  - Intraoperative Localization of Rectal Tumors Using Liposomal Indocyanine Green
T2  - SURGICAL INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Tumor localization may pose a significant challenge during minimally invasive rectal resection. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging can penetrate biological tissue and afford tumor localization from the external surface of the rectum. Our aim was to develop an NIR-based tool for rectal tumor imaging that can be administered intravenously. Methods: We prepared indocyanine-green (ICG)-loaded liposomes by sonication. Liposomes were evaluated for their size and morphology. We then used an endoscopically induced rectal cancer in mice as a model for rectal cancer. After intravenous administration, tumors were evaluated for their fluorescence intensity. Tumor intensity was expressed in relation to the background signal, that is, tumor to background ratio (TBR). Results: Liposomes in various sizes could be prepared by adjusting sonication time. We selected 100-nm-sized liposomes for further experiments. Transmission electron microscopy showed spherical particles and confirmed the size measurements. The liposomes could be lyophilized and then rehydrated again before use without compromising their structure or signal. Fluorescence intensity was kept for 24 hours after solubilization. Testing the optimal time course for rectal tumor imaging revealed that early time course (up to 3 hours) yielded nonspecific imaging, whereas after long time course (24 hours), a very weak signal remained in the tissue. The optimal time window for imaging was after 12 hours from injection, with TBR = 8.1 +/- 3.6 (P = .002). Free ICG could not achieve similar results. Conclusions: The liposomal ICG can be reproducibly prepared and kept in lyophilized form. Liposomal ICG could serve as a tool for intraoperative tumor localization.

TI  - A comparison of two downscaling procedures to increase the spatial resolution of mapping actual evapotranspiration
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research addressed the effects of downscaling cokriging Land Surface Temperature (LST) on estimation of Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) from remote sensing images. Two procedures were followed. We first applied downscaling cokriging to a coarse resolution LST product of MODIS at 1000 m. With its outcome, daily AET of a medium spatial resolution (250 m) was obtained using the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS). Second, we downScaled a coarse AET map to medium spatial resolution (250 m). For both procedures, the 250 m resolution MODIS NDVI product was used as a co-variable. Validation was carried out using Landsat 8 images, from which LST was derived from the thermal bands. The two procedures were applied to an agricultural area with a traditional irrigation network in Iran. We obtained an average LST value of 305.8 K as compared to a downscaled LST value of 307.0 K. Reference AET estimated with SEBS using Landsat 8 data was equal to 5.756 mm day(-1), as compared with a downscaled AET value of 5.571 mm day(-1). The RMSE between reference AET and downscaled AET was equal to 1.26 mm day(-1) (r = 0.49) and between reference and downscaled LST to 3.67 K (r = 0.48). The study showed that AET values obtained with the two downscaling procedures were similar to each other, but that AET showed a higher spatial variability if obtained with downscaled LST. We concluded that LST had a large effect on producing AET maps from Remote Sensing (RS) images, and that downscaling cokriging was helpful to provide daily AET maps at medium spatial resolution.

TI  - An Intercomparison of Satellite-Based Daily Evapotranspiration Estimates under Different Eco-Climatic Regions in South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for enhancing our understanding of the hydrological cycle, as well as for managing water resources, particularly in semi-arid regions. Remote sensing offers a comprehensive means of monitoring this phenomenon at different spatial and temporal intervals. Currently, several satellite methods exist and are used to assess ET at various spatial and temporal resolutions with various degrees of accuracy and precision. This research investigated the performance of three satellite-based ET algorithms and two global products, namely land surface temperature/vegetation index (TsVI), Penman-Monteith (PM), and the Meteosat Second Generation ET (MET) and the Global Land-surface Evaporation: the Amsterdam Methodology (GLEAM) global products, in two eco-regions of South Africa. Daily ET derived from the eddy covariance system from Skukuza, a sub-tropical, savanna biome, and large aperture boundary layer scintillometer system in Elandsberg, a Mediterranean, fynbos biome, during the dry and wet seasons, were used to evaluate the models. Low coefficients of determination (R-2) of between 0 and 0.45 were recorded on both sites, during both seasons. Although PM performed best during periods of high ET at both sites, results show it was outperformed by other models during low ET times. TsVI and MET were similarly accurate in the dry season in Skukuza, as GLEAM was the most accurate in Elandsberg during the wet season. The conclusion is that none of the models performed well, as shown by low R2 and high errors in all the models. In essence, our results conclude that further investigation of the PM model is possible to improve its estimation of low ET measurements.

AB  - Geomagnetic observatory data are fundamental in geomagnetic field studies and are widely used in other applications. Often they are combined with satellite and ground survey data. Unfortunately, the observatory definitive data are only available with a time lag ranging from several months up to more than a year. The reason for this lag is the annual production of the final calibration values, i.e. baselines that are used to correct preliminary data from continuously recording magnetometers. In this paper, we will show that the preparation of definitive geomagnetic data is possible within a calendar year and presents an original method for prompt and automatic estimation of the observatory baselines. The new baselines, obtained in a mostly automatic manner, are compared with the baselines reported on INTERMAGNET DVDs for the 2009-2011 period. The high quality of the baselines obtained by the proposed method indicates its suitability for data processing in fully automatic observatories when automated absolute instruments will be deployed at remote sites.

TI  - First Serological Evidence of West Nile Virus in Horses and Dogs from Corsica Island, France
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is widely distributed over the world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia and spread over the past two decades to North and South America. In the south of France, sporadic cases are frequently described and the virus is endemic in Italy with frequent cases and outbreaks. The aim of this study was to identify a possible WNV circulation in Corsica (French island in the Mediterranean Sea) in sheep, horses, and dogs as sentinel animals for the virus surveillance. In 2014, 386 blood samples were collected from 219 sheep, 96 horses, and 71 dogs, in 12 localities in Corsica, in the oriental coast of Corsica. Each sample was systematically tested for WNV immunoglobulin G using an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) with inactivated WNV as antigen. The result of the ELISA for the WNV antibody test on the sheep sera was all negative, whereas 9 of 96 horses (9.4%) and 6 of 71 dogs (8.4%) presented WNV antibodies. All the positive samples from horses and dogs were confirmed by serum neutralization test. Although no clinical case in humans and horses was reported to date, this report highlights the necessity to improve WNV surveillance in animals and humans, as well as in blood donors in Corsica.

TI  - Applications of Geospatial Technologies to Understand Terroir Effects in an Ontario Riesling Vineyard
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ENOLOGY AND VITICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether yield components and grape berry composition variables were related to and dependent upon soil texture and composition, vine water status (leaf water potential, Psi), and vine size and to assess whether spatial patterns of leaf Psi, vine size, and other field variables were temporally stable. Data were collected in a 10-ha Riesling vineyard at Thirty Bench Winemakers in Beamsville, ON. The vineyard was delineated using global positioning systems and 519 vines in six sub-blocks were geo-referenced. Soil water content (SWC; all sentinel vines) and leaf Psi data (a subset of 134 sentinel vines) were measured bi-weekly from 2006 to 2009. Soil texture and composition data were also collected for the 134-vine subset. Yield components (yield, clusters per vine) and berry samples were collected from each sentinel vine, with an additional berry sample for monoterpene determination from the subset. Vine size was determined by weight of cane prunings. Berry samples were analyzed for Brix, pH, and titratable acidity (TA) and the additional berry samples, for free and potential monoterpenes. All variables were mapped using geographic information systems, which permitted verification of temporal stability and correlative and spatial relationships. SWC and leaf Psi were temporally stable throughout the vineyard despite extremely different weather conditions. There was increased Brix and pH and decreased TA (enhanced grape maturity) with decreases in SWC, leaf Psi, and vine size. Where SWC was very high, decreased leaf Psi, vine size, and fruit maturity were observed. Sub-blocks with highest sand and soil organic matter tended to have higher vine sizes and more berry monoterpenes.

TI  - Does Conservative Surgery for Breast Carcinoma Still Require Axillary Lymph Node Evaluation? A Retrospective Analysis of 1156 Consecutive Women With Early Breast Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - We performed a retrospective analysis of 1156 patients affected by early breast cancer in order to estimate the real incidence of patients with T1 tumors presenting > 2 metastatic lymph nodes. The advantage of axillary surgery seems to be limited only to a specific subgroup of T1 patients who are undergoing conservative surgery plus radiotherapy.Background: The role of axillary surgery for early breast carcinoma treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy is currently the subject of considerable investigation. Recent studies have supported the noninferiority of avoiding axillary surgery in terms of overall survival when sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB) presents < 2 positive lymph nodes, thus sparing the patients from complications. There are some ongoing studies investigating the possibility of omitting SLNB. Axillary study seems to be sufficiently replaced by SLNB for staging the disease. Axillary surgery maintains a therapeutic role in the presence of > 2 metastatic lymph nodes at SLNB. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 1156 patients with early breast cancer to estimate the real incidence of patients with T1 tumors presenting > 2 metastatic lymph nodes. Results: Of the 1156 cases, only 106 (9.2%) had > 2 axillary metastatic lymph nodes. More specifically, 38 (4.3%) of 884 T1 cases, and 6 (2.3%) of 257 of T1b cases had > 2 metastatic lymph nodes. Conclusion: The advantage of axillary surgery seems to be limited only to a specific subgroup of T1 patients who are undergoing conservative surgery plus radiotherapy. The ongoing studies on avoiding SLNB will likely prove the noninferiority of omitting biopsy because these studies are conducted in the whole population of early breast cancers. It is necessary to identify more accurately the subpopulation of patients who may benefit from axillary surgery.

TI  - Spatial characteristics of landslides triggered by the 2015 M<sub>w</sub> 7.8 (Gorkha) and M<sub>w</sub> 7.3 (Dolakha) earthquakes in Nepal
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - High magnitude earthquakes trigger numerous landslides and their occurrences are mainly controlled by terrain parameters. We created an inventory of 15,551 landslides with a total area of 90.2 km(2) triggered by the 2015 M-w 7.8 (Gorkha) and M-w 7.3 (Dolakha) earthquakes in Nepal, through interpretation of very high resolution satellite images (e.g. WorldView, Pleiades, Cartosat-1 and 2, Resourcesat-2). Our spatial analysis of landslide occurrences with ground acceleration, slope, lithology and surface defomation indicated ubiquitous control of steep slope on landslides with ground acceleration as the trigger. Spatial distribution of landslides shows increasing frequency away from the Gorkha earthquake epicentre up to 130 km towards east, dropping sharply thereafter, which is an abnormal phenomenon of coseismic landslides. Landslides are laterally concentrated in three zones which matches well with the seismic rupture evolution of Gorkha earthquake, as reported through teleseismic measurements.

TI  - Early Detection of Infection in Pigs through an Online Monitoring System
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Late detection of emergency diseases causes significant economic losses for pig producers and governments. As the first signs of animal infection are usually fever and reduced motion that lead to reduced consumption of water and feed, we developed a novel smart system to monitor body temperature and motion in real time, facilitating the early detection of infectious diseases. In this study, carried out within the framework of the European Union research project Rapidia Field, we tested the smart system on 10 pigs experimentally infected with two doses of an attenuated strain of African swine fever. Biosensors and an accelerometer embedded in an eartag captured data before and after infection, and video cameras were used to monitor the animals 24 h per day. The results showed that in 8 of 9 cases, the monitoring system detected infection onset as an increase in body temperature and decrease in movement before or simultaneously with fever detection based on rectal temperature measurement, observation of clinical signs, the decrease in water consumption or positive qPCR detection of virus. In addition, this decrease in movement was reliably detected using automatic analysis of video images therefore providing an inexpensive alternative to direct motion measurement. The system can be set up to alert staff when high fever, reduced motion or both are detected in one or more animals. This system may be useful for monitoring sentinel herds in real time, considerably reducing the financial and logistical costs of periodic sampling and increasing the chances of early detection of infection.

TI  - Mapping the Viability, Time, and Cost of Manual Borehole Drilling in Developing Regions
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - While access to water remains an issue in arid and semiarid regions across the world, aquifers have the potential to help millions of people out of poverty by providing a reliable source of drinking and irrigation water. Manual boreholes are increasingly advocated as a safe and cost-effective substitute to mechanized drilling, as well as to traditional excavation methods. This research banks on the assumption that field and remote sensing data can be integrated within a geospatial database in order to map the viability of manual boreholes based on factors such as rock type, water table depth, landforms, or water quality. The approach presents three main novelties in relation to methodological precedents: (1) outcomes are not only expressed in terms of technical feasibility, but also as a function of drilling time and cost; (2) maps refer to a specific drilling technique; and (3) results take into account borehole diameter, as this constrains both drilling time and cost. The method provides univocal outcomes that can be immediately useful for non-experts, donors, planners, or practitioners and that can be readily exported to other catchment-scale settings. Results were validated against geophysical data.

TI  - Assessment of Atmospheric Correction Methods for Sentinel-2 MSI Images Applied to Amazon Floodplain Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data provide the only viable means for extensive monitoring of remote and large freshwater systems, such as the Amazon floodplain lakes. However, an accurate atmospheric correction is required to retrieve water constituents based on surface water reflectance (R-W). In this paper, we assessed three atmospheric correction methods (Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6SV), ACOLITE and Sen2Cor) applied to an image acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) on-board of the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2A platform using concurrent in-situ measurements over four Amazon floodplain lakes in Brazil. In addition, we evaluated the correction of forest adjacency effects based on the linear spectral unmixing model, and performed a temporal evaluation of atmospheric constituents from Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) products. The validation of MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD) indicated satisfactory retrievals over the Amazon region, with a correlation coefficient (R) of similar to 0.7 and 0.85 for Terra and Aqua products, respectively. The seasonal distribution of the cloud cover and AOD revealed a contrast between the first and second half of the year in the study area. Furthermore, simulation of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance showed a critical contribution of atmospheric effects (>50%) to all spectral bands, especially the deep blue (92%-96%) and blue (84%-92%) bands. The atmospheric correction results of the visible bands illustrate the limitation of the methods over dark lakes (R-W < 1%), and better match of the R-W shape compared with in-situ measurements over turbid lakes, although the accuracy varied depending on the spectral bands and methods. Particularly above 705 nm, R-W was highly affected by Amazon forest adjacency, and the proposed adjacency effect correction minimized the spectral distortions in R-W (RMSE < 0.006). Finally, an extensive validation of the methods is required for distinct inland water types and atmospheric conditions.

TI  - Availability of sentinel lymph node biopsy for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is the second common cutaneous cancer, especially in the elderly. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is generally performed in breast cancers and cutaneous melanomas to detect occult nodal metastases. The benefit of sentinel lymph node biopsy in improving cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma prognosis is doubtful. One hundred and sixty-nine patients who underwent treatment for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma between 2004 and 2015, and who were followed up for at least 6 months or developed metastases within the follow-up period were included. Forty-nine patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, whereas 120 patients did not, including 13 who exhibited clinical lymph node metastases before treatment. Of these 49 patients, nine (18.4%) presented with sentinel lymph node metastasis, which occurred after treatment in three (6.1%) of them (false-negative). Among the 107 patients who did not undergo lymph node biopsy, 12 (11.2%) developed post-treatment metastases. The metastasis-free and disease-specific survival rates were not significantly different in those who did or did not undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy. Patients with clinical lymph node metastases had a higher risk compared with those without. Patients with T2-T4 tumors had a higher risk compared with those with T1 tumors. When selecting for those with T2 tumors or greater, the same lack of relationship was observed. In conclusion, in this small retrospective cohort, in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, there were no significant differences in metastasis-free and disease-specific survival rates between those who did or did not undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy, regardless of T staging.

T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a technique for mapping monthly average hourly downward longwave (LW down arrow) irradiance using ground- and satellite -based data. A model relating LW down arrow irradiance to a satellite derived brightness temperature of the earth -atmospheric system, relative humidity and ambient air temperature was formulated. This model was validated against LW down arrow irradiance obtained from measurements at 4 sites in the tropics and discrepancy in terms of root mean square errors and mean bias errors was found to be 1.89% and -0.69%, respectively. After the validation, the model was used to calculate monthly average hourly LW down arrow irradiance over Thailand and the results were displayed as LW down arrow maps. These maps reveal the influence of various factors on LW down arrow irradiance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis of <i>Eisenia fetida</i> chronically exposed to benzo(a)pyrene
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Benzo(a)pyrene is a high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon which is carcinogenic and widespread pollutant in the environment. It is essential to identify the presence of this chemical in soil as it is toxic to biota including humans. Eisenia fetida is a sentinel organism in soil which can be used to diagnose the health of the soil. In order to identify potential molecular markers from Eisenia fetida to diagnose the presence of benzo(a)pyrene in soil, we exposed the organism to sub-lethal (10 mg Kg(-1)) concentrations for a period of eight months and carried out transcriptome analysis. From the transcriptome, we have identified differentially expressed genes. Results showed that benzo(a)pyrene has altered the expression of calcium binding and calcium homeostasis, apoptotic process, cytoskeletal proteins, protein transport, nucleotide binding, lipid metabolism, peripheral neuronal development, cell division, wound healing and processing genes at transcription level. Several of the genes we reported here were not reported earlier. The highly up regulated and down regulated genes could be used as a molecular marker to diagnose the presence of benzo(a)pyrene in the soil. (c) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Mosquito-borne viruses circulating in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Diseases caused by mosquito-borne viruses are among the most important emerging diseases that threaten human and animal health, particularly in Africa. However, little attention has been paid to these diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The present cross-sectional study was undertaken between March and May 2014 to investigate the presence of mosquito-borne viruses in mosquitoes collected from five municipalities of Kinshasa, DRC.Methods: Mosquitoes were collected using BG-Sentinel traps and battery-powered aspirators. Female mosquitoes were pooled according to their genera and sampling locations, preserved in RNAlater, and later screened for viruses using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays.Results: A total of 2922 mosquitoes were collected and 29 pools of female mosquitoes, containing approximately 30 mosquitoes each, were tested. Twelve of the 29 (41.4%) mosquito pools were found to be infected with at least one arbovirus, with eight (27.5%) pools positive for Alphavirus, nine (31%) for Flavivirus, and five (17.2%) for Bunyaviridae. Chikungunya, o'nyong'nyong, and Rift valley fever viruses were detected.Conclusions: The present study shows that mosquitoes in Kinshasa carry mosquito-borne viruses that may have serious public health implications. Further investigations on the presence of mosquito-borne viruses in the human and livestock populations of Kinshasa and DRC are recommended. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - A risk-based approach for identifying constituents of concern in oil sands process-affected water from the Athabasca Oil Sands region
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining leases in the Athabasca Oil Sands (AOS) region produce large volumes of oil sands process affected water (OSPW) containing constituents that limit beneficial uses and discharge into receiving systems. The aim of this research is to identify constituents of concern (COCs) in OSPW sourced from an active settling basin with the goal of providing a sound rational for developing mitigation strategies for using constructed treatment wetlands for COCs contained in OSPW. COCs were identified through several lines of evidence: 1) chemical and physical characterization of OSPW and comparisons with numeric water quality guidelines and toxicity endpoints, 2) measuring toxicity of OSPW using a taxonomic range of sentinel organisms (i.e. fish, aquatic invertebrates, and a macrophyte), 3) conducting process-based manipulations (PBMs) of OSPW to alter toxicity and inform treatment processes, and 4) discerning potential treatment pathways to mitigate ecological risks of OSPW based on identification of COCs, toxicological analyses, and PBM results. COCs identified in OSPW included organics (naphthenic acids [NAs], oil and grease [O/G]), metals/metalloids, and suspended solids. In terms of species sensitivities to undiluted OSPW, fish >= aquatic invertebrates > macrophytes. Bench-scale manipulations of the organic fractions of OSPW via PBMs (i.e. H2O2+UV254 and granular activated charcoal treatments) eliminated toxicity to Ceriodaphnia dubia (7-8 d), in terms of mortality and reproduction. Results from this study provide critical information to inform mitigation strategies using passive or semi-passive treatment processes (e.g., constructed treatment wetlands) to mitigate ecological risks of OSPW to aquatic organisms.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Supervised and unsupervised satellite image classifications have progressed greatly in recent years. However, discrimination difficulties still remain among classes that directly affecting data extraction and surface mapping accuracy. The Ouargla region in southeastern Algeria is intersected by wadis, where direct communication between the shallow groundwater table and these dry, overlying ephemeral stream beds exists. Underflowing groundwater exfiltrates into low-lying aeolian blowouts or endorheic basins forming oases, chotts, and sebkhas, commonly known as saline wetlands. These wetlands are becoming increasingly vulnerable to anthropogenic stress, resulting in significant water degradation. Wetland microclimates are very important to arid regions, as they promote oasis ecosystem sustainability and preservation. High water salinity in these ecosystems, however, directly affects flourishing habitat and undermines successful desert oasis development. The objective of this work is to choose the best classification method to identify saline wetlands by comparison between the different results of land use mapping within the Ouargla basin. Landsat ETM+ (2000) satellite imagery, using visual analysis with colored compositions, has identified various forms of saline wetlands in the Ouargla region desert environment in southeast Algeria. The results show that supervised classification is validated in the identification of Saharan saline wetlands, and that support vector machine (SVM) algorithm presents the best overall accuracy.

TI  - Evaluation of Remote Sensing Inversion Error for the Above-Ground Biomass of Alpine Meadow Grassland Based on Multi-Source Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is not yet clear whether there is any difference in using remote sensing data of different spatial resolutions and filtering methods to improve the above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation accuracy of alpine meadow grassland. In this study, field measurements of AGB and spectral data at Sangke Town, Gansu Province, China, in three years (2013-2015) are combined to construct AGB estimation models of alpine meadow grassland based on these different remotely-sensed NDVI data: MODIS, HJ-1B CCD of China and Landsat 8 OLI (denoted as NDVIMOD, NDVICCD and NDVIOLI, respectively). This study aims to investigate the estimation errors of AGB from the three satellite sensors, to examine the influence of different filtering methods on MODIS NDVI for the estimation accuracy of AGB and to evaluate the feasibility of large-scale models applied to a small area. The results showed that: (1) filtering the MODIS NDVI using the Savitzky-Golay (SG), logistic and Gaussian approaches can reduce the AGB estimation error; in particular, the SG method performs the best, with the smallest errors at both the sample plot scale (250 m x 250 m) and the entire study area (33.9% and 34.9%, respectively); (2) the optimum estimation model of grassland AGB in the study area is the exponential model based on NDVIOLI, with estimation errors of 29.1% and 30.7% at the sample plot and the study area scales, respectively; and (3) the estimation errors of grassland AGB models previously constructed at different spatial scales (the Tibetan Plateau, Gannan Prefecture and Xiahe County) are higher than those directly constructed based on the small area of this study by 11.9%-36.4% and 5.3%-29.6% at the sample plot and study area scales, respectively. This study presents an improved monitoring algorithm of alpine natural grassland AGB estimation and provides a clear direction for future improvement of the grassland AGB estimation and grassland productivity from remote sensing technology.

TI  - Intercomparison of Soil Moisture, Evaporative Stress, and Vegetation Indices for Estimating Corn and Soybean Yields Over the US
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an intercomparative study of 12 operationally produced large-scale datasets describing soil moisture, evapotranspiration (ET), and/or vegetation characteristics within agricultural regions of the contiguous United States (CONUS). These datasets have been developed using a variety of techniques, including, hydrologic modeling, satellite-based retrievals, data assimilation, and survey/in-field data collection. The objectives are to assess the relative utility of each dataset for monitoring crop yield variability, to quantitatively assess their capacity for predicting end-of-season corn and soybean yields, and to examine the evolution of the yield-index correlations during the growing season. This analysis is unique both with regards to the number and variety of examined yield predictor datasets and the detailed assessment of the water availability timing on the end-of-season crop production during the growing season. Correlation results indicate that over CONUS, at state-level soil moisture and ET indices can provide better information for forecasting corn and soybean yields than vegetation-based indices such as normalized difference vegetation index. The strength of correlation with corn and soybean yields strongly depends on the interannual variability in yield measured at a given location. In this case study, some of the remotely derived datasets examined provide skill comparable to that of in-situ field survey-based data-further demonstrating the utility of these remote sensing-based approaches for estimating crop yield.

TI  - Reaching endpoints for lymphatic filariasis elimination- results from mass drug administration and nocturnal blood surveys, South Gujarat, India
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFollowing the World Health Assembly resolution on Elimination of lymphatic filariasis (ELF) as a public health problem by the year 2020, a Global Program (GPELF) was launched in 1997 to help endemic countries to initiate national programs. The current strategy to interrupt transmission of LF, is administration of once-yearly, single-dose, two-drug regimen (Albendazole with Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) to be used in endemic areas with the goal of reaching 65% epidemiological coverage for 4-6 years. We report findings of independent assessment from year 2010 to 2015 for last six rounds, after initial five rounds of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) since 2005 for ELF in endemic area of Gujarat.MethodsIndependent assessment of MDA was performed to find coverage and compliance indicators, reasons for non-coverage and non-compliance in five Implementation Units (IUs). Pre, during and post MDA evaluations were done in three phases. The impact of MDA was measured by microfilaraemia survey. A total of eight sites, four random and four fixed sentinel sites were selected to calculate microfilaria rate (MF) per IUs per year. In years 2010 to 2015, we report results from 125,936 nocturnal blood smears and 17551 population in 120 selected clusters. Four clusters were selected per year in each of the five IUs for assessment of MDA round.ResultPost MDA survey showed drug coverage between 81%-88% and epidemiological coverage 77%-89% across years. Main reasons for non-coverage were drug administrator related (the team did not visit or missed people) while non-compliance was population related (fear of side effects, sickness, people forgot or absent). During MDA findings show that the directly observed consumption is considerably improved from 58% in 2010 to 82% in 2015. The knowledge about benefits of drug provided also increased from 59% to 90% over the years. The current MF rate is less than one in all IUs with an overall 68% percent decrease from baseline year 2005 to year 2015. The average MF rate of Gujarat is 0.44 for year 2015.ConclusionsThe findings show that achieving adequate epidemiological and drug coverage is possible by actual field level operation of the program in large endemic areas. The results and feedback from independent assessment, performed regularly, could guide the policymakers and program managers for mid-term corrections and to frame strategies to enhance program. Monitoring of coverage and impact indicator together informs decisions for reaching end-point of MDA. The impact indicator-microfilaria rate in all IUs of South Gujarat Region has reached and remained less than one percent signaling end-points of MDA. Post MDA stringent monitoring in form of TAS is recommended to keep vigil on maintenance of elimination achieved.

TI  - Time-series cloud noise mapping and reduction algorithm for improved vegetation and drought monitoring
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) time-series Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) products are regularly used for vegetation monitoring missions and climate change analysis. However, satellite observation is affected by the atmospheric condition, cloud state and shadows introducing noise in the data. MODIS state flag helps in understanding pixel quality but overestimates the noise and hence its usability requires further scrutiny. This study has analyzed MODIS MOD09A1 annual data set over Sri Lanka. The study presents a simple and effective noise mapping method which integrates four state flag parameters (i.e. cloud state, cloud shadow, cirrus detected, and internal cloud algorithm flag) to estimate Cloud Possibility Index (CPI). Usability of CPI is analyzed along with NDVI for noise elimination. Then the gaps generated due to noise elimination are reconstructed and performance of the reconstruction model is assessed over simulated data with five different levels of random gaps (10-50%) and four different statistical measures (i.e. Root mean square error, mean absolute error, mean bias error, and mean absolute percentage error). The sample-based analysis over homogeneous and heterogeneous pixels have revealed that CPI-based noise elimination has increased the detection accuracy of number of growing cycle from 45-60% to 85-95% in vegetated regions. The study cautions that usage of time-series NDVI data without proper cloud correction mechanism would result in wrong estimation about spatial distribution and intensity of drought, and in our study 50% of area is wrongly reported to be under drought though there was no major drought in 2014.

TI  - Comprehensive Annual Ice Sheet Velocity Mapping Using Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, and RADARSAT-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing data including Landsat-8 (optical), Sentinel-1, and RADARSAT-2 (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions) have recently become routinely available for large scale ice velocity mapping of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. These datasets are too large in size to be processed and calibrated manually as done in the past. Here, we describe a methodology to process the SAR and optical data in a synergistic fashion and automatically calibrate, mosaic, and integrate these data sets together into seamless, ice-sheet-wide, products. We employ this approach to produce annual mosaics of ice motion in Antarctica and Greenland with all available data acquired on a particular year. We find that the precision of a Landsat-8 pair is lower than that of its SAR counterpart, but due to the large number of Landsat-8 acquisitions, combined with the high persistency of optical surface features in the Landsat-8 data, we obtain accurate velocity products from Landsat that integrate well with the SAR-derived velocity products. The resulting pool of remote sensing products is a significant advance for observing changes in ice dynamics over the entire ice sheets and their contribution to sea level. In preparation for the next generation sensors, we discuss the implications of the results for the upcoming NASA-ISRO SAR mission (NISAR).

TI  - Decadal-scale changes in forest soil carbon and nitrogen storage are influenced by organic matter removal during timber harvest
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates whether different intensities of organic matter removal associated with timber harvest influence decadal-scale storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in the top 1m of mineral soil 18years postharvest in a Pinus taeda L. forest in the Gulf Coastal Plain. We quantified forest harvest-related changes in SOC, TN, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and nitrogen (MBN) pools (0-100cm) in unharvested control stands and in two organic matter removal treatment stands subjected to either (i) merchantable bole/stem-only harvest or (ii) whole-tree harvest+forest floor removal. In addition, C-13 of SOC and N-15 of TN were measured in mineral soil to provide insights regarding mechanisms that might explain changes in SOC and TN pool sizes. Soils were sampled seasonally for 1year. Increasing organic matter removal intensity reduced SOC, TN, MBC, and MBN relative to the unharvested control. Furthermore, soils from whole-tree harvest+forest floor removal stands had lower C-13 and higher N-15 values, suggesting that increasing organic matter removal may decrease heterotrophic activity as well as increase rates of N loss. Seasonal variabilities in SOC and TN were correlated to changes in forest biological properties such as root biomass and forest floor mass. These results indicate that more intensive harvest methods may lead to decade-scale decreases in SOC and TN storage in surface and subsurface soils which could influence rates of biogeochemical processes, the availability of soil nutrients, and potential forest productivity.

AB  - Remotely sensed data and the instruments that acquire them are core parts of Earth and planetary observation systems. They are used to quantify the Earth's interconnected systems, and remote sensing is the only way to get a daily, or more frequent, snapshot of the status of the Earth. It really is the Earth's stethoscope. In a similar manner remote sensing is the rock hammer of the planetary scientist and the only way comprehensive data sets can be acquired. To risk offending many remotely sensed data acquired across the electromagnetic spectrum, it is the tricorder to explore known and unknown planets. Arriving where we are today in the use of remotely sensed data in the solar system has been a continually evolving synergy between Earth observation, planetary exploration, and fundamental laboratory work.

TI  - Evaluating fire severity in Sudanian ecosystems of Burkina Faso using Landsat 8 satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The fire severity of the 2013-2014 fire season within Sudanian ecosystems in Burkina Faso was evaluated from Landsat 8 images using derivatives of the Normalized Burn Ratio algorithm (NBR). The relationship between the image-derived severity and the field observed severity i.e. Composite Burn Index (CBI) was best described by a nonlinear model of the form y = a + b*EXP(CBI *c) (R-2 = 0.66). Classification of the image-derived burned area into burn severity classes achieved a classification Kappa accuracy statistic of 0.56. Highly severely burned areas were mapped with the highest accuracy (user's accuracy 77%, producer's accuracy 86%). The severity of the burn varied across phyto-geographical zones, protected status, land cover regimes, and forest management practices. The south Sudanian zone burned with a higher severity (low = 7%, moderate = 16% and high = 13%) than the north Sudanian zone (low = 5%, moderate = 10% and high = 5%). The mean of the highly severely burned areas differed significantly among the forest management practices (P = 0.005). A pair-wise comparison of the severity mean area indicated that the highly burned areas within forests managed for wildlife purposes differed significantly with that of both forests under the joint management (P = 0.006) and those under no management (P = 0.024). Among the management practices, forests jointly managed by the local communities and the government had the highest unburned area and the least highly severely burned areas reflecting the impacts of bottom-up forestry management where the local communities are actively involved in the management.

TI  - Application of Supervised Classification and CrostaTechnique for Lithological Discrimination in Parts of South Khetri Belt, Sikar District, Rajasthan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supervised classification and Crosta technique is widely used for lithological and alteration zone mapping respectively. Landsat ETM+ digital imagery has been used to generate Crosta and Supervised classification image using digital image processing (DIP) technique. In the study, The Crosta technique has been used for the first time in lithological mapping. These techniques were applied to distinguish the litho-contacts between Alwar and Ajabgarh quartzite in the south-western part of North Delhi Fold Belt (NDFB) on the basis of argillaceous and arenaceous nature of the rocks. Litho contacts between Alwar and Ajabgarh groups are varying from quartzite to biotite schist in the Khetri basin whereas in the study area the litho-contacts are Alwar quartzite to Ajabgarh quartzite which are very difficult to classify on naked eye. Therefore, this area has been selected for this study. Several authors have studied the geological setting of Khetri sub basin and classified on the basis of argillaceous, arenaceous nature and primary sedimentary structural features like ripple marks and cross bedding. This is the first attempt in the Khetri sub basin for lithological classification based on remote sensing and digital image processing technique. This study revealed that Crosta image has significant spatial correlation with the lithology discriminated using Supervised classification technique. Lithological variations were clearly demarcated using these technique around Rahunathgarh and Golyana areas. The litho units between these areas were marked under the Group of Ajabgarh quartzite by the GSI people during 1994. However, the present study classified those area under the Group of Alwar quartzite. Similar type of studies can also be carried out where these type of lithological problems arises.

T2  - Data in Brief
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Land use and land cover changes will continue to affect resilient human communities and ecosystems as a result of climate change. However, an assessment of land use and land cover changes over time in Indian Ocean Islands is less documented. The land use/cover data changes over 10 years at smaller geographical scale across Unguja Island in Zanzibar were analyzed. Downscaling of the data was obtained from SERVIR through partnership with Kenya-based Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) database (http://www.servirglobal.net), and clipped down in ArcMap (Version 10.1) to Unguja Island. SERVIR and RCMRD Land Cover Dataset are mainly 30 m multi-spectral images include Landsat TM and ETM+Multispectral Images. Landscape ecology Statistics tool (LecoS) was used to analysis the land use and land cover changes. The data provide information on the status of the land use and land cover changes along the Unguja Island in Zanzibar. The data is of great significance to the future research on global change.

TI  - Image enhancements of Landsat 8 (OLI) and SAR data for preliminary landslide identification and mapping applied to the central region of Kenya
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Image enhancements lead to improved performance and increased accuracy of feature extraction, recognition, identification, classification and hence change detection. This increases the utility of remote sensing to suit environmental applications and aid disaster monitoring of geohazards involving large areas. The main aim of this study was to compare the effect of image enhancement applied to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and Landsat 8 imagery in landslide identification and mapping. The methodology involved pre-processing Landsat 8 imagery, image co-registration, despeckling of the SAR data, after which Landsat 8 imagery was enhanced by Principal and Independent Component Analysis (PCA and ICA), a spectral index involving bands 7 and 4, and using a False Colour Composite (FCC) with the components bearing the most geologic information. The SAR data were processed using textural and edge filters, and computation of SAR incoherence. The enhanced spatial, textural and edge information from the SAR data was incorporated to the spectral information from Landsat 8 imagery during the knowledge based classification. The methodology was tested in the central highlands of Kenya, characterized by rugged terrain and frequent rainfall induced landslides. The results showed that the SAR data complemented Landsat 8 data which had enriched spectral information afforded by the FCC with enhanced geologic information. The SAR classification depicted landslides along the ridges and lineaments, important information lacking in the Landsat 8 image classification. The success of landslide identification and classification was attributed to the enhanced geologic features by spectral, textural and roughness properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Total tumor load assessed by one-step nucleic acid amplification assay as an intraoperative predictor for non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study aimed to determine the relationship between CK19 mRNA copy number in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) assessed by one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) technique, and non sentinel lymph nodes (NSLN) metastization in invasive breast cancer. A model using total tumor load (TEL) obtained by OSNA technique was also constructed to evaluate its predictability.Methods: We conducted an observational retrospective study including 598 patients with clinically T1 T3 and node negative invasive breast cancer. Of the 88 patients with positive SLN, 58 patients fulfill the inclusion criteria.Results: In the analyzed group 25.86% had at least one positive NSLN in axillary lymph node dissection. Univariate analysis showed that tumor size, TTL and number of SLN macrometastases were predictive factors for NSLN metastases. In multivariate analysis just the TTL was predictive for positive NSLN (OR 2.67; 95% CI 1.06-6.70; P = 0.036). The ROC curve for the model using TTL alone was obtained and an AUC of 0.805 (95% CI 0.69-0.92) was achieved. For TTL >1.9 x 105 copies/4 we got 73.3% sensitivity, 74.4% specificity and 88.9% negative predictive value to predict NSLN metastases.Conclusion: When using OSNA technique to evaluate SLN, NSLN metastases, can be predicted intraoperatively. This prediction tool could help in decision for axillary lymph node dissection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF ABOVEGROUND FOREST BIOMASS USING GEOSPATIAL TECHNIQUES IN MURREE AND ABBOTTABAD AREAS, PAKISTAN
T2  - International Journal of Biology and Biotechnology
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an important biophysical parameter for evaluating global carbon stocks. Accurate estimates of AGB are gaining importance because of UN Climate Change requirements: This research study developed a methodology for estimating aboveground forest biomass using SPOT-5 satellite data coupled with sample field data and allometric equations in the coniferous forests of Murree and Abbottabad areas, Pakistan. Plot sizes of 13.7 m radius were used for field measurements, size of plots were based on tree density of the forest in the study area. In total, 11 sample plots were surveyed for measurements of tree Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), tree density and species information. Biomass values were worked out using volume equations, factors in the study areas. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values were extracted from radiometrically and atmospherically corrected SPOT 5 data. The algorithm was developed between NDVI and measured tree biomass for estimating and generating biomass maps for the study areas. The spectrally derived above ground biomass were estimated as 235 Mega g/ha and 261 Mega g/ha in Murree and Abbottabad areas, respectively. The AGB results in this study have been comparable with previously reported values in the area. The study demonstrates the application of geospatial technologies including mapping, spectral responses and field measurements for biomass estimation. The forest maps so generated provide a new method of assessing forest AGB resource in the study areas. To further improve efficiency of regression models for precise measurements of AGB, the bigger number of sample sites could be taken into consideration.

TI  - Micro- and macro-metastasis in the axillary lymph node: A review
T2  - SURGEON-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL COLLEGES OF SURGEONS OF EDINBURGH AND IRELAND
M3  - Review
AB  - Pathologists typically examine the sentinel lymph nodes excised from patients with invasive breast cancer more thoroughly than they have historically those from axillary lymph node clearance specimens. This, it is thought, increases the chances of detecting small metastatic foci (i.e. macrometastases (>2 mm), micrometastases (0.2-2 mm), or isolated tumour cell clusters (<0.2 mm or <200 cancer cells in one section)). However, the clinical significance of these small metastatic deposits remains unclear. Although an increasing nodal burden is known to proportionally decrease patient survival, the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial has, at the least, raised questions as to how best to manage nodal metastasis in early invasive breast cancer. These issues, and a brief overview of the biology of metastatic spread are presented in this review.

TI  - Observed spatio-temporal changes of winter snow albedo over the north-west Himalaya
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the spatio-temporal winter snow albedo analysis over different mountain ranges of north-west Himalaya (NWH) for a period of approximately 24 years. Here we assess the temporal albedo variations in past two decades (1991-2010) in comparison to the recent 14 years (2000-2014). The field collected manual data of two representative observatories of Lower Himalaya (LH) and Great Himalaya (GH), and six automatic weather stations in LH, GH and Karakoram Himalaya (KH) were analysed. Satellite derived MODIS albedo data (MOD10A1) over these stations between 2001 and 2014 were analysed. A good correlation (r = 0.59) was observed between monthly average MODIS retrieved albedo and field collected albedo for GH with a relative error of 11%. In past two decades, a statistically significant (99%) decreasing rate of -0.011 per year in winter snow albedo was observed over GH (1993-2010), while in recent decade (2001 onward), no statistically significant increasing trend was observed. The change in albedo of GH is attributed to winter mean air temperature, which shows a significant rise in the past two decades, but there has been a hiatus in winter mean air temperature rise in recent decade. The higher winter mean air temperature above 0 degrees C since beginning of the study period (1991 onward) kept albedo of moist/wet snow approximately stable in LH. Further, insignificant increasing trend of albedo was observed over KH range in recent decade, and it is attributed to persistent very low temperatures and an increase in the frequency of snowfall days. This albedo study over NWH supports the recently reported findings on Himalayan snow cover and glacier variations during different durations.

TI  - Assessment of urbanization and urban heat islands in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam using Landsat data
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has a great impact on the local climate of a city, thereby triggering the urban heat island (UHI) effect and affecting the quality of human life. Information on past and present changes of urban landscapes and temperature could be of interest to urban planners in an attempt to shape the urban planning process and mitigate effects of UHI. This study aimed to develop an approach for assessing the urbanization and UHI effects in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam using Landsat data during the periods 1996-2007-2016. The data were processed through four main steps: (1) data pre-processing, (2) impervious surface (IS) extraction, (3) land surface temperature (LST) retrieval, and (4) accuracy assessment. The results of IS extraction compared with the ground reference data indicated the overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients generally higher than 86.1% and 0.72, in all cases. During 1996-2016, the city was drastically urbanized into multiple directions, with the IS area increasing from 10,488.5 ha (1996) to 27,142.7 ha (2016). The results of retrieved LST revealed the radiant temperature for 1996 ranging from 22.4-35.8 degrees C, while that for 2016 remarkably higher from 25.3-40.4 degrees C. The relationship between LST and a newly developed normalized difference composite index (NDCI) was also examined to investigate the genesis of temperature due to decadal urbanization, indicating a strong correlation with the correlation coefficients (r) of higher than 0.71 (p-value < 0.001), in all cases. To further understand UHI impacts due to the urbanization, the proportion of IS and averaged LST over IS areas for each district was calculated. The results showed that only few central districts located in the city higher than 30 degrees C in 1996, while most of districts were heavily influenced by urban surface structures with the LST higher than 31 degrees C in 2007 and 32 degrees C in 2016.

TI  - Estimation of surface iron oxide abundance with suppression of grain size and topography effects
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral forms of iron oxide, such as hematite, goethite and jarosite, are important because they are widely distributed at the Earth's surface and because they are used as indicators for mineral exploration. Iron oxide abundance in rocks containing these minerals can be estimated from the absorption depth at wavelengths of around 900 nm in a reflectance spectrum, but this depth is also affected by extraneous factors such as grain size and topography. This paper investigated the effect of grain size on reflectance spectra and proposed a method for estimating iron oxide abundance in surface rocks by using remotely sensed data with suppression of the effects of grain size and topography. Reflectance spectra were measured in a laboratory from rock powder samples of different grain sizes containing iron oxide minerals. While the reflectance increased with decreasing grain size, the presence of ferric iron caused the absorption depth to be almost constant at around 900 nm, irrespective of the chemical composition of the sample. In addition, the difference between the reflectance at 550 nm and 760 nm (Slope) was a function of grain size. Iron oxide abundance can be estimated accurately by MCR-900D, which is the maximum absorption depth at the absorption center after the effect of grain size and topography was suppressed by Slope and the continuum-removal method, which takes the ratio between the original spectrum and its continuum, respectively. Correlation of MCR-900D results with datasets of actual spectral and chemical iron oxide laboratory measurements revealed that the mineral forms also need to be considered. MCR-900D results were significantly correlated with rock samples classified as containing different forms of iron oxide minerals (hematite, goethite and jarosite). Finally, MCR-900D was applied to an AVIRIS dataset for the Cuprite site in Nevada, USA. The results represented the enrichment zones of iron oxide within hydrothermally altered areas.

TI  - Assessing the progress of desertification of the southern edge of Chihuahuan Desert: A case study of San Luis Potosi Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to establish if the San Luis Potosi Plateau (SLPP), which is part of the southern edge of the Chihuahuan Desert, is generating desertification processes, indicating a progression of the desert toward the central part of Mexico. Therefore, we analyzed the temporal evolution of four environmental indicators of desertification: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Iron Oxides Index (IO) and Surface Temperature (ST). Landsat TM images are used to cover a period from 1990 to 2011. A new equation of total balance is proposed to generate an image of the overall evolution of each factor which is applied to get a probability map of desertification. The evolution of NDVI, NDWI and IO shows a behavior almost stable over the time. In contrast, the ST shows a slight increase. The outcomes of this study confirm periods of vegetation re-greening and 8.80% of the SLPP has the highest probability to develop desertification. The most affected area is the portion west of the region, and the east and south are the least affected areas. The results suggest a slight advance of the desert, although most of the area doesn't have the necessary conditions to develop desertification.

AB  - Very high-resolution (VHR) Pleiades 1A and ENVISAT/ASAR (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite images were used for lithological and tectonic mapping respectively of Santorini island complex, South Aegean, Greece. The results were compared to the existing geological maps of the study area. The extracted, quantitative results within GIS environment, followed by a ground-truth visit, showed that there is some variance in the delineation of the boundaries of certain lithological units on the geological map compared to those on the Pleiades 1A image and that a number of lineaments detected on the ENVISAT image could be incorporated to the faults' population. As a general conclusion, new findings can be embodied to the existing geological maps.

TI  - Evaluation of IR radiance simulation for all-sky assimilation of Himawari-8/AHI in a mesoscale NWP system
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - To assimilate the all-sky infrared radiances of Himawari-8/AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager), we investigated the statistical characteristics of a radiance simulation from a mesoscale cloud-resolving model. Compared with AHI observations, the simulations tended to show insufficiently low brightness temperature (BT), probably because of a lack of high-cloud prediction and insufficient cloud-scattering in the radiative transfer (RT) calculations. For effective assimilation, quality control (QC) procedures were developed to eliminate samples in which high inhomogeneities were identified, observed BTs were very low, and simulated (background) radiances deviated substantially from observations. The probability distribution function (PDF) of observation-minus-background (O-B) was Gaussian for the QC-passed samples at the humidity bands (6.2 and 6.9 mu m) of the AHI. This evaluation was implemented for four representative meteorological conditions around Japan to ensure robustness. The PDF at the window band (10.4 mu m), however, was not close to Gaussian, probably because of the significant negative bias even after QCs. The PDF at a low-tropospheric temperature band (13.3 mu m) was Gaussian for three out of four meteorological conditions.The relationship of the removal of inhomogeneous scenes to the O-B statistics and BT distribution was investigated quantitatively. The stricter threshold of inhomogeneity reduced O-B difference but also decreased the percentage of low BT, resulting in the possibility of excessive removal of high-altitude cloud samples. This relationship was enhanced for larger samples that included more diverse cloud scenes. Finally, comparison of simulations at various resolutions with two RT models revealed that the reproducibility of low BT was more affected by using a different RT model than by using higher-resolution systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Management of the axilla in stage II/III breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) is controversial. To understand current patterns of care, we collected axillary data from 2 NST trials: HER2-positive (Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB] 40601) and triple-negative (CALGB 40603).STUDY DESIGN: Axillary evaluation pre-and post-NST was per the treating surgeon and could include sentinel node biopsy. Post-NST, node-positive patients were recommended to undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). We report pre-NST histopathologic nodal evaluation and post-NST axillary surgical procedures with correlation to clinical and pathologic nodal status.RESULTS: Seven hundred and forty-two patients were treated, 704 had complete nodal data pre-NST and post-NST. Pre-NST, 422 (60%) of 704 patients underwent at least 1 procedure for axillary node evaluation (total of 468 procedures): fine needle aspiration (n = 234; 74% positive), core needle biopsy (n = 138; 72% positive), and sentinel node biopsy (n = 96; 33% positive). Pre-NST, 304 patients were considered node-positive. Post-NST, 304 of 704 patients (43%) underwent sentinel node biopsy; 44 were positive and 259 were negative (29 and 36 patients, respectively, had subsequent ALND). Three hundred and ninety-one (56%) patients went directly to post-NST ALND and 9 (1%) pre-NST node-positive patients had no post-NST axillary procedure. Post-NST, 170 (24%) of the 704 patients had residual axillary disease. Agreement between post-NST clinical and radiologic staging and post-NST histologic staging was strongest for node-negative (81%) and weaker for node-positive (N1 31%, N2 29%), with more than half of the clinically node-positive patients found to be pathologic negative (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest there is no widely accepted standard for axillary nodal evaluation pre-NST. Post-NST staging was highly concordant in patients with N0 disease, but poorly so in node-positive disease. Accurate methods are needed to identify post-NST patients without residual axillary disease to potentially spare ALND. (C) 2017 by the American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Implementation of the 7th edition AJCC staging system: Effects on staging and survival for pT1 melanoma. A Dutch population based study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - In the 7th edition of the AJCC staging system, the mitotic rate criterion replaced Clark level to increase correct classification of high-risk thin melanoma patients (pT1B). Additionally, sentinel node biopsy (SNB) was recommended for nodal staging of pT1B melanomas. The aim of this article was to evaluate the effects on pT1 substaging and clinical implications in the national pT1 melanoma population. All pT1 melanomas diagnosed in the Netherlands between 2003 and 2014 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (IKNL). Patients were stratified by cohort according to AJCC edition: (1) 2003-2009 (6th) and (2) 2010-2014 (7th). Relative survival was calculated to estimate melanoma-specific survival. A total of 29.546 pT1 melanoma patients were included. The pT1b proportion increased from 10.1% in Cohort 1 to 21.5% in Cohort 2. The proportion of performed SNBs per cohort increased: for pT1b melanomas alone from 4.5% to 13.0%. SNB positivity rate decreased from 10.5% to 8.8% for the entire pT1 population, and for pT1b melanomas from 11.3% to 8.6%. At 5 years, the relative survival rate was similar for pT1a and pT1b in both cohorts, namely, pT1a 100% vs pT1b 97% (Cohort 1), and pT1a 100% vs pT1b 98% (Cohort 2). The 7th edition of the AJCC staging system has caused an increased number of patients to undergo SNB, without an increase in SNB positivity rate. Survival between pT1 subgroups remains similar. The mitotic rate criterion for pT1b classification and the recommendation to perform SNB for pT1b melanomas should be reconsidered.

TI  - Analysis of land cover/use changes using Landsat 5 TM data and indices
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion and unprecedented rural to urban transition, along with a huge population growth, are major driving forces altering land cover/use in metropolitan areas. Many of the land cover classes such as farmlands, wetlands, forests, and bare soils have been transformed during the past years into human settlements. Identification of the city growth trends and the impact of it on the vegetation cover of an area is essential for a better understanding of the sustainability of urban development processes, both planned and unplanned. Analyzing the causes and consequences of land use dynamics helps local government, urban planners, and managers for the betterment of future plans and minimizing the negative effects.This study determined temporal changes in vegetation cover and built-up area in Istanbul (Turkey) using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and built-up area index (BUAI). The temporal data were based on Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images acquired in June of 1984, 2002, 2007, 2009, and 2011. The NDVI was applied to all the Landsat images, and the resulting NDVI images were overlaid to generate an NDVI layer stack image. The same procedure was repeated using the SAVI and BUAI images. The layer stack images revealed those areas that had changed in terms of the different indices over the years. To determine temporal change trends, the values of 150 randomly selected control points were extracted from the same locations in the NDVI, SAVI, and BUAI layer stack images. The results obtained from these control points showed that vegetation cover decreased considerably because of a remarkable increase in the built-up area.

TI  - Soil Moisture Estimation over Vegetated Agricultural Areas: Tigris Basin, Turkey from Radarsat-2 Data by Polarimetric Decomposition Models and a Generalized Regression Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the soil moisture in agricultural fields is a significant parameter to use irrigation systems efficiently. In contrast to standard soil moisture measurements, good results might be acquired in a shorter time over large areas by remote sensing tools. In order to estimate the soil moisture over vegetated agricultural areas, a relationship between Radarsat-2 data and measured ground soil moistures was established by polarimetric decomposition models and a generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The experiments were executed over two agricultural sites on the Tigris Basin, Turkey. The study consists of four phases. In the first stage, Radarsat-2 data were acquired on different dates and in situ measurements were implemented simultaneously. In the second phase, the Radarsat-2 data were pre-processed and the GPS coordinates of the soil sample points were imported to this data. Then the standard sigma backscattering coefficients with the Freeman-Durden and H/A/alpha polarimetric decomposition models were employed for feature extraction and a feature vector with four sigma backscattering coefficients (sigma hh, sigma hv, sigma vh, and sigma vv) and six polarimetric decomposition parameters (entropy, anisotropy, alpha angle, volume scattering, odd bounce, and double bounce) were generated for each pattern. In the last stage, GRNN was used to estimate the regional soil moisture with the aid of feature vectors. The results indicated that radar is a strong remote sensing tool for soil moisture estimation, with mean absolute errors around 2.31 vol %, 2.11 vol %, and 2.10 vol % for Datasets 1-3, respectively; and 2.46 vol %, 2.70 vol %, 7.09 vol %, and 5.70 vol % on Datasets 1 & 2, 2 & 3, 1 & 3, and 1 & 2 & 3, respectively.

TI  - Using satellite-based soil moisture to detect and monitor spatiotemporal traces of agricultural drought over Bundelkhand region of India
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection and monitoring of seasonal agricultural drought at sub-regional scale is a complex theme due to inefficient spatiotemporal indicators. This study presents a new time-based function of spaceborne soil moisture as an efficient indicator. Bundelkhand of Central India, a frequently agricultural drought affected region, was used as the study area. Rabi agricultural season (October-May) being the dominant agricultural return period, was chosen as the study period. Coarse resolution soil moisture (SMc) obtained from European space agency under climate change initiative program was spatially downscaled (SMd) to meet spatial scale at sub-regional level with overall root-mean-square error under 0.065cm(3)/cm(3). Indirect validation of SMd was done using temporal impact of rainfall/dry spell on SMd and spatiotemporal impact of SMd on vegetation condition. SMd was found to agree with phenomenon as expected in natural processes and hence it was assumed to be validated. The time-based function derived from spatiotemporal SMd (FSMs) was found to be better related with fluctuations in seasonal crop yield (Y-s) at district level as compared to a similar function (FVCIs) derived using vegetation condition index (VCI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. FSMs outperformed FVCIs having better correlation coefficient (R0.8) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) than FVCIs for most of the districts. Unlike FVCIs, it also efficiently detected the lowest and highest Y-s for majority of the districts representing better association with agricultural drought. Subsequently, frequent soil moisture deficit areas were mapped by using FSMs to visualize the spatiotemporal severity of agricultural drought in the region during Rabi season.

TI  - Modelling Urban Sprawl Using Remotely Sensed Data: A Case Study of Chennai City, Tamilnadu
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl (US), propelled by rapid population growth leads to the shrinkage of productive agricultural lands and pristine forests in the suburban areas and, in turn, adversely affects the provision of ecosystem services. The quantification of US is thus crucial for effective urban planning and environmental management. Like many megacities in fast growing developing countries, Chennai, the capital of Tamilnadu and one of the business hubs in India, has experienced extensive US triggered by the doubling of total population over the past three decades. However, the extent and level of US has not yet been quantified and a prediction for future extent of US is lacking. We employed the Random Forest (RF) classification on Landsat imageries from 1991, 2003, and 2016, and computed six landscape metrics to delineate the extent of urban areas within a 10 km suburban buffer of Chennai. The level of US was then quantified using Renyi's entropy. A land change model was subsequently used to project land cover for 2027. A 70.35% expansion in urban areas was observed mainly towards the suburban periphery of Chennai between 1991 and 2016. The Renyi's entropy value for year 2016 was 0.9, exhibiting a two-fold level of US when compared to 1991. The spatial metrics values indicate that the existing urban areas became denser and the suburban agricultural, forests and particularly barren lands were transformed into fragmented urban settlements. The forecasted land cover for 2027 indicates a conversion of 13,670.33 ha (16.57% of the total landscape) of existing forests and agricultural lands into urban areas with an associated increase in the entropy value to 1.7, indicating a tremendous level of US. Our study provides useful metrics for urban planning authorities to address the social-ecological consequences of US and to protect ecosystem services.

TI  - Phenological Observations on Classical Prehistoric Sites in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yellow River Based on Landsat NDVI Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Buried archeological features show up as crop marks that are mostly visible using high-resolution image data. Such data are costly and restricted to small regions and time domains. However, a time series of freely available medium resolution imagery can be employed to detect crop growth changes to reveal subtle surface marks in large areas. This paper aims to study the classical Chinese settlements of Taosi and Erlitou over large areas using Landsat NDVI time series crop phenology to determine the optimum periods for detection and monitoring of crop anomalies. Burial areas (such as the palace area and the sacrificial area) were selected as the research area while the surrounding empty fields with a low density of ancient features were used as reference regions. Landsat NDVI covering two years' growth periods of wheat and maize were computed and analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and Euclidean distance. Similarities or disparities between the burial areas and their empty areas were computed using the Hausdorff distance. Based on the phenology of crop growth, the time series NDVI images of winter wheat and summer maize were generated to analyze crop anomalies in the archeological sites. Results show that the Hausdorff distance was high during the critical stages of water for both crops and that the images of high Hausdorff distance can provide more obvious subsurface archeological information.

TI  - An activity index for geomagnetic paleosecular variation, excursions, and reversals
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Magnetic indices provide quantitative measures of space weather phenomena that are widely used by researchers in geomagnetism. We introduce an index focused on the internally generated field that can be used to evaluate long term variations or climatology of modern and paleomagnetic secular variation, including geomagnetic excursions, polarity reversals, and changes in reversal rate. The paleosecular variation index, P-i, represents instantaneous or average deviation from a geocentric axial dipole field using normalized ratios of virtual geomagnetic pole colatitude and virtual dipole moment. The activity level of the index, sigma P-i, provides a measure of field stability through the temporal standard deviation of P-i. P-i can be calculated on a global grid from geomagnetic field models to reveal large scale geographic variations in field structure. It can be determined for individual time series, or averaged at local, regional, and global scales to detect long term changes in geomagnetic activity, identify excursions, and transitional field behavior. For recent field models, P-i ranges from less than 0.05 to 0.30. Conventional definitions for geomagnetic excursions are characterized by P-i exceeding 0.5. Strong field intensities are associated with low P-i unless they are accompanied by large deviations from axial dipole field directions. sigma P-i provides a measure of geomagnetic stability that is modulated by the level of PSV or frequency of excursional activity and reversal rate. We demonstrate uses of P-i for paleomagnetic observations and field models and show how it could be used to assess whether numerical simulations of the geodynamo exhibit Earth-like properties.

TI  - The 9p21.3 locus and cardiovascular risk in familial hypercholesterolemia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL LIPIDOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carrying a risk variant in the 9p21.3 locus represents one of the strongest genetic risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in the general population. However, the effect of these polymorphisms in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) has never been studied.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the sentinel 9p21.3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs1333047 and ASCVD susceptibility in FH subjects.METHODS: A total of 20,434 Caucasian patients with dyslipidemia were screened, of which 725 FH were included in this study. The risk allele (T) of the rs1333047 SNP has previously been shown to confer increased ASCVD risk compared with the control allele (A).RESULTS: In a model adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, carrying the risk allele was associated with a 42% increased ASCVD susceptibility per allele, according to an additive model (odds ratio = 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.91; P = .02). On average, 0.53 cardiovascular event was observed in AA carriers, compared with 0.83 in the TT group (P = .02). The mean age of first ASCVD event was similar among the 3 variants.CONCLUSION: The 9p21.3 SNP rs1333047 SNP was associated with increased ASCVD in FH subjects. Genetic screening for this SNP could allow to identify very high risk FH patients, which could benefit from more aggressive ASCVD prevention. (C) 2017 National Lipid Association. All rights reserved.

T2  - GEOGRAPHY COMPASS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is temperature of the skin surface of land, which can be derived from satellite information or direct measurements. Satellite data provide consistent, continuous, and spatially distributed information on the Earth's surface conditions. The moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer instruments installed on the Aqua and Terra Earth observation satellites from NASA, have provided MOD11A2 Product, which contains daytime and nighttime LST in 1km spatial resolution. Short-term mean (STM) has been calculated using the daytime LST (2002-2011). LST for year 2012, 2013, and 2014 has been analyzed with reference to STM. The study has been carried out for summer season (March to June) that is also called as premonsoon season. Results show that the district of Saurashtra and Ahmadabad experience high LST during summer as compared to districts of South Gujarat. LST analysis is carried out at district and taluka level for entire Gujrat state. Twenty-five districts in Gujarat state contains 179 talukas. Study aims to assess inter and intra-annual and seasonal variability in LST time series data and explores the variation in STM LST and trends in the Gujarat state. The results showed that in 2012 was normal in terms of LST for the summer season, but in the year 2013 experienced above normal or higher LST as compare to STM in almost entire Gujarat during summer season. The analysis showed that the year 2014 summer season also experienced very high LST as compare to the STM. In the year 2013, months of March, April, May, and June, LST is higher than STM in 81, 38, 139, and 43 talukas, respectively.

TI  - Microcystic, elongated, and fragmented pattern invasion is mainly associated with isolated tumor cell pattern metastases in International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade I endometrioid endometrial cancer
T2  - HUMAN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although many studies have evaluated the impact of mismatch repair protein loss of expression (MMR LOE) or microcystic, elongated, and fragmented (MELF) pattern of myometrial invasion as individual factors in endometrial cancer, we analyzed the combined impact of both. We reviewed every case of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancers (EECs) from our institution, between 2011 and 2015, that had a sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or a lymphadenectomy, and examined the following data: age, myometrial infiltration, MELF infiltration, lymphovascular space invasion, and lymph node status. These cases were then grouped according to the absence of lymph node metastases, the presence of isolated tumor cell (ITC) lymph node metastases, or the presence of non-ITC metastases. Among the 127 cases that were in our study, 105 patients did not have nodal metastases, whereas 22 patients showed metastases, of which 11 were ITC. MMR LOE was only significantly associated with a higher odds ratio (OR) of metastases (OR, 7.44; P < .001). MELF was only associated with a higher OR of ITC-pattern metastases (OR, 32.3; P < .001). This study distinguished the effects of MELF and MMR LOE on the risk of metastases in FIGO grade 1 EEC. Further research on the clinical impact of MELF and ITC-pattern metastases is warranted to better guide clinicians on the management of patients with FIGO grade 1 EEC harboring such characteristics, which are still considered low-risk cancer.

TI  - Systematic approaches to adverse events in obstetrics, Part I: Event identification and classification
T2  - SEMINARS IN PERINATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite our best intentions to improve health when a patient presents for care, adverse events are ubiquitous in medical practice today. Known complications related to the course of a patient's illness or condition or to the characteristics of the treatment have been an openly stated part of taking care of patients for centuries. However, it is only in the past decade that preventable adverse events, instances of harm related to error and deviations in accepted practice have become a primary part of these conversations. Human and system errors are an innate part of working in a complex environment like health care and we are now well aware of this burden in medicine. Now, we are building ways to react to adverse events from error in systematic ways. A systematic approach to identifying and classifying events is a critical part of any safety program, let alone an obstetric safety program. This article reviews the various systems that are used to identify adverse events, in particular sentinel events, state reportable events, and the significant local adverse "trigger" events in obstetrics. These events typically become identified through robust reporting systems where staff can report adverse, near-miss events, or precursor safety events. After events are reported, a system for classifying events, including a structured tracking and reporting system with built in accountability, is necessary. The concept of the "serious safety event," and how these differ from known complications or unpreventable events, and how this is classified are also reviewed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Local and landscape drivers of predation services in urban gardens
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In agroecosystems, local and landscape features, as well as natural enemy abundance and richness, are significant predictors of predation services that may result in biological control of pests. Despite the increasing importance of urban gardening for provisioning of food to urban populations, most urban gardeners suffer from high pest problems, and have little knowledge about how to manage their plots to increase biological control services. We examined the influence of local, garden scale (i.e., herbaceous and arboreal vegetation abundance and diversity, ground cover) and landscape (i.e., landscape diversity and surrounding land use types) characteristics on predation services provided by naturally occurring predators in 19 urban gardens in the California central coast. We introduced sentinel pests (moth eggs and larvae and pea aphids) onto greenhouse-raised plants taken to gardens and assigned to open or bagged (predator exclosure) treatments. We found high predation rates with between 40% and 90% of prey items removed in open treatments. Predation services varied with local and landscape factors, but significant predictors differed by prey species. Predation of eggs and aphids increased with vegetation complexity in gardens, but larvae predation declined with vegetation complexity. Smaller gardens experienced higher predation services, likely due to increases in predator abundance in smaller gardens. Several ground cover features influenced predation services. In contrast to patterns in rural agricultural landscapes, predation on aphids declined with increases in landscape diversity. In sum, we report the relationships between several local management factors, as well as landscape surroundings, and implications for garden management.

TI  - Axillary Nodal Management Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy A Review
T2  - JAMA ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - IMPORTANCE The increasing use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for operable breast cancer has raised questions about optimal local therapy for the axilla.OBSERVATIONS Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NAC in patients presenting with clinically negative nodes has an accuracy similar to upfront SLNB and reduces the need for axillary lymph node dissection compared with SLNB prior to NAC. In patients presenting with node-positive disease, clinical trials demonstrate that SLNB after NAC is accurate when 3 or more sentinel nodes are obtained, but long-term outcomes are lacking. The relative importance of pre-and post-NAC stage in predicting risk of locoregional recurrence remains an area of controversy.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Neoadjuvant chemotherapy reduces the need for axillary lymph node dissection, and SLNB is an accurate method of determining nodal status after NAC.

TI  - Retrieval of cloud ice water path using SAPHIR on board Megha-Tropiques over the tropical ocean
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The SAPHIR sensor onboard Megha-Tropiques (MT) measures the earth emitted radiation at frequencies near the water vapor absorption band. SAPHIR operates in six frequencies ranging from 183 +/- 0.1 to 183 +/- 11 GHz. These frequencies have been used to retrieve cloud ice water path (IWP) at a very high resolution. A method to retrieve IWP over the Indian ocean region is attempted in this study. The study is in two parts, in first part a radiative transfer based simulation is carried out to give an insight of using SAPHIR frequency channels for IWP retrieval, in the next part the real observations of SAPHIR and TRMM-TMI was used for IWP retrieval. The concurrent observations of SAPHIR brightness temperatures (Tbs) and TRMM TMI IWP were used in the development of the retrieval algorithm. An Eigen Vector analysis was done to identify weight of each channel in retrieving IWP; following this a two channel regression based algorithm was developed. The SAPHIR channels which are away from the water vapor absorption band were used to avoid possible water vapor contamination. When the retrieval is compared with independent test dataset, it gives a correlation of 0.80 and RMSE of 3.5%. SAPHIR derived IWP has been compared with other available global IWP products such as TMI, MSPPS, Cloud Sat and GPM-GMI qualitatively as well as quantitatively. PDF comparison of SAPHIR derived IWP found to have good agreement with CloudSat. Zonal mean comparison with recently launched GMI shows the strength of this algorithm. (C) 2017 COSPAR.

TI  - Preoperative MRI Evaluation of Axillary Lymph Nodes in Invasive Ductal Carcinoma: Comparison of Luminal A Versus Luminal B Subtypes in a Paradigm Using Ki-67 and Receptor Status
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to assess whether luminal A versus luminal B molecular subtypes of breast cancer affect the diagnostic utility of preoperative MRI evaluation of the axilla.MATERIALS AND METHODS. This study identified 125 patients who underwent preoperative breast MRI evaluation of tumors classifiable as luminal A or luminal B molecular subtypes between January 2012 and August 2014. The subtypes were classified on the basis of immunohistochemical staining surrogates combining receptor status and the Ki-67 proliferation index. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square analysis and one-way ANOVA. When a statistically significant difference was found, follow-up analysis involving pairwise comparison using the Bonferroni correction was performed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was also used to determine whether the molecular subtype was independently predictive of lymph node involvement.RESULTS. A total of 80 patients had tumors classifiable as the luminal A molecular subtype, whereas 45 patients had tumors classifiable as the luminal B subtype. Pathologically proven axillary lymph node (ALN) disease occurred statistically significantly more frequently in luminal B tumors (18/45 [40.0%]) than in luminal A tumors (11/80 [13.8%]; p < 0.01). In addition, pathologically proven ALN disease was 4.3 times more likely to occur in luminal B tumors after controlling for patient age, tumor size, and tumor grade (p < 0.01). We found no difference in the negative predictive value of the MRI assessment of the axilla when luminal A tumors were compared with luminal B tumors. The positive predictive value of MRI evaluation of ALNs is statistically significantly higher for luminal B tumors than for luminal A tumors (76.2% vs 28.0%, respectively; p = 0.004).CONCLUSION. With the use of molecular subtype classification including the Ki-67 proliferation index, suspicious nodes detected in luminal B tumors by MRI are likely to have positive findings and warrant preoperative tissue sampling. Conversely, in view of the high falsepositive rate of suspicious nodes detected in luminal A tumors by MRI, proceeding straight to sentinel lymph node biopsy for all cases, except for those with highly suspicious findings, is suggested. These results should, however, be validated in a larger prospective study.

TI  - Evaluating the performance of remotely sensed and reanalysed precipitation data over West Africa using HBV light
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is a crucial resource in West Africa, where large parts of the population rely on rainfed agriculture. Therefore, accurate knowledge of the water resources is of the utmost importance. Due to the declining number of rain gauging stations, the use of satellite and reanalysis precipitation datasets in hydrological modelling is steadily rising. However, accurate information on the benefits and deficits of these datasets is often lacking, especially in the West African subcontinent. For validation purposes, these products are commonly compared to freely available rain gauge data, which has in some cases already been used to bias correct the products in the first place. We therefore explored the possibility of a hydrological evaluation, where a model is calibrated for each dataset using streamflow as the observed variable. In this study, ten freely available satellite and reanalysis datasets (CFSR, CHIRPS, CMORPHv1.0 CRT, CMORPHv1.0 RAW, PERSIANN CDR, RFE 2.0, TAMSAT, TMPA 3B42v7, TMPA 3B42 RTv7 and GPCC FDDvl) were thus evaluated for six differently sized and located basins in West Africa. Results show that while performances differ, most datasets manage to somewhat accurately predict the observed stream flow in a given basin. Best results were achieved by datasets which use a multitude of input data, namely infrared and microwave satellite data, as well as observations from rain gauges (usually GPCC) for bias correction. If considering only the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency averaged for all six basins during the calibration phase, best results were achieved by CMORPH CRT and PERSIANN CDR (both 0.66), followed by TAMSAT, CHIRPS and TMPA 3B42 (all three 0.64). Average results were achieved by RFE 2.0 (0.63), GPCC (0.61) and TMPA 3B42 RT (0.54). CMORPH RAW and CFSR performed worst (0.36 and -0.34 on average). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Community review of Southern Ocean satellite data needs
T2  - ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - This review represents the Southern Ocean community's satellite data needs for the coming decade. Developed through widespread engagement and incorporating perspectives from a range of stakeholders (both research and operational), it is designed as an important community-driven strategy paper that provides the rationale and information required for future planning and investment. The Southern Ocean is vast but globally connected, and the communities that require satellite-derived data in the region are diverse. This review includes many observable variables, including sea ice properties, sea surface temperature, sea surface height, atmospheric parameters, marine biology (both micro and macro) and related activities, terrestrial cryospheric connections, sea surface salinity, and a discussion of coincident and in situ data collection. Recommendations include commitment to data continuity, increases in particular capabilities (sensor types, spatial, temporal), improvements in dissemination of data/products/uncertainties, and innovation in calibration/validation capabilities. Full recommendations are detailed by variable as well as summarized. This review provides a starting point for scientists to understand more about Southern Ocean processes and their global roles, for funders to understand the desires of the community, for commercial operators to safely conduct their activities in the Southern Ocean, and for space agencies to gain greater impact from Southern Ocean-related acquisitions and missions.

TI  - Evaluating mangroves of Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary in relation to the general status of mangroves in Andhra Pradesh, India
T2  - International Journal of Environmental Studies
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was carried out to check whether there is a decline in mangrove cover of Andhra Pradesh state, India, as cited by a few studies. The research analysed mangrove dynamics of Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary of Andhra Pradesh state, using temporal satellite data of six periods. Analysis of these data showed major changes in the mangrove areas of the sanctuary. In 1972, the mangrove cover was 82.76km(2), which then decreased to 80.47km(2) in 1981, and then further dropped to 69.52km(2) in 1990. Comparatively an area of 13.22km(2) was lost from 1972 to 1990. The area recorded in 2000 was 101.98km(2) and the positive trend of increase in mangrove areas was observed in both 2009 (138.36km(2)) and in 2014 (158.16km(2)). Overall, an increase of 88.64km(2) mangrove area was observed from 1990 to 2014. The study confirms the increase in mangrove cover in the state, disagreeing with the observations of decrease in mangrove cover made by other studies previously.

TI  - Applications of Imaging Spectrometry in Inland Water Quality Monitoring-a Review of Recent Developments
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Inland waters represent complex and highly variable ecosystems, which are also of immense recreational and economic values to humans. The maintenance of high quality of inland water status necessitates development of means for rapid quality monitoring. Imaging spectrometry techniques are proven technology that can provide useful information for the estimation of inland water quality attributes due to fast speed, noninvasiveness, ease of use, and in situ operation. Although there have been many studies conducted on the use of imaging spectrometry for marine water quality monitoring and assessment, relatively few studies have considered inland water bodies. The aim of this review is to present an overview of imaging spectrometry technologies for the monitoring of inland waters including spaceborne and airborne and field or ground-based hyperspectral systems. Some viewpoints on the current situation and suggestions for future research directions are also proposed.

TI  - Rainfall Extremes: a Novel Modeling Approach for Regionalization
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rainfall events of extreme magnitude over the past few decades have caused destructive damages to lives and properties, especially in the subcontinent (e. g. Pakistan, India, Bangladesh etc). Rainfall hazard maps for these areas can be of great practical and theoretical interests. In our work, we used extreme value analysis and spatial interpolation techniques to provide such maps through a combination of the Tropical Rainfall MeasuringMission Precipitation (TRMM) 3B42 product and raingauge data. This mixed approach takes advantage of both the long time series available at a limited number of stations, and the large spatial coverage of the satellite data which, instead, has a poor temporal extent. The methodology is implemented by (1) creating a unique growth curve for the homogeneous region by utilizing in- situ rainfall data and (2) mapping the parameters of intensity- duration functions for the entire length of the study area by using TRMM 3B42 product. The regional results obtained by using mixed approach and TRMM 3B42 are compared with the estimates obtained by using in-situ data. The comparison showed that the overall output of mixed approach is more consistent with what transpired by in-situ data for a predefined return period.

TI  - Multi-decadal land cover evolution in the Sundarban, the largest mangrove forest in the world
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Having one of the most vulnerable coasts of the world to climate change, Bangladesh and India are facing new challenges to protect Sundarban, the largest mangrove in the world, from adverse impacts of climate-driven changes. In this study, unsupervised classification of mangrove density is performed on Landsat images of folk time periods over 35 years (1975-77, 1989, 2000 and 2010) to identify the spatiotemporal evolution of the Sundarban mangrove, and infer the causes of observed changes. Specifically the influences of environmental and anthropogenic drivers on these changes are discriminated by correlating the observed change patterns with cyclones' tracks, erosion processes and areas of expected human influences as assessed by local stakeholders. Results highlight a very dynamic systerh, with rapid changes characterized by decreasing mangrove density, mainly in India, erosion and accretion. There is similar to 1.2% (or 11,500 ha) net erosion in 35 years in Sundarban, which remains limited relative to the documented high rate of sea level rise of 6 mm/yr. Mangrove density changes are attributed to cyclones, increased salinity and anthropogenic influences. Based on interpretation of the spatial pattern of density changes by local stakeholders, we conclude that the zones accessible to human activities are significantly more affected by land cover changes. Management policies of Sundarban by Bangladeshi and Indian authorities should acknowledge the important role played by natural or global drivers like sea level change, cyclones in affecting the mangrove as well as manage the localized anthropogenic pressures.

TI  - Using local language syndromic terminology in participatory epidemiology: Lessons for One Health practitioners among the Maasai of Ngorongoro, Tanzania
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pastoralists and agro-pastoralists often occupy remote and hostile environments, which lack infrastructure and capacity in human and veterinary healthcare and disease surveillance systems. Participatory epidemiology (PE) and Participatory Disease Surveillance (PDS) are particularly useful in situations of resource scarcity, where conventional diagnostics and surveillance data of disease prevalence may be intermittent or limited. Livestock keepers, when participating in PE studies about health issues, commonly use their local language terms, which are often syndromic and descriptive in nature. Practitioners of PE recommend confirmation of their findings with triangulation including biomedical diagnostic techniques. However, the latter is not practiced in all studies, usually due to time, financial or logistical constraints. A cross sectional study was undertaken with the Maasai of Ngorongoro District, Tanzania. It aimed to identify the terms used to describe the infectious diseases of livestock and humans with the greatest perceived impact on livelihoods. Furthermore, it aimed to characterise the usefulness and limitations of relying on local terminology when conducting PE studies in which diagnoses were not confirmed. Semi-structured interviews were held with 23 small groups, totalling 117 community members within five villages across the district. In addition, informal discussions and field observations were conducted with village elders, district veterinary and medical officers, meat inspectors and livestock field officers. For human conditions including zoonoses, several biomedical terms are now part of the common language. Conversely, livestock conditions are described using local Maasai terms, usually associated with the signs observed by the livestock keeper. Several of these descriptive, syndromic terms are used inconsistently and showed temporal and spatial variations. This study highlights the complexity and ambiguity which may exist in local terminology when used in PE studies. It emphases the need for further analysis of such findings, including laboratory diagnosis where possible to improve specificity before incorporating them into PDS or disease control interventions.

TI  - Lymph Node Ratio in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Era: Are We Losing Prognostic Information?
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node ratio (LNR) is considered to have prognostic significance in patients with solid tumors. To better understand its application, we reviewed 553 patients with node-positive early-stage breast cancer (EBC), concentrating on clinical, pathologic, treatment, and outcome data.Background: The number of involved axillary lymph nodes (LNs) found pathologically is regarded as a significant prognostic factor in early-stage breast cancer (EBC). Recently, there is speculation that LN ratio (LNR) may be a better surrogate at predicting cancer-specific outcome than number of involved LNs. This study investigated prognostic value of LNR, using predetermined cutoff values. Methods: Data included all women diagnosed with node-positive EBC between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2010 (N = 553). Retrospective evaluation for clinical, demographic, and pathologic data was performed. Most had axillary node clearance (ANC) (548/553; 99.1 %). Cohorts were divided by LNR risk groups (low: <= 0.20; intermediate: 0.21-0.65; high: >0.65). Proportional hazard modeling was undertaken to evaluate whether LNR was associated with overall survival (OS). Results: Median follow-up was 59.8 months. LNR distribution was as follows: low, 303/553 (54.8%); intermediate, 160/553 (28.9%); high, 90/553 (16.3%). Kaplan-Meier estimates for OS were stratified by LNR: low-risk group had better outcome for OS (P <.001). Overall 5 and 10-year OS was 63% and 58%, respectively. Number of positive LNs correlated with 10-year OS (66%, 48%, and 48% for patients with N1, N2, and N3 stage, respectively; P < .001). LNR also correlated with 5-year OS (69%, 48%, and 41% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively; P < .001). Significantly, LNR on multivariate analysis also formed a prognostic model when combined with age, estrogen receptor status, PgR status and, HER2 status (P < .001). Conclusion: The Findings support LNR as a predictor for OS in EBC. LNR should be considered an independent prognostic variable to current prognostic instruments already in use. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Friar Francisco Ximenez and the <i>Popol Vuh</i>: From Religious Treatise to a Digital Sacred Book
T2  - ETHNOHISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Popol Vuh represents the most studied indigenous text of Mesoamerica, with its breadth of detail concerning Maya worldview, religion, cosmology, and society. Regarded as an ethnohistorical treasure, this narrative has been read exclusively as a freestanding, self-contained text to inquire into a history far removed from when it was actually created. Consequently, the colonial context of the text itself has been omitted, including the central role of Dominican friar Francisco Ximenez as transcriber and translator of the only available copy. This article reframes the Popol Vuh within its historical and physical ecclesiastic context, recovering Friar Ximenez's voice within his manuscript. It is argued that his work was first and foremost intended to be a religious treatise to carry out the conversion of the K'iche' to Christianity. This study offers an alternative, holistic understanding of Friar Ximenez's manuscript by tracing two historical moments that contributed to the transformation of the Popol Vuh narrative from a religious treatise into what it is now in the prevailing view, an ancient text or "sacred book."

TI  - Extraction and analysis of geological lineaments of Kolli hills, Tamil Nadu: a study using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study is to investigate the lineaments of Kolli hills of Tamil Nadu State for which CARTOSAT-1 satellite's DEM output has been made use of. The extracted lineaments were analysed using ArcGIS and Rockworks software. The total number and length of lineaments are 523 and 943.81 km, respectively. Shorter lineaments constitute about 3/4th of the total number of lineaments. The density of the lineaments varies from 0 to 7.41 km/km(2), and areas of very high to high density are restricted to the south central, central and north eastern parts, and these areas reflect the high degree of rock fracturing and shearing which makes these areas unsuitable for the construction of dams and reservoirs. However, these areas could be targeted for groundwater exploitation as they possess higher groundwater potential. The lineaments are oriented in diverse directions. However, those orienting in ENEWSW, NE-SW and NW-SE are predominating followed by those oriented in sub E-W and sub N-S directions. These orientations corroborate with results of previous regional studies and with orientations of prominent geological structures and features of the study area. Distinct variation in the predominant orientations of lineaments of varied sizes is observed, while the shorter ones are oriented in either NW-SE or NNW-SSE directions, the longer ones are oriented in either NE-SW or ENE-WSW. A comparative analysis of lineament datasets of the eight azimuth angles and the final lineament map underlines the need to extract lineaments from various azimuth angles to get a reliable picture about the lineaments.

TI  - Mapping drought-impacted vegetation stress in California using remote sensing
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent droughts and the profound effects they have on ecosystems, agriculture, and forests in California highlighted a critical need to understand drought impacts and develop remote sensing-based methods for drought monitoring. The objectives of this work were to evaluate drought-affected areas of northern and central California using remote sensing and aid in drought mitigation and prediction efforts for sustainable forest resource management and planning. Remote sensing provides direct measurement of spectral properties at moderate spatial resolution (30m with Landsat) as compared to modeled environmental variables at 800m spatial resolution, scaled to 270m. Modified Perpendicular Drought Index derived from Landsat data and long term Climatic Water Deficit (CWD) data for the year 2014 were analyzed. MPDI was strongly correlated with CWD, precipitation and temperature data for various forest types with coefficient of determination in the range of 0.60-0.80. Our results demonstrate that MPDI is an effective and direct method to monitor vegetation stress and forest declines at landscape scale, thereby providing land managers and stakeholders guidance in forest management and planning.

TI  - Assessment of MERRA-2 Land Surface Hydrology Estimates
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The MERRA-2 atmospheric reanalysis product provides global, 1-hourly estimates of land surface conditions for 1980-present at similar to 50-km resolution. MERRA-2 uses observations-based precipitation to force the land (unlike its predecessor, MERRA). This paper evaluates MERRA-2 and MERRA land hydrology estimates, along with those of the land-only MERRA-L and and ERA-Interim/Land products, which also use observations-based precipitation. Overall, MERRA-2 land hydrology estimates are better than those of MERRA-Land and MERRA. A comparison against GRACE satellite observations of terrestrial water storage demonstrates clear improvements in MERRA-2 over MERRA in South America and Africa but also reflects known errors in the observations used to correct the MERRA-2 precipitation. Validation against in situ measurements from 220-320 stations in North America, Europe, and Australia shows that MERRA-2 and MERRA-Land have the highest surface and root zone soil moisture skill, slightly higher than that of ERA-Interim/Land and higher than that of MERRA (significantly for surface soil moisture). Snow amounts from MERRA-2 have lower bias and correlate better against reference data from the Canadian Meteorological Centre than do those of MERRA-Land and MERRA, with MERRA-2 skill roughly matching that of ERA-Interim/Land. Validation with MODIS satellite observations shows that MERRA-2 has a lower snow cover probability of detection and probability of false detection than MERRA, owing partly to MERRA-2's lower midwinter, midlatitude snow amounts and partly to MERRA-2's revised snow depletion curve parameter compared to MERRA. Finally, seasonal anomaly R values against naturalized streamflow measurements in the United States are, on balance, highest for MERRA-2 and ERA-Interim/Land, somewhat lower for MERRA-Land, and lower still for MERRA (significantly in four basins).

TI  - IRONY AND COGNITIVE EMPATHY IN CHRETIEN DE TROYES'S GETTIER PROBLEM
T2  - PHILOSOPHY AND LITERATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Irony often separates a work's author (or reader) from its characters. But irony can also engage our universal, adaptive capacity for perspective taking. In his twelfth-century romance Cliges, Chretien de Troyes creates such an irony. Though medieval, it takes the form of a Gettier problem, a thought experiment from twentieth-century epistemology. Read closely, this irony can pump our intuition that we share the characters' ignorance. This intuition allows us to empathize with them, not emotionally but cognitively, taking on their worldview and realizing that we know things, or not, just as they do.

TI  - Assessing plant senescence reflectance index-retrieved vegetation phenology and its spatiotemporal response to climate change in the Inner Mongolian Grassland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant phenology is a key link for controlling interactions between climate change and biogeochemical cycles. Satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been extensively used to detect plant phenology at regional scales. Here, we introduced a new vegetation index, plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI), and determined PSRI-derived start (SOS) and end (EOS) dates of the growing season using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data from 2000 to 2011 in the Inner Mongolian Grassland. Then, we validated the reliability of PSRI-derived SOS and EOS dates using NDVI-derived SOS and EOS dates. Moreover, we conducted temporal and spatial correlation analyses between PSRI-derived SOS/EOS date and climatic factors and revealed spatiotemporal patterns of PSRI-derived SOS and EOS dates across the entire research region at pixel scales. Results show that PSRI has similar performance with NDVI in extracting SOS and EOS dates in the Inner Mongolian Grassland. Precipitation regime is the key climate driver of interannual variation of grassland phenology, while temperature and precipitation regimes are the crucial controlling factors of spatial differentiation of grassland phenology. Thus, PSRI-derived vegetation phenology can effectively reflect land surface vegetation dynamics and its response to climate change. Moreover, a significant linear trend of PSRI-derived SOS and EOS dates was detected only at small portions of pixels, which is consistent with that of greenup and brownoff dates of herbaceous plant species in the Inner Mongolian Grassland. Overall, PSRI is a useful and robust metric in addition to NDVI for monitoring land surface grassland phenology.

TI  - Soil Erosion Assessment in Tasik Chini Catchment using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques
T2  - SAINS MALAYSIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Over many years, forested land transformation into urban, agriculture and mining areas within Tasik Chini Catchment become more intense. These activities have negatively affected the catchment through soil erosion and increased the amount of sediments that deposited into the lake. Hence, the present study aimed to estimate soil erosion risk within Tasik Chini Catchment integrating the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and remotely sensed geospatial data. The multispectral imagery from LANDSAT 8 was used to provide up to date information on land cover within the catchment. The result shows the majority of Tasik Chini Catchment is classified at very low class (< 10 ton ha(-1) yr(-1)) about 4835.34 ha (92.38%), followed by the low class (10-50 ton ha(-1) yr(-1)) with total area of 175.47 ha (3.35%), moderate high class (50-100 ton ha(-1) yr(-1)) with total area of 65.11 ha (1.24%), high class (100-150 ton ha(-1) yr(-1)) with total area of 38.37 ha (0.73%) and very high class (> 150 ton ha-1 yr(-1)) with total area of 120.04 ha (2.30%). Tasik Chini Catchment is very susceptible to soil erosion especially on northwest and southeast regions, where the main sources of soil loss come from the agricultural, new settlements and mining activities. To conclude, the estimation of soil erosion model using remotely sensed data can be used to build sustainable development strategy within Tasik Chini Catchment in the future.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To assess whether, during a 2012 pertussis outbreak, unvaccinated and poorly vaccinated cases occurred earlier on a community level.Study design Pediatric pertussis among children 2 months to 10 years of age in the Oregon Sentinel Surveillance region during an epidemic starting at the beginning of 2012 were stratified by immunization status, age, zip code, and calendar date of disease onset. Differences in median onset as days between fully or mostly vaccinated, poorly vaccinated, and unvaccinated cases were examined overall and within local zip code areas. Disease clusters also were examined using SatScan analysis.Results Overall, 351 pertussis cases occurred among children aged 2 months to 10 years of age residing in 72 distinct zipcodes. Among unvaccinated or poorly vaccinated cases, their median date of onset was at calendar day 117 (April 26, 2012), whereas for those who were fully or mostly vaccinated the median date of onset was 41 days later, at day 158 (June 6, 2012). Within each local zip code area, the unvaccinated cases were 3.2 times more likely than vaccinated cases to have earlier median dates of onset (95% CI 2.9-3.6).Conclusion In this outbreak, pertussis cases among unvaccinated children represented an earlier spread of disease across local areas. Controlling outbreaks may require attention to the composition and location of the unvaccinated.

TI  - Transferability of multi- and hyperspectral optical biocrust indices
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are communities of cyanobacteria, algae, microfungi, lichens and bryophytes in varying proportions, which live within or immediately on top of the uppermost millimeters of the soil in arid and semiarid regions. As biocrusts are highly relevant for ecosystem processes like carbon, nitrogen, and water cycling, a correct characterization of their spatial distribution is required. Following this objective, considerable efforts have been devoted to the identification and mapping of biocrusts using remote sensing data, and several mapping indices have been developed. However, their transferability to different regions has only rarely been tested. In this study we investigated the transferability of two multispectral indices, i.e. the Crust Index (CI) and the Biological Soil Crust Index (BSCI), and two hyperspectral indices, i.e. the Continuum Removal Crust Identification Algorithm (CRCIA) and the Crust Development Index (CDI), in three sites dominated by biocrusts, but with differences in soil and vegetation composition. Whereas multispectral indices have been important and valuable tools for first approaches to map and classify biological soil crusts, hyperspectral data and indices developed for these allowed to classify biocrusts at much higher accuracy. While multispectral indices showed Kappa (kappa) values below 0.6, hyperspectral indices obtained good classification accuracy (kappa similar to 0.8) in both the study area where they had been developed and in the newly tested region. These results highlight the capability of hyperspectral sensors to identify specific absorption features related to photosynthetic pigments as chlorophyll and carotenoids, but also the limitation of multispectral information to discriminate between areas dominated by biocrusts, vegetation or bare soil. Based on these results we conclude that remote sensing offers an important and valid tool to map biocrusts. However, the spectral similarity between the main surface components of drylands and biocrusts demand for mapping indices based on hyperspectral information to correctly map areas dominated by biocrusts at ecosystem scale.

AB  - BACKGROUND Oropouche virus causes Oropouche fever, an arboviral disease transmitted mainly by midges of the genus Culicoides and Culex mosquitoes. Clinical presentation of Oropouche fever in humans includes fever, headache, rash, myalgia, and in rare cases spontaneous bleeding and aseptic meningitis. Landscape change has been proposed as a driver of Oropouche fever emergence.OBJECTIVE To investigate the landscape epidemiology of the Oropouche fever outbreak that began in April 2016 in Cusco, Peru.METHODS We used information of vegetation and multivariate spatial analyses including ecological niche modeling. Vegetation was characterised using16-day composite enhanced vegetation index (EVI) images at 500 m spatial resolution from the MODIS sensor carried by the Terra satellite.FINDINGS Cases were distributed across seven Peruvian districts in two provinces. La Concepcion was the province with most of the affected districts. EVI time series across 2000 to 2016 suggested a decline in the vegetation in sites with Oropouche fever cases before the epidemic. Our ecological niche modeling suggests that other areas in Junin, Apurimac, and Madre de Dios departments are at risk of Oropouche fever occurrence.MAIN CONCLUSIONS Our results may provide a guide for future fieldwork to test hypotheses regarding Oropouche fever emergence and habitat loss in tropical Latin America.

T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) is one of the key factors determining the ecosystem functions in a basin. In this paper, the NPP of Guangxi Xijiang River basin was estimated by applying a model of Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) with the time series data sets of MODIS, vegetation and meteorological data collected for the period from 2003 to 2012. Then the spatial and temporal patterns of NPP and its influencing factors were analyzed. The results indicated that: (1) the average annual NPP value from 2003 to 2012 in this basin was 524.67 g C . m(-2) . a(-1). The high NPP values were mainly concentrated in the south and east while the low values in the central part. From the perspective of terrain, the areas in the valley plain had lower values of NPP but those areas in the hilly region had higher values. The NPP exhibited a significant variation among vegetation types. The evergreen broad. leaf forest was the most productive with a NPP value of 788 g C . m(-2) . a(-1), and the planting crop the least productive with a NPP value of 386 g C . m(-2) . a(-1) ; (2) The average annual NPP value in this study area was in the range of 430.05-602.48 g C . m(-2) . a(-1) from 2003 to 2012. Generally, NPP value exhibited a fluctuating and descending trend. In 88.89% of total study area, the NPP showed a decreasing trend. The NPP value was high from July to October and low from January to March. (3) The NPP was negatively correlated with annual average precipitation but positively correlated with annual average temperature. The correlation between NPP and meteorological elements (precipitation and temperature) was significant, with a multiple correlation coefficient value of 0.67.

T2  - CLINICAL SPINE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Design: Retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 2005-2011.Objective: To identify trends in procedural volume and rates in the time period surrounding publication of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the utility of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.Summary of Background Data: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are frequently performed for vertebral compression fractures. Several RCTs have been published with conflicting outcomes regarding pain and quality of life compared with nonsurgical management and sham procedures. Four RCTs with discordant results were published in 2009.Materials and Methods: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample provided longitudinal, retrospective data on United States' inpatients between 2005 and 2011. Inclusion was determined by a principal or secondary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code of 81.65 (percutaneous vertebroplasty) or 81.66 (percutaneous vertebral augmentation; "kyphoplasty"). No diagnoses were excluded. Years were stratified as "pre" (2005-2008) and "post" (2010-2011) in relation to the 4 RCTs published in 2009. Patient, hospital, and admission characteristics were compared using Pearson w 2 test.Results: The estimated annual inpatient procedures performed decreased from 54,833 to 39,832 in the pre and post periods, respectively. The procedural rate for fractures decreased from 20.1% to 14.7% (P<0.0001). Patient and hospital demographics did not change considerably between the time periods. In the post period, weekend admissions increased (34.2% vs. 12.4%, P<0.0001), elective admissions decreased (21.4% vs. 40.0%, P<0.0001), routine discharge decreased (33.0% vs. 52.1%, P<0.0001), and encounters with Z3 Elixhauser comorbidities increased (54.5% vs. 39.1%, P<0.0001).Conclusions: The absolute rate of inpatient vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures for fractures decreased 5% in the period (2010-2011) following the publication of 4 RCTs in 2009. The proportion of elective admissions and routine discharges decreased, possibly indicating a population with greater disease severity. Although our analysis cannot demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship, the decreased inpatient volume and procedural rates surrounding the publication of sentinel negative RCTs is clearly observed.

TI  - Application of remote sensing technologies in detecting prehistoric canals of the Hohokam Period (AD 450-1450) in the Middle Gila River Valley, Arizona
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper summarizes research on the potential of high-resolution imagery downloaded from Google Earth Pro to detect prehistoric canals from the Hohokam Period in the Middle Gila River Valley, Arizona. The potential of the imagery to identify obscured features was evaluated by means of ground truthing reconnaissance as well as a comparative analysis of the Google Earth imagery with the more traditionally employed CORONA and Landsat ETM+ imagery used in analogous studies. This research is presented as a method-based solution to utilize remote sensing in exploratory archaeological research projects facing budget constraints. The conclusion of the research was that Google Earth imagery provided the best spatial resolution for detecting obscured irrigation features compared to the other imagery used. The results of the investigation are summarized as a potential research model applicable in other dryland settings.

TI  - Multicenter prospective evaluation of the reliability of the combined use of two models to predict non-sentinel lymph node status in breast cancer patients with metastatic sentinel lymph nodes: the MSKCC nomogram and the Tenon score. Results of the NOTEGS study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the combined use of The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram and Tenon score to select, in patients with metastatic sentinel lymph node (SN), those at low risk of metastatic non-SN for whom additional axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) could be avoided.Methods: From January 2011 to July 2012, a prospective non-interventional nationwide study was conducted (NCT01509963). We sought to identify the false reassurance rate (FRR, a negative test result is false) in patients with both a <= 10% probability of metastatic non-SN with the MSKCC nomogram and a Tenon score <= 3.5 (low risk): the proportion of patients with metastatic non-SN at additional ALND. Our hypothesis was that these patients would have a FRR <= 5%.Results: Data on 2822 patients with breast cancer from 53 institutions were prospectively recorded. At least one SN was metastatic (isolated tumour cells, micro-or macrometastases) in 696 patients (24.7%). Among patients with ALND and complete data to calculate combined risk (n = 504), 67 and 437 patients had low and high combined risk, respectively. Patients at low risk had less ALND (47%) compared to patients at high risk (P<0.001). This study did not meet its primary objective because the FRR in patients with low risk was 16.4% (11 out of 67) (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.7-23.1%). In the high-risk group, 33.9% (148 out of 437) (95% CI: 29.6-38.4%) had non-SN metastases (P = 0.004).Conclusions: In this controlled prospective study, metastatic SN patients with both a <= 10% probability of metastatic non-SN with the MSKCC nomogram and a Tenon score <= 3.5 failed to identify patients at low risk of metastatic non-SN when completion ALND was not systematic.

TI  - The Dynamics of Deforestation in the Wet and Dry Tropics: A Comparison with Policy Implications
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests in the dry tropics differ significantly from forests in the humid tropics in their biomass and in their socio-ecological contexts, so it might be reasonable to assume that the dynamics that drive deforestation in these two settings would also differ. Until recently, difficulties in measuring the extent of dry tropical forests have made it difficult to investigate this claim empirically. The release of high resolution LANDSAT satellite imagery in 2013 has removed this impediment, making it possible to identify variations in the extent of wet and dry forests within countries by measuring variations in the canopy cover of their forests. These metrics have in turn made it possible to investigate human differences in the dynamics of deforestation between dry forested and wet forested nations in the tropics. Cross-national analyses suggest that international trade in agricultural commodities plays a more important role in driving deforestation in the wet tropics than it does in the dry tropics. The variable salience of international trade as a driver has important implications, described here, for the success of policies designed to slow deforestation in the dry tropics and the wet tropics. Curbing dry forest losses, in particular, would appear to require locally focused and administered policies.

TI  - Population pressure and global markets drive a decade of forest cover change in Africa's Albertine Rift
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Africa's Albertine Rift region faces a juxtaposition of rapid human population growth and protected areas, making it one of the world's most vulnerable biodiversity hotspots. Using satellite-derived estimates of forest cover change, we examined national socioeconomic, demographic, agricultural production, and local demographic and geographic variables, to assess multilevel forces driving local forest cover loss and gain outside protected areas during the first decade of this century. Because the processes that drive forest cover loss and gain are expected to be different, and both are of interest, we constructed models of significant change in each direction. Although rates of forest cover change varied by country, national population change was the strongest driver of forest loss for all countries with a population doubling predicted to cause 2.06% annual cover loss, while doubling tea production predicted to cause 1.90%. The rate of forest cover gain was associated positively with increased production of the local staple crop cassava, but negatively with local population density and meat production, suggesting production drivers at multiple levels affect reforestation. We found a small but significant decrease in loss rate as distance from protected areas increased, supporting studies suggesting higher rates of landscape change near protected areas. While local population density mitigated the rate of forest cover gain, loss was also correlated with lower local population density, an apparent paradox, but consistent with findings that larger scale forces outweigh local drivers of deforestation. This implicates demographic and market forces at national and international scales as critical drivers of change, calling into question the necessary scales of forest protection policy in this biodiversity hotspot. Using a satellite derived estimate of forest cover change for both loss and gain added a dynamic component to more traditionally static and unidirectional studies, significantly improving our understanding of landscape processes and drivers at work.

TI  - The pitfalls in cytology diagnosis of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of lung and their treatment response
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Lung is the most common site of small cell carcinoma (SCLC) - a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (PDNEC). SCLC comprises 15-20% of the invasive cancers of the lung.Aim: This study was conducted to appraise the accuracy and pitfalls of the diagnosis of PDNEC on cytology along with treatment responses if available.Settings and Design: Retrospective study for 2 years yielded 21 cases on cytology.Subjects and Methods: Slides of fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes, the tumor, bronchial brush, and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were used. The histological correlation was obtained as were treatment responses.Results: Eighteen SCLCs were confirmed on review. Of these, 13 initial reports were concordant and five, discordant. The rest three cases which initially reported as SCLC were found to be negative (2) and combined SCLC (1). One SCLC with concordant initial and reviewed diagnoses failed to confirm on histopathology. The patients, all heavy smokers, were predominantly males in the seventh to eighth decade age group. The sensitivity and specificity of reviewed diagnoses were better than that of the original. The difference between histopathology and cytology diagnoses (reviewed and original) was statistically insignificant. All patients were categorized as "extensive stage" by positron emission tomography-computerized tomography, and five were treated with etoposide and cisplatin with/without radiotherapy.Conclusion: Age group (61-70) and gender (males) distribution were statistically significant. Intermediate variants of SCLC may be misdiagnosed as adenocarcinoma. Similarly, combined SCLC may be missed on cytology if the observer does not sustain a high index of suspicion. Unequivocal cytology diagnosis opposed to negative histopathology report demands repeat biopsy.

TI  - Management of non-visualization following dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy for squamous cell carcinoma of the penis
T2  - BJU INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo review the management and clinical outcomes of uni- or bilateral non-visualization of inguinal lymph nodes during dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (DSNB) in patients diagnosed with penile cancer and clinically impalpable inguinal lymph nodes (cN0), and to develop an algorithm for the management of patients in which non-visualization occurs.Patients and MethodsThis is a retrospective observational study over a period of 4 years, comprising 166 patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma undergoing DSNB and followed up for a minimum of 6 months. All cases diagnosed with uni- or bilateral non-visualization of sentinel nodes in this cohort were identified from a penile cancer database. The management of the inguinal lymph nodes after non-visualization and the oncological outcomes including local and regional recurrence rates were documented.ResultsOut of 166 consecutive patients undergoing DSNB, 20 patients (12%) had unilateral non-visualization after injection of intradermal Tc-99m. Of these 20 patients, seven underwent repeat DSNB at a later date, with six having successful visualization. One patient had persistent non-visualization and proceeded to a superficial modified inguinal lymphadenectomy (SML). None of these patients experienced recurrence at follow-up. A further seven patients underwent modified SML with on-table frozen-section analysis of the lymph node packet; none of these patients were found to have micrometastatic disease in the inguinal lymph nodes, although one patient developed metastatic inguinal node disease at a later date. Six patients elected to undergo clinical surveillance and have remained disease-free.ConclusionPatients with impalpable inguinal lymph nodes undergoing DSNB with >= G2 T1 disease should ideally have bilateral visualization of the sentinel lymph nodes, reflecting the drainage pattern from the primary tumour. In the present series, 12% of patients were found to have unilateral nonvisualization after DSNB. Among patients offered a repeat DSNB at a later date, localizing the sentinel node was successful in 86% of cases. Patients with favourable histological characteristics can be placed on clinical surveillance. Those with high-risk disease can be offered a repeat DSNB procedure on the proviso that SML may be carried out if there is repeated non-visualization. Larger cohorts are required to validate this proposed algorithm.

TI  - Sensitivity and negative predictive value for sentinel lymph node biopsy in women with early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The role of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy alone for staging of early-stage cervical cancer remains controversial. We aimed to determine the validity of this technique in women with early-stage cervical cancer.Methods. We retrospectively reviewed women with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent SLN mapping followed by complete pelvic lymphadenectomy as part of initial surgical management from August 1997 through October 2015. All modes of surgical approach were included. Lymphatic mapping was performed using blue dye, technetium-99 m sulfur colloid (Tc-99), and/or indocyanine green (ICG). We determined SLN detection rates, sensitivity and negative predictive value.Results. One hundred eighty-eight patients were included, and 35 (19%) had lymph node metastases. At least one SLN was identified in 170 patients (90%), and bilateral SLNs were identified in 117 patients (62%). The majority of SLNs (83%) were found in the pelvis. There was no difference in detection rates between mapping agents, surgical approach, patients with and without prior conization or between patient with tumors <2 cm and >= 2 cm. The detection rate for bilateral SLNs was significantly lower in Women with body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m(2) than in women with lower BMI (p = 0.03). Metastatic disease in sentinel nodes was detected by H&E staining in 78% of cases and required ultrastaging/immunohistochemistry in 22% of cases. Only one patient had a false-negative result, yielding a sensitivity of 96.4% (95% CI 79.8%-99.8%) and negative predictive value of 99.3% (95% CI 95.6%-100%). The false-negative rate was 3.6%.Conclusions. In these women with early-stage cervical cancer, SLN biopsy had very high sensitivity and negative predictive value. We believe it is time to change the standard of care for women with early-stage cervical cancer to SLN biopsy only. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Toward Optimum Fusion of Thermal Hyperspectral and Visible Images in Classification of Urban Area
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, classification of urban area based on multi-sensor fusion has been widely investigated. In this paper, the potential of using visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) hyperspectral images fusion for classification of urban area is evaluated. For this purpose, comprehensive spatial-spectral feature space is generated which includes vegetation index, differential morphological profile (DMP), attribute profile (AP), texture, geostatistical features, structural feature set (SFS) and local statistical descriptors from both datasets in addition to original datasets. Although Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an appropriate tool in the classification of high dimensional feature space, its performance is significantly affected by its parameters and feature space. Cuckoo search (CS) optimization algorithm with mixed binary-continuous coding is proposed for feature selection and SVM parameter determination simultaneously. Moreover, the significance of each selected feature category in the classification of a specific object is verified. Accuracy assessment on two subsets shows that stacking of VIS and TIR bands can improve the classification performance to 87 percent and 82 percent for two subsets, compare to VIS image (72 percent and 80 percent) and TIR image (50 percent and 56 percent). However, the optimum results obtained based on the proposed method which gains 94 percent and 92 percent. Furthermore, results show that using TIR beside VIS image improves classification accuracy of roads and buildings in urban area.

TI  - Eight-year follow up result of the OTOASOR trial: The Optimal Treatment Of the Axilla - Surgery Or Radiotherapy after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: A randomized, single centre, phase III, non-inferiority trial
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The National Institute of Oncology, Budapest conducted a single centre randomized clinical study. The OTOASOR (Optimal Treatment Of the Axilla Surgery Or Radiotherapy) trial compares completion of axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) to regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis (pNlsn) in stage I-II breast cancer.Patients and methods: Patients with primary invasive breast cancer (cNO and cT <= 3 cm) were randomized before surgery for cALND (standard treatment) or RNI (investigational treatment). Sentinel lymph nodes (SN) were investigated with serial sectioning at 0.5 mm levels by hematoxylin eosin staining. Investigational treatment arm patients received 50 Gy RNI instead of cALND. Adjuvant treatment and follow up were performed according to the actual guidelines. Between August 2002 and June 2009, 1054 patients were randomized for cALND and 1052 patients for RNI. SN was evaluated in 2073 patients and was positive in 526 patients (25.4%). 474 cases were evaluable (244 in the cALND and 230 in the RNI arm), and in the cALND group 94 of 244 patients (38.5%) who underwent completion axillary surgery has additional positive nodes. The two arms were well balanced according to the majority of main prognostic factors. Primary endpoint was axillary recurrence and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).Results: Mean follow-up was 97 months (Q1-Q3: 80-120). Axillary recurrence was 2.0% in cALND arm vs. 1.7% in RNI arm (p = 1.00). OS at 8 years was 77.9% vs. 84.8% (p = 0.060), and DFS was 72.1% in cALND arm and 77.4% after RNI (p = 0.51). The results show that RNI is statistically not inferior to cALND treatment.Conclusions: The long term follow-up results of this prospective-randomized trial suggest that RNI without cALND does not increase the risk of axillary failure in selected patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer (cT <= 3 cm, cNO) and pNl(sn). Axillary radiotherapy should be an alternative treatment for selected patients with sentinel lymph node metastases.

TI  - The spectral variability hypothesis does not hold across landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the biodiversity metrics to track from space is the spatial variability in reflectance that has previously been proposed as a proxy of species counts per unit area. The corresponding hypothesis is known as the spectral variability hypothesis (SVH). Little attention has been paid so far to the questions whether the SVH holds over broader regions and across time. Here, we addressed these questions by using a spatially contiguous dataset of vascular plant species occurrences in Southern Germany along with MODIS data at 14 time steps. The floristic dataset consists of species occurrence data for 815 areas of 10 longitudinal by 6 latitudinal minutes (approximately 12 km by 11 km, referred to as mapping units). The spectral variability in space (within these units) was determined using MODIS pixels of 0.5 km by 0.5 km. We used two different measures of spectral variability in combination with a moving window approach to derive statistical links between spectral variability and species counts through space and time. The moving windows consisting of several mapping units were shifted in space and meanwhile used as target areas for correlation analyses.The performance of the spectral variability to predict species counts was influenced by the location and the extent of the reference windows. In some regions, high spectral variability was connected to high species counts. In other regions, comparably low spectral variability was linked to high species counts and vice versa. Furthermore, the relation between spectral variability and species varied with season. Certain areas changed from almost no correlation to very high correlation depending on the applied scene. Also, the applied spectral variability measure had a notable influence on the observed results.Based on these results, we conclude that the spectral variability hypothesis does not hold across landscapes at this spatial grain. Using spectral variability alone as a proxy for species counts in a monitoring approach for larger extents and grains is therefore unlikely to work in many parts of the world. This does not mean that it cannot help as a covariate in analyses with more predictors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Global satellite data highlights the diurnal asymmetry of the surface temperature response to deforestation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainties remain about the spatial pattern and magnitude of the biophysical effects of deforestation. In particular, a diurnal asymmetry in the magnitude and sign of the surface temperature response to deforestation (T-S) has been observed, but the biophysical processes that contribute to day and nighttime T-S are not fully understood. In this study, we use a space-for-time approach with satellite and reanalysis data to investigate the biophysical processes that control the day and nighttime T-S. Additionally, we incorporate flux-tower data to examine two hypotheses for nighttime forest warming relative to open lands: (1) that forests generate turbulence in the stable nocturnal boundary layer, which brings heat aloft down to the surface, and (2) that forests store more heat during the day and release it at night. Our results confirm a diurnal asymmetry in T-S. Over most regions of the world, deforestation results in daytime warming and nighttime cooling. The strongest daytime warming is in the tropics, where the average T-S is 4.40.07K. The strongest nighttime cooling is observed in the boreal zone, where open lands are cooler than forests by an average of 1.40.04K. Daytime patterns of T-S are explained by differences in the latent heat flux (LE) and absorbed solar radiation (K-a). We find that nighttime T-S is related to the strength of the nocturnal temperature inversion, with stronger temperature inversions at high latitudes and weak inversions in the tropics. Forest turbulence at night combined with stored heat release drives nighttime T-S patterns.

TI  - Subsurface fluid flow in the deep-water Kwanza Basin, offshore Angola
T2  - BASIN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated analysis of high-quality three-dimensional (3D) seismic, seabed geochemistry, and satellite-based surface slick data from the deep-water Kwanza Basin documents the widespread occurrence of past and present fluid flow associated with dewatering processes and hydrocarbon migration. Seismic scale fluid flow phenomena are defined by seep-related seafloor features including pockmarks, mud or asphalt volcanoes, gas hydrate pingoes, as well as shallow subsurface features such as palaeo-pockmarks, direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHIs), pipes and bottom-simulating reflections (BSRs). BSR-derived shallow geothermal gradients show elevated temperatures attributed to fluid advection along inclined stratigraphic carrier beds around salt structures in addition to elevated shallow thermal anomalies above highly conductive salt bodies. Seabed evidences of migrated thermogenic hydrocarbons and surface slicks are used to differentiate thermogenic hydrocarbon migration from fluid flow processes such as dewatering and biogenic gas migration. The analysis constrains the fluid plumbing system defined by the three-dimensional distribution of stratigraphic carriers and seal bypass systems through time. Detailed integration and iterative interpretation have confirmed the presence of mature source rock and effective migration pathways with significant implications for petroleum prospectivity in the post-salt interval. Integration of seismic, seabed geochemistry and satellite data represents a robust method to document and interpret fluid flow phenomena along continental margins, and highlights the importance of integrated fluid flow studies with regard to petroleum exploration, submarine geohazards, marine ecosystems and climate change.

TI  - Cost of Cutaneous Melanoma by Tumor Stage: A Descriptive Analysis.
T2  - Actas dermo-sifiliograficas
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The basis for optimal resource allocation is an understanding of requirements during the diagnostic and treatment phases. Costs associated with the rising incidence of cutaneous melanoma are considerable. We undertook an up-to-date analysis of the cost of diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up according to tumor stage.METHODS: We constructed descriptive tables following a theoretical model of direct costs based on amounts published in directives for the Spanish national health system and in international guidelines for managing cutaneous melanoma according to stage at diagnosis and clinical course. The tables allowed us to calculate the cost of treating individual patients as well as the expected cost for all patients with tumors in the same stage.RESULTS: Individual patients would generate costs ranging from 1689 (for a stage I tumor) to 88, 268 (stage IV). The largest differences were between stages IA and IB-IIA and between stages III and IV. Costs differed greatly between patients with early-stage tumors and favorable outcomes and those with recurring tumors, which cost 50-fold more in the first year and 20-fold more after 10 years of follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: The high cost of diagnosing advanced-stage cutaneous melanoma calls attention to the need to promote primary prevention and early detection. Our findings provide the knowledge base for cost-effectiveness studies in this disease.

TI  - Radiation therapy targets and the risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema: a systematic review and network meta-analysis
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - New indications have been found for regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in breast cancer treatment, yet the relationship of RNI and lymphedema risk is uncertain. We sought to determine the association of RNI and lymphedema.We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus for articles in English on humans published from 1995 to 2015, using search terms breast neoplasm, treatment, and morbidity. Two investigators independently selected articles and extracted information, including manuscripts reporting incidence of lymphedema by radiation targets. Meta-analyses, review papers, case-control studies, matched-pair studies, repetitive datasets, and retrospective studies were excluded. A total of 2399 abstracts were identified and 323 corresponding articles reviewed. Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria. Data were pooled using a random effects mixed model. Network meta-analyses were performed to determine the association of radiation targets alone and radiation targets plus extent of axillary surgery on incidence of lymphedema.The addition of RNI to breast/CW irradiation was associated with an increased incidence of lymphedema (OR 2.85; 95% CI 1.24-6.55). In patients treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary sampling, there was no association of lymphedema with the addition of RNI to breast/CW irradiation (OR 1.58; 95% CI 0.54-4.66; pooled incidence 5.7 and 4.1%, respectively). Among patients treated with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), treatment with RNI in addition to breast/CW radiation was associated with a significantly higher risk of lymphedema (OR 2.74; 95% CI 1.38-5.44; pooled incidence 18.2 and 9.4%, respectively).RNI is associated with a significantly higher risk of lymphedema than irradiation of the breast/CW, particularly after ALND.

TI  - Fuzzy AutoEncode Based Cloud Detection for Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection of remote sensing imagery is quite challenging due to the influence of complicated underlying surfaces and the variety of cloud types. Currently, most of the methods mainly rely on prior knowledge to extract features artificially for cloud detection. However, these features may not be able to accurately represent the cloud characteristics under complex environment. In this paper, we adopt an innovative model named Fuzzy Autoencode Model (FAEM) to integrate the feature learning ability of stacked autoencode networks and the detection ability of fuzzy function for highly accurate cloud detection on remote sensing imagery. Our proposed method begins by selecting and fusing spectral, texture, and structure information. Thereafter, the proposed technique established a FAEM to learn the deep discriminative features from a great deal of selected information. Finally, the learned features are mapped to the corresponding cloud density map with a fuzzy function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, 172 Landsat ETM+ images and 25 GF-1 images with different spatial resolutions are used in this paper. For the convenience of accuracy assessment, ground truth data are manually outlined. Results show that the average RER (ratio of right rate and error rate) on Landsat images is greater than 29, while the average RER of Support Vector Machine (SVM) is 21.8 and Random Forest (RF) is 23. The results on GF-1 images exhibit similar performance as Landsat images with the average RER of 25.9, which is much higher than the results of SVM and RF. Compared to traditional methods, our technique has attained higher average cloud detection accuracy for either different spatial resolutions or various land surfaces.

TI  - Fractal Dimension of Irregular Region of Interest Application to Corn Phenology Characterization
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of multitemporal remote sensing imagery offers a reliable and cost-effective means for monitoring crops on a broad-scale and provides consistent temporal measurements. Fractal geometry has been used as a quantitative description of spatial complexity of remote sensing images. Yet, corn field of spatial irregularity alters the fractal dimension of the landscape, which shall be suppressed in the estimation. In this paper, we propose a method for computing fractal dimension from irregular region of interests that minimizes the contribution from 2-D spatial irregularity. Our method was evaluated with normalized difference vegetation index products derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and satellite pour l'observation de la terre VEGETATION sensors from three states in the U.S. The experimental results using the time series demonstrated that our proposed fractal dimension estimation method exhibited great consistency and invariance to the change of image spectral characteristics, spatial resolution, and the degree of pixel mixing. In contrast to entropy and variance, the spectral characteristics of different imaging devices exhibited lower impact to the fractal dimension, which also implies its scale invariance. With respect to the detection rate of the first peak, fractal dimension achieved the best consistency. The proposed method for computing fractal dimension provides a critical and reliable measure for studying phenological patterns.

TI  - Influence of meteorological conditions on correlation between aerosol and cloud in summer
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols can affect the atmospheric radiation balance through direct and indirect effects. The formation and development of cloud and precipitation influenced by aerosols differ significantly from each other in different meteorological conditions. In this work, we used the MODIS's daily Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Cloud Effective Radius (CER), Cloud Top Temperature (CTT), Cloud Water Path (CWP) and ECMWF's Relative Humidity (RH), Vertical Velocity (VV) and Horizontal Wind (HW) (from 2005 to 2008) to reveal the influence of meteorological factors on the distribution of aerosols, and also the correlation between aerosols and clouds. The study was designed in such a way that, the RH, VV, Upwind (UW), Downwind (DW) and CWP were divided into several intervals, to quantify the relationship between AOD and CER by controlling one single variable or two comprehensive variables over the mountains and plains. At the same time, the effect of wind speed and direction on polluted conditions was analyzed through the superposed spatial distribution map of wind and AOD. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The wind coming from mountains dispelled aerosols while the sea breeze invigorated aerosols, and the upwind showed a markedly negative relevance with AOD. (2) The strong upwind contributed to the positive relationship between AOD and CER, and the correlation rose by 38% after excluding the condition where CWP < 34 g/m(2). (3) For the horizontal wind, only the zonal wind over the plains had obvious effects on the correlation, while the meridonal wind did not show evident influence. (4) For the plains, when CWP values were within the interval of 0-34 g/m(2) and 74-150 g/m(2), the correlation was positive, while in 34-74 g/m(2), it was negative. However, it is generally positive either over the mountains or in clean conditions. Moreover, the influence of RH on the correlation was consistent with that of CWP. (C) 2017 COSPAR.

TI  - Built-up land change and its impact on ecological quality in a fast-growing economic zone : Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Since China's reform and opening. up, the rapid growth of China's economy has greatly accelerated the expansion of built. up land, which has affected regional ecological environment to a great extent. Taking Jinjiang County of Fujian Province, one of the fastest economic-developing counties in the coastal areas of southeastern China, as a case study area, this paper focused on analyzing the rapid built. up land expansion process of the county and its impact on county's ecological quality using remote sensing techniques. Based on two Landsat images of 1996 and 2015 of Jinjiang, the built-up land of the county was extracted using the index-based built-up index (IBI) and its change was analyzed. In the meantime, the ecological status of Jinjiang was evaluated with a recently. proposed remote sensing based ecological index (RSEI) and the relationship between the built-up land dynamics and the ecological status changes of the county was quantitatively examined. The results showed that during the period from 1996 to 2015, the area of built-up land of Jinjiang had a net increase of 68.54 km(2), a growth of 45%, and the expansion intensity was 0.55. The expansion of the built-up lands has caused overall degradation of the county's ecological quality. The mean value of RSEI of the county had declined from 0.532 in 1996 to 0.460 in 2015, a drop of 13.5%. The area proportion of high ecological-quality grades also significantly fell from 39% in 1996 to 21% in 2015. The built-up land expansion intensity was negatively correlated with the ecological quality change.

TI  - Statistical estimation of high-resolution surface air temperature from MODIS over the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution surface air temperature data are critical to regional climate modeling in terms of energy balance, urban climate change, and so on. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) to estimate air temperature at a high resolution over the Yangtze River Delta region, China. It is found that daytime LST is highly correlated with maximum air temperature, and the linear regression coefficients vary with the type of land surface. The air temperature at a resolution of 1 km is estimated from the MODIS LST with linear regression models. The estimated air temperature shows a clear spatial structure of urban heat islands. Spatial patterns of LST and air temperature differences are detected, indicating maximum differences over urban and forest regions during summer. Validations are performed with independent data samples, demonstrating that the mean absolute error of the estimated air temperature is approximately 2.5A degrees C, and the uncertainty is about 3.1A degrees C, if using all valid LST data. The error is reduced by 0.4A degrees C (15%) if using best-quality LST with errors of less than 1 K. The estimated high-resolution air temperature data have great potential to be used in validating high-resolution climate models and other regional applications.

TI  - "We Can't Be Dependent on Anybody": The rhetoric of "Energy Independence" and the legitimation of fracking in Pennsylvania
T2  - EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in hydraulic fracturing technology have reduced US dependence on oil imports, inspiring claims that "energy independence" is within reach. In this article we contest the construction of space that undergirds this notion of energy independence. Specifically, we find that the discourse of "energy independence" constructs the world as a struggle between territorial states. The geographical worldview of the energy independence script is made of territorial states as containers of bounded, exclusive, sovereignty, referred to by Agnew as the "territorial trap". This obscures how international networks of commerce and investment rest on a basis of binding links of interdependence, cooperation and coproduction (1994). Using a mix of qualitative and quantitative evidence from Pennsylvania, we show how elites used notions of struggles between territorial powers to legitimate the infusion of international circuits of capital into local extractive zones. We find that the global network of investment that settled in Pennsylvania, with the goal of exporting gas as LNG, directly contradicted the spatial assumptions made by energy independence rhetoric. In making our argument we draw on evidence from interviews with elites within the fracking debate in Pennsylvania. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integrating Geospatial Techniques for Urban Land Use Classification in the Developing Sub-Saharan African City of Lusaka, Zambia
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - For most sub-Saharan African (SSA) cities, in order to control the historically unplanned urban growth and stimulate sustainable future urban development, there is a need for accurate identification of the past and present urban land use (ULU). However, studies addressing ULU classification in SSA cities are lacking. In this study, we developed an integrated approach of remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques to classify ULU in the developing SSA city of Lusaka. First, we defined six ULU classes (i.e., unplanned high density residential; unplanned low density residential; planned medium-high density residential; planned low density residential; commercial and industrial; public institutions and service areas). ULU parcels, created using road networks as homogenous units separating ULU classes, were used to classify ULU. We utilised the combined detail of cadastral and land use data plus high-resolution Google Earth imagery to infer ULU and classify the parcels. For residential ULU, we also created density thresholds for accurate separation of the classes. We then used the classified ULU parcels for post-classification sorting of built-up pixels extracted from three Landsat TM/ETM+ imageries (1990, 2000, and 2010) into respective ULU classes. Three ULU maps were produced with overall accuracy values of 84.09% to 85.86%. The maps provide information that is relevant to urban planners and policy makers for sustainable future urban planning of Lusaka City. The study also provides an insight for ULU classification in SSA cities with complex urban landscapes similar to Lusaka.

TI  - Assessing effect of dominant land-cover types and pattern on urban forest biomass estimated using LiDAR metrics
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of biomass in urban forests can help improve strategies for enhancing ecosystem services. Landscape heterogeneity, such as land-cover types and their spatial arrangements, greatly affects biomass growth, and it complicates the estimation of biomass. Application of LiDAR data is a typical approach for mapping forest biomass and carbon stocks across heterogeneous landscapes. However, little is known about how urban land uses and pattern impact biomass and estimates derived from LiDAR analysis. In this study, we examined the relationship between LiDAR-derived biomass and dominant land-cover types using field-measured estimates of aboveground forest biomass in an urbanized region of North Carolina, USA. Three objectives drove this research: 1) we examined the local effects of dominant land cover types on urban forest biomass; 2) we identified the spatial scale at which dominant land cover influences biomass estimates; 3) we investigated whether the fine-scale, spatial heterogeneity of the urban landscape contributed to forest biomass. We used multiple linear regression to relate field-measured biomass to LiDAR metrics and land cover densities derived from Landsat and LiDAR data. The biomass model developed from variables derived from LiDAR first returns produced biomass estimates similar to using all LiDAR returns. Although three land-cover types (impervious surface, managed clearings, and farmland) exhibited a negative relationship with biomass, only impervious surface was statistically significant. The biomass model that used impervious surface densities between 100 m and 175 m radial buffers produced the highest adjusted R (2) with lower RMSE values. Our study suggests that impervious surface impacted forest biomass estimates considerably in urbanizing landscapes with the greatest effect between 100 and 175 m from a forest stand. Managed clearing and farmland types negatively impacted biomass estimation albeit not as strongly as impervious surface. Overall, we found that accounting for impervious surface density and its proximity to forest in biomass models may improve urban forest biomass estimates.

TI  - Optimizing light delivery through fiber bundle in photoacoustic imaging with clinical ultrasound system: Monte Carlo simulation and experimental validation
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Translating photoacoustic (PA) imaging into clinical setup is a challenge. We report an integrated PA and ultrasound imaging system by combining the light delivery to the tissue with the ultrasound probe. First, Monte Carlo simulations were run to study the variation in absorbance within tissue for different angles of illumination, fiber-to-probe distance (FPD), and fiber-to-tissue distance (FTD). This is followed by simulation for different depths of the embedded sphere (object of interest). Several probe holders were designed for different light launching angles. Phantoms were developed to mimic a sentinel lymph node imaging scenario. It was observed that, for shallower imaging depths, the variation in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values could be as high as 100% depending on the angle of illumination at a fixed FPD and FTD. Results confirm that different light illumination angles are required for different imaging depths to get the highest SNR PA images. The results also validate that one can use Monte Carlo simulation as a tool to optimize the probe holder design depending on the imaging needs. This eliminates a trial-and-error approach generally used for designing a probe holder. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Serial Vaccination and the Antigenic Distance Hypothesis: Effects on Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness During A(H3N2) Epidemics in Canada, 2010-2011 to 2014-2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The antigenic distance hypothesis (ADH) predicts that negative interference from prior season's influenza vaccine (v1) on the current season's vaccine (v2) protection may occur when the antigenic distance is small between v1 and v2 (v1 approximate to v2) but large between v1 and the current epidemic (e) strain (v1 not equal e).Methods. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H3N2) illness was estimated by test-negative design during 3 A(H3N2) epidemics (2010-2011, 2012-2013, 2014-2015) in Canada. Vaccine effectiveness was derived with covariate adjustment across v2 and/or v1 categories relative to no vaccine receipt among outpatients aged >= 9 years. Prior vaccination effects were interpreted within the ADH framework.Results. Prior vaccination effects varied significantly by season, consistent with the ADH. There was no interference by v1 in 20102011 when v1 not equal v2 and v1 not equal e, with comparable VE for v2 alone or v2 + v1: 34% (95% confidence interval [CI] = -51% to 71%) versus 34% (95% CI = -5% to 58%). Negative interference by v1 was suggested in 2012-2013 with nonsignificant reduction in VE when v1 approximate to v2 and v1 not equal e: 49% (95% CI = -47% to 83%) versus 28% (95% CI = -12% to 54%). Negative effects of prior vaccination were pronounced and statistically significant in 2014-2015 when v1  v2 and v1 not equal e: 65% (95% CI = 25% to 83%) versus -33% (95% CI = -78% to 1%).Conclusions. Effects of repeat influenza vaccination were consistent with the ADH and may have contributed to findings of low VE across recent A(H3N2) epidemics since 2010 in Canada.

Examining the theatrical use of emotion in Gary Henderson's play Home Land and Stuart Hoar and Chris Blake's opera Bitter Calm, this article considers how performed emotions may represent Pakeha cultural identity on the stage.The cultural memories underlying theatrical emotions empower them to challenge ideas, and this article considers how the theatrical use of emotion represents memories of, and ideas about, Pakeha cultural identity. As a form of cultural language, a performance, as Bert O. States observes, 'offers an aesthetic completion to a process we know to be endless... The play imitates the timely in order to move it from time, to give time a shape.'Within this shape, the remembered and reconfigured past is emotionally represented, at multiple performances, to an ever-changing present. This representation to an audience allows for an ongoing examination of personal and cultural identity in which emotional representation performs a key role. For, as Peta Tait notes, '[i]f emotions are socially meaningful only as natural, this locates them as opposite to culture and camouflages their immense social power'.

TI  - Procedural sedation in the emergency department by Dutch emergency physicians: a prospective multicentre observational study of 1711 adults
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To describe our experience performing ED procedural sedation in a country where emergency medicine (EM) is a relatively new specialty.Methods This is a prospective observational study of adult patients undergoing procedural sedation by emergency physicians (EPs) or EM residents in eight hospitals in the Netherlands. Data were collected on a standardised form, including patient characteristics, sedative and analgesic used, procedural success, adverse events (classified according to World SIVA) and rescue interventions.Results 1711 adult cases were included from 2006 to 2013. Propofol, midazolam and esketamine (S+ enantiomer of ketamine) were the most used sedatives (63%, 29% and 8%). We had adverse event data on all patients. The overall adverse event rate was 11%, mostly hypoxia or apnoea. There was no difference in adverse event rate between EPs and EM residents. However, there was a significantly higher success rate of the procedure when EPs did the procedural sedation (92% vs 84%). No moderate (unplanned hospital admission or escalation of care) or sentinel SIVA outcomes occurred (pulmonary aspiration syndrome, death or permanent neurological deficit).Conclusion Adverse events during procedural sedation occurred in 11% of patients. There were no moderate or sentinel outcomes. All events could be managed by the sedating physician. In a country where EM is a relatively new specialty, procedural sedation appears to be safe when performed by EPs or trained EM residents and has comparable adverse event rates to international studies.

TI  - Preoperative measurement of serum CA-125 levels: is it useful in the risk assessment of low volume lymph node disease in cervical cancer?
T2  - REVISTA ROMANA DE MEDICINA DE LABORATOR
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND:Elevated serum cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) is observed in some cervical cancers (CCs). Is the correlation of CA-125 with the presence of nodal events useful in predicting early metastasis to the lymph nodes?METHODS:The study included 45 patients with CC FIGO (2009) stages IA1-IIA1 and known preoperative CA-125 concentration, surgery treated (05.2011-05.2014). Investigated pretreatment: age (pre-, postmenopausal), histological type, grade, confounding factors - prior cone biopsy, ovarian cyst, endometriosis, liver or colon pathology, concomitant malignancy. LN metastases (LNM) were defined as macro (MAC, > 2mm) and/or micrometastases (mic, 0.2 - 2 mm), and LVLND as mic or/and ITC (single CC cells clusters) in LNs. Ultrastaging of all LNs (sentinel and non-sentinel, 4 mu m thick slices/150 mu m intervals) was performed with hematoxylin and eosin staining and with immunohistochemistry (IHC - AE1/AE3 cytokeratin antibodies). Non-parametrical analysis and receiver operating curve analysis were used to determine correlation between CA-125 and LNM including LVLND.RESULTS:The median age was 55 (23-71). 806 LNs were extracted. LNM was found in 12, LVLND in 6 patients. LNM but not LVLND was correlated with higher grade (G2-G3, p < 0.05). LVLND was positively correlated with premenopausal age (p < 0.05) but not with tumor histology or grade. Liver disease only was found to influence CA-125 levels (p = 0.064). There were no differences within CA-125 concentration among LVLND, LNM, and node-negative patients groups, however a trend was found between higher CA-125 and lower LVLND risk.CONCLUSIONS:Elevated levels of CA-125 may be less likely due to LVLND than to LN positivity. Grade is an important feature in prediction of LNM but not LVLND. CA-125 level was found to be not predictive of LNM nor LVLND, as confirmed by ultrastaging.

TI  - A Novel Statistical Approach for Ocean Colour Estimation of Inherent Optical Properties and Cyanobacteria Abundance in Optically Complex Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication is an increasing problem in coastal waters of the Baltic Sea. Moreover, algal blooms, which occur every summer in the Gulf of Gdansk can deleteriously impact human health, the aquatic environment, and economically important fisheries, tourism, and recreation industries. Traditional laboratory-based techniques for water monitoring are expensive and time consuming, which usually results in limited numbers of observations and discontinuity in space and time. The use of hyperspectral radiometers for coastal water observation provides the potential for more detailed remote optical monitoring. A statistical approach to develop local models for the estimation of optically significant components from in situ measured hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance in case 2 waters is presented in this study. The models, which are based on empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and stepwise multilinear regression, allow for the estimation of parameters strongly correlated with phytoplankton (pigment concentration, absorption coefficient) and coloured detrital matter abundance (absorption coefficient) directly from reflectance spectra measured in situ. Chlorophyll a concentration, which is commonly used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, was retrieved with low error (median percent difference, MPD = 17%, root mean square error RMSE = 0.14 in log(10) space) and showed a high correlation with chlorophyll a measured in situ (R = 0.84). Furthermore, phycocyanin and phycoerythrin, both characteristic pigments for cyanobacteria species, were also retrieved reliably from reflectance with MPD = 23%, RMSE = 0.23, R-2 = 0.77 and MPD = 24%, RMSE = 0.15, R-2 = 0.74, respectively. The EOF technique proved to be accurate in the derivation of the absorption spectra of phytoplankton and coloured detrital matter (CDM), with R-2 (lambda) above 0.83 and RMSE around 0.10. The approach was also applied to satellite multispectral remote sensing reflectance data, thus allowing for improved temporal and spatial resolution compared with the in situ measurements. The EOF method tested on simulated Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) or Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) data resulted in RMSE = 0.16 for chl-a and RMSE = 0.29 for phycocyanin. The presented methods, applied to both in situ and satellite data, provide a powerful tool for coastal monitoring and management.

TI  - An anomalous African dust event and its impact on aerosol radiative forcing on the Southwest Atlantic coast of Europe in February 2016
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A desert dust (DD) event that had its origin in North Africa occurred on the 20th-23rd of February 2016. The dust transport phenomenon was exceptional because of its unusual intensity during the coldest season. A historical dataset (2006-2015) of February meteorological scenarios using ECMWF fields, meteorological parameters, aerosol optical properties, surface 03 and AOD retrieved from MODIS at the El Arenosillo observatory (southwestern Spain) were analysed and compared with the levels during the DD event to highlight its exceptionality. Associated with a low-pressure system in Western North Africa, flows transported air from the Sahel to Algeria and consequently increased temperatures from the surface to 700 hPa by up to 7-9 degrees C relative to the last decade. These conditions favoured the formation of a Saharan air layer. Dust was transported to the north and reached the Western Mediterranean Basin and the Iberian Peninsula. The arrival of the DD event at El Arenosillo did not affect the surface weather conditions or ozone but did impact the aerosol radiative forcing at the top of atmosphere (RFTOA). Aerosol radiative properties did not change relative to historical; however, the particle size and the amount of the aerosol were significantly higher. The DD event caused an increase (in absolute terms) of the mean aerosol RFTOA to a value of -8.1 W m(-2) (long-term climatological value similar to - 1.5 W m(-2)). The aerosol RFTOA was not very large relative other DD episodes; however, our analysis of the historical data concluded that the importance of this DD event lay in the month of occurrence. European phenological datasets related to extreme atmospheric events predominantly reflect changes that are probably associated with climate change. This work is an example of this phenomenon, showing an event that occurred in a hotspot, the Saharan desert, and its impact two thousand km away. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Harmonization of forest disturbance datasets of the conterminous USA from 1986 to 2011
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Several spatial forest disturbance datasets exist for the conterminous USA. The major problem with forest disturbance mapping is that variability between map products leads to uncertainty regarding the actual rate of disturbance. In this article, harmonized maps were produced from multiple data sources (i.e., Global Forest Change, LANDFIRE Vegetation Disturbance, National Land Cover Database, Vegetation Change Tracker, and Web-Enabled Landsat Data). The harmonization process involved fitting common class ontologies and determining spatial congruency to produce forest disturbance maps for four time intervals (1986-1992, 1992-2001, 2001-2006, and 2006-2011). Pixels mapped as disturbed for two or more datasets were labeled as disturbed in the harmonized maps. The primary advantage gained by harmonization was improvement in commission error rates relative to the individual disturbance products. Disturbance omission errors were high for both harmonized and individual forest disturbance maps due to underlying limitations in mapping subtle disturbances with Landsat classification algorithms. To enhance the value of the harmonized disturbance products, we used fire perimeter maps to add information on the cause of disturbance.

TI  - Global cross-calibration of Landsat spectral mixture models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Data continuity for the Landsat program relies on accurate cross-calibration among sensors. The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has been shown to exhibit superior performance to the sensors on Landsats 4-7 with respect to radiometric calibration, signal to noise, and geolocation. However, improvements to the positioning of the spectral response functions on the OLI have resulted in known biases for commonly used spectral indices because the new band responses integrate absorption features differently from previous Landsat sensors. The objective of this analysis is to quantify the impact of these changes on linear spectral mixture models that use imagery collected by different Landsat sensors. The 2013 underflight of Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 provides an opportunity to cross calibrate the spectral mixing spaces of the ETM+ and OLI sensors using near-simultaneous acquisitions of radiance measurements from a wide variety of land cover types worldwide. We use 80,910,343 pairs of OLI and ETM+ spectra to characterize the Landsat 8 OLI spectral mixing space and perform a cross-calibration with Landsat 7 ETM+. This new global collection of Landsat spectra spans a greater spectral diversity than those used in prior studies and the resulting Substrate, Vegetation, and Dark (SVD) spectral endmembers (EMs) supplant prior global Landsat EMs. We find only minor (-0.01 <mu < 0.01) differences between SVD fractions for coregistered pairs of spectra unmixed using the new sensor-specific endmembers identified in this analysis. Root mean square (RMS) misfit fractions are also shown to be small (< 98% of pixels with < 5% RMS), in accord with previous studies using standardized global endmembers. Finally, vegetation is used as an example to illustrate the empirical and theoretical relationship between commonly used spectral indices and subpixel fractions. We include the new global ETM+ and OLI EMs as Supplementary Materials. SVD fractions unmixed using global EMs thus provide easily computable, linearly scalable, physically based measures of subpixel land cover area which can be compared accurately across the entire Landsat 4-8 archive without introducing any additional cross-sensor corrections.

TI  - Precipitation Drivers of Cropping Frequency in the Brazilian Cerrado: Evidence and Implications for Decision-Making
T2  - WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon basin has been subjected to unprecedented rates of land-use change over the past several decades, primarily as a result of the expansion of agriculture. Enhanced rain forest conservation efforts toward the end of the twentieth century slowed deforestation of the Amazon but, in turn, increased demand for land repurposing in the adjacent Cerrado (savanna) region, where conservation regulations are less strict. To maintain or increase yields while minimizing the need for additional land, agricultural producers adopted a form of intensification in which two rain-fed crops are planted within a single growing season (double cropping). Using 10 years (August 2002 to July 2012) of MODIS and TRMM data, it is demonstrated that there exists a threshold growing season rainfall amount (1759 mm) for double cropping. But more nuanced is the relationship between observable precipitation information available to farmers at the time of planting decision and the choice to "double crop'' in a given year. An evaluation of decision-available precipitation characteristics provides strong evidence for the importance of high rainfall frequency during a critical period prior to, and including, the rainy season onset.

TI  - The Edmonton-Calgary corridor: Simulating future land cover change under potential government intervention
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The region connecting Edmonton and Calgary, the two largest cities in Alberta, contains rich agricultural land and is one of the most rapidly changing areas in the province. There is little legislation to restrict urban sprawl or adequately protect agricultural land or native grasslands, and there has been little research to predict future alteration. The main study objectives are, therefore, to assess historical changes in the Edmonton-Calgary corridor from 1984 to 2013 and simulate the future landscape change to 2022 under potential government intervention scenarios. Satellite imagery from Landsat, used in conjunction with biogeophysical variables, was used to create a history of cover in the Edmonton-Calgary area. This history of the environment can be used as a baseline to project changes into the future. Testing different legislative scenarios under two major branches of modifying rates of change or locations of change can be used to identify effective policies for limiting damage to the environment while still allowing for urban growth. Five scenarios were created for this purpose: 1) business as usual, 2) increased rate of urban expansion, 3) no urban expansion, 4) implementation of greenbelts around urban areas, 5) protection of the best agricultural land. This study finds that over the past 30 years, urban area has nearly doubled in size, targeting predominately farmland, especially due to an increase in rural subdivisions. Each scenario impacts growth differently, however, greenbelts and the no expansion model decease growth the most, while the agricultural protection is comparable to the business as usual scenario.

TI  - Regional Radiation Therapy Impacts Outcome for Node-Positive Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Regional radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to reduce the risk of regional recurrence with node-positive cutaneous melanoma. However, risk factors for regional recurrence, especially in the era of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), are less clear. Our goals were to identify risk factors associated with regional recurrence and to determine whether a radiosensitivity index (RSI) gene expression signature (GES) could identify patients who experience a survival benefit with regional RT. Methods: A single-institution, Institutional Review Board-approved study was performed including 410 patients treated with either SLNB with or without completion lymph node dissection (LND; n= 270) or therapeutic LND (n= 91). Postoperative regional RT was delivered to the involved nodal basin in 83 cases (20.2%), to a median dose of 54 Gy (range, 30-60 Gy) in 27 fractions (range, 5-30). Primary outcomes were regional control and overall survival by RSI GES status. Results: Median follow-up was 69 months (range, 13-180). Postoperative regional RT was associated with a reduced risk of regional recurrence among all patients on univariate (5-year estimate: 95.0% vs 83.3%; P=.036) and multivariate analysis (hazard ratio[HR], 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.43; P<.001). Among higher-risk subgroups, regional RT was associated with a lower risk of regional recurrence among patients with clinically detected lymph nodes (n= 175; 5-year regional control: 94.1% vs 69.5%; P=.003) and extracapsular extension (ECE) present (n= 138; 5-year regional control: 96.7% vs 62.2%; P<.001). Among a subset of radiated patients with gene expression data available, a low RSI GES (radiosensitive) tumor status was associated with improved survival compared with a high RSI GES (5-year: 75% vs 0%; HR, 10.68; 95% CI, 1.24-92.14). Conclusions: Regional RT was associated with a reduced risk of regional recurrence among patients with ECE and clinically detected nodal disease. Gene expression data show promise for better predicting radiocurable patients in the future. In the era of increasingly effective systemic therapies, the value of improved regional control potentially takes on greater significance.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping: Effect of Spatial Resolution towards the Prediction of Landslide Prone Area in a Tropical Catchment
T2  - CHIANG MAI JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide has become a common problem especially in tropical countries such as in Malaysia. This study was carried out in Fraser Hill Catchment using a GIS based deterministic slope stability analysis model, that combine infinite slope stability and steady state hydrology assumptions to quantify the stability called SINMAP. The model requires some inputs. Historical landslide inventory for the catchment were obtained from interpretation of multispectral SPOT 5 image and Global Positioning Survey (GPS) survey. Topographic maps at scale of 1: 50,000 were used to construct Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Soil strength parameters and hydrologic parameters were gathered from in situ test as well as previous records. The purposes of this study were to map the landslide susceptibility of Fraser Hill Catchment and to test the usage of different DEM spatial resolution towards the accuracy of the model. Landslide susceptibility map for the study area was produced as the output of this model. The result will be compared with the actual location of slope failure that occur within the catchment to assess the model performance. Results showed that, for this catchment, SINMAP gives good results in predicting the landslide with 68% of the current landslide inventory fall within unstable class as their calculation of Stability Index (SI) are less than 1. Results from the spatial resolution analysis showed that 20 and 30 meter resolution gave optimum result compared to others.

TI  - Crosstalk Effect in SNPP VIIRS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An investigation has been carried out to examine the crosstalk contamination in the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) spacecraft. Prior to this study, the cause of the pronounced striping in Earth View (EV) images and obvious discontinuity in the EV brightness temperature (BT) of the thermal emissive bands (TEB) during black body (BB) warm-up cool-down (WUCD) calibration observed since launch has not been identified. Meanwhile, it has been recently demonstrated in the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) long-wave infrared (LWIR) photovoltaic (PV) bands that the crosstalk effect induces the same erroneous features. In this investigation, it is shown that the established lunar imagery analysis indeed verifies the existence of crosstalk contamination in SNPP VIIRS TEB. The crosstalk effect is quantitatively characterized by deriving the crosstalk coefficients from the scheduled lunar observations. The magnitude of the effect is comparatively smaller than that in MODIS LWIR PV bands, but is of a large enough magnitude to induce the aforementioned artificial features. Among all SNPP VIIRS TEB, Band M14 has the largest crosstalk contamination from Band M15, while Bands M13, M15, M16, and I5 have pronounced crosstalk effects as well. One new detail of the crosstalk effect specific to SNPP VIIRS, differing from the MODIS result, is the distinctive two-group pattern of odd and even detectors for each affected band due to the arrangement of the detector on the focal plane assembly (FPA). This is fully consistent with the earlier finding that this odd-even detector arrangement contributes to striping in the sea surface temperature (SST) products. Our analyses additionally suggest an explanation of the large temperature anomalies appearing during the WUCD time periods. The parallel effort examining the potential crosstalk contamination in SNPP VIIRS reflective solar bands, however, reveals no observable effect.

TI  - Daily Mapping of 30 m LAI and NDVI for Grape Yield Prediction in California Vineyards
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wine grape quality and quantity are affected by vine growing conditions during critical phenological stages. Field observations of vine growth stages are too sparse to fully capture the spatial variability of vine conditions. In addition, traditional grape yield prediction methods are time consuming and require large amount grape samples. Remote sensing data provide detailed spatial and temporal information regarding vine development that is useful for vineyard management. In this study, Landsat surface reflectance products from 2013 and 2014 were used to map satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and leaf area index (LAI) over two Vitis vinifera L. cv. Pinot Noir vineyards in California, USA. The spatial correlation between grape yield maps and the interpolated daily time series (LAI and NDVI) was quantified. NDVI and LAI were found to have similar performance as a predictor of spatial yield variability, providing peak correlations of 0.8 at specific times during the growing season, and the timing of this peak correlation differed for the two years of study. In addition, correlations with maximum and seasonal-cumulative vegetation indices were also evaluated, and showed slightly lower correlations with the observed yield maps. Finally, the within-season grape yield predictability was examined using a simple strategy in which the relationship between grape yield and vegetation indices were calibrated with limited ground measurements. This strategy has a strong potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of yield estimation in comparison with traditional approaches used in the wine grape growing industry.

TI  - Favorable environments for the occurrence of overshooting tops in tropical cyclones
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on Multifunctional Transport Satellite data and the infrared window-texture detection algorithm, the level of overshooting top (OT) activity within a tropical cyclone (TC), which is defined as the hourly mean number of OT occurrence, was statistically investigated in the western North Pacific basin for the period 2005-12. Based on the level of OT activity, the samples were divided into OT and non-OT cases or high-activity-OT (HA-OT) and low-activity-OT (LA-OT) cases. The differences in large-scale environmental variables between OT (HA-OT) and non-OT (LA-OT) cases were examined 12 hours prior to the OT occurrence. Statistical analysis showed that environmental differences did exist between the OT and non-OT cases. The OTs were more skewed towards the early stage of the TC life cycle, and mostly concentrated in low latitudes. Meanwhile, a sufficiently deep warm-water layer, large temperature difference between the upper- and lower-level troposphere, large humidity at the middle and upper levels, and large atmospheric instability, were favorable for OT occurrence. The differences in large-scale environmental characteristics between HA-OTs and LA-OTs were not as significant as those between OTs and non-OTs, but the HA-OT samples tended to occur when the vertical shear was weak and the TC intensity was low. Finally, statistical models were designed to predict the OT and HA-OT. When at least three OT (HA-OT) predictor thresholds were satisfied, the Peirce skill score reached a maximum value of 0.49 (0.30).

TI  - Loess Landslide Inventory Map Based on GF-1 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall-induced landslides are a major threat in the hilly and gully regions of the Loess Plateau. Landslide mapping via field investigations is challenging and impractical in this complex region because of its numerous gullies. In this paper, an algorithm based on an object-oriented method (OOA) has been developed to recognize loess landslides by combining spectral, textural, and morphometric information with auxiliary topographic parameters based on high-resolution multispectral satellite data (GF-1, 2 m) and a high-precision DEM (5 m). The quality percentage (QP) values were all greater than 0.80, and the kappa indices were all higher than 0.85, indicating good landslide detection with the proposed approach. We quantitatively analyze the spectral, textural, morphometric, and topographic properties of loess landslides. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is useful for discriminating landslides from vegetation cover and water areas. Morphometric parameters, such as elongation and roundness, can potentially improve the recognition capacity and facilitate the identification of roads. The combination of spectral properties in near-infrared regions, the textural variance from a grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and topographic elevation data can be used to effectively discriminate terraces and buildings. Furthermore, loess flows are separated from landslides based on topographic position data. This approach shows great potential for quickly producing accurate results for loess landslides that are induced by extreme rainfall events in the hilly and gully regions of the Loess Plateau, which will help decision makers improve landslide risk assessment, reduce the risk from landslide hazards and facilitate the application of more reliable disaster management strategies.

TI  - Surgical outcomes in patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma in Europe - a systematic literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - There is limited comparative evidence of the outcomes of different types of surgical management in patients with malignant melanoma in Europe. To address that gap we conducted a systematic literature review to summarize studies reporting outcomes of surgical procedures in patients with malignant melanoma in Europe. Medline was searched for European studies published in English, between 2004 and 2014 reporting surgical outcomes in adults with cutaneous malignant melanoma. We identified 23 studies that evaluated 18332 patients treated surgically between 1979 and 2009 from 11 European countries. Most of the studies (21/23) were observational; the two remaining studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies compared the effect of a range of surgical interventions on a range of clinical outcomes, more commonly overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS)/recurrence-free survival (RFS). Wider excisions were not associated with improved survival in patients with melanoma thickness 2mm in both studies (RCTs), however, recent results based on long-term follow-up data associate 3cm excision margins (vs. 1cm) with favourable survival outcomes. There was some evidence that complete lymph node dissection after positive sentinel lymph node offers survival benefits over therapeutic lymph node dissection. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was not shown to be associated with significant OS benefits, however, it was overly related with higher rates of DFS/RFS. This review highlights the difficulties of making comparisons between different types of surgical procedures for malignant melanoma. As surgery remains the main treatment, this is an important field, and further evidence, particularly from RCTs, is needed.

TI  - Building the vegetation drought response index for Canada (VegDRI-Canada) to monitor agricultural drought: first results
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural climatic phenomenon that occurs throughout the world and impacts many sectors of society. To help decision-makers reduce the impacts of drought, it is important to improve monitoring tools that provide relevant and timely information in support of drought mitigation decisions. Given that drought is a complex natural hazard that manifests in different forms, monitoring can be improved by integrating various types of information (e.g., remote sensing and climate) that is timely and region specific to identify where and when droughts are occurring. The Vegetation Drought Response Index for Canada (VegDRI-Canada) is a recently developed drought monitoring tool for Canada. VegDRI-Canada extends the initial VegDRI concept developed for the conterminous United States to a broader transnational coverage across North America. VegDRI-Canada models are similar to those developed for the United States, integrating satellite observations of vegetation status, climate data, and biophysical information on land use and land cover, soil characteristics, and other environmental factors. Collectively, these different types of data are integrated into the hybrid VegDRI-Canada to isolate the effects of drought on vegetation. Twenty-three weekly VegDRI-Canada models were built for the growing season (April-September) through the weekly analysis of these data using a regression tree-based data mining approach. A 15-year time series of VegDRI-Canada results (s to 2014) was produced using these models and the output was validated by randomly selecting 20% of the historical data, as well as holdout year (15% unseen data) across the growing season that the Pearson's correlation ranged from 0.6 to 0.77. A case study was also conducted to evaluate the VegDRI-Canada results over the prairie region of Canada for two drought years and one non-drought year for three weekly periods of the growing season (i.e., early-, mid-, and late season). The comparison of the VegDRI-Canada map with the Canadian Drought Monitor (CDM), an independent drought indicator, showed that the VegDRI-Canada maps depicted key spatial drought severity patterns during the two targeted drought years consistent with the CDM. In addition, VegDRI-Canada was compared with canola yields in the Prairie Provinces at the regional scale for a period from 2000 to 2014 to evaluate the indices' applicability for monitoring drought impacts on crop production. The result showed that VegDRI-Canada values had a relatively higher correlation (i.e., r>0.5) with canola yield for nonirrigated croplands in the Canadian Prairies region in areas where drought is typically a limiting factor on crop growth, but showed a negative relationship in the southeastern Prairie region, where water availability is less of a limiting factor and in some cases a hindrance to crop growth when waterlogging occurs. These initial results demonstrate VegDRI-Canada's utility for monitoring drought-related vegetation conditions, particularly in drought prone areas. In general, the results indicated that the VegDRI-Canada models showed sensitivity to known agricultural drought events in Canada over the 15-year period mainly for nonirrigated areas.

TI  - Land-ocean differences in the warm-rain formation process in satellite and ground-based observations and model simulations
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - A previous study explored land-ocean differences in the warm-rain formation process. In that study, aerosol effects were removed, or at least partially removed, but some land-ocean differences remained. Therefore, the study hypothesized that the land-ocean difference in the microphysical structure of warm clouds and in the formation of warm rain can be explained by differences in the nature of updraughts. To test this hypothesis, this study provides a detailed analysis of the land-ocean differences in warm clouds using a combination of CloudSat and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, ground-based measurements obtained from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM), as well as a simple model framework. Our results show that a stronger updraught increases the height at which significant coalescence begins, and also prolongs the lifetime of falling drops promoting larger droplet growth. A consequence of this difference is that drizzle is less frequently observed at cloud base over land. Our results point to the critical role of the strength of the convective updraught in the warm-rain formation process.

TI  - Coffee Certification and Forest Quality: Evidence from a Wild Coffee Forest in Ethiopia
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Shade coffee certification programs that aim to conserve the forest and to prevent forest degradation have attracted an increasing amount of attention. However, such programs' impact on forest degradation remains unclear because of the absence of empirical evidence. In addition, there is heated debate about whether certification programs create an incentive for producers to expand their coffee-growing areas, which may accelerate forest degradation in the surrounding natural forest. This study, which was conducted in Ethiopia, aimed to evaluate the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest degradation. Additionally, to provide empirical evidence for the debate, we examined the spillover effects of certification to surrounding forest areas and used remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 to classify forest areas based on their density. We applied matching methods, such as the propensity score matching with different algorithms, to compare forest coffee areas with and without the certification. We found that the certified forest coffee areas slightly increased in forest density. By contrast, we observed drastic forest degradation in the forest coffee areas without certification. We checked the sensitivity of our results and found that our results are robust to potential hidden bias. Furthermore, our empirical results revealed that the natural forest areas within a 100-m radius from the forest coffee boundary area exhibited significantly reduced forest degradation compared with forest areas under similar environmental conditions but that such positive and significant impact diminished after 100-m distance. These results indicate that the certification program is effective in alleviating forest degradation in the certified area and in the surrounding natural forest. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

TI  - Parallel Agent-as-a-Service (P-AaaS) Based Geospatial Service in the Cloud
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To optimize the efficiency of the geospatial service in the flood response decision making system, a Parallel Agent-as-a-Service (P-AaaS) method is proposed and implemented in the cloud. The prototype system and comparisons demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing methods. The P-AaaS method includes both parallel architecture and a mechanism for adjusting the computational resources-the parallel geocomputing mechanism of the P-AaaS method used to execute a geospatial service and the execution algorithm of the P-AaaS based geospatial service chain, respectively. The P-AaaS based method has the following merits: (1) it inherits the advantages of the AaaS-based method (i.e., avoiding transfer of large volumes of remote sensing data or raster terrain data, agent migration, and intelligent conversion into services to improve domain expert collaboration); (2) it optimizes the low performance and the concurrent geoprocessing capability of the AaaS-based method, which is critical for special applications (e.g., highly concurrent applications and emergency response applications); and (3) it adjusts the computing resources dynamically according to the number and the performance requirements of concurrent requests, which allows the geospatial service chain to support a large number of concurrent requests by scaling up the cloud-based clusters in use and optimizes computing resources and costs by reducing the number of virtual machines (VMs) when the number of requests decreases.

TI  - The Observed Impacts of Wind Farms on Local Vegetation Growth in Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind farms (WFs) can affect the local climate, and local climate change may influence underlying vegetation. Some studies have shown that WFs affect certain aspects of the regional climate, such as temperature and rainfall. However, there is still no evidence to demonstrate whether WFs can affect local vegetation growth, a significant part of the overall assessment of WF effects. In this research, based on the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index, productivity and other remote-sensing data from 2003 to 2014, the effects of WFs in the Bashang area of Northern China on vegetation growth and productivity in the summer (June-August) were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) WFs had a significant inhibiting effect on vegetation growth, as demonstrated by decreases in the leaf area index (LAI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of approximately 14.5%, 14.8%, and 8.9%, respectively, in the 2003-2014 summers. There was also an inhibiting effect of 8.9% on summer gross primary production (GPP) and 4.0% on annual net primary production (NPP) coupled with WFs; and (2) the major impact factors might be the changes in temperature and soil moisture: WFs suppressed soil moisture and enhanced water stress in the study area. This research provides significant observational evidence that WFs can inhibit the growth and productivity of the underlying vegetation.

TI  - Unravelling the response of diurnal raptors to land use change in a highly dynamic landscape in northwestern Spain: an approach based on satellite earth observation data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover change (LULCC) is one of the main components of current anthropogenic global change. Unravelling the ecological response of biodiversity to the combined effect of land use change and other stressors is essential for effective conservation. For this purpose, we used co-inertia analysis to combine LULCC analysis of earth observation satellite data-derived maps and raptor data obtained from road censuses conducted in 2001 and 2014 at sampling unit level (10 km(2) spatial resolution), in northwestern Spain (province of Ourense, c. 7281 km(2)). In addition, habitat suitability models were also computed using ten widely used single-modelling techniques providing an ensemble of predictions at landscape level (four spatial resolutions: 500-m, 1-km, 2-km and 5-km radius around each sighting) for each year and raptor species to analyse the habitat suitability changes in the whole study area through three niche overlap indices. The models revealed an increase in occurrence and habitat suitability of forest raptor species coupled with a strong decrease in species associated with open habitats, mainly heaths and shrub formations. Open-habitat specialist species were negatively affected by the concomitant effects of intensive forest management and a long-lasting trend of rural abandonment coupled with an unusually high frequency of wildfires. Sustainable forest management and agricultural practices should be encouraged by both public and private sectors, through, e.g. policies related to European funds for rural and regional development (FEDER and FEADER programs) to effectively protect threatened habitats and species, and to comply with current environmental legislation. The combined use of satellite imagery and ground-level biodiversity data proved to be a cost-effective and systematic method for monitoring priority habitats and their species in highly dynamic landscapes.

T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: F-18-FDG PET/CT has high positive predictive value for the detection of avid lymph node metastases in breast cancer patients. We analysed the effect of upstaging lymph nodes by PET/CT on short-term outcome in stage II/III breast cancer patients.Patients and methods: A total of 278 stage II/III primary breast cancer patients (mean age 48.9 years, range 19-75 years) were re-staged with 18F-FDG PET/CT before start of pre-operative systemic treatment (PST). Patients were divided in three groups based on risk for local recurrence: a low - (T2N0), intermediate - (T0-2N1 and T3NO) and a high-risk group (T0-3N2-3, T3N1 and T4). Within these groups we looked at local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) within the first 3 years of followup.Results: With a median follow-up (FU) of 50 months the RFS, LRFS and OS were 87%, 88% and 92% respectively for the whole group. PET/CT upstaged 43 patients from the low- and intermediate risk group to the high-risk group, based on detection of >= 4 avid axillary nodes or occult N2/3-disease. Patients upstaged with PET/CT had more events for all three analyses compared to the original risk groups, which resulted in a significantly worse RFS (69.8%; p = 0.03) a nearly significantly worse LRFS (p = 0.052) and no effect in OS (p = 0.433).Discussion: Additional PET/CT staging allows breast cancer patients to be treated according to the true stage, still stage II/III breast cancer patients upstaged to N2/3 by PET/CT have worse short-term outcome, despite adjustment of treatment, than patients staged high-risk with conventional imaging.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is widely accepted as an important part of staging cutaneous malignant melanoma. Hybrid single photon emission computed tomography and computed tomography (SPECT/CT) may identify additional SLN and provide important information to the surgeon performing SLN biopsy. We report our experience at a major referral centre for melanoma surgery.Methods: Retrospective case series of pre-operative sentinel node lymphoscintigraphy for primary melanoma over a consecutive 12-month period. All patients had planar imaging and hybrid SPECT/CT.Results: At least 1 SLN was successfully identified in 82 of 86 eligible patients (95.3%). These 82 patients had 144 SLNs (mean 1.8). There were no patients where the SLN was seen only with SPECT/CT. Additional information was provided by SPECT/CT in 32 patients (39.0%). Histology reports were available for 52 patients, 9 (17.3%) had at least 1 SLN positive for metastatic disease.Conclusions: We achieved a high rate of SLN identification. SPECT/CT was most frequently helpful when the primary melanoma was located in the head, neck and trunk. Routine use of SPECT/CT during lymphoscintigraphy provides important anatomical information and may reduce the false-negative rate.

TI  - Neuropathic pain and quality of life after wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma: a multicentre study
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with melanoma. As survival outcomes improve, longer term quality of life questions become more pertinent and this study aims to assess the factors which may play a role following surgery. A total of, 221 patients who underwent wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma (AJCC stage I and II) were recruited from three UK centres. These patients completed a patient outcome questionnaire, which included demographic and treatment data as well as quality of life and pain questionnaires. Pain was the only significant factor influencing the quality of life with a negative correlation seen between pain and quality of life scores (P<0.001). In total, 34% of patients reported pain at their surgical site and four (1.8%) patients scored as high risk for neuropathic pain. Patients experiencing pain were significantly younger that those not reporting pain (median 55.0 vs. 63.5 years, P<0.001). Length of time since surgery did not correlate with pain nor quality of life scores. Our results suggest that following this common procedure a sizeable proportion of patients experience pain and poorer quality of life which does not improve with time. The level of pain experienced is clinically significant and merits evaluation and treatment in this group of patients who are increasingly surviving their melanoma diagnosis. Further investigation into potential prophylactic measures is suggested.

TI  - Mapping gains and losses in woody vegetation across global tropical drylands
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody vegetation in global tropical drylands is of significant importance for both the interannual variability of the carbon cycle and local livelihoods. Satellite observations over the past decades provide a unique way to assess the vegetation long-term dynamics across biomes worldwide. Yet, the actual changes in the woody vegetation are always hidden by interannual fluctuations of the leaf density, because the most widely used remote sensing data are primarily related to the photosynthetically active vegetation components. Here, we quantify the temporal trends of the nonphotosynthetic woody components (i.e., stems and branches) in global tropical drylands during 2000-2012 using the vegetation optical depth (VOD), retrieved from passive microwave observations. This is achieved by a novel method focusing on the dry season period to minimize the influence of herbaceous vegetation and using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data to remove the interannual fluctuations of the woody leaf component. We revealed significant trends (P < 0.05) in the woody component (VODwood)in 35% of the areas characterized by a nonsignificant trend in the leaf component (VODleaf modeled from NDVI), indicating pronounced gradual growth/ decline in woody vegetation not captured by traditional assessments. The method is validated using a unique record of ground measurements from the semiarid Sahel and shows a strong agreement between changes in VODwood and changes in ground observed woody cover (r(2) = 0.78). Reliability of the obtained woody component trends is also supported by a review of relevant literatures for eight hot spot regions of change. The proposed approach is expected to contribute to an improved assessment of, for example, changes in dryland carbon pools.

TI  - Estimating and mapping chlorophyll content for a heterogeneous grassland: Comparing prediction power of a suite of vegetation indices across scales between years
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the performance of existing vegetation indices for retrieving chlorophyll content for a semi-arid mixed grass prairie ecosystem across scales using in situ data collected in 2012 and 2013. A 144 published broadband (21) and narrowband (123) vegetation indices are evaluated to estimate chlorophyll content. Results indicate that narrowband indices utilize reflectance data from one or more wavelengths in the red-edge region (similar to 690-750 nm) perform better. Broadband indices are found to be as effective as narrowband indices for chlorophyll content estimation at both leaf and canopy scales. The empirical relationships are generally stronger at the canopy than the leaf scale, attributable to the fact that leaf samples are collected during the peak growing season when chlorophyll in plant species are uniform. SPOT-5 and CASI-550 derived chlorophyll maps result in map accuracies of 63.56% and 78.88% respectively. The assessment of vegetation chlorophylls at the canopy level, especially using remote sensing imagery is important for providing information pertaining to ecosystem health such as the physiological status, productivity, or phenology of vegetation.

TI  - Risk factors associated with the development of perinatal asphyxia in neonates at the Hospital Universitario del Valle, Cali, Colombia, 2010-2011
T2  - BIOMEDICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Perinatal asphyxia is one of the main causes of perinatal mortality and morbidity worldwide and it generates high costs for health systems; however, it has modifiable risk factors.Objective: To identify the risk factors associated with the development of perinatal asphyxia in newborns at Hospital Universitario del Valle, Cali, Colombia.Materials and methods: Incident cases and concurrent controls were examined. Cases were defined as newborns with moderate to severe perinatal asphyxia who were older than or equal to 36 weeks of gestational age, needed advanced resuscitation and presented one of the following: early neurological disorders, multi-organ commitment or a sentinel event. The controls were newborns without asphyxia who were born one week apart from the case at the most and had a comparable gestational age. Patients with major congenital malformations and syndromes were excluded.Results: Fifty-six cases and 168 controls were examined. Premature placental abruption (OR=41.09; 95%CI: 4.61-366.56), labor with a prolonged expulsive phase (OR=31.76; 95%CI: 8.33-121.19), lack of oxytocin use (OR=2.57; 95% CI: 1.08 - 6.13) and mothers without a partner (OR=2.56; 95% CI: 1.21-5.41) were risk factors for the development of perinatal asphyxia in the study population. Social difficulties were found in a greater proportion among the mothers of cases.Conclusions: Proper control and monitoring of labor, development of a thorough partograph, and active searches are recommended to ensure that all pregnant women have adequate prenatal care with the provision of social support to reduce the frequency and negative impact of perinatal asphyxia.

TI  - Irrigation management with remote sensing: Evaluating irrigation requirement for maize under Mediterranean climate condition
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use control methods and water resources planning are of high priority. In irrigated agriculture, the right way to save water is to increase water use efficiency through better management. The present work validates procedures and methodologies using remote sensing to determine the water availability in the soil at each moment, giving the opportunity for the application of the water depth strictly necessary to optimise crop growth (optimum irrigation timing and irrigation amount). The analysis is applied to the Irrigation District of Divor, Evora, using 7 experimental plots, which are areas irrigated by centre pivot systems, cultivated to maize. Data were determined from images of the cultivated surface obtained by satellite and integrated with atmosphere and crop parameters to calculate biophysical indicators and indices of water stress in the vegetation Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Kc, and Kcb. Therefore, evapotranspiration (ETc) was estimated and used to calculate crop water requirement, together with the opportunity and the amount of irrigation water to allocate. Although remote sensing data available from satellite imagery presented some practical constraints, the study could contribute to the validation of a new methodology that can be used for irrigation management of a large irrigated area, easier and at lower costs than the traditional FAO recommended crop coefficients method. The remote sensing based methodology can also contribute to significant saves of irrigation water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Photoacoustic imaging is an emerging hybrid imaging modality that can provide multicontrast, multiscale imaging of biological features ranging from organelles to organs. The three major embodiments of photoacoustic imaging are microscopy, endoscopy, and computed tomography. Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) or photoacoustic computed tomography allows deep-tissue imaging, and hence it is more suitable for whole body preclinical/clinical imaging applications. Due to fast- growing laser technology and ultrasound detector technology, PAT is evolving rapidly, leading to a quicker translation into clinical trials. We review the recent developments of PAT systems and their applications in preclinical and clinical practices. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - An 88-year-old Caucasian man recently sought medical attention due to recrudescence of skin disease in the area of previously excised nodule (in 2002) on the nose dorsum. The original lesion was clinically considered as a pigmented basal cell carcinoma, after which histological examination revealed a superficial spreading melanoma in vertical growth face (Clark level IV; Breslow thickness 2.1 mm) arising from a pre-existing nevus. The adjacent skin also showed significant actinic damage both in the epidermis and in the dermis. A sentinel node was positive (micrometastases of melanoma) and radical lymph node dissection of the neck was performed. Other lymph nodes did not contain metastasis. Computed tomography scans of brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis performed at that time showed no evidence of systemic disease.

TI  - Mobilizing master narratives through categorical narratives and categorical statements when default identities are at stake
T2  - DISCOURSE & COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In research interviews, interviewees are usually well aware of why they were selected, and in their narratives they often construct default identities' in line with the interviewers' expectations. Furthermore, narrators draw on shared cultural knowledge and master narratives that tend to form an implicit backdrop of their stories. Yet in this article we focus on how some of these master narratives may be mobilized explicitly when default identities are at stake. In particular, we investigate interviews with successful female professionals from diverse geographical contexts. We found that the interviewees deal with challenges to their successful professional' identities by drawing on categorical narratives or categorical statements. As such, the interviewees talk into being a morally ordered gendered worldview, thus making explicit gendered master narratives about their societies and workplaces. In general, this article shows that categorical narratives and statements can bring (the typically rather elusive) master narratives to the surface and that these can thus contribute to the narrators' identity work.

TI  - Modeling uncertainties in estimation of canopy LAI from hyperspectral remote sensing data A Bayesian approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing data carry information on the leaf area index (LAI) of forests, and thus in principle, LAI can be estimated based on the data by inverting a forest reflectance model. However, LAI is usually not the only unknown in a reflectance model; especially, the leaf spectral albedo and understory reflectance are also not known. If the uncertainties of these parameters are not accounted for, the inversion of a forest reflectance model can lead to biased estimates for LAI. In this paper, we study the effects of reflectance model uncertainties on LAI estimates, and further, investigate whether the LAI estimates could recover from these uncertainties with the aid of Bayesian inference. In the proposed approach, the unknown leaf albedo and understory reflectance are estimated simultaneously with LAI from hyperspectral remote sensing data. The feasibility of the approach is tested with numerical simulation studies. The results show that in the presence of unknown parameters, the Bayesian LAI estimates which account for the model uncertainties outperform the conventional estimates that are based on biased model parameters. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the Bayesian inference can also provide feasible measures for the uncertainty of the estimated LAI. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mexican pre Columbian culture is one of the great six mother civilisations but, compared with the Indian or Chinese ones, is far less known in the West. This culture had a notable richness and complexity that, from theoretical and scientific knowledge, led to applied science, producing important technological applications, such as astronomical observatories and calendars. These were at the same time also expression of human and ethical values, within a general idea of a somehow dualistic Universe, based on the struggle between contraries - light and darkness, life and death, male and female - that finally lead to a vision that one may define as theological. Our partial and segmented knowledge of Mexican Pre Columbian culture tends to converge into a unitarian vision that may, for some reason, be called 'systemic'.

AB  - This study aimed at comparing the surveillance program of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV1) as laid down by EU Decision 2004/558/EC and 2007/584/EC ('conventional design') with an alternative design. The alternative design was based on monthly bulk-milk testing, clinical surveillance and a risk-based component that involves testing of animals that are purchased from non-free cattle herds. Scenario-tree analyses were carried out to determine sensitivities of the surveillance system (and its components) and the monthly confidence of freedom on herd-level. Also, the expected costs per surveillance design and components thereof were calculated. Results showed that the conventional (EU) and alternative surveillance designs to obtain a BHV1-free status performed equally well in terms of sensitivity. However, total costs per cattle herd to obtain a free status were highest in the conventional design. In an endemic situation and with a within-herd design prevalence of 10%, the conventional design led to a varying probability of freedom ranging from 99.6% to 100% per month. With the alternative design, in this situation, a constant probability of freedom of >99.9% per month was found. In a disease-free situation, both designs performed equally well (probability of freedom >99.9% per month). The yearly costs per farm for monitoring the disease-free status decreased by approximately 25% in the alternative design. The alternative strategy based on monthly bulk-milk monitoring therefore was deemed most cost-effective. This study showed that the surveillance regime to attain and maintain a BHV1-free status as described by EU-legislation can be improved to reduce the monitoring costs without reduction of the system's sensitivity, given a within-herd design prevalence of 10%. The assessment of various surveillance designs could be highly useful to support decision-making towards a more risk-based approach of animal health surveillance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Severity of a mountain pine beetle outbreak across a range of stand conditions in Fraser Experimental Forest, Colorado, United States
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreaks had unprecedented effects on lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) in western North America. We used data from 165 forest inventory plots to analyze stand conditions that regulate lodgepole pine mortality across a wide range of stand structure and species composition at the Fraser Experimental Forest in Colorado, USA. Forest inventory data were then combined with Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) imagery and boosted regression trees modeling to map outbreak severity (proportion of basal area killed). The outbreak severity map was evaluated with training (pseudo-R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.13) and independent test plots (pseudo-R-2 = 0.42, RMSE = 0.27). This map was used to compare pine mortality in regenerating clearcuts and mature stands, which would have been problematic otherwise since regenerating clearcuts were underrepresented in the forest inventory data. Mortality spanned from 0 to 99% of stand basal area, proportional to the abundance of pine in surveyed stands. During the outbreak, mortality was highest for larger-diameter trees; however, contrary to earlier outbreaks, beetles also attacked younger stands. Pine mortality was lower in stands regenerating from clearcut harvests conducted between 1954 and 1985 than in mature stands and was more closely related to topographic factors than stand age or clearcut size; mortality was highest on southerly aspects and lower elevation sites, favorable to lodgepole pine. The best predictors for mapping outbreak severity were the change in the Normalized Difference Moisture Index between pre- and end-of-outbreak imagery and the end-of-outbreak ETM+ band 5. A better understanding of mortality patterns relative to forest management can inform management planning and assessment of the influence of bark beetle outbreaks on ecosystem processes.

AB  - The primary objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis (Cfv) and Tritrichomonas foetus in breeding bulls from a sentinel cohort of cow-calf herds in western Canada and to estimate the association between positive test status and non-pregnancy. The final objective was to evaluate the application of these tests when: i) screening bulls in the absence of a recognized problem with reproductive performance, and ii) testing for diagnosis of poor pregnancy rates. The crude apparent bull prevalence for Cfv was 1.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5% to 2.1%; 8/735] and herd prevalence was 2.6% (95% CI: 0.3% to 9.0%; 2/78). The crude apparent bull prevalence for T. foetus was, 0.001% (95% CI: 0.0% to 0.5%; 0/735) and herd prevalence was < 0.001% (95% CI: 0.0% to 4.6%; 0/78). Cows from herds where at least 1 bull was test positive for Cfv were 2.35 times more likely (95% CI: 1.01% to 5.48%; P = 0.047) to not be pregnant than those with no positive bulls. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of preputial material collected into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was recommended for screening for T. foetus when the pre-test probability of infection was > 1%. The same test for Cfv was not recommended for screening moderate- and low-risk herds due to the high risk of false positives. Tests for both T. foetus and Cfv can be used to investigate herds with reproductive problems when also ruling out other risk factors. Regardless of the type of test used, however, 3 negative tests are required to rule out infection in high-risk situations.

TI  - Fallow-land Algorithm based on Neighborhood and Temporal Anomalies (FANTA) to map planted <i>versus</i> fallowed croplands using MODIS data to assist in drought studies leading to water and food security assessments
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An important metric to monitor for optimizing water use in agricultural areas is the amount of cropland left fallowed, or unplanted. Fallowed croplands are difficult to model because they have many expressions; for example, they can be managed and remain free of vegetation or be abandoned and become weedy if the climate for that season permits. We used 250m, 8-day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index data to develop an algorithm that can routinely map cropland status (planted or fallowed) with over 75% user's and producer's accuracies. The Fallow-land Algorithm based on Neighborhood and Temporal Anomalies (FANTA) compares the current greenness of a cultivated pixel to its historical greenness and to the greenness of all cultivated pixels within a defined spatial neighborhood, and is therefore transportable across space and through time. This article introduces FANTA and applies it to California from 2001 to 2015 as a case study for use in data-poor places and for use in historical modeling. Timely and accurate knowledge of the extent of fallowing can provide decision makers with insights and knowledge to mitigate the impacts of drought and provide a scientific basis for effective management response. This study is part of the WaterSMART (Sustain and Manage America's Resources for Tomorrow) project, an interdisciplinary and collaborative research effort focused on improving water conservation and optimizing water use.

TI  - Ecological Worldview among Urban Design Professionals
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The built environment is responsible for a large proportion of the global use of energy, natural resources, and emissions. Architects and other urban design professionals are key actors in the building process whose behavior and decisions will influence these impacts. Because environmental attitudes are linked to pro-environmental behavior, this study aims to measure environmental worldview among urban design professionals involved in the architectural competition 'A New City Center for Kiruna'. The mean score registered for the New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) scale was 3.68 (standard deviation 0.51) and there were no significant differences with regard to age (mean 41.3 years) or gender (64.7% males). The ecological worldview of the participants was similar to most other samples from diverse countries, but a lower score was reported in comparison to environmentalists. The score ranged from 2.53 to 4.67 which shows heterogeneity at an individual level. Thus, future efforts to improve environmental attitudes among urban design professionals are needed.

TI  - Improved Line Tracing Methods for Removal of Bad Streaks Noise in CCD Line Array Image-A Case Study with GF-1 Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images could provide us with tremendous quantities of large-scale information. Noise artifacts (stripes), however, made the images inappropriate for vitalization and batch process. An effective restoration method would make images ready for further analysis. In this paper, a new method is proposed to correct the stripes and bad abnormal pixels in charge-coupled device (CCD) linear array images. The method involved a line tracing method, limiting the location of noise to a rectangular region, and corrected abnormal pixels with the Lagrange polynomial algorithm. The proposed detection and restoration method were applied to Gaofen-1 satellite (GF-1) images, and the performance of this method was evaluated by omission ratio and false detection ratio, which reached 0.6% and 0%, respectively. This method saved 55.9% of the time, compared with traditional method.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring of desertification in the Tarim Basin based on RS and GIS techniques
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tarim Basin is one of the regions with the most serious land desertification in China. In this study, the spatial and temporal variations of land desertification in the Tarim Basin during 2000-2014 were monitored and analyzed using RS and GIS technologies based on the vegetation coverage from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data of MODIS. Besides, the impacts of climate change and human activities on the desertification for the Tarim Basin were investigated. The results showed that: (1) The Tarim Basin was characterized by the largest proportion of severe desertification (64.63%), followed by moderate desertification (17.70%), and slight desertification (9.95%), and non-desertification was the least (4.18%). The gravity center of the severe desertification migrated to the northeast part in the past 15 years, with a migration distance of 21.08 km. (2) During the past 15 years, the severe desertification area decreased at a rate of 0.0076 km(2) . a(-1). However, the moderate desertification area increased rapidly, with an average annual rate of 0.0169 km(2) . a(-1), the slight desertification area had a slightly increasing trend with a rate of 0.0093 km(2) . a(-1), and the proportion of non. desertification increased significantly with a rate of 0.0289 km(2) . a(-1). (3) The changes of desertification were the results of the interaction of climate change and land-use change. Annual precipitation was closely related to annual average vegetation coverage with a correlation coefficient of 0.45. At the sametime, the expansion of cultivated land area, which had increased by 13.18x10(3) km(2) during the last 15 years, accelerated the desertification processes of the peripheral oasis area.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we constructed an exploration target model for volcanogenic massive sulfide and hydro thermal deposits in Honghai district (China) using moderate resolution ETM+, ASTER, and hyperspectral Hyperion images and high resolution ZY-3 images, and weights-of-evidence (WofE) analysis and concentration-area (C-A) fractal modeling. The methodology and mapping steps were: (1) ETM + images were used to extract hydroxyl and iron-oxide alterations for identification of linear and ring fault structures and prospective zones in regional scale; (2) ASTER images were used to extract SiO2 index, kaolinite, chlorite, propylite, potassium, carbonate, and limonite alterations for identification of mineralization zones in district scale; (3) hyperspectral Hyperion images were analyzed to identify mineral components for identification of Cu-Au deposit zones in district scale; (4) high resolution ZY-3 images were used to extract geological objects (e.g., volcanic rocks, integration, and linear and ring fault structures) and cross-validate multiple type alterations and their associations with lithological strata based on interpretation of ETM+ and ASTER images; (5) alteration/structural factors and geological objects were integrated for mineral prospectivity mapping by WofE analysis, and mineral prospectivity was classified by (C-A) fractal modeling. Ring faults, iron-oxide alteration, chlorite alteration and silicification are important exploration factors, whereas carbonate alteration, potassic alteration, and linear faults are secondary exploration factors. Ten exploration targets were recognized in the Honghai district. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping 2000-2010 Impervious Surface Change in India Using Global Land Survey Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and monitoring the environmental impacts of global urbanization requires better urban datasets. Continuous field impervious surface change (ISC) mapping using Landsat data is an effective way to quantify spatiotemporal dynamics of urbanization. It is well acknowledged that Landsat-based estimation of impervious surface is subject to seasonal and phenological variations. The overall goal of this paper is to map 2000-2010 ISC for India using Global Land Survey datasets and training data only available for 2010. To this end, a method was developed that could transfer the regression tree model developed for mapping 2010 impervious surface to 2000 using an iterative training and prediction (ITP) approachAn independent validation dataset was also developed using Google Earth (TM) imagery. Based on the reference ISC from the validation dataset, the RMSE of predicted ISC was estimated to be 18.4%. At 95% confidence, the total estimated ISC for India between 2000 and 2010 is 2274.62 +/- 7.84 km(2).

TI  - Comparison of IMERG Level-3 and TMPA 3B42V7 in Estimating Typhoon-Related Heavy Rain
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoon-related heavy rain has unique structures in both time and space, and use of satellite-retrieved products to delineate the structure of heavy rain is especially meaningful for early warning systems and disaster management. This study compares two newly-released satellite products from the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG final run) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA 3B42V7) with daily rainfall observed by ground rain gauges. The comparison is implemented for eight typhoons over the coastal region of China for a two-year period from 2014 to 2015. The results show that all correlation coefficients (CCs) of both IMERG and TMPA for the investigated typhoon events are significant at the 0.01 level, but they tend to underestimate the heavy rainfall, especially around the storm center. The IMERG final run exhibits an overall better performance than TMPA 3B42V7. It is also shown that both products have a better applicability (i.e., a smaller absolute relative bias) when rain intensities are within 20-40 and 80-100 mm/day than those of 40-80 mm/day and larger than 100 mm/day. In space, they generally have the best applicability within the range of 50-100 km away from typhoon tracks, and have the worst applicability beyond the 300-km range. The results are beneficial to understand the errors of satellite data in operational applications, such as storm monitoring and hydrological modeling.

TI  - Slip Model for the 25 November 2016 Mw 6.6 Aketao Earthquake, Western China, Revealed by Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 25 November 2016 (UTC 14:24:30), an Mw 6.6 dextral strike-slip earthquake ruptured Aketao county in the northwestern portion of the Kongur Shan extensional system, western China. We extracted surface deformation maps and investigated the distribution of the coseismic slip of the 2016 Aketao earthquake by exploiting the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data imaged by the Sentinel-1 satellites of the European Space Agency and the ALOS-2 satellite of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency. Assuming the crust of the earth is an elastic half-space homogeneous medium, the best fitting slip model suggests a dip angle of 78 degrees for the seismogenic fault. The rupture of the 2016 Aketao earthquake may have consisted of two sub-events that occurred in rapid succession within a few seconds, resulting in two large discrete asperities with maximum slip of similar to 0.85 m, which were separated by a similar to 6 km-wide small slip gap. The maximum slip for the sub-event near the epicenter was mainly concentrated at a depth of similar to 10 km and that of the other at a depth of similar to 5 km. The estimated total seismic moment from the optimal slip model is 1.58 x 10(19) N.m, corresponding to an event with a moment magnitude of 6.74. More than 65% of the aftershocks occurred in the areas of increased Coulomb failure stress, in which the stress was estimated to have been increased by at least 0.1 bar. Matching the potential barrier on the fault with the depth distribution of aftershocks implies that friction on the causative fault was heterogeneous, which may play a primary role in controlling the active behavior of the Muji fault.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation phenology change and relationships with climate in the two transects of East China
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in vegetation phenology due to global climate change directly impact the dynamic balance of terrestrial carbon and nutrients and the biodiversity pattern, and send feedbacks to climate system. It is crucial to understand spatiotemporal patterns and mechanisms of vegetation phenology change and their relationship with climatic change. In this paper, we quantified the spatiotemporal patterns of start and end of growing season for seven vegetation types in Northeast China Transect (NECT) and North-South Transect of East China (NSTEC) during 2001-2013 using MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The integral of EVI during growing season was also calculated as an additional phenological index. We then proceeded to analyze the relationship between the three phenological metrics and climate variables including daytime and nighttime temperature and precipitation. To study the temporal phenological trend of deciduous broadleaved forest in northeast China, we identified stands of deciduous broadleaved forest without land cover changes during 2001-2013 and derived the slopes of temporal changes in phenological metrics. Regression was applied to quantify the relationship between phenological trends and trends of climate variables.The vegetation types along the two transects in eastern China have distinctly different phenological characteristics and the strength of climate modulations on phenology varies among vegetation types. The study of temporal trend of phenological changes of the deciduous broadleaved forest in northeast China revealed that nighttime temperature is the most important driver. Increasing in nighttime temperature in spring tends to advance the start of growing season, while increasing in nighttime temperature during growing season tends to delay the growing season. Cold daytime prior to growing season also favors advanced start of growing season. On the other hand, summer nighttime temperature tends to bring down, whereas precipitation tends to enhance, the maximum EVI and hence the EVI integral as the latter is mostly determined by maximum EVI and to a less extent by length of growing season.

TI  - Large Differences between Glaciers 3D Surface Extents and 2D Planar Areas in Central Tianshan
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Most glaciers in China lie in high mountainous environments and have relatively large surface slopes. Common analyses consider glaciers' projected areas (2D Area) in a two-dimensional plane, which are much smaller than glacier's topographic surface extents (3D Area). The areal difference between 2D planar areas and 3D surface extents exceeds 5% when the glacier's surface slope is larger than 18 degrees. In this study, we establish a 3D model in the Muzart Glacier catchment using ASTER GDEM data. This model is used to quantify the areal difference between glaciers' 2D planar areas and their 3D surface extents in various slope zones and elevation bands by using the second Chinese Glacier Inventory (CGI2). Finally, we analyze the 2D and 3D area shrinking rate between 2007 and 2013 in Central Tianshan using glaciers derived from Landsat images by an object-based classification approach. This approach shows an accuracy of 89% when it validates by comparison of glaciers derived from Landsat and high spatial resolution GeoEye images. The extracted glaciers in 2007 also have an agreement of 89% with CGI2 data in the Muzart Glacier catchment. The glaciers' 3D area is 34.2% larger than their 2D area from CGI2 in the Muzart Glacier catchment and by 27.9% in the entire Central Tianshan. Most underestimation occurs in the elevation bands of 4000-5000 m above sea level (a.s.l.). The 3D glacier areas reduced by 30 and 115 km(2) between 2007 and 2013 in the Muzart Glacier catchment and Central Tianshan, being 37.0% and 27.6% larger than their 2D areas reduction, respectively. The shrinking rates decrease with elevation increase.

TI  - Interference of Heavy Aerosol Loading on the VIIRS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) Retrieval Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been widely used in climate research, atmospheric environmental observations, and other applications. However, high AOD retrieval remains challenging over heavily polluted regions, such as the North China Plain (NCP). The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which was designed as a successor to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), will undertake the aerosol observations mission in the coming years. Using the VIIRS AOD retrieval algorithm as an example, we analyzed the influence of heavy aerosol loading through the 6SV radiative transfer model (RTM) with a focus on three aspects: cloud masking, ephemeral water body tests, and data quality estimation. First, certain pixels were mistakenly screened out as clouds and ephemeral water bodies because of heavy aerosols, resulting in the loss of AOD retrievals. Second, the greenness of the surface could not be accurately identified by the top of atmosphere (TOA) index, and the quality of the aggregation data may be artificially high. Thus, the AOD retrieval algorithm did not perform satisfactorily, indicated by the low availability of data coverage (at least 37.97% of all data records were missing according to ground-based observations) and overestimation of the data quality (high-quality data increased from 63.42% to 80.97% according to radiative simulations). To resolve these problems, the implementation of a spatial variability cloud mask method and surficial index are suggested in order to improve the algorithm.

TI  - Can Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Be Spared in Papillary Carcinoma of the Breast?
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the clinicopathologic features of 99 cases of papillary carcinoma (PC). One patient had sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis, two. patients had recurred locally, and none exhibited distant metastases or disease-related death. PC rarely involves the lymph nodes, even in tumors with an associated frank invasive component. We propose that evaluation of SLN is not routinely indicated for PC cases.Background: Papillary carcinoma (PC) of the breast represents similar to 0.5% of all newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer and usually has an indolent course. The current data suggest lack of a consensus in the surgical management of this disease. Because patients can occasionally develop metastatic disease, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is often performed during surgery. Materials and Methods: In the present study, we retrospectively evaluated the histologic characteristics of 99 cases of PC with or without associated frank invasive carcinoma, including 43 encapsulated or intracystic PCs, 24 solid PCs, and 32 intraductal PCs, and correlated these with the incidence of nodal metastasis. Results: Of the 99 cases, 64 were tumor stage Tis (noninvasive), 5 were T1 microinvasive, 17 T1 a, 5 T1b, 5 T1c, and 3 were T2. A total of 37 patients (37%) underwent axillary staging, including 31 SLN biopsies and 6 axillary dissections. Only 1 patient (2.7%) with noninvasive solid PC had evidence of nodal metastasis. Follow-up information was available for 81 patients, with a mean follow-up period of 4.9 years (range, 1-13 years). Two local recurrences, no distant metastases, and no disease-related deaths were recorded. Conclusion: PC rarely involves the lymph nodes even in tumors with an associated frank invasive component, and the overall prognosis and long-term survival is excellent. We propose that evaluation of the SLN should not be routinely indicated for patients with PC treated by local control lumpectomy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Planar Cell Polarity Effector Fritz Interacts with Dishevelled and Has Multiple Functions in Regulating PCP
T2  - G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Planar cell Polarity Effector (PPE) genes inturned, fuzzy, and fritz are downstream components in the frizzled/starry night signaling pathway, and their function is instructed by upstream Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) core genes such as frizzled and dishevelled. PPE proteins accumulate asymmetrically in wing cells and function in a protein complex mediated by direct interactions between In and Frtz and In and Fy. How the PCP proteins instruct the accumulation of PPE protein is unknown. We found a likely direct interaction between Dishevelled and Fritz and Dishevelled and Fuzzy that could play a role in this. We previously found that mild overexpression of frtz rescued a weak in allele. To determine if this was due to extra Frtz stabilizing mutant In or due to Frtz being able to bypass the need for In we generate a precise deletion of the inturned gene (in(PD)). We found that mild overexpression of Fritz partially rescued in(PD), indicating that fritz has In independent activity in PCP. Previous studies of PPE proteins used fixed tissues, and did not provide any insights into the dynamic properties of PPE proteins. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to edit the fritz gene to add a green fluorescent protein tag. fritz(mNeonGreen) provides complete rescue activity and works well for in vivo imaging. Our data showed that Fritz is very dynamic in epidermal cells and preferentially distributed to discrete membrane subdomains (puncta). Surprisingly, we found it in stripes in developing bristles.

TI  - A Technique of Endoscopic Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy for Breast Cancer.
T2  - JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) is a widely accepted surgical technique for patients with early breast cancer. The technique improves cosmetic outcomes, but a decrease in nipple sensitivity has been observed with NSM because of the incision into the nipple-areola complex (NAC). Endoscopic nipple-sparing mastectomy with skin lifting system (ENSMSLS) removes all breast tissue through the axillary incision used for the sentinel lymph node biopsy, to avoid incision around the NAC area. With only one incision, NAC sensitivity is less likely to be affected by this technique. We sought to investigate the effect of ENSMSLS on sensation in the NAC, compared with NSM.METHODS: A single-institution retrospective review was performed from August 2014 through August 2015. Thirty patients who underwent NSM in the past 6 years were frequency matched for age and cancer stage with those who underwent ENSMSLS between 2014 and 2015. All patients were recalled and re-examined for the study. Patients from the ENSMSLS group were recalled twice at both 3 and 6 months after surgery. Matched control subjects who underwent NSM were examined when they were recalled. The sensations of pressure, temperature, and vibration were measured.RESULTS: Patients who underwent ENSMSLS were significantly less likely to have decreased or impaired sensations of pressure, temperature, and vibration compared those who had NSM. The improvement in preservation of sensations by the use of ENSMSLS was very impressive.CONCLUSIONS: ENSMSLS, which avoids incision around the NAC, significantly decreases the possibility of decline in NAC sensation.

TI  - Band-to-Band Misregistration of the Images of MODIS Onboard Calibrators and Its Impact on Calibration
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments aboard Terra and Aqua satellites are radiometrically calibrated on-orbit with a set of onboard calibrators (OBCs), including a solar diffuser, a blackbody, and a space view port through which the detectors can view the dark space. As a whisk-broom scanning spectroradiometer, 36 MODIS spectral bands are assembled in the along-scan direction on four focal plane assemblies (FPAs). These bands capture images of the same target sequentially with the motion of a scan mirror. Then the images are coregistered onboard by delaying the appropriate band-dependent amount of time, depending on the band locations on the FPA. While this coregistration mechanism is functioning well for the "far-field" remote targets such as earth view scenes or the moon, noticeable band-to-band misregistration in the along-scan direction has been observed for "near field" targets, particularly in OBCs. In this paper, the misregistration phenomenon is presented and analyzed. It is concluded that the root cause of the misregistration is that the rotating element of the instrument, the scan mirror, is displaced from the focus of the telescope primary mirror. The amount of the misregistration is proportional to the band location on the FPA and is inversely proportional to the distance between the target and the scan mirror. The impact of this misregistration on the calibration of MODIS bands is discussed. In particular, the calculation of the detector gain coefficient m(1) of bands 8-16 (412-870 nm) is improved by up to 1.5% for Aqua MODIS.

TI  - Evaluation of the Ozone Fields in NASA's MERRA-2 Reanalysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The assimilated ozone product from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), produced at NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) spanning the time period from 1980 to the present is described herein, and its quality is assessed. MERRA-2 assimilates partial column ozone retrievals from a series of Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Radiometer (SBUV) instruments on NASA and NOAA spacecraft between January 1980 and September 2004: starting in October 2004, retrieved ozone profiles from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and total column ozone from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on NASA's EOS Aura satellite are assimilated. The MERRA-2 ozone is compared with independent satellite and ozonesonde data, focusing on the representation of the spatial and temporal variability of stratospheric and upper-tropospheric ozone and on implications of the change in the observing system from SBUV to EOS Aura. The comparisons show agreement within 10% (standard deviation of the difference) between MERRA-2 profiles and independent satellite data in most of the stratosphere. The agreement improves after 2004, when EOS Aura data are assimilated. The standard deviation of the differences between the lower-stratospheric and upper-tropospheric MERRA-2 ozone and ozonesondes is 11.2% and 24.5%, respectively, with correlations of 0.8 and above, indicative of a realistic representation of the near-tropopause ozone variability in MERRA-2. The agreement improves significantly in the EOS Aura period; however, MERRA-2 is biased low in the upper troposphere with respect to the ozonesondes. Caution is recommended when using MERRA-2 ozone for decadal changes and trend studies.

TI  - A Glacier Surge of Bivachny Glacier, Pamir Mountains, Observed by a Time Series of High-Resolution Digital Elevation Models and Glacier Velocities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surge-type glaciers are characterised by relatively short phases of enhanced ice transport and mass redistribution after a comparatively long quiescent phase when the glacier is virtually inactive. This unstable behaviour makes it difficult to assess the influence of climate change on those glaciers. We describe the evolution of the most recent surge of Bivachny Glacier in the Pamir Mountains, Tajikistan between 2011 and 2015 with respect to changes in its topography and dynamics. For the relevant time span, nine digital elevation models were derived from TanDEM-X data; optical satellite data (Landsat 5, 7 and 8, EO-1) as well as synthetic aperture radar data (TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X) were used to analyse ice flow velocities. The comparison of the topography at the beginning of the surge with the one observed by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission in 2000 revealed a thickening in the upper part of the ablation area of the glacier and a thinning further down the glacier as is typically observed during the quiescent phase. During the active phase, a surge bulge measuring up to around 80 m developed and travelled downstream for a distance of 13 km with a mean velocity of 4400 m year(-1). Ice flow velocities increased from below 90 m year(-1) duringthe quiescent phase in 2000 to up to 3400 m year 1 in spring 2014. After reaching the confluence with Fedchenko Glacier, the surge slowed down until it completely terminated in 2015. The observed seasonality of the glacier velocities with a regular speed-up during the onset of the melt period suggests a hydrological control of the surge related to the effectiveness of the subglacial drainage system.

TI  - Sentinel-Lymph-Node-Based Management or Routine Axillary Clearance? Five-Year Outcomes of the RACS Sentinel Node Biopsy Versus Axillary Clearance (SNAC) 1 Trial: Assessment and Incidence of True Lymphedema
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. To determine whether the benefits of sentinel-node-based management (SNBM) over routine axillary clearance (RAC) persisted to 5 years.Methods. A total of 1088 women with breast cancer less than 3 cm in diameter and clinically negative axillary nodes were randomized to SNBM with axillary clearance if the sentinel node was positive or RAC preceded by sentinel-node biopsy. The outcomes were: (1) objectively measured change in the volume of the operated and contralateral nonoperated arms; (2) the proportion with an increase in arm volume < 15%; and (3) subjectively assessed arm morbidity for the domains swelling, symptoms, dysfunction, and disability. Assessments were performed at 1 and 6 months after surgery and then annually.Results. Limb volume increased progressively in the operated and nonoperated arms for 2 years and persisted unchanged to year 5, accompanied by weight gain. Correction by change in the nonoperated arm showed a mean volume increase of 70 mL in the RAC group and 26 mL in the SNBM group (P < 0.001) at 5 years. Only 28 patients (3.3%) had a corrected increase > 15% from baseline (RAC 5.0% vs. SNBM 1.7%). Significant predictors were surgery type (RAC vs. SNBM), obesity, diabetes, palpable tumor, and weight gain exceeding 10% of baseline value.Conclusions. Subjective assessments revealed persisting patient concerns about swelling and symptoms but not overall disability at 5 years. Subjective scores were only moderately correlated with volume increase. SNAC1 has demonstrated that objective morbidity and subjective morbidity persist for 5 years after surgery and that SNBM significantly lowers the risk of both.

TI  - An operational analysis system for the global diurnal cycle of sea surface temperature: implementation and validation
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - An operational system for producing a global diurnally varying analysis of skin sea-surface temperature (SST) has been developed at the Met Office. Skin SST is formulated as the sum of a foundation temperature, a warm-layer temperature difference, and a thermal skin temperature difference. Foundation temperature is taken from the Operational Sea surface Temperature and sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) system, while numerical models are used for the warm layer and thermal skin layer. Both the thermal skin layer and warm-layer models are forced using outputs from the Met Office's numerical weather prediction system. Data assimilation is used to improve estimates of the warm layer, with observations coming from the geostationary SEVIRI and GOES-W instruments, as well as the polar orbiting NOAA-AVHRR sensors. The SST observations of these instruments are converted to observations of the warm-layer temperature difference by subtracting an instrument-specific foundation SST calculated using just night-time data from that sensor. A quality control procedure removes warm-layer observations where the satellite-specific foundation estimates are less robust due to lack of data. Validation of the analysis system has been performed by comparing the model to the assimilated satellite data, and to independent near-surface observations from Argo floats. The mean state of the system was assessed via a comparison to a climatology generated from drifting buoys. Results from the validation show that the system does a good job of replicating the climatology and that assimilation improves the analysis when assessed against Argo. However, the system has been found to underestimate the diurnal range of skin SST by approximately 0.1-0.3 degrees C on average. Data from the system are available free of charge from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service.

TI  - Does nonlocal women's attendance at antenatal clinics distort HIV prevalence surveillance estimates in pregnant women in Zimbabwe?
T2  - AIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The objective was to assess whether HIV prevalence measured among women attending antenatal clinics (ANCs) are representative of prevalence in the local area, or whether estimates may be biased by some women's choice to attend ANCs away from their residential location. We tested the hypothesis that HIV prevalence in towns and periurban areas is underestimated in ANC sentinel surveillance data in Zimbabwe.Methods: National unlinked anonymous HIV surveillance was conducted at 19 ANCs in Zimbabwe in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, and 2012. This data was used to compare HIV prevalence and nonlocal attendance levels at ANCs at city, town, periurban, and rural clinics in aggregate and also for individual ANCs.Results: In 2000, HIV prevalence at town ANCs (36.6%, 95% CI 34.4-38.9%) slightly underestimated prevalence among urban women attending these clinics (40.7%, 95% CI 37.6-43.9%). However, there was no distortion in HIV prevalence at either the aggregate clinic location or at individual clinics in more recent surveillance rounds. HIV prevalence was consistently higher in towns and periurban areas than in rural areas. Nonlocal attendance was high at town (26-39%) and periurban (53-95%) ANCs but low at city clinics (<10%). However, rural women attending ANCs in towns and periurban areas had higher HIV prevalence than rural women attending rural clinics, and were younger, more likely to be single, and less likely to be housewives.Conclusions: :In Zimbabwe, HIV prevalence among ANC attendees provides reliable estimates of HIV prevalence in pregnant women in the local area.

TI  - Magnetic Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Prostate Cancer after intraprostatic Injection of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles
T2  - AKTUELLE UROLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - In prostate cancer, reliable information about the lymph node status is of great importance for accurate staging and the optimal planning of treatment. Despite recent advances in imaging, the histological detection of metastases, or pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND), continues to be the most reliable method for lymph node staging in clinically localised prostate cancer, especially as this procedure enables the detection of small or micrometastases. Radioisotope-guided sentinel PLND (sPLND) demonstrates high sensitivity in the detection of lymph node metastases as well as low morbidity in prostate cancer because of the targeted removal of a relatively small number of lymph nodes. However, radioactive labelling is associated with limitations such as strict legal regulations, the need for a nuclear medicine department and the radioactive exposure of patients and medical staff. In order to take advantage of the targeted sentinel method while avoiding the disadvantages of radioactive labelling, the identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) by means of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) was studied in breast carcinoma, and its non-inferiority compared with the established procedure with (99m)technetium nanocolloid was demonstrated. Just like the radioactive identification of SLNs, this innovative new method for magnetic labelling and the intraoperative identification of SLNs using a hand-held magnetometer were successfully transferred to prostate cancer. Initial studies demonstrated high sensitivity in the detection of lymph node-positive patients. This method offers the additional advantage of being safe and easy to perform for a single urologist. In addition, the visualisation of SPION-marked SLNs through magnetic resonance tomography enables a precise preoperative SLN identification comparable to lymphoscintigraphy in the radioactive approach. Therefore, SLNs can be identified before and during surgical procedures in prostate cancer patients without exposure to irradiation.

TI  - Sentinel Node Procedure in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review to Assess Diagnostic Accuracy
T2  - EUROPEAN UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Context: Extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) is the gold standard for detecting lymph node (LN) metastases in prostate cancer (PCa). The benefit of sentinel node biopsy (SNB), which is the first draining LN as assessed by imaging of locally injected tracers, remains controversial.Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of SNB in PCa.Evidence acquisition: A systematic literature search of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (1999-2016) was undertaken using PRISMA guidelines. All studies of SNB in men with PCa using PLND as reference standard were included. The primary outcomes were the nondiagnostic rate (NDR), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rates. Relevant sensitivity analyses based on SN definitions, ePLND as reference standard, and disease risk were undertaken, including a risk of bias (RoB) assessment.Evidence synthesis: Of 373 articles identified, 21 studies recruiting a total of 2509 patients were eligible for inclusion. Median cumulative percentage (interquartile range) results were 4.1% (1.5-10.7%) for NDR, 95.2% (81.8-100%) for sensitivity, 100% (95.0-100%) for specificity, 100% (87.0-100%) for PPV, 98.0% (94.3-100%) for NPV, 0% (0-5.0%) for the FP rate, and 4.8% (0-18.2%) for the FN rate. The findings did not change significantly on sensitivity analyses. Most studies (17/22) had low RoB for index test and reference standard domains.Conclusions: SNB appears to have diagnostic accuracy comparable to ePLND, with high sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, and a low FN rate. With a low FP rate (rate of detecting positive nodes outside the ePLND template), SNB may not have any additional diagnostic value over and above ePLND, although SNB appears to increase nodal yield by increasing the number of affected nodes when combined with ePLND. Thus, in high-risk disease it may be prudent to combine ePLND with SNB.Patient summary: This literature review showed a high diagnostic accuracy for sentinel node biopsy in detecting positive lymph nodes in prostate cancer, but further studies are needed to explore the effect of sentinel node biopsy on complications and oncologic outcome.

T2  - Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift (1946)
M3  - Comparative Study
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an established technique for melanoma staging.OBJECTIVE: There are no studies available comparing different techniques for the removal of sentinel lymph nodes related to safety and postsurgical complication rate.METHODS: This is a retrospective single-center trial. We analyzed the postsurgical complications in 201consecutive melanoma patients with ligature of lymphatic vessels by sutures (group A) and in 91consecutive patients with occlusion of lymphatic vessels by bipolar tweezers (groupB). We paid particular attention to complications related to disturbed lymphatic function, such as lymph edema, lymphatic fistula, and seroma.RESULTS: The complication rate was 5.5% (groupA) and 9.6% (groupB) which is in the range of other published trials (p= 0.89). There was no increase of complications related to lymphatic vessels in groupB, although the rate of patients with more than two sentinel lymph nodes removed was 5‑times higher than in groupA.CONCLUSIONS: Removal of sentinel lymph nodes with the use of bipolar tweezers does not increase the risk of postsurgical complications, and in particular it is not associated with ahigher rate of complications related to lymphatic vessel dysfunction.

TI  - A remote sensing-based tool for assessing rainfall-driven hazards
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - RainyDay is a Python-based platform that couples rainfall remote sensing data with Stochastic Storm Transposition (SST) for modeling rainfall-driven hazards such as floods and landslides. SST effectively lengthens the extreme rainfall record through temporal resampling and spatial transposition of observed storms from the surrounding region to create many extreme rainfall scenarios. Intensity-Duration Frequency (IDF) curves are often used for hazard modeling but require long records to describe the distribution of rainfall depth and duration and do not provide information regarding rainfall space-time structure, limiting their usefulness to small scales. In contrast, RainyDay can be used for many hazard applications with 1-2 decades of data, and output rainfall scenarios incorporate detailed space-time structure from remote sensing. Thanks to global satellite coverage, RainyDay can be used in inaccessible areas and developing countries lacking ground measurements, though results are impacted by remote sensing errors. RainyDay can be useful for hazard modeling under nonstationary conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The logistic regression and statistical index models are applied and verified for landslide susceptibility mapping in Daguan County, Yunnan Province, China, by means of the geographic information system (GIS). A detailed landslide inventory map was prepared by literatures, aerial photographs, and supported by field works. Fifteen landslide-conditioning factors were considered: slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, altitude, STI, SPI, and TWI were derived from digital elevation model; NDVI was extracted from Landsat ETM7; rainfall was obtained from local rainfall data; distance to faults, distance to roads, and distance to rivers were created from a 1: 25,000 scale topographic map; the lithology was extracted from geological map. Using these factors, the landslide susceptibility maps were prepared by LR and SI models. The accuracy of the results was verified by using existing landslide locations. The statistical index model had a predictive rate of 81.02%, which is more accurate prediction in comparison with logistic regression model (80.29%). The models can be used to land-use planning in the study area.

TI  - Effect of water level fluctuations on wintering goose abundance in Poyang Lake wetlands of China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Poyang Lake is a Ramsar site and is the important over-wintering site for migratory waterbirds along the East Asian-Australasian Fly way. Examining the effects of water level fluctuations on waterbird abundance and analyzing the influencing mechanism is critical to waterbird protection in the context of hydrological alteration. In this study, the effect of water level regime on wintering goose abundance was examined and the influencing mechanism was interpreted. Synchronous waterbirds survey data, hydrological data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MODIS-NDVI) data and habitat data derived from Landsat TM/ETM data and HJ/CCD data were combined. The satellite-derived Green Wave Index (GWI) based on MODIS-NDVI dataset was applied to detect changes in goose food resources. It was found that habitat size and vegetation conditions are key factors determining goose abundance. Geese numbers were positively correlated with habitat area, while intermediate range of vegetation productivity might benefit the goose abundance. Water level affects goose abundance by changing available habitat areas and vegetation conditions. We suggested that matching hydrological regime and exposed meadows time to wintering geese dynamics was crucial in the Poyang Lake wetlands. Our study could provide sound scientific information for hydrological management in the context of waterbird conservation.

TI  - Assimilation of Leaf Area Index and Surface Soil Moisture With the CERES-Wheat Model for Winter Wheat Yield Estimation Using a Particle Filter Algorithm
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve winter wheat yield estimates in the Guanzhong Plain, China, the daily leaf area index (LAI) and soil moisture at depths of 0-20 cm (theta) simulated by CERES-Wheat model were assimilated from field-measured LAI and theta and from Landsat-derived LAI and theta using a particle filter algorithm. Linear regression analyses were performed to determine the relationships between assimilated LAI or theta and field-measured yields to identify highly yield-related variables for each growth stage of winter wheat, which were used to establish an optimal-assimilation yield estimation model. At the green-up and milk stages, assimilated. was highly correlated with the measured yields, and at the jointing and heading-filling stages, both assimilated LAI and theta were highly correlated with the yields. The optimal-assimilation yield estimation model was then established by combining the regression equations relating assimilated theta to the yields during the green-up and milk stages with the equations relating assimilated LAI and theta to the yields at the jointing and heading-filling stages, which resulted in better estimation accuracy than the yield estimation model established based on dualistic regression equations relating the assimilated LAI and theta to measured yields for each growth stage. Moreover, establishing different yield estimation models for irrigated and rain-fed farmlands improved the yield estimates compared with the established estimation model that did not take into account whether the farmlands were irrigated or rain-fed. Therefore, the assimilation of highly yield-related state variables at each wheat growth stage provides a reliable and promising method for improving crop yield estimates.

TI  - Automated cropland mapping of continental Africa using Google Earth Engine cloud computing
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The automation of agricultural mapping using satellite-derived remotely sensed data remains a challenge in Africa because of the heterogeneous and fragmental landscape, complex crop cycles, and limited access to local knowledge. Currently, consistent, continent-wide routine cropland mapping of Africa does not exist, with most studies focused either on certain portions of the continent or at most a one-time effort at mapping the continent at coarse resolution remote sensing. In this research, we addressed these limitations by applying an automated cropland mapping algorithm (ACMA) that captures extensive knowledge on the croplands of Africa available through: (a) ground-based training samples, (b) very high (sub meter to five-meter) resolution imagery (VHRI), and (c) local knowledge captured during field visits and/or sourced from country reports and literature. The study used 16-day time-series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composited data at 250-m resolution for the entire African continent. Based on these data, the study first produced accurate reference cropland layers or RCLs (cropland extent/areas, irrigation versus rainfed, cropping intensities, crop dominance, and croplands versus cropland fallows) for the year 2014 that provided an overall accuracy of around 90% for crop extent in different agro-ecological zones (AEZs). The RCLs for the year 2014 (RCL2014) were then used in the development of the ACMA algorithm to create ACMA-derived cropland layers for 2014 (ACL2014). ACL2014 when compared pixel-by-pixel with the RCL2014 had an overall similarity greater than 95%. Based on the ACL2014, the African continent had 296 Mha of net cropland areas (260 Mha cultivated plus 36 Mha fallows) and 330 Mha of gross cropland areas. Of the 260 Mha of net cropland areas cultivated during 2014, 90.6% (236 Mha) was rainfed and just 9.4% (24 Mha) was irrigated. Africa has about 15% of the world's population, but only about 6% of world's irrigation. Net cropland area distribution was 95 Mha during season 1, 117 Mha during season 2, and 84 Mha continuous. About 58% of the rainfed and 39% of the irrigated were single crops (net cropland area without cropland fallows) cropped during either season 1 (January-May) or season 2 (June September). The ACMA algorithm was deployed on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and applied on MODIS time-series data from 2003 through 2014 to obtain ACMA-derived cropland layers for these years (ACL2003 to ACL2014). The results indicated that over these twelve years, on average: (a) croplands increased by 1 Mha/yr, and (b) cropland fallows decreased by 1 Mha/year. Cropland areas computed from ACL2014 for the 55 African countries were largely underestimated when compared with an independent source of census-based cropland data, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.5 Mha. ACMA demonstrated the ability to hind-cast (past years), now-cast (present year), and forecast (future years) cropland products using MODIS 250-m time-series data rapidly, but currently, insufficient reference data exist to rigorously report trends from these results.

TI  - The development processes and regional differentiation of both banks of the Strait of Malacca during 1980-2010
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the international waterways connecting the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the Strait of Malacca has different degrees of influence on the surrounding coastal development and construction. In this study, the Landsat MSS/TM images during four periods (1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010) were selected in order to extract the coastlines of both banks of the Strait of Malacca, as well as the development and utilization intensity information on the landward side within a 20 km area, for the purpose of conducting research regarding the development processes and regional differentiation of both of the banks. The results revealed that during the past 30 years, due to the construction of the coastal cities and the river diversion and sediment accumulation, the Malaysian west coast has been extended by 4.8%. In the study area on the eastern coast of Sumatra, the coastline has been extended by 2.96%. Furthermore, after 30 years of land development processes, the urban construction land areas have respectively expanded by 2.3 times and 3.5 times on the Malaysian western coast and the Sumatra eastern coast. In regards to the agricultural land, the areas with moderate development intensity and above (>0.5) were respectively expanded from 36.37% to 54.96% and 22.02%-44.56% on the western coast of Malaysia and eastern coast of Sumatra. Up until 2010, the urban construction land areas of Singapore accounted for 61.66%, and 58.2% of the areas were high-intensity development zones (>0.6). The differences between each of these are obvious. The regional differentiation in the coastal development degree of the Strait of Malacca was found to be closely related to port construction, channel distances, economic policies, infrastructure, and security. The development and construction degrees were different on each of the banks, which also produced certain effects on the stability of the strait (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - An improved algorithm for retrieving the fine-mode fraction of aerosol optical thickness, part 1: Algorithm development
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The fine-mode fraction (FMF) can be a useful tool to separate natural aerosols from man-made aerosols and to assist in estimating surface concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter < 2.5 mu m. A LookUp Table-based Spectral Deconvolution Algorithm (LUT-SDA) was developed here for satellite-based applications using data such as MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements. This method was validated against ground-based FMF retrievals from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). The LUT-SDA was then applied to two MODIS-retrieved aerosol optical thickness (AOT) products for the period of December 2013 to July 2015: the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) Dark Target (DT) AOT product and the simplified high-resolution MODIS Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) AOT product. In comparison with the MODIS C6 FMF product in three study areas (Beijing, Hong Kong, and Osaka), FMFs estimated by the LUT-SDA agreed more closely with those retrieved from the AERONET with a very low bias. Eighty percent of the FMF values fell within the expected error range of +/- 0.4. The root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.168 with few anomalous values, whereas the RMSE for the MODIS FMF was 0.340 with more anomalous values. The LUT-SDA FMF estimated using SARA AOT data conveys more detailed information on urban pollution than that from MODIS C6 DT AOT data. As a demonstration, the seasonally-averaged spatial distribution of the FMF in Beijing was obtained from the LUT-SDA applied to SARA AOT data and compared with that of the AERONET-retrieved FMF. Their seasonal trends agreed well. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, about 220 satellite images between 2000 and 2012 were obtained from FY -series, MODIS, CBERS, HJ-1A and HJ-1B to estimate the impact of duststorms on the South Yellow Sea (SYS), which serve as an important source of particles there. The analyzing results from the images support a total occurrence of 88 duststorms (including the locally -generated dusty weather) that affected the SYS during 2000-2012. The annual occurrence was about 4-10 times (10 times in 2000 and 2004; four times in 2009 and 2012), predominantly in March (29%), April (33%) and May (22%). By mapping the distribution of their frequency, the duststorms influencing the SYS were found primarily moving from the northwest (39 times, 44.3%) and west (37 times, 42%) to the study region with only 11 duststorms (12.5%) coming from the north and 1 duststorm (1%) from the southwest. We estimated that an annual amount of 0.5-3.5 million tons of sediment particles was brought to the SYS by the duststorms during 2000-2012.

TI  - Downscaling Land Surface Temperature in Complex Regions by Using Multiple Scale Factors with Adaptive Thresholds
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many downscaling algorithms have been proposed to address the issue of coarse-resolution land surface temperature (LST) derived from available satellite-borne sensors. However, few studies have focused on improving LST downscaling in urban areas with several mixed surface types. In this study, LST was downscaled by a multiple linear regression model between LST and multiple scale factors in mixed areas with three or four surface types. The correlation coefficients (CCs) between LST and the scale factors were used to assess the importance of the scale factors within a moving window. CC thresholds determined which factors participated in the fitting of the regression equation. The proposed downscaling approach, which involves an adaptive selection of the scale factors, was evaluated using the LST derived from four Landsat 8 thermal imageries of Nanjing City in different seasons. Results of the visual and quantitative analyses show that the proposed approach achieves relatively satisfactory downscaling results on 11 August, with coefficient of determination and root-mean-square error of 0.87 and 1.13 degrees C, respectively. Relative to other approaches, our approach shows the similar accuracy and the availability in all seasons. The best (worst) availability occurred in the region of vegetation (water). Thus, the approach is an efficient and reliable LST downscaling method. Future tasks include reliable LST downscaling in challenging regions and the application of our model in middle and low spatial resolutions.

TI  - Impact of Semiconducting Perylene Diimide Nanoparticle Size on Lymph Node Mapping and Cancer Imaging
T2  - ACS NANO
M3  - Article
AB  - Semiconducting molecules of perylene diimide (PDI) with strong light absorption properties in the near-infrared region and good biocompatibility have received increasing attention in the field of theranostics, especially as photoacoustic (PA) imaging agents. Herein, we report a series of [Cu-64]-labeled PDI nanoparticles (NPs) of different sizes (30, 60, 100, and 200 nm) as dual positron emission tomography (PET) and PA imaging probes and photothermal therapy agents. The precise size control of the PDI NPs can be achieved by adjusting the initial concentration of PDI molecules in the self-assembly process, and the photophysical property of different sized PDI NPs was studied in detail. Furthermore, we systematically investigated the size-dependent accumulation of the PDI NPs in the lymphatic system after local administration and in tumors after intravenous injection by PA and PET imaging. The results revealed that 100 nm is the best size for differentiating popliteal and sciatic LNs since the interval is around 60 min for the NPs to migrate from popliteal LNs to sciatic LNs, which is an ideal time window to facilitate surgical sentinel LN biopsy and pathological examination. Furthermore, different migration times of the different-sized PDI NPs will provide more choices for surgeons to map the specific tumor relevant LNs. PDI NP theranostics can also be applied to imaging-guided cancer therapy. The NPs with a size of 60 nm appear to be the best for tumor imaging and photothermal cancer therapy due to the maximum, tumor accumulation efficiency. Thus, our study not only presents organic PDI NP theranostics but also introduces different-sized NPs for multiple bioapplications.

TI  - Differences in estimating terrestrial water flux from three satellite-based Priestley-Taylor algorithms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of terrestrial latent heat of evaporation (LE) for different biomes are essential to assess energy, water and carbon cycles. Different satellite-based Priestley-Taylor (PT) algorithms have been developed to estimate LE in different biomes. However, there are still large uncertainties in LE estimates for different PT algorithms. In this study, we evaluated differences in estimating terrestrial water flux in different biomes from three satellite-based PT algorithms using ground-observed data from eight eddy covariance (EC) flux towers of China. The results reveal that large differences in daily LE estimates exist based on EC measurements using three PT algorithms among eight ecosystem types. At the forest (CBS) site, all algorithms demonstrate high performance with low root mean square error (RMSE) (less than 16 W/m(2)) and high squared correlation coefficient (R-2) (more than 0.9). At the village (HHV) site, the ATI-PT algorithm has the lowest RMSE (13.9 W/m(2)), with bias of 2.7 W/m(2) and R-2 of 0.66. At the irrigated crop (HHM) site, almost all models algorithms underestimate LE, indicating these algorithms may not capture wet soil evaporation by parameterization of the soil moisture. In contrast, the SM-PT algorithm shows high values of R2 (comparable to those of ATI-PT and VPD-PT) at most other (grass, wetland, desert and Gobi) biomes. There are no obvious differences in seasonal LE estimation using MODIS NDVI and LAI at most sites. However, all meteorological or satellite-based water-related parameters used in the PT algorithm have uncertainties for optimizing water constraints. This analysis highlights the need to improve PT algorithms with regard to water constraints. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Glacier changes on the Tibetan Plateau derived from Landsat imagery: mid-1970s-2000-13
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier area changes on the Tibetan Plateau were studied in different drainage basins based on Landsat satellite images from three epochs: 263 in the mid-1970s, 150 in 1999-2002 and 148 in 2013/14. Three mosaics (M1976, M2001 and M2013) with minimal cloud and snow cover were constructed, and the uncertainty due to each epoch having a finite span was accounted for. Glacier outlines (TPG1976, TPG2001 and TPG2013) were digitized manually with guidance from the SRTM DEM v4.1 and Google Earth imagery. To achieve complete multi- temporal coverage in a reasonable time, only debris-free ice was delineated. Area mapping uncertainty was evaluated at three study sites, Mount Qomolangma (Everest), Mount Naimona'Nyi, Mount Geladandong, where the largest differences between present and earlier measurements were within similar to +/- 4%. Area differences with previous inventories ranged from - 19.6% (TPG1976 minus the first Chinese Glacier Inventory) to -3.6% and -1.1% (TPG2013 and TPG2001, respectively minus the second Chinese Glacier Inventory), while the difference TPG2001 minus the GAMDAM Glacier Inventory was + 10.4%. Glacier area on the plateau decreased from 44 366 +/- 2827 km(2) (1.7% of the study area) in the 1970s to 42 210 +/- 1621 km2 in 2001 and 41 137 +/- 1616 km2 in 2013. Shrinkage was faster in external drainage basins of the southeast than in the interior basins of the northwest, from a maximum of -0.43% a(-1) (-1.60% a(-1) during 19942013) in the Mekong catchment down to a minimum of - 0.12% a(-1) in the Tarim interior drainage.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel technique, namely texture-guided multisensor superresolution (TGMS), for fusing a pair of multisensor multiresolution images to enhance the spatial resolution of a lower-resolution data source. TGMS is based on multiresolution analysis, taking object structures and image textures in the higher-resolution image into consideration. TGMS is designed to be robust against misregistration and the resolution ratio and applicable to a wide variety of multisensor superresolution problems in remote sensing. The proposed methodology is applied to six different types of multisensor superresolution, which fuse the following image pairs: multispectral and panchromatic images, hyperspectral and panchromatic images, hyperspectral and multispectral images, optical and synthetic aperture radar images, thermal-hyperspectral and RGB images, and digital elevation model and multispectral images. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and high general versatility of TGMS.

TI  - Water clarity of the Upper Great Lakes: Tracking changes between 1998-2012
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity trends in three upper Great Lakes, Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron, were assessed via satellite imagery from 1998 to 2012. Light attenuation coefficients (Kd(490)) from SeaWiFS and Aqua MODIS satellites compared favorably with in situ measurements. Significant temporal and spatial trends and differences in Kd(490) were noted within all three of the lakes. Lake-wide average Kd(490) for Lake Superior did not exhibit any changes between 1998 and 2012. Annual Kd(490) values for Lake Huron, however, showed a significant negative trend during the study period using both SeaWiFS and MODIS datasets. Similarly, annual Kd(490) values of Lake Michigan declined between 1998 and 2010. Only in the offshore waters (>90 m depth) of northern Lake Michigan did Kd(490) increase but just after 2007. Photic depth increased significantly in both Lake Michigan (similar or equal to 5 m), and Lake Huron (similar or equal to 10 m) when comparing annual Kd(490) for pre- (1998-2001) and post-dreissenid mussel (2006-2010). At seasonal level, significant decreases in Kd(490) in lakes Michigan and Huron were mainly noted for the spring/fall/winter mixing periods. After these recent changes in water clarity, lake-wide photic depths in lakes Michigan and Huron superseded Lake Superior; thus, making Lake Superior no longer the clearest Great Lake. Several factors (e.g. filtering activities of quagga mussels, phosphorus abatement, climate change, etc.) are likely responsible for these large changes.

TI  - Application of CASI Hyperspectral Image to Analysis of the Distribution of Hydrogen-Fluoride-Damaged Vegetation in Gumi, Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On the night of 27th Sept 2012, a hydrogen fluoride (HF) storage tank exploded in the industrial area of Gumi, Korea. In this study, an attempt was made to detect the damaged vegetation using a hyperspectral image. Assuming that HF was the most significant stressor of vegetation near the blast site, our results indicated that the difference in reflectance values between the 786 and 801 nm wavelengths became negative (-) and fluctuated from -5 to -160 in the affected vegetation. On the other hand, positive (+) values were found in the non-affected vegetation. The combination of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and simple ratio (SR) was used [named combined vegetation index (CVI) in this study] to assess the accuracy of these measurements. Among 150,965 pixels that were defined as damaged vegetation, about 2.8 % were analyzed incorrectly in this study. As a result, factors such as wind direction, distance from the accident spot, elevation, and aspect were shown to affect damage distribution.

TI  - Retrieving Soybean Leaf Area Index from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Hyperspectral Remote Sensing: Analysis of RF, ANN, and SVM Regression Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important indicator of plant growth and yield that can be monitored by remote sensing. Several models were constructed using datasets derived from SRS and STR sampling methods to determine the optimal model for soybean (multiple strains) LAI inversion for the whole crop growth period and a single growth period. Random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) regression models were compared with a partial least-squares regression (PLS) model. The RF model yielded the highest precision, accuracy, and stability with V-R2, SDR 2, V-RMSE, and SDRMSE values of 0.741, 0.031, 0.106, and 0.005, respectively, over the whole growth period based on STR sampling. The ANN model had the highest precision, accuracy, and stability (0.452, 0.132, 0.086, and 0.009, respectively) over a single growth phase based on STR sampling. The precision, accuracy, and stability of the RF, ANN, and SVM models were improved by inclusion of STR sampling. The RF model is suitable for estimating LAI when sample plots and variation are relatively large (i.e., the whole growth period or more than one growth period). The ANN model is more appropriate for estimating LAI when sample plots and variation are relatively low (i.e., a single growth period).

TI  - Evaluating satellite-derived long-term historical precipitation datasets for drought monitoring in Chile
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation is a key parameter for the study of climate change and variability and the detection and monitoring of natural disaster such as drought. Precipitation datasets that accurately capture the amount and spatial variability of rainfall is critical for drought monitoring and a wide range of other climate applications. This is challenging in many parts of the world, which often have a limited number of weather stations and/or historical data records. Satellite-derived precipitation products offer a viable alternative with several remotely sensed precipitation datasets now available with long historical data records (+3oyears), which include the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) datasets. This study presents a comparative analysis of three historical satellite-based precipitation datasets that include Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B43 version 7 (1998-2015), PERSIANN-CDR (1983-2015) and CHIRPS 2.0 (1981-2015) over Chile to assess their performance across the country and for the case of the two long-term products the applicability for agricultural drought were evaluated when used in the calculation of commonly used drought indicator as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). In this analysis, 278 weather stations of in situ rainfall measurements across Chile were initially compared to the satellite data. The study area (Chile) was divided into five latitudinal zones: North, North-Central, Central, South-Central and South to determine if there were a regional difference among these satellite products, and nine statistics were used to evaluate their performance to estimate the amount and spatial distribution of historical rainfall across Chile. Hierarchical cluster analysis, k-means and singular value decomposition were used to analyze these datasets to better understand their similarities and differences in characterizing rainfall patterns across Chile. Monthly analysis showed that all satellite products highly overestimated rainfall in the arid North zone. However, there were no major difference between all three products from North to South-Central zones. Though, in the South zone, PERSIANN-CDR shows the lowest fit with high underestimation, while CHIRPS 2.0 and TMPA 3B43 v7 had better agreement with in situ measurements. The accuracy of satellite products were highly dependent on the amount of monthly rainfall with the best results found during winter seasons and in zones (Central to South) with higher amounts of precipitation. PERSIANN-CDR and CHIRPS 2.0 were used to derive SPI at time-scale of 1, 3 and 6 months, both satellite products presented similar results when it was compared in situ against satellite SPI's. Because of its higher spatial resolution that allows better characterizing of spatial variation in precipitation pattern, the CHIRPS 2.0 was used to mapping the SPI-3 over Chile. The results of this study show that in order to use the CHIRPS 2.0 and PERSIANN-CDR datasets in Chile to monitor spatial patterns in the rainfall and drought intensity conditions, these products should be calibrated to adjust for the overestimation/underestimation of rainfall geographically specially in the North, zone and seasonally during the summer and spring months in the other zones.

TI  - Seismic classification-based method for recognizing epicenter-neighboring orbits
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - From the point of view of the Fourth Paradigm, this paper attempts to find a recognizing method based on DEMETER (Detection of Electro-Magnetic Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions) satellite data for epicenter-neighboring orbits during strong shocks. Detection points or small regions are used as research objects in numerous studies on seismic activities recognition. Due to the infrequency of strong shocks, the number of non-seismic data is far larger than the abnormal one, which results in the underfitting during the training of recognition model. Additionally, data located along the edge of seismic regions can hardly be classified into abnormal dataset or non-seismic one. A sloppy classification can badly reduce the accuracy of model. Hence, it is desired to put forward a more suitable approach to make better use of original data. In this paper, a seismic classification-based method for recognizing epicenter neighboring orbit is proposed to address these problems. Unlike the existing approaches, our method regards the satellite orbits as the analyzing objects, which avoids the underfitting performance caused by the unbalanced data distribution. Moreover, error correcting output coding (ECOC) strategy is utilized to transform the recognizing problem into a series of binary classifications. By means of safe semi-supervised support vector machines (S4VMs) with kernel combination, the unlabeled orbits help obtain a better classification performance. Finally, three groups of comprehensive experiments are applied to validate the effectiveness of the method. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Kernel Sparse Subspace Clustering with a Spatial Max Pooling Operation for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data Interpretation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering is generally a challenging task because of the complex spectral-spatial structure. Based on the assumption that all the pixels are sampled from the union of subspaces, recent works have introduced a robust technique-the sparse subspace clustering (SSC) algorithm and its enhanced versions (SSC models incorporating spatial information)-to cluster HSIs, achieving excellent performances. However, these methods are all based on the linear representation model, which conflicts with the well-known nonlinear structure of HSIs and limits their performance to a large degree. In this paper, to overcome these obstacles, we present a new kernel sparse subspace clustering algorithm with a spatial max pooling operation (KSSC-SMP) for hyperspectral remote sensing data interpretation. The proposed approach maps the feature points into a much higher dimensional kernel space to extend the linear sparse subspace clustering model to nonlinear manifolds, which can better fit the complex nonlinear structure of HSIs. With the help of the kernel sparse representation, a more accurate representation coefficient matrix can be obtained. A spatial max pooling operation is utilized for the representation coefficients to generate more discriminant features by integrating the spatial-contextual information, which is essential for the accurate modeling of HSIs. This paper is an extension of our previous conference paper, and a number of enhancements are put forward. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on two well-known hyperspectral data sets-the Salinas image and the University of Pavia image-and the experimental results clearly indicate that the newly developed KSSC-SMP algorithm can obtain very competitive clustering results for HSIs, outperforming the current state-of-the-art clustering methods.

TI  - Spatiotemporal prediction of continuous daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations across China using a spatially explicit machine learning algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A high degree of uncertainty associated with the emission inventory for China tends to degrade the performance of chemical transport models in predicting PM2.5 concentrations especially on a daily basis. In this study a novel machine learning algorithm, Geographically -Weighted Gradient Boosting Machine (GW-GBM), was developed by improving GBM through building spatial smoothing kernels to weigh the loss function. This modification addressed the spatial nonstationarity of the relationships between PM2.5 concentrations and predictor variables such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological conditions. GW-GBM also overcame the estimation bias of PM2.5 concentrations due to missing AOD retrievals, and thus potentially improved subsequent exposure analyses. GW-GBM showed good performance in predicting daily PM2.5 concentrations (R-2 = 0.76, RMSE = 23.0 g/m(3)) even with partially missing AOD data, which was better than the original GBM model (R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 25.3 g/m(3)). On the basis of the continuous spatiotemporal prediction of PM2.5 concentrations, it was predicted that 95% of the population lived in areas where the estimated annual mean PM2.5 concentration was higher than 35 g/m(3), and 45% of the population was exposed to PM2.5 > 75 g/m(3) for over 100 days in 2014. GW-GBM accurately predicted continuous daily PM2.5 concentrations in China for assessing acute human health effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A CBIR System for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images Using Endmember Extraction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, searching the similar image is a challenge for hyperspectral remote sensing image processing. Meanwhile, the dramatic growth in the amount of hyperspectral remote sensing data has stimulated considerable research on content-based image retrieval (CBIR) in the field of remote sensing technology. Although many CBIR systems have been developed, few studies focused on the hyperspectral remote sensing images. A CBIR system for hyperspectral remote sensing image using endmember extraction is proposed in this paper. The main contributions of our method are that: (1) the endmembers as the spectral features are extracted from hyperspectral remote sensing image by improved automatic pixel purity index (APPI) algorithm; (2) the spectral information divergence and spectral angle match (SID-SAM) mixed measure method is utilized as a similarity measurement between hyperspectral remote sensing images. At last, the images are ranked with descending and the top-M retrieved images are returned. The experimental results on NASA datasets show that our system can yield a superior performance.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Analysis of the Mitigating Effects of Industrial Relocation on the Surface Urban Heat Island over China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is typically accompanied by the relocation and reconstruction of industrial areas due to limited space and environmental requirements, particularly in the case of a capital city. Shougang Group, one of the largest steel mill operators in China, was relocated from Beijing to Hebei Province. To study the thermal environmental changes at the Shougang industrial site before and after relocation, four Landsat images (from 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2016) were used to calculate the land surface temperature (LST). Using the urban heat island ratio index (URI), we compared the LST values for the four images of the investigated area. Following the relocation of Shougang Group, the URI values decreased from 0.55 in 2005 to 0.21 in 2016, indicating that the surface urban heat island effect in the area was greatly mitigated; we infer that this effect was related to steel production. This study shows that the use of Landsat images to assess industrial thermal pollution is feasible. Accurate and rapid extraction of thermal pollution data by remote sensing offers great potential for the management of industrial pollution sources and distribution, and for technical support in urban planning departments.

TI  - Toward downscaling oceanic hydrodynamics - suitability of a high-resolution OGCM for describing regional ocean variability in the South China Sea
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We suggest to transfer the empirical downscaling methodology, which was developed mostly for atmospheric dynamics and impacts, to regional ocean problems. The major problem for doing so is the availability of decades-long and homogeneous and spatially detailed data sets. We have examined the performance of the STORM multidecadal simulation, which was run on a 0.1 degrees grid and forced with 1950-2010 NCEP re-analyses, in the South China Sea and found the data suitable. For demonstration we build with this STORM-data downscaling model for the regional throughflow.The STORM data is compared with AVISO satellite observations and the ocean re-analysis dataset C-GLORS. We find the seasonal patterns and the inter-annual variability of sea surface height anomaly in both the C-GLORS data and the STORM simulation consistent with the AVISO-satellite data. Also the strong westward intensification and the seasonal patterns of South China Sea circulation steered by the monsoon have been presented well. As an important indicator of vertical movement, the sea surface temperature distribution maps are also very close, especially for the narrow upwelling region in summer. We conclude that the output of the STORM simulation is realistically capturing both the large-scale as well as the small-scale dynamical features in the South China Sea.

TI  - Improving Spatial Coverage for Aqua MODIS AOD Using NDVI-Based Multi-Temporal Regression Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides widespread Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) datasets for climatological and environmental health research. Since MODIS AOD clearly lacks coverage in orbit-scanning gaps and cloud obscuration, some applications will benefit from data recovery using multi-temporal AOD. Aimed at qualitatively describing the relationship between multi-temporal AOD, AOD loadings and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) have been considered based on the mechanism of satellite AOD retrieval. Accordingly, the NDVI-based Weighted Linear Regression (NWLR) has been proposed to recover AOD by synthetically weighing AOD similarity, spatial proximity, and NDVI similarity. To evaluate the performance of AOD recovery, simulated experiments applying gap and window masks were conducted in South Asia and Beijing, respectively. The evaluation results demonstrated that the linear regression R-2 achieved 0.8 and the absolute relative errors remained steady. Further validation was conducted between the recovered and actual AODs using 56 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites in East and South Asia from 2013 to 2015, which demonstrated that over 41% of recovered AODs fell within the expected error (EE) envelope. Additional validation conducted in South Asia and Beijing showed that recovery by NWLR did not expand satellite-derived AOD errors, and the accuracy of recovered AOD was consistent with the accuracy of the original Aqua MODIS Deep Blue (DB) AOD. The recovery results illustrated that AOD coverage was improved in most regions, especially in North China, Mongolia, and South Asia, which could provide better support in aerosol spatio-temporal analysis and aerosol data assimilation.

AB  - Vegetation types are generally classified based only on remote sensing vegetation data, and yet they cannot reflect their connection with climate. Climatic vegetation types reflect the regional vegetation characteristics in terms of climate. The distribution of global climatic vegetation types were identified by K-means method based on vegetation and climate data. Fourteen climatic vegetation types were classified based on vegetation and climate data. Every type had distinct climate and vegetation characteristics. The regions with similar normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values but with different climate values such as tropical desert and temperate desert could be distinguished. Our new updated climatic vegetation types agreed fair' with Koeppen climate types and climate type of Zhang and Yan while agreed good' with vegetation types when checked with Kappa test.

TI  - Snow Cover Monitoring in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Based on Chinese Fengyun-3/VIRR Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover monitoring in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is very important to global climate change research. Because of the geographic distribution of ground meteorological stations in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is too sparse, satellite remote sensing became the only choice for snow cover monitoring in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. In this paper, multi-channel data from Visible and Infrared Radiometer (VIRR) on Chinese polar orbiting meteorological satellites Fengyun-3(FY-3) are utilized for snow cover monitoring, in this work, the distribution of snow cover is extracted from the normalized difference snow index(NDSI), and the multi-channel threshold from the brightness temperature difference in infrared channels. Then, the monitoring results of FY-3A and FY-3B are combined to generate the daily composited snow cover product. Finally, the snow cover products from MODIS and FY-3 are both verified by snow depth of meteorological station observations, result shows that the FY-3 products and MODIS products are basically consistent, the overall accuracy of FY-3 products is higher than MODIS products by nearly 1 %. And the cloud coverage rate of FY-3 products is less than MODIS by 2.64 %. This work indicates that FY-3/VIRR data can be reliable data sources for monitoring snow cover in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Analyzing the Impacts of Urbanization and Seasonal Variation on Land Surface Temperature Based on Subpixel Fractional Covers Using Landsat Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface areas (ISAs) and vegetation are two major urban land cover types. Estimating the spatial distribution of ISA and vegetation is critical for analyzing urban landscape patterns and their impact on the thermal environment. In this paper, linear spectralmixture analysis (LSMA) is used to extract their respective subpixel land cover composition from bitemporal Landsat images and the accuracy of the fractional covers is assessed with a subpixel confusion matrix at the category level and the map level by comparing with the reference data from high-resolution images. The percent ISA was divided into discrete categories representing different urban development density areas. Mean land surface temperature (LST) is calculated for each ISA category to analyze the thermal characteristics of different levels of development in the urban area of Fuzhou, China. ISA and vegetation variations are also quantified between different ISA categories and different dates. The contribution index is also calculated based on each ISA category to analyze the impact of different landscape patterns on the urban thermal environment. The results show that ISA category is an important determinant of the urban thermal environment. Furthermore, seasonal variations significantly impact the strength of this relationship. In the study area, the contribution indices were highest in the 90%-100% ISA category in summer 2013 and early spring 2001. The analytical methodologies used in this study can help to quantify urban thermal environmental functions under conditions of urban expansion and explore the climate adaptation potential of cities.

TI  - Impact of hydro-thermal conditions on the spatio-temporal patterns of migratory bird populations.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Poyang Lake wetland is a key wintering habitat for migratory birds in East Asia, where the spatio-temporal pattern of migratory bird populations (STP-MB) is complex. This study used multi-source data from MODIS (NASA) from 2000 to 2010, including 10 days/nights of MODIS composite images of land surface temperature data (MODLT1T, provided by International Scientific & Technical Data Mirror Site, Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (http://www.gscloud.cn)), annual aerial survey data of migratory birds from 2001 to 2009, and meteorological data. Inter-annual variation in hydro-thermal factors (IAV-HT) and the correlation with migratory bird populations was analyzed at multi-spatial scales to examine the influence of IAV-HT on the STP-MB. Correlation between precipitation and water area, and the spatial pattern of land surface temperature was analyzed to assess coupling correlations within hydro-thermal factors. The final impact of IAV-HT on the STP-MB was revealed by the aforementioned coupling analysis. We found that the atmospheric temperature in December was the driving factor behind bird migration; and inter-annual changes in hydrological conditions were the determining factors of STP-MB, which was influenced by agricultural activities and ecological conditions in subzones. This research contributes towards the protection of migratory birds in Poyang Lake.

TI  - Vertical distribution of snow cover and its relation to temperature over the Manasi River Basin of Tianshan Mountains, Northwest China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - How snow cover changes in response to climate change at different elevations within a mountainous basin is a less investigated question. In this study we focused on the vertical distribution of snow cover and its relation to elevation and temperature within different elevation zones of distinct climatology, taking the mountainous Manasi River Basin of Xinjiang, Northwest China as a case study. Data sources include MODIS 8-day snow product, MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data from 2001 to 2014, and in situ temperature data observed at three hydrological stations from 2001 to 2012. The results show that: (1) the vertical distribution of snow areal extent (SAE) is sensitive to elevation in low (< 2100 m) and high altitude (> 3200 m) regions and shows four different seasonal patterns, each pattern is well correspondent to the variation of temperature. (2) The correlation between vertical changes of the SAE and temperature is significant in all seasons except for winter. (3) The correlation between annual changes of the SAE and temperature decreases with increasing elevation, the negative correlation is significant in area below 4000 m. (4) The snow cover days (SCDs) and its long-term change show visible differences in different altitude range. (5) The long-term increasing trend of SCDs and decreasing trend of winter temperature have a strong vertical relation with elevation below 3600 m. The decreasing trend of SCDs is attributed to the increasing trend of summer temperature in the area above 3600 m.

TI  - InSAR Time-Series Analysis of Land Subsidence under Different Land Use Types in the Eastern Beijing Plain, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Beijing plain, the long-term groundwater overexploitation, exploitation, and the utilization of superficial urban space have led to land subsidence. In this study, the spatial-temporal analysis of land subsidence in Beijing was assessed by using the small baseline subset (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique based on 47 TerraSAR-X SAR images from 2010 to 2015. Distinct variations of the land subsidence were found in the study regions. The maximum annual land subsidence rate was 146 mm/year from 2011 to 2015. The comparison between the SBAS InSAR results and the ground leveling measurements showed that the InSAR land subsidence results achieved a precision of 2 mm. In 2013, the maximum displacement reached 132 and 138 mm/year in the Laiguangying and DongbalizhuangDajiaoting area. Our analysis showed that the serious land subsidence mainly occurred in the following land use types: water area and wetland, paddy field, upland soils, vegetable land, and peasant-inhabited land. Our results could provide a useful reference for groundwater exploitation and urban planning.

TI  - Hyperspectral and Multispectral Retrieval of Suspended Sediment in Shallow Coastal Waters Using Semi-Analytical and Empirical Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural lagoons and estuaries worldwide are experiencing accelerated ecosystem degradation due to increased anthropogenic pressure. As a key driver of coastal zone dynamics, suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is difficult to monitor with adequate spatial and temporal resolutions both in the field and using remote sensing. In particular, the spatial resolutions of currently available remote sensing data generated by satellite sensors designed for ocean color retrieval, such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) or SeaWiFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor), are too coarse to capture the dimension and geomorphological heterogeneity of most estuaries and lagoons. In the present study, we explore the use of hyperspectral (Hyperion) and multispectral data, i.e., the Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) and ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus), ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer), and ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite), to estimate SSC through semi-analytical and empirical approaches in the Venice lagoon (Italy). Key parameters of the retrieval models are calibrated and cross-validated by matching the remote sensing estimates of SSC with in situ data from a network of water quality sensors. Our analysis shows that, despite the higher spectral resolution, hyperspectral data provide limited advantages over the use of multispectral data, mainly due to information redundancy and cross-band correlation. Meanwhile, the limited historical archive of hyperspectral data (usually acquired on demand) severely reduces the chance of observing high turbidity events, which are relatively rare but critical in controlling the coastal sediment and geomorphological dynamics. On the contrary, retrievals using available multispectral data can encompass a much wider range of SSC values due to their frequent acquisitions and longer historical archive. For the retrieval methods considered in this study, we find that the semi-analytical method outperforms empirical approaches, when applied to both the hyperspectral and multispectral dataset. Interestingly, the improved performance emerges more clearly when the data used for testing are kept separated from those used in the calibration, suggesting a greater ability of semi-analytical models to "generalize" beyond the specific data set used for model calibration.

TI  - Open Surface Water Mapping Algorithms: A Comparison of Water-Related Spectral Indices and Sensors
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Open surface water bodies play an important role in agricultural and industrial production, and are susceptible to climate change and human activities. Remote sensing data has been increasingly used to map open surface water bodies at local, regional, and global scales. In addition to image statistics-based supervised and unsupervised classifiers, spectral index-and threshold-based approaches have also been widely used. Many water indices have been proposed to identify surface water bodies; however, the differences in performances of these water indices as well as different sensors on water body mapping are not well documented. In this study, we reviewed and compared existing open surface water body mapping approaches based on six widely-used water indices, including the tasseled cap wetness index (TCW), normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (mNDWI), sum of near infrared and two shortwave infrared bands (Sum457), automated water extraction index (AWEI), land surface water index (LSWI), as well as three medium resolution sensors (Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 MSI). A case region in the Poyang Lake Basin, China, was selected to examine the accuracies of the open surface water body maps from the 27 combinations of different algorithms and sensors. The results showed that generally all the algorithms had reasonably high accuracies with Kappa Coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92. The NDWI-based algorithms performed slightly better than the algorithms based on other water indices in the study area, which could be related to the pure water body dominance in the region, while the sensitivities of water indices could differ for various water body conditions. The resultant maps from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data had higher overall accuracies than those from Landsat 7. Specifically, all three sensors had similar producer accuracies while Landsat 7 based results had a lower user accuracy. This study demonstrates the improved performance in Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 for open surface water body mapping efforts.

TI  - Modeling Gross Primary Production for Sunlit and Shaded Canopies Across an Evergreen and a Deciduous Site in Canada
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Light use efficiency (LUE) models offer an effective way for regional gross primary productivity (GPP) estimation. However, LUE is not easily determined at the landscape level due to its complexity and dependence on various environmental factors. One possible strategy to avoid the requirement for assessing environmental stressors is using the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) to determine LUE via the epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle. Integration of such measurements into GPP models could lead to more realistic GPP estimates of landscape level. Conventional, "one-leaf" LUE models, however, seem less suitable for integration of such remote sensing observations, as optically derived estimates are dependent on the shadow fraction viewed at a given time. Here, we utilize the two-leaf LUE (TL-LUE) model to parameterize LUE from multiangle PRI observations and compare it with MOD17 approach. Significant relationships were found between LUE (LUE, LUEsun, and LUEshaded) and PRI (PRI, PRIsun, and PRIshaded) over 8- and 16-day time steps. Similarly, R-2 values for the relationships between modeled GPP and observed GPP (EC derived measurements of GPP) were 0.87 (TL-LUE) and 0.81 (MOD17) at deciduous forest and 0.54 (TL-LUE) and 0.46 (MOD17) at evergreen forest for eight-day periods, as well as 0.84 (TL-LUE) and 0.74 (MOD17) at deciduous forest and 0.49 (TL-LUE) and 0.46 (MOD17) at evergreen forest for 16-day periods. Our results are relevant when planning potential future satellite missions to help constrain existing GPP models using remotely sensed data, as such observations will likely be affected by canopy shading effects at the time of observation.

TI  - Comparing Impacts of Satellite Data Assimilation and Lateral Boundary Conditions on Regional Model Forecasting: A Case Study of Hurricane Sandy (2012)
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of both satellite data assimilation (DA) and lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) on the Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) Model forecasts of Hurricane Sandy 2012 were assessed. To investigate the impact of satellite DA, experiments were run with and without satellite data assimilated, as well as with all satellite data but excluding Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Sounder data. To gauge the LBC impact, these experiments were also run with a variety of outer domain (D-1) sizes. The inclusion of satellite DA resulted in analysis fields that better characterized the tropical storm structures including the warm core anomaly and wavenumber-1 asymmetry near the eyewall, and also served to reduce the forecast track errors for Hurricane Sandy. The specific impact of assimilating the GOES Sounder data showed positive impacts on forecasts of the storm minimum sea level pressure. Increasing the D-1 size resulted in increases in the day 4/5 forecast track errors when verified against the best track and the Global Forecast System (GFS) forecast, which dominated any benefits from assimilating an increased volume of satellite observations due to the larger domain. It was found that the LBCs with realistic environmental flow information could provide better constraints on smaller domain forecasts. This study demonstrated that satellite DA can improve the analysis of a hurricane asymmetry, especially in a shear environment, and then lead to a better track forecast, and also emphasized the importance of the LBCs and the challenges associated with the evaluation of satellite data impacts on regional model prediction.

TI  - Maternal early warning systems-Towards reducing preventable maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity through improved clinical surveillance and responsiveness
T2  - SEMINARS IN PERINATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite increasing awareness of obstetric safety initiatives, maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity in the United States have continued to increase over the past 20 years. Since results from large-scale surveillance programs suggest that up to 50% of maternal deaths may be preventable, new efforts are focused on developing and testing early warning systems for the obstetric population. Early warning systems are a set of specific clinical signs or symptoms that trigger the awareness of risk and an urgent patient evaluation, with the goal of reducing severe morbidity and mortality through timely diagnosis and treatment. Early warning systems have proven effective at predicting and reducing mortality and severe morbidity in medical, surgical, and critical care patient populations; however, there has been limited research on how to adapt these tools for use in the obstetric population, where physiologic changes of pregnancy render them inadequate. In this article, we review the available obstetric early warning systems and present evidence for their use in reducing maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. We also discuss considerations and strategies for implementation and acceptance of these early warning systems for clinical use in obstetrics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Insecticide resistance in malaria vectors along the Thailand-Myanmar border
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is a paucity of data about the susceptibility status of malaria vectors to Public Health insecticides along the Thailand-Myanmar border. This lack of data is a limitation to guide malaria vector-control in this region. The aim of this study was to assess the susceptibility status of malaria vectors to deltamethrin, permethrin and DDT and to validate a simple molecular assay for the detection of knock-down resistance (kdr) mutations in the study area.Methods: Anopheles mosquitoes were collected in four sentinel villages during August and November 2014 and July 2015 using human landing catch and cow bait collection methods. WHO susceptibility tests were carried out to measure the mortality and knock-down rates of female mosquitoes to deltamethrin (0.05%), permethrin (0.75%) and DDT (4%). DNA sequencing of a fragment of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene was carried out to identify knock-down resistance (kdr) mutations at position 1014 in mosquitoes surviving exposure to insecticides.Results: A total of 6295 Anopheles belonging to ten different species were bioassayed. Resistance or suspected resistance to pyrethroids was detected in An. barbirostris (s.l.) (72 and 84% mortality to deltamethrin (n = 504) and permethrin (n = 493) respectively), An. hyrcanus (s.l.) (33 and 48% mortality to deltamethrin (n = 172) and permethrin (n = 154), respectively), An. jamesii (87% mortality to deltamethrin, n = 111), An. maculatus (s.l.) (85 and 97% mortality to deltamethrin (n = 280) and permethrin (n = 264), respectively), An. minimus (s.l.) (92% mortality, n = 370) and An. vagus (75 and 95% mortality to deltamethrin (n = 148) and permethrin (n = 178), respectively). Resistance or suspected resistance to DDT was detected in An. barbirostris (s.l.) (74% mortality, n = 435), An. hyrcanus (s.l.) (57% mortality, n = 91) and An. vagus (97% mortality, n = 133). The L1014S kdr mutation at both heterozygous and homozygous state was detected only in An. peditaeniatus (Hyrcanus Group).Conclusion: Resistance to pyrethroids is present along the Thailand-Myanmar border, and it represents a threat for malaria vector control. Further investigations are needed to better understand the molecular basis of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in this area.

T2  - Communicable diseases intelligence quarterly report
M3  - Historical Article
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The Victorian Sentinel Practice Influenza Network conducts syndromic surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI), with testing for laboratory confirmation of a proportion of cases at the discretion of general practitioners. The aim of this study was to evaluate the consistency of sentinel general practitioners' swabbing practice within and between influenza seasons. Aggregated, weekly, non-identified data for May to October each year from 2007 to 2014 were used to calculate the proportion of patients presenting with ILI (defined as cough, fever and fatigue), proportion of ILI patients swabbed and proportion of swabs positive for influenza. Data on the proportion of consultations for ILI and the proportion of ILI patients swabbed were aggregated into time-period quintiles for each year. Analysis of variance was used to compare ILI patients swabbed for each aggregated time-period quintile over all 8 years. Spearman's correlation and Bland-Altman analyses were used to measure association and agreement respectively between ILI proportions of consultations and swabs positive for influenza in time period quintiles within each year. Data were aggregated by year for the rest of the analyses. Between 2007 and 2014 there was a slight decrease in the proportion of positive tests and the proportion of ILI patients was generally a good proxy for influenza test positivity. There was consistency in testing within and between seasons, despite an overall testing increase between 2007 and 2014. There was no evidence for temporal sampling bias in these data despite testing not being performed on a systematic basis. This sampling regimen could also be considered in other similar surveillance systems.

TI  - An Improved Remote Sensing Image Fusion Algorithm Based on IHS Transformation
T2  - KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing image processing, the traditional fusion algorithm is based on the Intensity-Hue-Saturation (IHS) transformation. This method does not take into account the texture or spectrum information, spatial resolution and statistical information of the photos adequately, which leads to spectrum distortion of the image. Although traditional solutions in such application combine manifold methods, the fusion procedure is rather complicated and not suitable for practical operation. In this paper, an improved IHS transformation fusion algorithm based on the local variance weighting scheme is proposed for remote sensing images. In our proposal, firstly, the local variance of the SPOT (which comes from French "Systeme Probatoire d'Observation dela Tarre" and means "earth observing system") image is calculated by using different sliding windows. The optimal window size is then selected with the images being normalized with the optimal window local variance. Secondly, the power exponent is chosen as the mapping function, and the local variance is used to obtain the weight of the I component and match SPOT images. Then we obtain the I'component with the weight, the I component and the matched SPOT images. Finally, the final fusion image is obtained by the inverse Intensity-Hue-Saturation transformation of the I', H and S components. The proposed algorithm has been tested and compared with some other image fusion methods well known in the literature. Simulation result indicates that the proposed algorithm could obtain a superior fused image based on quantitative fusion evaluation indices.

TI  - Land cover changes induced by the great east Japan earthquake in 2011
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The east Japan earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011 was a big natural disaster, comprising the large earthquake shock, tsunami, and Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident. These disasters caused changes in the land use and land cover (LULC) in Japan's Tohoku district. While the LULC map created before the disaster is available, as yet there is no precise LULC map of the district after the disaster. In this study, we created a precise LULC map for the years 2013-2015 post-disaster with 30-m spatial resolution using the Landsat-8 with the Operational Land Imager (OLI) to evaluate the changes in LULC induced by the disaster. Our results indicate many changes in areas categorized as rice paddies primarily into grass categories along the coast damaged by the tsunami and in the evacuation zone around the FDNPP. Since there is a possibility of future LULC changes according to the change of the evacuation zone and implementation of reconstruction and revitalization efforts, we recommend continual monitoring of the changes in LULC by the use of satellite data in order to evaluate the long-term effects of the disaster.

TI  - Estimating soil salt components and salinity using hyperspectral remote sensing data in an arid area of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - HJ-1A hyperspectral data were used to distinguish topsoil salt components and estimate soil salinity, and the relationship between soil salt chemical components and sensitive bands of soil reflectance spectra was analyzed. The correlation between the soil salt content and the soil spectra obtained from the hyperspectral data was analyzed, proving that topsoil salinity has a very significant correlation with soil reflectance spectra. The relationship between soil reflectance spectra and salt chemical ions was investigated. The soil spectral reflectance at wavelength 510.975 nm and a difference vegetation index were selected to estimate soil salinity and the dominant salt chemical ion concentrations at a depth of 0 to 10 cm using a partial least squares regression model. It was found that the bands sensitive to various levels of chemical components of soil salt were shown to differ, controlled by the dominant component of the soil salt. The sensitive bands in the soil salinity estimation will change with differences in salt components. Estimating the dominant salt in the soil using soil reflectance spectra will lead to greater prediction accuracy. This study provided a possible method for the estimation of salinity and chemical component levels in topsoil, using the hyperspectral data to estimate topsoil salt components. (C) The Authors.

TI  - A tipping point in refreezing accelerates mass loss of Greenland's glaciers and ice caps
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Melting of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) and its peripheral glaciers and ice caps (GICs) contributes about 43% to contemporary sea level rise. While patterns of GrIS mass loss are well studied, the spatial and temporal evolution of GICs mass loss and the acting processes have remained unclear. Here we use a novel, 1 km surface mass balance product, evaluated against in situ and remote sensing data, to identify 1997 (+/- 5 years) as a tipping point for GICs mass balance. That year marks the onset of a rapid deterioration in the capacity of the GICs firn to refreeze meltwater. Consequently, GICs runoff increases 65% faster than meltwater production, tripling the post-1997 mass loss to 36 +/- 16 Gt(-1), or similar to 14% of the Greenland total. In sharp contrast, the extensive inland firn of the GrIS retains most of its refreezing capacity for now, buffering 22% of the increased meltwater production. This underlines the very different response of the GICs and GrIS to atmospheric warming.

TI  - Disease severity determines health-seeking behaviour amongst individuals with influenza-like illness in an internet-based cohort
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Seasonal influenza epidemics place considerable strain on health services. Robust systems of surveillance are therefore required to ensure preparedness. Sentinel surveillance does not accurately capture the community burden of epidemics as it misses cases that do not present to health services. In this study, Flusurvey (an internet-based community surveillance tool) was used to examine how severity of disease influences health-seeking behaviour in the UK.Methods: Logistic regression with random effects was used to investigate the association between health-seeking and symptom severity, duration of illness and reduction in self-reported health-score over four flu seasons between 2011 and 2015.Results: The majority of individuals did not seek care. In general, there was very strong evidence for an association between all severity indicators and visiting a health service (p < 0.0001). Being female (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.23-2.14, p = 0.0003) and a self-diagnosis of the flu (OR 3.39, 95% CI 2.38-4.83, p < 0.0001) were also associated with increased likelihood of visiting a health service. During the 2012-13 and 2014-15 flu seasons, there was a significantly larger proportion of individuals with more severe sets of symptoms and a longer duration of illness. Despite this, the proportion of individuals with particular sets of symptoms visiting a health service showed only very slight variation across years.Conclusions: Traditional surveillance systems capture only the more severe episodes of illness. However, in spite of variation in flu activity, the proportion of individuals visiting a health service remains relatively stable within specific sets of symptoms across years. These data could be used in combination with data on consultation rates to provide better estimates of community burden.

AB  - A 50-year-old woman presented with chest tenderness. On examination, both breasts were lumpy. Bilateral mammography showed heterogeneously dense parenchyma, with possible stromal distortion laterally on the right at the 0900 position. On ultrasound (US), a corresponding 13*9*10 mm irregular hypoechoic mass with internal vascularity was noted and both breasts had a complex heterogeneous fibroglandular background pattern. US-guided core biopsy with marker clip insertion was performed with the diagnosis of a grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). In view of the parenchymal pattern on mammography and US, contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) was performed for local staging. Mild background enhancement was noted, but there was no enhancement at the lesion site. The patient elected to have bilateral mastectomies and sentinel node biopsies. Final histopathology showed a node negative 11 mm grade 2 oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive, IDC.

TI  - Aerosol radiative effects under clear skies over Europe and their changes in the period of 2001-2012
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the study, the clear-sky aerosol radiative effects have been quantified at 52 European sites using empirical and radiative transfer modelling approaches. Furthermore, the trends of the aerosol radiative effects are also determined for the period of 2001-2012. The aerosol radiative effects are simulated using the Mesoscale Atmospheric Global Irradiance Code radiation code with aerosol and water vapour climatology. The annual mean of the surface aerosol radiative effects in clear-sky situations over Europe is -7.1 +/- 2.9Wm(-2). The trends of the aerosol radiative effects are derived assigning radiative effects to monthly Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aerosol optical depth time series applying linear fitting. In the indirect approach, the clear-sky situations are selected from daily surface solar radiation observations from the Word Radiation Data Centre, and the trends of the aerosol radiative effects are delimitated in these clear-sky radiation time series. The two approaches give good fit, based on the direct approach the annual trend of the aerosol radiative effects on clear-sky solar surface radiation is -4.41Wm(-2) per decade for the period of 2001-2013, while in the case of the indirect approach, this trend is found to be -4.46Wm(-2) per decade. The seasonal trends of the aerosol radiative effects vary between -7.57 and -0.17Wm(-2) per decade indicating stronger decreases in summertime. The results are presented for four sub-regions of Europe detecting negative changes in all cases with a stronger decrease in the central, north-eastern and southern part of the continent. The trends of the aerosol radiative effect have the same magnitude as the trends detected in clear-sky solar surface radiation, and are an order of magnitude higher than the radiative effects of water vapour (0.20Wm(-2) per decade).

TI  - 2D comb feature for analysis of ship classification in high-resolution SAR imagery
T2  - ELECTRONICS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new feature named 2D comb' to improve ship classification is proposed. The proposed feature presents added value to distinguish between container ship, tank ship and cargo ship. It is based on radar cross-section (RCS) statistic of the ship target related to the ship structure. Besides, related local RCS is proposed to classify three kinds of ships. Experimental results based on TerraSAR-X images show that the proposed feature can abstract and describe the ship structure in high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. It establishes relationship between RCS and ship structure, which is very useful to distinguish different kinds of ships.

TI  - The Andes Cordillera. Part I: snow distribution, properties, and trends (1979-2014)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover presence, duration, properties, and water amount play a major role in Earth's climate system through its impact on the surface energy budget. Snow cover conditions and trends (1979-2014) were simulated for South America-for the entire Andes Cordillera. Recent data sets and SnowModel developments allow relatively high-resolutions of 3-h time step and 4-km horizontal grid increment for this domain. US Geological Survey's Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 topography, Global Land Cover (GlobCover), Randolph Glacier Inventory (v. 4.0) glacier, and NASA modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications data sets were used to simulate first-order atmospheric forcing (e.g. near-surface air temperature and precipitation, including the fraction of precipitation falling as snow) and terrestrial snow characteristics (e.g. snow cover days, snow water equivalent depth, and snow density). Simulated snow conditions were verified against moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer-derived snow cover extent and 3064 individual direct observations of snow depths. Regional variability in mean annual air temperature occurred: positive trends in general were seen in the high Andes Cordillera, and negative trends at relatively lower elevations both east and west of the Cordillera. Snow precipitation showed more heterogeneous patterns than air temperature due to the influence from atmospheric conditions, topography, and orography. Overall, for the Cordillera, much of the area north of 23 degrees S had a decrease in the number of snow cover days, while the southern half experienced the opposite. The snow cover extent changed approximate to-15% during the simulation period, mostly between the elevations of approximate to 3000 and 5000m above sea level (a.s.l.). However, below 1000ma.s.l. (in Patagonia) the snow cover extent increased. The snow properties varied over short distances both along and across the Andes Cordillera.

TI  - Mapping the reduction in gross primary productivity in subarctic birch forests due to insect outbreaks
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - It is projected that forest disturbances, such as insect outbreaks, will have an increasingly negative impact on forests with a warmer climate. These disturbance events can have a substantial impact on forests' ability to absorb atmospheric CO2, and may even turn forests from carbon sinks into carbon sources; hence, it is important to develop methods both to monitor forest disturbances and to quantify the impact of these disturbance events on the carbon balance. In this study we present a method to monitor insect-induced defoliation in a subarctic birch forest in northern Sweden, and to quantify the impact of these outbreaks on gross primary productivity (GPP). Since frequent cloud cover in the study area requires data with high temporal resolution and limits the use of finer spatial resolution sensors such as Landsat, defoliation was mapped with remote sensing data from the MODIS sensor with 250m x 250m spatial resolution. The impact on GPP was estimated with a light use efficiency (LUE) model that was calibrated with GPP data obtained from eddy covariance (EC) measurements from 5 years with undisturbed birch forest and 1 year with insect-induced defoliation. Two methods were applied to estimate the impact on GPP: (1) applying a GPP reduction factor derived from EC measured GPP to estimate GPP loss, and (2) running a LUE model for both undisturbed and defoliated forest and deriving the differences in modelled GPP. In the study area of 100 km(2) the results suggested a substantial setback to the carbon uptake: an average decrease in regional GPP over the three outbreak years (2004, 2012, and 2013) was estimated to 15 +/- 5 Gg C yr(-1), compared to the mean regional GPP of 40 +/- 12 Gg C yr(-1) for the 5 years without defoliation, i.e. 38 %. In the most severe outbreak year (2012), 76 % of the birch forests were defoliated, and annual regional GPP was merely 50 % of GPP for years without disturbances. The study has generated valuable data on GPP reduction, and demonstrates a potential for mapping insect disturbance impact over extended areas.

TI  - Earthquake damage mapping by using remotely sensed data: the Haiti case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work proposes methodologies aimed at evaluating the sensitivity of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) change features obtained from satellite images with respect to the damage grade due to an earthquake. The test case is the Mw 7.0 earthquake that hit Haiti on January 12, 2010, located 25 km west-south-west of the city of Port-au-Prince. The disastrous shock caused the collapse of a huge number of buildings and widespread damage. The objective is to investigate possible parameters that can affect the robustness and sensitivity of the proposed methods derived from the literature. It is worth noting how the proposed analysis concerns the estimation of derived features at object scale. For this purpose, a segmentation of the study area into several regions has been done by considering a set of polygons, over the city of Port-au-Prince, extracted from the open source open street map geo-database. The analysis of change detection indicators is based on ground truth information collected during a postearthquake survey and is available from a Joint Research Centre database. The resulting damage map is expressed in terms of collapse ratio, thus indicating the areas with a greater number of collapsed buildings. The available satellite dataset is composed of optical and SAR images, collected before and after the seismic event. In particular, we used two GeoEye-1 optical images (one preseismic and one postseismic) and three TerraSAR-X SAR images (two preseismic and one postseismic). Previous studies allowed us to identify some features having a good sensitivity with damage at the object scale. Regarding the optical data, we selected the normalized difference index and two quantities coming from the information theory, namely the Kullback-Libler divergence (KLD) and the mutual information (MI). In addition, for the SAR data, we picked out the intensity correlation difference and the KLD parameter. In order to analyze the capability of these parameters to correctly detect damaged areas, two different classifiers were used: the Naive Bayes and the support vector machine classifiers. The classification results demonstrate that the simultaneous use of several change features from Earth observations can improve the damage estimation at object scale. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Urban meteorological modeling using WRF: a sensitivity study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the sensitivity of high-resolution mesoscale simulations of urban heat island (UHI) in the Chicago metropolitan area (CMA) and its environs to urban physical parameterizations, with emphasis on the role of lake breeze. A series of climate downscaling experiments were conducted using the urban-Weather Research and Forecasting (uWRF) model at 1-km horizontal resolution for a relatively warm period with a strong lake breeze. The study employed best available morphological data sets, selection of appropriate urban parameters, and estimates of anthropogenic heating sources for the CMA. Several urban parameterization schemes were then evaluated using these parameter values. The study also examined (1) the impacts of land data assimilation for initialization of the mesoscale model, (2) the role of urbanization on UHI and lake breeze, and (3) the effects of sub-grid scale land-cover variability on urban meteorological predictions. Comparisons of temperature and wind simulations with station observations and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data in the CMA showed that uWRF, with appropriate selection of urban parameter values, was able to reproduce the measured near-surface temperature and wind speeds reasonably well. In particular, the model was able to capture the observed spatial variation of 2-m near-surface temperatures at night, when the UHI effect was pronounced. Results showed that inclusion of sub-grid scale variability of land-use and initializing models with more accurate land surface data can yield improved simulations of near-surface temperatures and wind speeds, particularly in the context of simulating the extent and spatial heterogeneity of UHI effects.

TI  - Terrestrial reproduction as an adaptation to steep terrain in African toads
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - How evolutionary novelties evolve is a major question in evolutionary biology. It is widely accepted that changes in environmental conditions shift the position of selective optima, and advancements in phylogenetic comparative approaches allow the rigorous testing of such correlated transitions. A longstanding question in vertebrate biology has been the evolution of terrestrial life histories in amphibians and here, by investigating African bufonids, we test whether terrestrial modes of reproduction have evolved as adaptations to particular abiotic habitat parameters. We reconstruct and date the most complete species-level molecular phylogeny and estimate ancestral states for reproductive modes. By correlating continuous habitat measurements from remote sensing data and locality records with life-history transitions, we discover that terrestrial modes of reproduction, including viviparity evolved multiple times in this group, most often directly from fully aquatic modes. Terrestrial modes of reproduction are strongly correlated with steep terrain and low availability of accumulated water sources. Evolutionary transitions to terrestrial modes of reproduction occurred synchronously with or after transitions in habitat, and we, therefore, interpret terrestrial breeding as an adaptation to these abiotic conditions, rather than an exaptation that facilitated the colonization of montane habitats.

TI  - Human Melanoma-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Regulate Dendritic Cell Maturation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evolution of melanoma from a primary tumor to widespread metastasis is crucially dependent on lymphatic spread. The mechanisms regulating the initial step in metastatic dissemination via regional lymph nodes remain largely unknown; however, evidence supporting the establishment of a pre-metastatic niche is evolving. We have previously described a dysfunctional immune profile including reduced expression of dendritic cell (DC) maturation markers in the first node draining from the primary tumor, the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Importantly, this phenotype is present prior to evidence of nodal metastasis. Herein, we evaluate melanoma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as potential mediators of the premetastatic niche through cargo-specific polarization of DCs. DCs matured in vitro in the presence of melanoma EVs demonstrated significantly impaired expression of CD83 and CD86 as well as decreased expression of Th1 polarizing chemokines FIt3L and IL15 and migration chemokines MIP-l alpha and MIP-1 beta compared to liposome-treated DCs. Profiling of melanoma EV cargo identified shared proteomic and RNA signatures including S100A8 and S100A9 protein cargo, which in vitro compromised DC maturation similar to melanoma EVs. Early evidence demonstrates that similar EVs can be isolated from human afferent lymphatic fluid ex vivo. Taken together, here, we propose melanoma EV cargo as a mechanism by which DC maturation is compromised warranting further study to consider this as a potential mechanism enabled by the primary tumor to establish the premetastatic niche in tumor-draining SLNs of patients.

TI  - Validation of MODIS-based monitoring for a green tide in the Yellow Sea with the aid of unmanned aerial vehicle
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have shown that Terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) has low detection and characterization efficiency when mapping a green tide (Ulva prolifera) in the Yellow Sea. To quantify the uncertainty in mapping of the green tide using MODIS data, comparisons were conducted between quasi synchronous MODIS images and in situ observation data, as well as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image. The results show that MODIS images could detect the location of large (> 100 m) floating green algae patches with good positional accuracy but tended to ignore the existence of small patches less than 10 m in width. The floating macroalgae area extracted using MODIS was several times larger than the area mapped using the UAV image. The Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument, the Chinese high resolution GF-1 wide field camera, and the Chinese HJ-1 charge-coupled device are recommended for early green tide detection, whereas MODIS is suitable for green tide monitoring. The UAV could also play an important role in regional green tide monitoring with the advantages of flexibility, smaller dimensions, high spatial resolution, and low cost.

TI  - Seasonal prevalence and species composition of mosquitoes and chigger mites collected from Daegu, Gunwi and Sangju in South Korea, 2014
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: As the habitat changes in Korea due to climate change, the emergence of disease-mediated vectors is increasing rapidly. Thus for the surveillance of mosquito-and chigger mite-borne disease, their seasonal prevalence and species composition were investigated at seven locations in Daegu, Gunwi and Sangju.Methods: Mosquitoes were collected twice every month from five collection sites using a black light and BG sentinel traps in Daegu and Gunwi from April through November. Chigger mites were investigated twice per month from wild rodents caught with Sherman live traps in Gunwi and Sangju from April through May and September through November.Results: A total of 2,361 female mosquitoes were collected. Cowshed (626 individuals, Trap index (TI) 44.7) and Kyungpook National University campus (846 individuals, TI 60.4) in Daegu had the highest number of mosquitoes in the black light and BG sentinel trap, respectively. The mosquitoes were collected more by BG sentinel trap than the black light trap. Nine mosquito species were trapped, and the Culex pipiens complex was the most commonly mosquito (1,397 individuals, 59.2%), followed by Anopheles sinensis (554 individuals, 23.5%). Anopheles sinensis (531 individuals, 51.9%) and Culex pipiens complex (1,142 individuals, 85.4%) were the most mosquitoes from black light and BG sentinel trap, respectively. In terms of seasonal prevalence, the highest abundance was in July, with 824 individuals collected. In chigger mites, eighty-one wild rodents of five species that are hosts of chigger mites were collected; among them, 53 and 25 individuals of Apodemus agrarius and Crocidura suaveolens, respectively were trapped. Leptotrombidium pallidum was a dominant species, with 2,467 individuals collected (67.8%).Conclusions: The mosquito was the dominant species in Culex pipiens complex and the highest in July and August. Apodemus agrarius was most abundant in wild rats and Leptotrombidium pallidum was dominant in the collected chigger mites.

TI  - Subsidence at Cerro Prieto Geothermal Field and postseismic slip along the Indiviso fault from 2011 to 2016 RADARSAT-2 DInSAR time series analysis
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present RADARSAT-2 Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) observations of deformation due to fluid extraction at the Cerro Prieto Geothermal Field (CPGF) and afterslip on the 2010 M7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah (EMC) earthquake rupture during 2011-2016. Advanced multidimensional time series analysis reveals subsidence at the CPGF with the maximum rate greater than 100mm/yr accompanied by horizontal motion (radial contraction) at a rate greater than 30mm/yr. During the same time period, more than 30mm of surface creep occurred on the Indiviso fault ruptured by the EMC earthquake. We performed inversions of DInSAR data to estimate the rate of volume changes at depth due to the geothermal production at the CPGF and the distribution of afterslip on the Indiviso fault. The maximum coseismic slip due to the EMC earthquake correlates with the Coulomb stress changes on the Indiviso fault due to fluid extraction at the CPGF. Afterslip occurs on the periphery of maximum coseismic slip areas. Time series analysis indicates that afterslip still occurs 6years after the earthquake.

TI  - Applicability of Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans multitemporal interferometry for monitoring slow ground motions in the San Francisco Bay Area
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from the Sentinel-1 satellite have already proven useful for investigating seismic and volcanic events since its launch in April 2014. The requirement of ultrahigh coregistration accuracy and the current relatively short time of Sentinel-1 acquisitions make its application challenging for studying slow deformation processes, such as fault creep and land subsidence. Here we analyze a set of 14 SAR images over the San Francisco Bay Area spanning 1year from early 2015 to 2016. We show that implementing an existing Enhanced Spectral Diversity algorithm or using precise orbits together with a reference digital elevation model both yield the required coregistration accuracy for making use of the phase measurements in time series analysis of ground deformation. Following a thorough validation test, we update our estimates of Hayward Fault creep rate and confirm uplift due to recharge of the Santa Clara Valley aquifer system during the final summer of 4year drought.

T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matter (PM) pollution from China is transported eastward to Korea and Japan and has been suggested to influence surface air quality on the West Coast of the United States. However, remote sensing studies have been inconclusive as to recent trends in Chinese emissions and transport. We reconciled different passive remote sensing points of view and found that while aerosol optical thickness (AOT) as an indicator of particulate pollution has increased from the start of the observation period (2000) to 2006-2007 from the main Chinese coastal outflow regions, since then there has been a 10-20% decrease in AOT (with respect to 2007). Reductions were observed in spring, summer, and fall seasons. No improvement in exported PM pollution is found for the winter season.Plain Language Summary Particulate matter pollution from China is transported eastward to Korea and Japan and has been suggested to influence surface air quality on the West Coast of the United States. However, remote sensing studies have been inconclusive as to recent trends in Chinese emissions and transport. We reconciled different passive remote sensing points of view and found that while aerosol optcial thickness (AOT) as an indicator of particulate pollution has increased to 2006-2007 in the main exit regions of China's coast, since then there has been a 10-20% decrease in AOT (with respect to 2007). Reductions were observed in spring, summer, and fall seasons. No improvement in exported particulate matter pollution is found for the winter season.

T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - To accelerate our endeavors to overcome cancer, Chinese Journal of Cancer has launched a program of publishing 150 most important questions in cancer research and clinical oncology. In this article, nine more questions are presented as followed. Question 6. Why do nasopharyngeal carcinomas rarely metastasize to the brain? Question 7. Can distant spread of cancer cells be blocked by inhibiting the remodeling of high endothelial venules in the sentinel lymph node? Question 8. What sort of live-imaging techniques can be developed to directly observe the dynamic processes of metastasis? Question 9. How does chronic hepatitis prevent liver metastasis from colorectal cancer? Question 10. How many types of host cells contribute to forming the pre-metastatic niche in the lung favorable for metastasis? Question 11. Why do cancers rarely metastasize to the small bowel? Question 12. Why do glioblastomas rarely metastasize outside the central nervous system? Question 13. Despite increased understanding of the molecular genetic events leading to the development and progression of high-grade gliomas, these tumors are the most therapeutically refractory among all human cancers. What then would be the most effective therapeutic approaches to treat what in essence can be regarded as a whole brain malignancy, since even a surgical resection of greater than 99% of tumor tissues is invariably associated with recurrence? Question 14. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) effectively limits a wide variety of potential therapeutic agents from reaching glioma cells widely dispersed in the brain. What therapeutic approaches can be used to breach the BBB and allow therapeutic agents to seek out and kill these tumor cells?

TI  - Inversion of AMSR-E observations for land surface temperature estimation: 2. Global comparison with infrared satellite temperature
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A comparison of land surface temperature (Ts) derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) with infrared Ts is presented. The infrared Ts include clear-sky estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager, the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Imager, and the Japanese Meteorological Imager. The higher discrepancies between AMSR-E and MODIS are observed over deserts and snow-covered areas. The former seems to be associated with Ts underestimation by MODIS, whereas the latter is mostly related to uncertainties in microwave emissivity over snow/ice. Ts differences between AMSR-E and MODIS are significantly reduced after masking out snow and deserts, with a bias change from 2.6/4.6K to 3.0/1.4K for daytime/nighttime and a standard deviation (STD) decrease from 7.3/7.9K to 5.1/3.9K. When comparing with all infrared sensors, the STD of the differences between microwave and infrared Ts is generally higher than between IR retrievals. However, the biases between microwave and infrared Ts are, in some cases, of the same order as the ones observed between infrared products. This is the case for GOES, with daytime biases with respect to AMSR-E and MODIS of 0.45K and 0.60K, respectively. While the infrared Ts are clear-sky estimates, AMSR-E also provides Ts under cloudy conditions. For frequently cloudy regions, this results in a large increase of available Ts estimates (>250%), making the microwave Ts a very powerful complement of the infrared estimates.

TI  - Use of indocyanine green for detecting sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer: letter to the editor
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Letter
AB  - In a previous issue of the journal, Oldrich Coufal and Vuk Fait reported a pilot study that specifically addressed the use of indocyanine green for detecting sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer within a European population. They concluded that fluorescence method cannot currently be considered a method fully comparable with using radioisotopes in this setting. We consider that the absence of a learning curve, the low mean of retrieved sentinel nodes, and the possibility that migration of indocyanine green occurred after the initial biopsy limit the strength of their conclusion.

TI  - Inversion of AMSR-E observations for land surface temperature estimation: 1. Methodology and evaluation with station temperature
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Inversions of the Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) brightness temperatures (T-bs) to derive the land surface temperature (T-s) are presented based on building a global transfer function by neural networks trained with AMSR-E T-bs and retrieved microwave T-s*. The only required inputs are the T-bs and monthly climatological emissivities, minimizing the dependence on ancillary data. The inversions are accompanied by a coarse estimation of retrieval uncertainty, an estimate of the quality of the retrieval, and a series of flags to signal difficult inversion situations. For approximate to 75% of the land surface the root-mean-square difference (RMSD) between the training target T-s* and the neural network retrieved T-s is below 2.8 K. The RMSD when comparing with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) clear-sky T-s is below 3.9 K for the same conditions. Over 10 ground stations, AMSR-E and MODIS T-s were compared with the in situ data. Overall, MODIS agrees better with the station T-s than AMSR-E (all-station mean RMSD of 2.4 K for MODIS and 4.0 for AMSR-E), but AMSR-E provides a larger number of T-s estimates by being able to measure under cloudy conditions, with an approximated ratio of 3 to 1 over the analyzed stations. At many stations the RMSD of the AMSR-E clear and cloudy sky are comparable, highlighting the ability of the microwave inversions to provide T-s under most atmospheric conditions. Closest agreement with the in situ T-s happens for stations with dense vegetation, where AMSR-E emissivity is less varying.

TI  - Development of a daytime cloud and haze detection algorithm for Himawari-8 satellite measurements over central and eastern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection by passive satellite sensors is very challenging in hazy weather over China because the reflective characteristics of haze and clouds are very similar. Consequently, hazy areas tend to be mistaken as cloudy or clear areas by current cloud mask algorithms. The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) aboard Himawari-8 is a multispectral Earth observation sensor with high temporal and spatial resolutions. A cloud and haze detection algorithm for AHI measurements is urgently needed for monitoring atmospheric pollution and its transport over China. This study presents the new Himawari-8 Cloud and Haze Mask (HCHM) algorithm that classifies image pixels from central and eastern China into one of three categories: clear, cloudy, or hazy. Based on the observations that haze occurs near the ground and accumulates in low-elevation plains and basins while clouds form at high altitudes, the proposed HCHM algorithm incorporates altitude information to adjust the thresholds used in the selected threshold tests to separate haze and cloud pixels. We find that combining auxiliary digital elevation model data with traditional indicators, such as the R-0.86/R-0.64, R-0.86/R-1.6, and BT11-BT3.9, improves the accuracy of cloud and haze discrimination. The HCHM algorithm is applied to Himawari-8 observations from August 2015, November 2015, January 2016, and May 2016 and validated against the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation vertical feature mask results. The validation shows that the average leakage rate, false alarm rate, and haze missing rate of the HCHM algorithm are 3.95%, 5.88%, and 4.17%, respectively.

TI  - Remote sensing and modelling analysis of the extreme dust storm hitting the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean in September 2015
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The extreme dust storm that affected the Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean in September 2015 resulted in record-breaking dust loads over Cyprus with aerosol optical depth exceeding 5.0 at 550 nm. We analyse this event using profiles from the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), geostationary observations from the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), and high-resolution simulations from the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). The analysis of modelling and remote sensing data reveals the main mechanisms that resulted in the generation and persistence of the dust cloud over the Middle East and Cyprus. A combination of meteorological and surface processes is found, including (a) the development of a thermal low in the area of Syria that results in unstable atmospheric conditions and dust mobilization in this area, (b) the convective activity over northern Iraq that triggers the formation of westward-moving haboobs that merge with the previously elevated dust layer, and (c) the changes in land use due to war in the areas of northern Iraq and Syria that enhance dust erodibility.

TI  - Can axillary radiotherapy replace axillary dissection for patients with positive sentinel nodes? A systematic review and meta-analysis.
T2  - Chronic diseases and translational medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of axillary radiotherapy (ART) with that of completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients with a positive sentinel lymph node.METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library by using the search terms "breast cancer", "sentinel lymph node biopsy", "axillary radiotherapy" or "regional node irradiation" for articles published between 2004 and 2016. Only randomized controlled trials that included patients with positive sentinel nodes were included in the meta-analysis.RESULTS: Two randomized controlled trials and three retrospective studies were identified. The reported overall survival rate (hazard ratio [HR]=1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75-1.43, P=0.365), disease-free survival rate (HR=1.01, 95% CI: 0.58-1.45, P=0.144), and axillary recurrence rate (1.2% and 0.4%, and 1.3% and 0.8%, respectively) were similar in both groups. The absence of knowledge on the extent of nodal involvement in the ART group appeared to have no major impact on the administration of adjuvant systemic therapy.CONCLUSIONS: ART is not inferior to cALND in the patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer who had a positive sentinel lymph node. Information obtained by using cALND after SLNB may have no major impact on the administration of adjuvant systemic therapy.

TI  - Satellite retrievals of dust aerosol over the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf (2005-2015)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The inter-annual variability of the dust aerosol presence over the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf is analysed over the period 2005-2015. Particular attention is paid to the variation in loading across the Red Sea, which has previously been shown to have a strong, seasonally dependent latitudinal gradient. Over the 11 years considered, the July mean 630 nm aerosol optical depth (AOD) derived from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) varies between 0.48 and 1.45 in the southern half of the Red Sea. In the north, the equivalent variation is between 0.22 and 0.66. The temporal and spatial pattern of variability captured by SEVIRI is also seen in AOD retrievals from the MODerate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), but there is a systematic offset between the two records. Comparisons of both sets of retrievals with ship-and land-based AERONET measurements show a high degree of correlation with biases of < 0.08. However, these comparisons typically only sample relatively low aerosol loadings. When both records are stratified by AOD retrievals from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), opposing behaviour is revealed at high MISR AODs (> 1), with offsets of C 0.19 for MODIS and 0.06 for SEVIRI. Similar behaviour is also seen over the Persian Gulf. Analysis of the scattering angles at which retrievals from the SEVIRI and MODIS measurements are typically performed in these regions suggests that assumptions concerning particle sphericity may be responsible for the differences seen.

TI  - Spring phenology shapes the spatial foraging behavior of Antarctic petrels
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In polar seas, the seasonal melting of ice triggers the development of an open-water ecosystem characterized by short-lived algal blooms, the grazing and development of zooplankton, and the influx of avian and mammalian predators. Spatial heterogeneity in the timing of ice melt generates temporal variability in the development of these events across the habitat, offering a natural framework to assess how foraging marine predators respond to the spring phenology. We combined 4 yr of tracking data of Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica with synoptic remote-sensing data on sea ice and chlorophyll a to test how the development of melting ice and primary production drive Antarctic petrel foraging. Cross-correlation analyses of first-passage time revealed that Antarctic petrels utilized foraging areas with a spatial scale of 300 km. These areas changed position or disappeared within 10 to 30 d and showed no spatial consistency among years. Generalized additive model (GAM) analyses suggested that the presence of foraging areas was related to the time since ice melt. Antarctic petrels concentrated their search effort in melting areas and in areas that had reached an age of 50 to 60 d from the date of ice melt. We found no significant relationship between search effort and chlorophyll a concentration. We suggest that these foraging patterns were related to the vertical distribution and profitability of the main prey, the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Our study demonstrates that the annual ice melt in the Southern Ocean shapes the development of a highly patchy and elusive food web, underscoring the importance of flexible foraging strategies among top predators.

TI  - Phase-Transition Nanodroplets for Real-Time Photoacoustic/Ultrasound Dual-Modality Imaging and Photothermal Therapy of Sentinel Lymph Node in Breast Cancer
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pathological status of lymph nodes (LNs) plays a critical role in staging and treatment for the patients with breast cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has become the standard method in determining pathological status of axillary LNs. Therefore, the determination of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and therapy of metastatic LNs are highly desirable in clinic. Herein, an unprecedented carbon nanoparticles (CNs)-incorporated liquid-gas phase-transition nanodroplets (CNPs) with strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption, good biocompatibility, excellent photoacoustic (PA) and ultrasound (US) contrast, and high photothermal-conversion efficiency are reported in this study. Upon laser irradiation, liquid-gas phase transition of the CNPs has been demonstrated to provide excellent contrasts for PA/US dual-modality imaging both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the CNPs are capable of staining lymph nodes, which can contribute significantly to the identification of LNs with naked eyes. With increased laser energy, the CNPs exhibit the high performance in killing the breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, due to the photothermal effect induced from the CNs within CNPs. These results suggest that the developed multifunctional phase-transition nanodroplets have high potential to act as the theranostic agents in both SLNs detection and therapy of metastatic LNs.

TI  - Feasibility of using regional sentinel surveillance to monitor the rotavirus vaccine impact, effectiveness and intussusception incidence in the African Region
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 9th African rotavirus symposium was held in Maputo, Mozambique from the 8th to 10th of December 2015, including a total of 101 delegates from 17 countries, 15 of which were African countries. This forum brought together participants with various expertise including scientists, clinicians, immunization program managers, public health officials and policymakers. By the time of the symposium, 29/47 (61%) of countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region had introduced rota virus vaccine into their routine immunization program. Countries that had started monitoring impact and effectiveness of the rotavirus vaccines as well as potential adverse events following immunization (AEFI) including intussusception) also participated. Seven Rotarix (R) vaccine-using countries and another four countries that are using the Rotateq (R) vaccine are conducting systematic surveillance on intussusception and report data to the WHO and partners. The symposium concluded that the regional rotavirus surveillance network has played a crucial role in pre-vaccine data through documenting burden and epidemiology of rotavirus diarrhea in Africa, seasonal trends and identifying common rotavirus genotypes. The sentinel surveillance platform is now being used to assess the impact of the vaccines and monitoring adverse events with a focus on intussusception.

TI  - Detecting surface coal mining areas from remote sensing imagery: an approach based on object-oriented decision trees
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting surface coal mining areas (SCMAs) using remote sensing data in a timely and an accurate manner is necessary for coal industry management and environmental assessment. We developed an approach to effectively extract SCMAs from remote sensing imagery based on object-oriented decision trees (OODT). This OODT approach involves three main steps: object-oriented segmentation, calculation of spectral characteristics, and extraction of SCMAs. The advantage of this approach lies in its effective integration of the spectral and spatial characteristics of SCMAs so as to distinguish the mining areas (i.e., the extracting areas, stripped areas, and dumping areas) from other areas that exhibit similar spectral features (e.g., bare soils and built-up areas). We implemented this method to extract SCMAs in the eastern part of Ordos City in Inner Mongolia, China. Our results had an overall accuracy of 97.07% and a kappa coefficient of 0.80. As compared with three other spectral information-based methods, our OODT approach is more accurate in quantifying the amount and spatial pattern of SCMAs in dryland regions.

TI  - Real-time sentinel lymph node biopsy guidance using combined ultrasound, photoacoustic, fluorescence imaging: <i>in vivo</i> proof-of-principle and validation with nodal obstruction
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification is crucial not only for accurate diagnosis of micro-metastases at an early stage of cancer progression but also for reducing the number of SLN biopsies (SLNB) to minimize their severe side effects. Furthermore, it is desirable that an SLNB guidance should be as safe as possible in routine clinical use. Although there are currently various SLNB guidance methods for pre-operative or intra-operative assessment, none are ideal. We propose a real-time SLNB guidance method using contrast-enhanced tri-modal images (i.e., ultrasound, photoacoustic, and fluorescence) acquired by a recently developed hand-held tri-modal probe. The major advantage of tri-modal imaging is demonstrated here through an in vivo study of the technically-difficult case of nodal obstruction that frequently leads to false-negative results in patients. The results in a tumor model in rabbits and normal controls showed that tri-modal imaging is capable of clearly identifying obstructed SLNs and of indicating their metastatic involvement. Based on these findings, we propose an SLNB protocol to help surgeons take full advantage of the complementary information obtained from tri-modal imaging, including for pre-operative localization, intra-operative biopsy guidance and post-operative analysis.

TI  - Respiratory viruses in patients with influenza like illness in Senegal: Focus on human respiratory adenoviruses
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundHuman adenoviruses (HAdVs) are highly contagious pathogens that are associated with a wide spectrum of human illnesses involving the respiratory tract. In the present study, we investigate the epidemiologic and viral molecular features of HAdVs circulating in Senegal after 4 consecutive years of sentinel surveillance of influenza-like Illness cases.Methodology and resultsFrom January 2012 to December 2015 swabs were collected from consenting ILI outpatients. Adenoviral detection is performed by rRT-PCR with the Anyplex TM I I RV16 Detection kit (Seegene) and molecular characterization was performed using a partial hexon gene sequence. 6381 samples were collected. More than half of patients (51.7%; 3297/6381) were children of < 5 years. 1967 (30.8%) were positive for HAdV with 1561 (79.4%) found in co-infection with at least one another respiratory virus. The most common co-detections were with influenza viruses (53.1%; 1045/1967), rhinoviruses (30%; 591/1967), enteroviruses (18.5%; 364/1967) and RSV (13.5%; 266/1967). Children under 5 were the most infected group (62.2%; 1224/1967; p <0.05). We noted that HAdV was detected throughout the year at a high level with detection peaks of different amplitudes without any clear seasonality. Phylogenetic analysis revealed species HAdV-C in majority, species HAdV-B and one HAdV- 4 genome type. The 9 HAdV-B species like strains from Senegal grouped with genome types HAdV-7, HAdV-55 and HAdV-11 as shown by a phylogenetic branch with a high bootstrap value of (88%).ConclusionIn conclusion, the results of the present study suggest strong year-round HAdV activity in Senegal, especially in children up to 5 years of age. Molecular studies revealed that the dominant species in circulation in patients with ILI appears to be HAdV-C and HAdV-B species. The circulation of though HAdV-7 and HAdV-55 genome types is of note as these serotypes are recognized causes of more severe and even fatal acute respiratory infections.

TI  - Estimating changes in lichen mat volume through time and related effects on barren ground caribou (<i>Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus</i>) movement
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lichens form a critical portion of barren ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) diets, especially during winter months. Here, we assess lichen mat volume across five herd ranges in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada, using newly developed composite Landsat imagery. The lichen volume estimator (LVE) was adapted for use across 700 000 km 2 of barren ground caribou habitat annually from 1984-2012. We subsequently assessed how LVE changed temporally throughout the time series for each pixel using Theil-Sen's slopes, and spatially by assessing whether slope values were centered in local clusters of similar values. Additionally, we assessed how LVE estimates resulted in changes in barren ground caribou movement rates using an extensive telemetry data set from 2006-2011. The Ahiak/Beverly herd had the largest overall increase in LVE (median = 0.033), while the more western herds had the least (median slopes below zero in all cases). LVE slope pixels were arranged in significant clusters across the study area, with the Cape Bathurst, Bathurst, and Bluenose East herds having the most significant clusters of negative slopes (more than 20% of vegetated land in each case). The Ahiak/Beverly and Bluenose West had the most significant positive clusters (16.3% and 18.5% of vegetated land respectively). Barren ground caribou displayed complex reactions to changing lichen conditions depending on season; the majority of detected associations with movement data agreed with current understanding of barren ground caribou foraging behavior (the exception was an increase in movement velocity at high lichen volume estimates in Fall). The temporal assessment of LVE identified areas where shifts in ecological conditions may have resulted in changing lichen mat conditions, while assessing the slope estimates for clustering identified zones beyond the pixel scale where forage conditions may be changing. Lichen volume estimates associated with barren ground caribou movement metrics in an expected manner and, as such, show value for future habitat assessments.

TI  - Biopsy of the sentinel node in lung cancer
T2  - MEDICINA CLINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and objective: Mediastinal lymph node involvement can be understaged in cases of lung cancer (up to 20% in stage I). Sentinel node detection is a standard technique recommended in breast cancer and melanoma action guidelines, and could also be useful in cases of lung cancer.Material and methods: Considering the detection of the sentinel node in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as feasible, a prospective cohort study was carried out on 48 patients with resectable NSCLC, using the intraoperative injection of colloid sulphate technetium-99.Results: The radioisotope migrated in all cases. The procedure's sensitivity was 88.24%, its accuracy was 95.83%, its negative predictive value was 93.94% and the false negative rate was 11.76%. No complications were associated with this technique.Conclusions: The detection of a sentinel node in NSCLC with the intraoperative injection of the isotope is feasible and safe, and allows for detection and sensitivity rates comparable to those of other tumour types.

TI  - An assessment of national surveillance systems for malaria elimination in the Asia Pacific
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Heads of Government from Asia and the Pacific have committed to a malaria-free region by 2030. In 2015, the total number of confirmed cases reported to the World Health Organization by 22 Asia Pacific countries was 2,461,025. However, this was likely a gross underestimate due in part to incidence data not being available from the wide variety of known sources. There is a recognized need for an accurate picture of malaria over time and space to support the goal of elimination. A survey was conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the collection of malaria incidence data for surveillance by National Malaria Control Programmes in 22 countries identified by the Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance.Methods: In 2015-2016, a short questionnaire on malaria surveillance was distributed to 22 country National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCP) in the Asia Pacific. It collected country-specific information about the extent of inclusion of the range of possible sources of malaria incidence data and the role of the private sector in malaria treatment. The findings were used to produce recommendations for the regional heads of government on improving malaria surveillance to inform regional efforts towards malaria elimination.Results: A survey response was received from all 22 target countries. Most of the malaria incidence data collected by NMCPs originated from government health facilities, while many did not collect comprehensive data from mobile and migrant populations, the private sector or the military. All data from village health workers were included by 10/20 countries and some by 5/20. Other sources of data included by some countries were plantations, police and other security forces, sentinel surveillance sites, research or academic institutions, private laboratories and other government ministries. Malaria was treated in private health facilities in 19/21 countries, while anti-malarials were available in private pharmacies in 16/21 and private shops in 6/21. Most countries use primarily paper-based reporting.Conclusions: Most collected malaria incidence data in the Asia Pacific is from government health facilities while data from a wide variety of other known sources are often not included in national surveillance databases. In particular, there needs to be a concerted regional effort to support inclusion of data on mobile and migrant populations and the private sector. There should also be an emphasis on electronic reporting and data harmonization across organizations. This will provide a more accurate and up to date picture of the true burden and distribution of malaria and will be of great assistance in helping realize the goal of malaria elimination in the Asia Pacific by 2030.

TI  - Surge dynamics and lake outbursts of Kyagar Glacier, Karakoram
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent surge cycle of Kyagar Glacier, in the Chinese Karakoram, caused formation of an ice-dammed lake and subsequent glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) exceeding 40 million m(3) in 2015 and 2016. GLOFs from Kyagar Glacier reached double this size in 2002 and earlier, but the role of glacier surging in GLOF formation was previously unrecognised. We present an integrative analysis of the glacier surge dynamics from 2011 to 2016, assessing surge mechanisms and evaluating the surge cycle impact on GLOFs. Over 80 glacier surface velocity fields were created from TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement), Sentinel-1A, and Landsat satellite data. Changes in ice thickness distribution were revealed by a time series of TanDEM-X elevation models. The analysis shows that, during a quiescence phase lasting at least 14 years, ice mass built up in a reservoir area at the top of the glacier tongue, and the terminus thinned by up to 100 m, but in the 2 years preceding the surge onset this pattern reversed. The surge initiated with the onset of the 2014 melt season, and in the following 15 months velocity evolved in a manner consistent with a hydrologically controlled surge mechanism. Dramatic accelerations coincided with melt seasons, winter deceleration was accompanied by subglacial drainage, and rapid surge termination occurred following the 2015 GLOF. Rapid basal motion during the surge is seemingly controlled by high water pressure, caused by input of surface water into either an inefficient subglacial drainage system or unstable subglacial till. The potential lake volume increased to more than 70 million m(3) by late 2016, as a result of over 60 m of thickening at the terminus. Lake formation and the evolution of the ice dam height should be carefully monitored through remote sensing to anticipate large GLOFs in the near future.

AB  - The shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands on the existing Earth Observing missions like MODIS have been designed to meet land and atmospheric science requirements. The future geostationary and polar-orbiting ocean color missions, however, require highly sensitive SWIR bands (> 1550nm) to allow for a precise removal of aerosol contributions. This will allow for reasonable retrievals of the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) using standard NASA atmospheric corrections over turbid coastal waters. Design, fabrication, and maintaining high-performance SWIR bands at very low signal levels bear significant costs on dedicated ocean color missions. This study aims at providing a full analysis of the utility of alternative SWIR bands within the 1600nm atmospheric window if the bands within the 2200nm window were to be excluded due to engineering/cost constraints. Following a series of sensitivity analyses for various spectral band configurations as a function of water vapor amount, we chose spectral bands centered at 1565 and 1675nm as suitable alternative bands within the 1600nm window for a future geostationary imager. The sensitivity of this band combination to different aerosol conditions, calibration uncertainties, and extreme water turbidity were studied and compared with that of all band combinations available on existing polar-orbiting missions. The combination of the alternative channels was shown to be as sensitive to test aerosol models as existing near-infrared (NIR) band combinations (e.g., 748 and 869nm) over clear open ocean waters. It was further demonstrated that while in extremely turbid waters the 1565/1675 band pair yields R-rs retrievals as good as those derived from all other existing SWIR band pairs (> 1550nm), their total calibration uncertainties must be < 1% to meet current science requirements for ocean color retrievals (i.e., Delta R-rs (443) < 5%). We further show that the aerosol removal using the NIR and SWIR bands (available on the existing polar-orbiting missions) can be very sensitive to calibration uncertainties. This requires the need for monitoring the calibration of these bands to ensure consistent multimission ocean color products in coastal/inland waters. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

TI  - Analysis of aerosol transport over southern Poland in August 2015 based on a synergy of remote sensing and backward trajectory techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lufft's CHM 15k "Nimbus" ceilometer and a collocated Cimel sunphotometer were used, in tandem with satellite data, to observe the transport of atmospheric aerosols over Raciborz, Poland, during an exceptionally warm month of August 2015. Two distinct periods are identified: increased aerosol optical thickness (AOT) values, exceeding 0.65, during August 6 to 13 concurrent with the planetary boundary layer elevated up to similar to 2.5 km and thin aerosol layers up to 7 km above ground visible from August 25 to 27. A newly developed scheme for backward air mass trajectory analysis is employed. The scheme utilizes satellite data on thermal anomalies as well as multiangle imaging of aerosol clouds. The obtained retrievals provide evidence that aerosols of biomass burning type were present during the first period, originating from a strong episode of wildfires in Ukraine. Moreover, satellite AOT data from the MODIS instrument show that a significant part of the observed aerosol was accumulated during transport between the region of intense biomass burning and the receptor, Raciborz. The same analysis scheme suggests that a long-range transport of biomass burning products from the United States was a source of the layers observed during the second period. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Reduced performance of a PVC-coated Biogents Sentinel prototype in comparison to the original Biogents Sentinel for monitoring the Asian tiger mosquito, <i>Aedes albopictus</i>, in temperate North America
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes albopictus is a major nuisance pest and also a public health concern because of the role it plays in the transmission of arboviruses. There is a continuing demand for effective surveillance tools for this species. The first generation of Biogents Sentinel (BGS1) traps have proven to be an effective tool for surveillance of Ae. albopictus throughout its range, however, some defects in construction led to the eventual development of the next generation. We compared the performance of the new generation prototype trap (BGS2P) to the original. Studies were conducted in suburban and urban areas in Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, and Virginia, USA in the summer of 2014 (July-October). BGS1 traps collected significantly more Ae. albopictus when compared to the BGS2P with or without CO2 in all locations (P<0.05). When a white cloth was wrapped around the BGS2P traps, efficiency did not change in Louisiana, New Jersey, and Virginia; however, numbers of adult Ae. albopictus collected from the BGS2P and the BGS1 were significantly different based on lure type (P<0.0001). Results from Florida showed that BGS1 with the BG lure and CO2 collected significantly higher adult numbers compared to BGS2P with a three component cartridge lure and CO2 (P<0.0001). Overall, our results indicate that despite improvements in construction and durability of the BGS2P, this newer trap type did not increase the capture rates of Ae. albopictus in North America. Biogents modified BGS2P based on the data collected from the current study and updated as Biogents Sentinel 2 is now commercially available and its efficacy in comparison to the original will require further study.

TI  - THEMIS satellite observations of hot flow anomalies at Earth's bow shock
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hot flow anomalies (HFAs) at Earth's bow shock were identified in Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions During Substorms (THEMIS) satellite data from 2007 to 2009. The events were classified as young or mature and also as regular or spontaneous hot flow anomalies (SHFAs). The dataset has 17 young SHFAs, 49 mature SHFAs, 15 young HFAs, and 55 mature HFAs. They span a wide range of magnetic local times (MLTs) from approximately 7 to 16.5MLT. The largest ratio of solar wind to HFA core density occurred near dusk and at larger distances from the bow shock. In this study, HFAs and SHFAs were observed up to 6.3 R-E and 6.1 R-E (Earth radii), respectively, upstream from the model bow shock. HFA-SHFA occurrence decreases with distance upstream from the bow shock. HFAs of the highest event core ion temperatures were not seen at the flanks. The ratio of HFA ion temperature increase to HFA electron temperature increase is highest around 12MLT and slightly duskward. For SHFAs, (T-ihfa /T-isw)/(T-ehfa/T-esw) generally increased with distance from the bow shock. Both mature and young HFAs are more prevalent when there is an approximately radial interplanetary magnetic field. HFAs occur most preferentially for solar wind speeds from 550 to 600 km s(-1). The correlation coefficient between the HFA increase in thermal energy density from solar wind values and the decrease in kinetic energy density from solar wind values is 0.62. SHFAs and HFAs do not show major differences in this study.

TI  - Discrete call types referring to predation risk enhance the efficiency of the meerkat sentinel system
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel behaviour, a form of coordinated vigilance, occurs in a limited range of species, mostly in cooperative breeders. In some species sentinels confirm their presence vocally by giving a single sentinel call type, whereby the rate and subtle acoustic changes provide graded information on the variation of perceived predation risk. In contrast, meerkat (Suricata suricatta) sentinels produce six different sentinel call types. Here we show that manipulation of perception of danger has different effects on the likelihood of emitting these different call types, and that these call types affect foraging individuals differently. Increasing the perceived predation risk by playing back alarm calls decreased the production rate of the common short note calls and increased the production rate of the rare long calls. Playbacks of short note calls increased foraging behaviour and decreased vigilance in the rest of the group, whereas the opposite was observed when playing long calls. This suggests that the common call types act as all-clear signals, while the rare call types have a warning function. Therefore, meerkats increase the efficiency of their sentinel system by producing several discrete call types that represent changes in predation risk and lead to adjustments of the group's vigilance behaviour.

TI  - Modelling spatial and temporal dynamics of gross primary production in the Sahel from earth-observation-based photosynthetic capacity and quantum efficiency
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been shown that vegetation growth in semiarid regions is important to the global terrestrial CO2 sink, which indicates the strong need for improved understanding and spatially explicit estimates of CO2 uptake (gross primary production; GPP) in semi-arid ecosystems. This study has three aims: (1) to evaluate the MOD17A2H GPP (collection 6) product against GPP based on eddy covariance (EC) for six sites across the Sahel; (2) to characterize relationships between spatial and temporal variability in EC-based photosynthetic capacity (F-opt) and quantum efficiency (alpha) and vegetation indices based on earth observation (EO) (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI)); and (3) to study the applicability of EO upscaled F-opt and alpha for GPP modelling purposes. MOD17A2H GPP (collection 6) drastically underestimated GPP, most likely because maximum light use efficiency is set too low for semi-arid ecosystems in the MODIS algorithm. Intra-annual dynamics in F-opt were closely related to SIWSI being sensitive to equivalent water thickness, whereas alpha was closely related to RDVI being affected by chlorophyll abundance. Spatial and inter-annual dynamics in F-opt and alpha were closely coupled to NDVI and RDVI, respectively. Modelled GPP based on F-opt and alpha upscaled using EO-based indices reproduced in situ GPP well for all except a cropped site that was strongly im-pacted by anthropogenic land use. Upscaled GPP for the Sahel 2001-2014 was 736 +/- 39 gCm(-2) yr(-1). This study indicates the strong applicability of EO as a tool for spatially explicit estimates of GPP, F-opt and alpha; incorporating EO-based F-opt and alpha in dynamic global vegetation models could improve estimates of vegetation production and simulations of ecosystem processes and hydro-biochemical cycles.

TI  - Safety Evaluation of a Novel Strain of <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i>
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Commensal non-toxigenic Bacteroides fragilis confers powerful health benefits to the host, and has recently been identified as a promising probiotic candidate. We previously isolated B. fragilis strain ZY-312 and identified it as a novel strain based on 16S rRNA sequencing and morphological analyses. We also determined that ZY312 displayed desirable probiotic properties, including tolerance to simulated digestive fluid, adherence, and in vitro safety. In this study, we aim to investigate whether ZY312 meets the safety criteria required for probiotic bacteria through comprehensive and systematic evaluation. Consequently, the fatty acid profile, metabolite production, and biochemical activity of strain ZY-312 were found to closely resemble descriptions of B. fragilis in Bergey's manual. Taxonomic identification of strain ZY-312 based on whole genome sequencing indicated that ZY-312 and ATCC 25285 showed 99.99% similarity. The 33 putative virulence-associated factors identified in ZY-312 mainly encoded structural proteins and proteins with physiological activity, while the lack of bft indicated that ZY-312 was non-toxigenic. In vivo safety was proven in both normal and immune-deficient mice. The 11 identified antibiotic resistance genes were located on the chromosome rather than on a plasmid, ruling out the risk of plasmid-mediated transfer of antibiotic resistance. In vitro, ZY-312 showed resistance to cefepime, kanamycin, and streptomycin. Finally, and notably, ZY-312 exhibited high genetic stability after 100 passages in vitro. This study supplements the foundation work on the safety evaluation of ZY-312, and contributes to the development of the first probiotic representative from the dominant Bacteroidetes phylum.

TI  - Impact of icebergs on net primary productivity in the Southern Ocean
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Productivity in the Southern Ocean (SO) is ironlimited, and supply of iron dissolved from aeolian dust is believed to be the main source from outside the marine environment. However, recent studies show that icebergs could provide a comparable amount of bioavailable iron to the SO as aeolian dust. In addition, small-scale areal studies suggest increased concentrations of chlorophyll, krill, and seabirds surrounding icebergs. Based on previous research, this study aims to examine whether iceberg occurrence has a significant impact on marine productivity at the scale of the SO, using remote sensing data of iceberg occurrences and ocean net primary productivity (NPP) covering the period 2002-2014. The impacts of both large and small icebergs are examined in four major ecological zones of the SO: the continental shelf zone (CSZ), the seasonal ice zone (SIZ), the permanent open ocean zone (POOZ), and the polar front zone (PFZ). We found that the presence of icebergs is associated with elevated levels of NPP, but the differences vary in different zones. Grid cells with small icebergs on average have higher NPP than other cells in most iron-deficient zones: 21% higher for the SIZ, 16% for the POOZ, and 12% for the PFZ. The difference is relatively small in the CSZ where iron is supplied from meltwater and sediment input from the continent. In addition, NPP of grid cells adjacent to large icebergs on average is 10% higher than that of control cells in the vicinity. The difference is larger at higher latitudes, where most large icebergs are concentrated. From 1992 to 2014, there is a significant increasing trend for both small and large icebergs. The increase was most rapid in the early 2000s and has leveled off since then. As the climate continues to warm, the Antarctic Ice Sheet is expected to experience increased mass loss as a whole, which could lead to more icebergs in the region. Based on our study, this could result in a higher level of NPP in the SO as a whole, providing a possible negative feedback for global warming in near future.

TI  - Spatial and radiometric characterization of multi-spectrum satellite images through multi-fractal analysis
T2  - NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies have shown that vegetation indexes can be used to estimate root zone soil moisture. Earth surface images, obtained by high-resolution satellites, presently give a lot of information on these indexes, based on the data of several wavelengths. Because of the potential capacity for systematic observations at various scales, remote sensing technology extends the possible data archives from the present time to several decades back. Because of this advantage, enormous efforts have been made by researchers and application specialists to delineate vegetation indexes from local scale to global scale by applying remote sensing imagery.In this work, four band images have been considered, which are involved in these vegetation indexes, and were taken by satellites Ikonos-2 and Landsat-7 of the same geographic location, to study the effect of both spatial (pixel size) and radiometric (number of bits coding the image) resolution on these wavelength bands as well as two vegetation indexes: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI).In order to do so, a multi-fractal analysis of these multi-spectral images was applied in each of these bands and the two indexes derived. The results showed that spatial resolution has a similar scaling effect in the four bands, but radiometric resolution has a larger influence in blue and green bands than in red and near-infrared bands. The NDVI showed a higher sensitivity to the radiometric resolution than EVI. Both were equally affected by the spatial resolution.From both factors, the spatial resolution has a major impact in the multi-fractal spectrum for all the bands and the vegetation indexes. This information should be taken in to account when vegetation indexes based on different satellite sensors are obtained.

TI  - Modeling thermal emissive bands radiometric calibration impact with application to AVHRR
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel analytical model of the calibration error impact on the Earth radiance measurement from thermal emissive bands of sensors is developed. The goal is to assess the impact of calibration errors, to evaluate those errors and to perform correction. This model is applied in the correction of bias in Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)channels 4 and 5 observed from the intercomparison with Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer measurements. A two-step regression is used to separate the effects of calibration radiance errors from calibration coefficient errors. In the first step, the calibration radiance error, primarily due to internal calibration target (ICT) imperfections and temperature measurement error, is evaluated using the bias from selected Earth scenes with brightness temperatures close to the ICT temperature. The effects from the ICT imperfections and temperature measurement errors are analyzed collectively. The resulting estimation of the calibration radiance error is 0.30% for channel 4 and 0.33% for channel 5. After correcting the Earth scene radiance for these effects, the errors in the offset and nonlinear coefficient of instrument response are evaluated through the second step of the regression. A weighting function is used to account for the nonuniformity in the data distribution over the Earth radiance range. After the evaluation of the errors, removal of their effects can be achieved either through corrections of the calibration coefficients or correction of the measured radiance. The results are useful for the improvement of the AVHRR IR channel calibration algorithm. This model and two-step regression approach can also be applied to other similar broadband thermal infrared radiometric sensors.

TI  - An efficient hybrid method for estimating clear-sky surface downward longwave radiation from MODIS data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an efficient hybrid method for estimating 1 km instantaneous clear-sky surface downward longwave radiation (LWDN) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal infrared observations and the MODIS near-infrared column water vapor (CWV) data product. The LWDN was formulated as a nonlinear function of surface upwelling longwave radiation estimated from the MODIS top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance of channels 29, 31, and 32, as well as CWV and the MODIS TOA radiance of channel 29. Ground measurements collected at 62 globally distributed sites from six networks were used to develop and validate the proposed hybrid method. The validation results showed that the bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 0.0597 W/m(2) and 21.008 W/m(2). These results demonstrate that the performance of our method is superior to that of other studies reported in the literature. The drawback of our method is that LWDN is overestimated over high-elevation areas with extremely low CWV (<0.5 g/cm(2)) and underestimated over regions with tropical climates that have extremely high CWV. A power function relating LWDN to CWV was derived and used as a complementary method to address these circumstances. The overestimation was overcome, and the bias and RMSE decreased from 9.407 W/m(2) and 23.919 W/m(2) to similar to 0.924 W/m(2) and 19.895 W/m(2). The underestimation was also alleviated.

TI  - Assessing the accuracy of MISR and MISR-simulated cloud top heights using CloudSat- and CALIPSO-retrieved hydrometeor profiles
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite retrievals of cloud properties are often used in the evaluation of global climate models, and in recent years satellite instrument simulators have been used to account for known retrieval biases in order to make more consistent comparisons between models and retrievals. Many of these simulators have seen little critical evaluation. Here we evaluate the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) simulator by using visible extinction profiles retrieved from a combination of CloudSat, CALIPSO, MODIS, and AMSR-E observations as inputs to the MISR simulator and comparing cloud top height statistics from the MISR simulator with those retrieved by MISR. Overall, we find that the occurrence of middle-and high-altitude topped clouds agrees well between MISR retrievals and the MISR-simulated output, with distributions of middle-and high-topped cloud cover typically agreeing to better than 5% in both zonal and regional averages. However, there are significant differences in the occurrence of low-topped clouds between MISR retrievals and MISR-simulated output that are due to differences in the detection of low-level clouds between MISR and the combined retrievals used to drive the MISR simulator, rather than due to errors in the MISR simulator cloud top height adjustment. This difference highlights the importance of sensor resolution and boundary layer cloud spatial structure in determining low-altitude cloud cover. The MISR-simulated and MISR-retrieved cloud optical depth also show systematic differences, which are also likely due in part to cloud spatial structure.

TI  - Improved meteorology and ozone air quality simulations using MODIS land surface parameters in the Yangtze River Delta urban cluster, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface parameters play an important role in the land-atmosphere coupling and thus are critical to the weather and dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere. This work aims at improving the meteorology and air quality simulations for a high-ozone (O-3) event in the Yangtze River Delta urban cluster of China, through incorporation of satellite-derived land surface parameters. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) input to specify the land cover type, green vegetation fraction, leaf area index, albedo, emissivity, and deep soil temperature provides a more realistic representation of surface characteristics. Preliminary evaluations reveal clearly improved meteorological simulation with MODIS input compared with that using default parameters, particularly for temperature (from -2.5 to -1.7 degrees C for mean bias) and humidity (from 9.7% to 4.3% for mean bias). The improved meteorology propagates through the air quality system, which results in better estimates for surface NO2 (from 11.5 to 8.0 ppb for mean bias) and nocturnal O-3 low-end concentration values (from -18.8 to -13.6 ppb for mean bias). Modifications of the urban land surface parameters are the main reason for model improvement. The deeper urban boundary layer and intense updraft induced by the urban heat island are favorable for pollutant dilution, thus contributing to lower NO2 and elevated nocturnal O-3. Furthermore, the intensified sea-land breeze circulation may exacerbate O-3 pollution at coastal cities through pollutant recirculation. Improvement of mesoscale meteorology and air quality simulations with satellite-derived land surface parameters will be useful for air pollution monitoring and forecasting in urban areas.

TI  - A combination mode of climate variability responsible for extremely poor recruitment of the Japanese eel (<i>Anguilla japonica)</i>
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data and assimilation products are used to investigate fluctuations in the catch of Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) in eastern Asian countries. It has been reported that the salinity front has extended farther south, which has shifted the eel's spawning grounds to a lower latitude, resulting in smaller eel catches in 1983, 1992, and 1998. This study demonstrates that interannual variability in the eel catch is strongly correlated with the combination mode (C-mode), but not with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. These eels continue to spawn within the North Equatorial Current (NEC),but the salinity front shifts south during a canonical El Nino. On the other hand, the spawning grounds accompanied by the salinity front extend farther south during the C-mode of climate variability, and eel larvae fail to join the nursery in the NEC, resulting in extremely poor recruitment in East Asia. We propose an appropriate sea surface temperature index to project Japanese eel larval catch.

TI  - Variability of diurnal tide in the MLT region over Tirunelveli (8.7°N), India: Consistency between ground- and space-based observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric tides propagating upward into the mesosphere-lower thermosphere region carry the variability from the lower atmosphere and influence the energy and momentum budgets of this region and above. A comprehensive understanding of these variabilities thus becomes important. In this work, we study the seasonal and interannual variabilities of the diurnal tides, in particular, the migrating DW1 (westward, wave number 1) tide and the nonmigrating DE3 (eastward, wave number 3) tide from two different platforms. Long-term observations from the MF radar at Tirunelveli (8.7 degrees N, 77.8 degrees E) constitute one data set. Temperature and wind data from Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry and TIMED Doppler Interferometer observations from the TIMED satellite mission constitute the other. Continuous radar observations yield long data records with high temporal resolution. Space-based observations, on the other hand, are relatively short but provide spatiotemporal information, the latter being useful in separating migrating and nonmigrating components. In this work, the consistency between the tidal signatures obtained from the ground-and space-based platforms is examined and subtle differences between the two data sets are brought out. One particular feature pertains to a possible solar cycle influence on the diurnal tide, a feature which is more prominently seen in radar observations, though restricted to a certain epoch of the solar cycle. A solar cycle dependence of the zonal mean densities observed in satellite data sets at similar altitudes appears to be a plausible source for the observed solar cycle signature in the diurnal tide, although the role of other agencies in modulating the diurnal tide activity in the solar cycle time periods cannot be ruled out.

TI  - Spatial and temporal analysis of forest cover change in Falgore Game Reserve in Kano, Nigeria
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Multi-temporal land-use and land-cover data provides a historical vehicle for determining and evaluating long-term trends in bio-physical landscapes. Land-use and land-cover assessment and mapping is one of the most useful applications of geographic information system (GIS) for planning, management, and development. This study analyses the spatio-temporal pattern of forest cover dynamics for three decades in Falgore Game Reserve in Kano, Nigeria. The dynamics of forest cover transition during 1985-2015 was analysed using multi-temporal Landsat imagery.Results: The spatio-temporal analysis shows that moderate woodland dominated in 1985 (46%) and 2005 (57%) but was replaced by open woodland in 2015 which accounts for 58% of the total area of Falgore Game Reserve (FGR) currently. Dense woodland occupied the least area of the total forest estate that varied between 17% in 1985 and 1% in 2015. The results indicate that dense woodland, moderate woodland, and very open woodland were decreased at annual average rate of 3, 1, and 0.4%. Open woodland had expanded from 21,127 ha in 1985 to 53,392 ha in 2015. The main drivers of forest resource degradation in the area were found to be excessive fuelwood collection, overgrazing, agricultural expansion, and forest fire.Conclusions: These findings suggest that protection strategies employed in FGR were not effective as deforestation is still evident in the reserve. Government and environmental based NGOs should therefore prioritize effective and efficient conservation strategy for present and future use of forest resources, in addition to the provision of alternative livelihood sources to communities proximate to the reserve. This will ensure the socio-economic well-being of the locals and sustainable conservation of biological diversity in the area.

TI  - Evaluation of the multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) aerosol algorithm through intercomparison with VIIRS aerosol products and AERONET
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) algorithm is under evaluation for use in conjunction with the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events mission. Column aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data from MAIAC are compared against corresponding data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument over North America during 2013. Product coverage and retrieval strategy, along with regional variations in AOT through comparison of both matched and unmatched seasonally gridded data, are reviewed. MAIAC shows extended coverage over parts of the continent when compared to VIIRS, owing to its pixel selection process and ability to retrieve aerosol information over brighter surfaces. To estimate data accuracy, both products are compared with Aerosol Robotic Network level 2 measurements to determine the amount of error present and discover if there is any dependency on viewing geometry and/or surface characteristics. Results suggest that MAIAC performs well over this region with a relatively small bias of -0.01; however, there is a tendency for greater negative biases over bright surfaces and at larger scattering angles. Additional analysis over an expanded area and longer time period are likely needed to determine a comprehensive assessment of the products' capability over the Western Hemisphere.

TI  - An improved constant evaporative fraction method for estimating daily evapotranspiration from remotely sensed instantaneous observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a primary mechanism for water and heat transfer between land and the atmosphere. One approach to estimate ET is from instantaneous remotely sensed data. The constant evaporative fraction (EF) method is then usually used to estimate integrated daily fluxes, which are typically underestimated values. Here we present a theoretical improvement to the conventional EF. The improved EF is shown to be robust and superior to the conventional approach, and it significantly reduces the underestimation bias.

TI  - On-orbit evaporative fraction estimations using a histogram-based triangle method from Terra MODIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A triangle method has been frequently used for a regional evapotranspiration (ET) or evaporative fraction (EF) estimation using the relationship between a vegetation index and surface temperature. A simple histogram based on an on-orbit EF estimation algorithm is developed to determine hot and cold edges in the triangle distribution using only remotely sensed data. A new histogram based on an EF estimation algorithm is developed and compared with different options of existing hot and cold edge algorithms. The selected algorithms are applied to 5-year Terra MODIS data products, and the on-orbit EF estimations are validated using ground truth data from southern Great Plains. Using numerous iterations among the tested EF algorithms with the triangle method, the "histogram"-based hot edge and newly proposed cold edge algorithm combinations provide an excellent performance between the ground truth and on-orbit EF estimations. It is shown that the histogram-based EF algorithm has enhanced correlation and mean bias values of 0.74 and 0.087, respectively, providing excellent accuracy for the regional on-orbit EF estimations.

TI  - Methods for mapping and monitoring global glaciovolcanism
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The most deadly (Nevado del Ruiz, 1985) and the most costly (Eyjafjallajokull, 2010) eruptions of the last 100 years were both glaciovolcanic. Considering its great importance to studies of volcanic hazards, global climate, and even astrobiology, the global distribution of gladovolcanism is insufficiently understood. We present and assess three algorithms for mapping, monitoring, and predicting likely centers of glaciovolcanic activity worldwide. Each algorithm intersects buffer zones representing known Holocene-active volcanic centers with existing datasets of snow, ice, and permafrost. Two detection algorithms, RGGA and PZGA, are simple spatial join operations computed from the Randolph Glacier Inventory and the Permafrost Zonation Index, respectively. The third, MDGA, is an algorithm run on all 15 available years of the MOD10A2 weekly snow cover product from the Terra MODIS satellite radiometer. Shortcomings and advantages of the three methods are discussed, including previously unreported blunders in the MOD10A2 dataset. Comparison of the results leads to an effective approach for integrating the three methods. We show that 20.4% of known Holocene volcanic centers host glaciers or areas of permanent snow. A further 10.9% potentially interact with permafrost.MDGA and PZGA do not rely on any human input, rendering them useful for investigations of change over time. An intermediate step in MDGA involves estimating the snow-covered area at every Holocene volcanic center. These estimations can be updated weekly with no human intervention. To investigate the feasibility of an automatic ice-loss alert system, we consider three examples of glaciovolcanism in the MDGA weekly dataset. We also discuss the potential use of PZGA to model past and future glaciovolcanism based on global circulation model outputs. Combined, the three algorithms provide an automated system for understanding the geographic and temporal patterns of global glaciovolcanism which should be of use for hazard assessment, the search for extreme microbiomes, climate models, and implementation of ice-cover-based volcano monitoring systems.

TI  - Onset of drying and dormancy in relation to water dynamics of semi-arid grasslands from MODIS NDWI
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Our knowledge of autumn phenology and its response to climate variability is currently limited. One way to improve our understanding of autumn phenology at the landscape scale is to investigate autumn vegetation dynamics based on multiple vegetation indices from remote sensing data. In this study, we derived two autumn phenological metrics (phenometrics), onset of drying and dormancy, for semi-arid grasslands from MODIS normalized difference water index (NDWI) time series. The onset of drying represents the start of decline in the vegetation's metabolism during autumn, and the onset of NDWI-based dormancy signifies the end of metabolic activity. These NDWI-based phenometrics were then compared with enhanced vegetation index (EVI)-based phenometrics in northeastern China from 2001 to 2013. Influences of climatic variability on autumn phenology were analyzed using partial correlation analysis. We found that, in general, the onset of drying was slightly later than the onset of EVI-based senescence. Both did not strongly correlate with precipitation and mean minimum temperature in August. The onset of NDWI-based dormancy had, on average, a time lag of seven days, relative to the onset of EVI-based dormancy during 2001-2013. Moreover, it showed a much stronger response to mean minimum temperature in September than EVI-based dormancy. A colder autumn generally advanced the onset of NDWI-based dormancy, while it had little effect on the onset of EVI-based dormancy in the study area. These results suggest that phenological studies using NDWI could expand our understanding of land surface phenology. Furthermore, considering the different responses of the onset of NDWI- and EVI-based dormancy to climate variability, a combination of these phenometrics could contribute to the study of the ecosystem processes (e.g., carbon cycle) in semi-arid grasslands.

M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic gram-negative bacteria is one of the most pressing challenges in the field of infectious diseases and is one of 4 key areas of unmet medical need identified by the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG). The mission of the Gram-Negative Committee is to advance our knowledge of these challenging infections and implement studies to improve patient outcomes. Studies have fallen primarily into 2 broad categories: prospective cohort studies and interventional trials. Among the observational studies, CRACKLE (Consortium on Resistance Against Carbapenems in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Other Enterobacteriaceae) has contributed seminal multicenter data describing risk factors and clinical outcomes of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in sentinel US hospitals. Building on this success, CRACKLE II will expand the network to hospitals across the United States and Colombia. Similar protocols have been proposed to include Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (SNAP and POP studies). In addition, the CREST study (Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Solid Organ Transplant Patients) has provided pivotal data on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and CRE carriage among solid organ transplant recipients to inform management of this vulnerable patient population. Two clinical trials to define novel ways of using an existing antibiotic, fosfomycin, to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (one that has completed enrollment and the other in late protocol development) will determine the clinical efficacy of fosfomycin as step-down oral therapy to treat complicated urinary tract infections. Additional clinical studies and trials using immunotherapeutic or newly approved agents are also in the planning stage, with the main goals of generating actionable data that will inform clinical decision making and facilitate development of new treatment options for highly resistant gram-negative bacterial infections.

TI  - Soil salinity mapping and hydrological drought indices assessment in arid environments based on remote sensing techniques
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices are mostly described as crop water derivatives. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is one of the oldest remote sensing applications that is widely used to evaluate crop vigor directly and crop water relationships indirectly. Recently, several NDVI derivatives were exclusively used to assess crop water relationships. Four hydrological drought indices are examined in the current research study. The water supply vegetation index (WSVI), the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), the moisture stress index (MSI) and the normalized difference infrared index (NDII) are implemented in the current study as an indirect tool to map the effect of different soil salinity levels on crop water stress in arid environments. In arid environments, such as Saudi Arabia, water resources are under pressure, especially groundwater levels. Groundwater wells are rapidly depleted due to the heavy abstraction of the reserved water. Heavy abstractions of groundwater, which exceed crop water requirements in most of the cases, are powered by high evaporation rates in the designated study area because of the long days of extremely hot summer. Landsat 8 OLI data were extensively used in the current research to obtain several vegetation indices in response to soil salinity in Wadi ad-Dawasir. Principal component analyses (PCA) and artificial neural network (ANN) analyses are complementary tools used to understand the regression pattern of the hydrological drought indices in the designated study area.

TI  - Visualizing and interpreting surface displacement patterns on unstable slopes using multi-geometry satellite SAR interferometry (2D InSAR)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) is capable of measuring surface displacement with a typical accuracy on the order of millimeters to centimeters. However, when the true deformation vector differs from the satellite line-of-sight (LOS), the sensitivity decreases and interpretation of InSAR deformation measurements becomes challenging. By combining displacement data from extensive ascending and descending TerraSAR-X datasets collected during the summer seasons of 2009-2014, we estimate two-dimensional (2D) InSAR surface displacement. Displacement data are decomposed into vertical and west/east deformation, dip and combined deformation vector, and validated using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. We use the decomposed dataset to visualize variations in surface velocity and direction on unstable slopes in a periglacial environment with sporadic permafrost in northern Norway. By identifying areas with uplift and subsidence, and detecting velocity changes (down slope acceleration/deceleration) and related areas of extension and compression, we are able to explain driving and controlling mechanisms and geomorphology in two rockslides and one area with solifluction landforms.

TI  - Derivation and validation of the stray light correction algorithm for the thermal infrared sensor onboard Landsat 8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been known and documented that the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) on-board Landsat 8 suffers from a significant stray light problem (Reuter et al., 2015; Montanaro et al., 2014a). The issue appears both as a non-uniform banding artifact across Earth scenes and as a varying absolute radiometric calibration error. A correction algorithm proposed by Montanaro et al. (2015) demonstrated great potential towards removing most of the stray light effects from TIRS image data. It has since been refined and will be implemented operationally into the Landsat Product Generation System in early 2017. The algorithm is trained using near-coincident thermal data (i.e., Terra/MODIS) to develop per-detector functional relationships between incident out-of-field radiance and additional (stray light) signal on the TIRS detectors. Once trained, the functional relationships are used to estimate and remove the stray light signal on a per-detector basis from a scene of interest.The details of the operational stray light correction algorithm"are presented here along with validation studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in removing the stray light artifacts over a stressing range of Landsat/FIRS scene conditions. Results show that the magnitude of the banding artifact is reduced by half on average over the current (uncorrected) product and that the absolute radiometric error is reduced to approximately 0.5% in both spectral bands on average (well below the 2% requirement). All studies presented here indicate that the implementation of the stray light algorithm will lead to greatly improved performance of the TIRS instrument, for both spectral bands.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental quality differences between two groups of reefs in the Veracruz Reef System were evaluated. The North group of reefs is very close to Veracruz, an urban and port zone, whereas the South group is more isolated, with minor anthropogenic disturbances. To prove the hypothesis that the North group is more affected by anthropogenic activities, the concentrations of hydrocarbons in liver, metals and metalloids such as Se. As. Ba. Cd. Hg and V in muscle, and PAH metabolites in bile were evaluated, and related to biomarkers (transcript abundance of cytochrome P4501A, Vitellogenin, and Glutathione-S-transferase) in two species of fish: Haemulon aurolineatum and Ocyurus chysurus. H. aurolineatum presents the highest concentrations for many pollutants, but O. chysurus shows the most significant differences in pollutant concentrations and biomarkers between the two reef groups, suggesting that this species could be used as a sentinel in future studies in the Gulf of Mexico.

TI  - Using Landsat to extend the historical record of lacustrine phytoplankton blooms: A Lake Erie case study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term records of phytoplankton blooms in freshwater lakes are necessary both for understanding basin scale changes to watersheds and for providing a key constraint for assessing processes driving blooms. However, due to the inherent constraints of in situ sampling and the short time period covered by modem space borne sensors, few long-term records exist. Historical data from sensors such as Landsat offer strong potential for creating new records of past blooms. Here, we use a novel evaluation procedure based on multiple metrics to assess algorithm suitability and robustness for generating long-term bloom records using Landsat 5 imagery. Evaluation metrics are based on bloom presence, spatial distribution, magnitude and timing, using both in situ Microcystis biovolume and remotely-sensed Cyanobacterial Index (CI) data from MERIS for 2002-2011. Applying this procedure for a test case focusing on Lake Erie's western basin, an algorithm based on a near infrared threshold with simple atmospheric correction through subtraction of the shortwave infrared band, combined with an additional "greenness" filter based on a hue threshold, performs best. Implementing this algorithm for 1984-2001 reveals the long-term trends in peak bloom magnitude prior to the start of the MERIS and MODIS record (2002-2015), and more than doubles the period of record that can be used to understand bloom occurrence and growth for this system. More broadly, we demonstrate that Landsat observations can be used to identify macro-scale features of blooms. For Lake Erie, the performance of the final Landsat algorithm is comparable to that of the MERIS CI algorithm, despite Landsat's broad spectral bands and long revisit time. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - A 38-year (1978-2015) Northern Hemisphere daily snow cover extent product derived using consistent objective criteria from satellite-borne optical sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A long-term Northern Hemisphere (NH) daily 5-km snow cover extent (SCE) product (JASMES) was developed by the application of a consistent objective snow cover mapping algorithm to data from historical optical sensors on polar orbiting satellites from 1978 to 2015. A conventional decision tree algorithm with multiple threshold tests was employed to analyze radiances for the five spectral bands available across the full analysis period. The accuracies of the analyzed SCE maps were evaluated against in-situ snow data measured at ground stations along with the SCE maps from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Data Record (NOAA-CDR) product. The evaluation showed the JASMES product to have a more temporally stable producer's accuracy (PA; 1-omission error) than NOAA, which is a key factor in the analysis of long-term SCE trends. Comparison of seasonal NH SCE trends from the two products showed NOAA to have opposite trends to those of JASMES in the fall and winter seasons, and to have overestimated SCE decreasing trends in the spring and summer. These tendencies are consistent with the increasing spatial and temporal resolutions of information over time, which were used in generating the NOAA snow analysis. An estimation of unbiased SCEs based on the accuracies of SCE maps also endorses the long-term trends of the JASMES product The JASMES NH seasonal SCE exhibited negative slopes in all seasons but was only statistically significant in the summer (JJA) and fall (SON). Delayed snow cover onset was observed to be the main driver of decreasing annual snow duration (SCD) trends. The spatial pattern of annual SCD trends exhibited noticeable asymmetry between continents, with the largest significant decreases observed over western Eurasia with relatively few statistically significant decreases over North America.

TI  - Stress variability in the Parnaiba Basin, Brazil, during Cretaceous rifting
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cretaceous section of the Parnaiba Basin, designated as Grajau Basin, represents an intracontinental half-graben formed during the Early Cretaceous due to the separation between the South American and African continents during the final dispersal of Western Gondwana. Here, through a synergetic approach between fluid inclusion planes (FlPs), outcropping geologic structures, borehole breakouts and remote sensing data, we elucidate in different scales the main structural features and their kinematic indicators. Normal faults strike mainly NNE-SSW and WNW-ESE, while deformation bands and extension joints trend to NW-SE and NE-SW, and FlPs to NE-SW and WNW-ESE. In addition, normal fault-generated scarps border geomorphological units and constitute dense zones of deformation bands and fluidization. Microthermometric FIP analyses suggest this fracturing event occurred at shallow basin levels, at temperatures below 50 degrees C. Furthermore, joints, bands and FlPs present mutually cross-cutting relationships, thus indicating contemporaneity. The numerical inversions applied to striated faults, non-striated faults, joints, deformation bands and FlPs suggest the occurrence of an extensional event characterized by variable direction of extension (sigma(3)) trending from NW-SE to WNW-ESE or NE-SE to NNE-SSW. This event probably started in the Albian during the final Gondwana fragmentation stages. The quasi-perpendicular sigma(3) trend could be caused by one or all of the following phenomena: a) stress ratio R values obtained (<0.4) indicate the possibility of radial extension (sigma(2) approximate to sigma(3)), perhaps in response to the deformation partitioning due to kinematic simple-shearing constraints along the Equatorial Atlantic transform margin; b) along the WNW-oriented release normal faults, the local extension (NNE-SSW) switch positions in relation to the regional extension (WNW-ESE) by rotating 90 degrees; c) influence of the pre-existing structures on the regional stress field. Thus, the spatial and temporal relationships between Cretaceous fault activity, stress field and the development of the geomorphological features in the Grajau Basin contribute to understanding of the Brazilian Equatorial margin geodynamics.

TI  - A statistical framework for estimating air temperature using MODIS land surface temperature data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has shown an immense capability for large-scale estimation of air temperature (T-air), one of the most important environmental state variables, using land surface temperature (LST) data. Following recent investigations on the T-air-LST relationship, in this article, we propose an advanced statistical approach to this realm. We tested the approach for estimation of T-air in eastern part of Iran using MODIS daytime and nighttime LST products and 11 auxiliary variables including Julian day, solar zenith angle, extraterrestrial solar radiation, latitude, altitude, reflectance at various visible and infrared bands and vegetation indices. Fourteen statistical models constructed through a stepwise regression analysis were evaluated along a 5-year period (2000-2004) using MODIS and meteorological station data. Results of this study indicated that the statistical approach performed reasonably well, where our final proposed model could estimate average T-air with validation mean absolute error of 2.3 and 1.8 degrees C at daily and weekly scales, respectively. Nighttime LST, Julian day, altitude and solar zenith angle indicated to be the most effective variables capturing most variations of T-air in the study region. Variables influenced by land surface and land cover properties including reflectance at different bands and vegetation indices showed a negligible effect on the T-air-LST relationship within the study area. It was indicated that the proposed models generally performed better for lower altitude regions.

TI  - A total precipitable water retrieval method over land using the combination of passive microwave and optical remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric water vapor plays an important role in hydrologic cycle and climate change of the Earth. A number of studies have focused on retrieval of the total precipitable water (TPW) using microwave or optical remote sensing. In this paper, the global quarter-degree gridded TPW over land was retrieved using water vapor sensitivity parameter Delta Tb-18.7/Delta Tb-23.8 based on the combination of AMSR-E and MODIS observations. There are two major improvements in the retrieval algorithm, including optimization of the estimation model of surface emissivity Delta epsilon(18.7)/Delta epsilon(23.8) and correction of the terrain influence to the retrieval of TPW using DEM. To obtain a high resolution TPW, we also developed an algorithm to downscale the retrieved quarter-degree gridded TPW to a fine scale of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees using DEM and NDVI. In addition, the downscaled TPW was further calibrated using high precision TPW from MODIS in the clear-sky condition to improve its accuracy. Finally, both quarter-degree and 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees gridded TPW were validated against SuomiNet GPS retrieved TPW on a global scale. The RMSE for the retrieved quarter-degree gridded global TPW is 3.45 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. In addition, the RMSE for the downscaled 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees gridded global TPW is 4.18 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. An obvious advantage of our algorithm compared with MODIS TPW product is that it can retrieve TPW under cloudy sky condition over land. The algorithm developed in this study can be easily transferred to AMSR2 on board GCOM-W1 and provides the long-term global daily TPW over land since the launch of Aqua to present day to support hydrologic cycle and climate change studies.

TI  - High spatio-temporal resolution mapping of soil moisture by integrating wireless sensor network observations and MODIS apparent thermal inertia in the Babao River Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture distributions with high spatio-temporal resolution are scarce but beneficial for understanding ecohydrological processes and closing the water cycle at the basin scale. Sensor networks are innovative in their ability to capture the spatio-temporal heterogeneity and dynamics of soil moisture; however, they cannot be used to directly derive spatially continuous soil moisture distributions. A Bayesian-based upscaling algorithm that utilizes MODIS-derived apparent thermal inertia is used to map daily soil moisture spatial patterns with a resolution of 1 km in the Babao River Basin, China. The 2-4 cm soil moisture observations from seven automatic meteorological stations located in different elevation zones from 3000 m to 3500 m are employed to validate the mapping algorithm. The correlation coefficient and unbiased root-mean-square error (RMSE) averaged 0.880 and 0.031 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively, which indicate satisfactory estimation accuracy. The 1 km resolution soil moisture products are re-sampled to a resolution of 25 km and then compared to the level 3 Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Mission (SMOS) soil moisture product. The results show that both products exhibit strong temporal consistency; however, due to complex topography, the SMOS soil moisture is generally lower than that of the upscaling results. Semivariograms and an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis are used to analyze the space-time heterogeneities of soil moisture at the 1 km scale. In the summer, rainfall results in soil moisture with low spatial variability and a complex spatial structure. After the rainy season, the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture is affected by other factors, such as soil texture, evapotranspiration and topography. From the perspective of temporal variation, the upscaled soil moisture shows a well-defined seasonal cycle, which represents the effects of decreased rainfall from August to October. Because more rain falls in the summer due to the mountain microclimate, the oscillation in soil moisture is more pronounced over 20% of the area compared to that in other regions. Based on a validation analysis of the mapping results, the upscaling method is proven feasible, and the upscaled soil moisture can be used to analyze eco-hydrological processes and validate remote sensing products.

TI  - Mapping per-pixel predicted accuracy of classified remote sensing images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional approach of map accuracy assessment based on an error matrix does not capture the spatial variation in classification accuracy. Here, per-pixel accuracy prediction methods are proposed based on interpolating accuracy values from a test sample in which the reference class of each sampled pixel has been determined. Different accuracy prediction methods were developed based on four factors: predictive domain (spatial versus spectral), interpolation function (constant, linear, Gaussian, and logistic), incorporation of class information (interpolating each class separately versus grouping them together), and sample size. Developing accuracy maps using the spectral domain is a new approach in contrast to previous efforts based on the spatial domain. Performance of the prediction methods was evaluated using 26 test blocks, with 10 km x 10 km dimensions, dispersed throughout the United States. Each block had complete coverage reference data manually extracted by interpreters and a land-cover map produced from Landsat imagery using a decision tree classification. The full scene maps were then compared to the corresponding reference maps to produce complete coverage accuracy information for each block. The predicted accuracy maps were produced from a sample of the reference data (i.e., the test dataset). The performance of the sample-based accuracy predictions was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic. Relative to existing accuracy prediction methods, our proposed methods resulted in improvements of AUC of 0.15 or greater. Evaluation of the four factors comprising the accuracy prediction methods demonstrated that: i) interpolations should be done separately for each class instead of grouping all classes together; ii) if an all-classes approach is used, the spectral domain will result in substantially greater AUC than the spatial domain; iii) for the smaller sample size and per-class predictions, the spectral and spatial domain yielded similar AUC; iv) for the larger sample size (i.e., very dense spatial sample) and per-class predictions, the spatial domain yielded larger AUC; v) increasing the sample size improved accuracy predictions with a greater benefit accruing to the spatial domain; and vi) the function used for interpolation had the smallest effect on AUC. To conclude, the ability to produce per-pixel accuracy predictions yielding simple to understand accuracy maps opens up new possibilities for error propagation of remotely sensed products in a variety of disciplines.

TI  - Analysis of Urban Population Dynamics Based on Residential Buildings Volume in Six Provinces of Pakistan Using Operational Linescan System Sensors
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Historically, an accurate knowledge of the size, behavior, and spatial distribution of the human population has been useful for understanding many social and political processes and phenomenon. The quality and availability of census data for a growing proportion of the world's population is continuing to deteriorate. Night lights have shown encouraging agreement between temporally stable lighted areas and the various definitions of urban extent. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Optical Line Scanner (DMSP-OLS) sensor of USA acquires images at night. Night-time satellite imagery is evaluated as a means of estimating the population of all the cities of the world based on their areal extent in the image. Models derived from night-time satellite imagery have the potential to dramatically improve our knowledge of the spatial distribution and intensity of human presence on the surface of the plane. The area of Pakistan is 881 913 km(2) having population of about 200 million (2015), which is equivalent to 2.57% of the world population. By using the known population of urban areas in every year (1992-2013), a total national population is also estimated using the regression analysis having r (2) = 0.87. Finally, we conclude that DMSP-OLS can be used to monitor the population and their activities.

TI  - Driving forces of recent vegetation changes in the Sahel: Lessons learned from regional and local level analyses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A wide range of environmental and societal issues such as food security policy implementation requires accurate information on biomass productivity and its underlying drivers at both regional and local scales. While many studies in West Africa are conducted with coarse resolution earth observation data, few have tried to relate vegetation trends to explanatory factors, as is generally done in land use and land cover change (LULCC) studies at finer scales. In this study we proposed to make a bridge between vegetation trend analysis and LULCC studies to improve the understanding of the various factors that influence the biomass production changes observed in satellite time series (using integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI] as a proxy). The study was conducted in two steps. In the first step we analyzed MODIS NDVI linear trends together with TRMM growing season rainfall over the Sahel region from 2000 to 2015. A classification scheme was proposed that enables better specification of the relative role of the main drivers of biomass production dynamics. We found that 16% of the Sahel is re-greening-but found strong evidence that rainfall is not the only important driver of biomass increase. Moreover, a decrease found in 5% of the Sahel can be chiefly attributed to factors other than rainfall (88%). In the second step, we focused on the "Degre Carre de Niamey" site in Niger. Here, the observed biomass trends were analyzed in relation to land cover changes and a set of potential drivers of LULCC using the Random Forest algorithm. We observed negative trends (29% of the Niger site area) mainly in tiger bush areas located on lateritic plateaus, which are particularly prone to pressures from overgrazing and overlogging. The significant role of accessibility factors in biomass production trends was also highlighted. Our methodological framework may be used to highlight changing areas and their major drivers to identify target areas for more detailed studies. Finer-scale assessments of the long-term vulnerability of populations can then be made to substantiate food security management policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - High-order ionospheric effects on electron density estimation from Fengyun-3C GPS radio occultation
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - GPS radio occultation can estimate ionospheric electron density and total electron content (TEC) with high spatial resolution, e.g., China's recent Fengyun-3C GPS radio occultation. However, high-order ionospheric delays are normally ignored. In this paper, the high-order ionospheric effects on electron density estimation from the Fengyun-3C GPS radio occultation data are estimated and investigated using the NeQuick2 ionosphere model and the IGRF12 (International Geomagnetic Reference Field, 12th generation) geomagnetic model. Results show that the high-order ionospheric delays have large effects on electron density estimation with up to 800 el cm(-3), which should be corrected in high-precision ionospheric density estimation and applications. The second-order ionospheric effects are more significant, particularly at 250-300 km, while third-order ionospheric effects are much smaller. Furthermore, the high-order ionospheric effects are related to the location, the local time, the radio occultation azimuth and the solar activity. The large high-order ionospheric effects are found in the low-latitude area and in the daytime as well as during strong solar activities. The second-order ionospheric effects have a maximum positive value when the radio occultation azimuth is around 0-20 degrees, and a maximum negative value when the radio occultation azimuth is around -180 to -160 degrees. Moreover, the geomagnetic storm also affects the high-order ionospheric delay, which should be carefully corrected.

TI  - Multi-feature combined cloud and cloud shadow detection in GaoFen-1 wide field of view imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The wide field of view (WFV) imaging system onboard the Chinese GaoFen-1 (GF-1) optical satellite has a 16-m resolution and four-day revisit cycle for large-scale Earth observation. The advantages of the high temporal-spatial resolution and the wide field of view make the GF-1 WFV imagery very popular. However, cloud cover is an inevitable problem in GF-1 WFV imagery, which influences its precise application. Accurate cloud and cloud shadow detection in GF-1 WFV imagery is quite difficult due to the fact that there are only three visible bands and one near-infrared band. In this paper, an automatic multi-feature combined (MFC) method is proposed for cloud and cloud shadow detection in GF-1 WFV imagery. The MFC algorithm first implements threshold segmentation based on the spectral features and mask refinement based on guided filtering to generate a preliminary cloud mask. The geometric features are then used in combination with the texture features to improve the cloud detection results and produce the final cloud mask. Finally, the cloud shadow mask can be acquired by means of the cloud and shadow matching and follow-up correction process. The method was validated using 108 globally distributed scenes. The results indicate that MFC performs well under most conditions, and the average overall accuracy of MFC cloud detection is as high as 96.8%. In the contrastive analysis with the official provided cloud fractions, MFC shows a significant improvement in cloud fraction estimation, and achieves a high accuracy for the cloud and cloud shadow detection in the GF-1 WFV imagery with fewer spectral bands. The proposed method could be used as a preprocessing step in the future to monitor land-cover change, and it could also be easily extended to other optical satellite imagery which has a similar spectral setting.

TI  - Multi-temporal LiDAR and Landsat quantification of fire-induced changes to forest structure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring post-fire effects at landscape scales is critical to an ecological understanding of wildfire effects. Predominantly this is accomplished with either multi-spectral remote sensing data or through ground-based field sampling plots. While these methods are important, field data is usually limited to opportunistic post-fire observations, and spectral data often lacks validation with specific variables of change. Additional uncertainty remains regarding how best to account for environmental variables influencing fire effects (e.g., weather) for which observational data cannot easily be acquired, and whether pre-fire agents of change such as bark beetle and timber harvest impact model accuracy. This study quantifies wildfire effects by correlating changes in forest structure derived from multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) acquisitions to multi-temporal spectral changes captured by the Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager for the 2012 Pole Creek Fire in central Oregon. Spatial regression modeling was assessed as a methodology to account for spatial autocorrelation, and model consistency was quantified across areas impacted by pre-fire mountain pine beetle and timber harvest. The strongest relationship (pseudo-r(2) = 0.86, p < 0.0001) was observed between the ratio of shortwave infrared and near infrared reflectance (d74) and LiDAR-derived estimate of canopy cover change. Relationships between percentage of LiDAR returns in forest strata and spectral indices generally increased in strength with strata height. Structural measurements made closer to the ground were not well correlated. The spatial regression approach improved all relationships, demonstrating its utility, but model performance declined across pre-fire agents of change, suggesting that such studies should stratify by pre-fire forest condition. This study establishes that spectral indices such as d74 and dNBR are most sensitive to wildfire-caused structural changes such as reduction in canopy cover and perform best when that structure has not been reduced pre-fire.

Although a variety of remote sensing based approaches have been developed and applied to Landsat mission imagery to infer burn severity at 30 m spatial resolution, forest burn severity have still been seldom assessed at fine spatial scales (5 m) from very-high-resolution (VHR) data. We assessed a 432 ha forest fire that occurred in April 2012 on Long Island, New York, within the Pine Barrens region, a unique but imperiled fire-dependent ecosystem in the northeastern United States. The mapping of forest burn severity was explored here at fine spatial scales, for the first time using remotely sensed spectral indices and a set of Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) fraction images from bi-temporal pre- and post-fire event - WorldView-2 (WV-2) imagery at 2 m spatial resolution. We first evaluated our approach using 1 m by 1 m validation points at the sub-crown scale per severity class (i.e. unburned, low, moderate, and high severity) from the post-fire 0.10 m color aerial ortho-photos; then, we validated the burn severity mapping of geo-referenced dominant tree crowns (crown scale) and 15 m by 15 m fixed-area plots (inter-crown scale) with the post-fire 0.10 m aerial ortho-photos and measured crown information of twenty forest inventory plots. Our approach can accurately assess forest burn severity at the sub-crown (overall accuracy is 84% with a Kappa value of 0.77), crown (overall accuracy is 82% with a Kappa value of 0.76), and inter-crown scales (89% of the variation in estimated burn severity ratings (i.e. Geo-Composite Burn Index (CBI)). This work highlights that forest burn severity mapping from VHR data can capture heterogeneous fire patterns at fine spatial scales over the large spatial extents. This is important since most ecological processes associated with fire effects vary at the <30 m scale and VHR approaches could significantly advance our ability to characterize fire effects on forest ecosystems.

TI  - An improved spectral optimization algorithm for atmospheric correction over turbid coastal waters: A case study from the Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary and the adjacent coast
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based retrieval of the concentrations of water components relies largely on the accuracy of the atmospheric correction. Although a variety of atmospheric correction algorithms have been developed for turbid waters, the water-leaving reflectance is still underestimated in extremely turbid waters, such as in the Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary and the adjacent coast. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved algorithm that is based on a spectral optimization algorithm (ESOA) with a coupled water-atmosphere model. The model combines an aerosol model that is constructed from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observation data and a simple semi-empirical radiative transfer (SERT) model (Shen et al. 2010) for water component retrieval. Four unknown parameters are involved in the coupled model: the relative humidity (RH), fine-mode fraction (FMF), aerosol optical thickness in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength tau(a)(lambda(0)) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration (C-spm). These parameters are estimated by a global optimization approach that is based on a genetic algorithm (GA) without any initial inputs. Validation results of the atmospherically corrected remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) from matchups between Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data and in situ data show that the algorithm has satisfactory accuracy. The root mean square error (RMSE) and the absolute percentage difference (APD) are 0.0089 and 35.12, respectively. By contrast, the R-rs(lambda) values retrieved from the same matchups using the GOCI data processing system (GDPS) have higher RMSE and APD of 0.0104 and 69.15, respectively. The ESOA method can be implemented conveniently within the open source code of SeaDAS (v7.1) as an alternative and operational tool for atmospheric correction of ocean color data, including GOCI, MERIS and MODIS, over highly turbid estuarine and coastal regions, such as the Yangtze estuary, the Hangzhou Bay and most of the coastal ocean in Eastern China.

TI  - Analysis of MODIS albedo changes over steady woody covers in France during the period of 2001-2013
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Using MODIS satellite data, this study examines the presence and causes of albedo trends in vegetation in France during the last decade. Special attention is paid to steady woody areas. During the last decade, 0.31% of the land surface of France has been identified as being affected by a sudden albedo shift due to land cover changes (LCC). Excluding these sudden changes in land cover, we show a significant (decreasing) albedo trends over 3.5% of France (p-value < 0.01). In most cases (84%), trends were identified in non-vegetated and non-steady vegetated covers; however, gradual albedo trends were observed in steady woody covers in over 0.1% of the surface area of France. The majority (59.9%) of these woody covers were broadleaved tree covers; the remainder was divided between needle-leaved and mixed tree covers and shrub cover. On average, in the steady woody covers affected by gradual albedo trends, the visible albedo shift was 0.0088 between 2001 and 2013, i.e., a loss of 20.1-29.8% depending on the woody cover type. This decrease in albedo was supported by a significant gradual increase (p-value < 0.05) in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This increase in greenness appears to be linked to the under-use of woody areas in France, leading to denser forests. The impact of these gradual albedo trends on the radiative forcing (RF) was estimated and compared to the impact of LCCs. During the 21st century in France, the impact on the radiative forcing of steady woody covers could reach + 0.2 W.m(-2). This value is 2.5 times larger than IPCC estimates based on past vegetation changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A snow climatology of the Andes Mountains from MODIS snow cover data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops a method for characterizing snow climatology in the Andes Mountains using the 8-day maximum binary snow cover product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor. The objectives are to: (1) identify regions with similar snow patterns and (2) identify snow persistence zones within these regions. Within a study area between 8 degrees and 39 degrees S, snow regions are defined using the (1) minimum elevation of snow cover, (2) rate of change of snow persistence with elevation, and (3) timing of the minimum elevation snow cover. In tropical latitudes (8 degrees-23 degrees S), snow cover is constrained to high elevations (>5000 m), and these areas have steep changes in snow persistence with elevation. Minimal differences in the elevation of snow on the east and west sides of the range suggest that temperature is a primary control on snow presence. Snow cover has minimal seasonal variability in the Tropics between 8 degrees and 14 degrees S, but it peaks in austral fall (March) after the wet season from 14 degrees to 23 degrees S. In mid-latitudes (south of 23 degrees S) snowline decreases in elevation with increasing latitude, and snow persistence changes with elevation are more gradual than in tropical regions. Snow cover peaks in the austral winter throughout the mid-latitudes. Differences in elevations of snow accumulation between the east and west sides of the Andes are greatest between 28 degrees and 37 degrees S, where high mountain peaks produce a strong orographic effect and precipitation shadow. Within the snow regions, four snow zones are defined based on the average fraction of the year that snow persists: (1) little or no snow, (2) intermittent, (3) seasonal, and (4) permanent snow zones. Tropical latitudes have snow cover only on the highest peaks. Areas of seasonal and permanent snow zones are greatest between latitudes 28 degrees and 37 degrees S as a result of higher precipitation than mountains further north and higher elevations than mountains further south.

TI  - Fault geometry of 2015, Mw7.2 Murghab, Tajikistan earthquake controls rupture propagation: Insights from InSAR and seismological data
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining space-based geodetic and array seismology observations can provide detailed information about earthquake ruptures in remote regions. Here we use Landsat-8 imagery and ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 radar interferometry data combined with data from the European seismology network to describe the source of the December 7, 2015, Mw7.2 Murghab (Tajikistan) earthquake. The earthquake reactivated a similar to 79 km-long section of the Sarez-Karakul Fault, a NE oriented sinistral, trans-tensional fault in northern Pamir. Pixel offset data delineate the geometry of the surface break and line of sight ground shifts from two descending and three ascending interferograms constrain the fault dip and slip solution. Two right stepping, NE-striking segments connected by a more easterly oriented segment, sub-vertical or steeply dipping to the west were involved. The solution shows two main patches of slip with up to 3.5 m of left lateral slip on the southern and central fault segments. The northern segment has a left-lateral and normal oblique slip of up to a meter. Back-projection of high-frequency seismic waves recorded by the European network, processed using the Multitaper-MUSIC approach, focuses sharply along the surface break. The time progression of the high-frequency radiators shows that, after a 10 second initiation phase at slow speed, the rupture progresses in 2 phases at super-shear velocity (similar to 4.3-5 km/s) separated by a 3 second interval of slower propagation corresponding to the passage through the restraining bend. The intensity of the high-frequency radiation reaches maxima during the initial and middle phases of slow propagation and is reduced by 50% during the super-shear phases of the propagation. These findings are consistent with studies of other strike-slip earthquakes in continental domain, showing the importance of fault geometric complexities in controlling the speed of fault propagation and related spatiotemporal pattern of the high-frequency radiation.

TI  - Joint Estimation of Cardiac Toxicity and Recurrence Risks After Comprehensive Nodal Photon Versus Proton Therapy for Breast Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The study aims to perform joint estimation of the risk of recurrence caused by inadequate radiation dose coverage of lymph node targets and the risk of cardiac toxicity caused by radiation exposure to the heart. Delivered photon plans are compared with realistic proton plans, thereby providing evidence-based estimates of the heterogeneity of treatment effects in consecutive cases for the 2 radiation treatment modalities.Methods and Materials: Forty-one patients referred for postlumpectomy comprehensive nodal photon irradiation for left-sided breast cancer were included. Comparative proton plans were optimized by a spot scanning technique with single-field optimization from 2 en face beams. Cardiotoxicity risk was estimated with the model of Darby et al, and risk of recurrence following a compromise of lymph node coverage was estimated by a linear dose-response model fitted to the recurrence data from the recently published EORTC ( European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) 22922/10925 and NCIC-CTG ( National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group) MA. 20 randomized controlled trials.Results: Excess absolute risk of cardiac morbidity was small with photon therapy at an attained age of 80 years, with median values of 1.0% (range, 0.2%-2.9%) and 0.5% (range, 0.03%-1.0%) with and without cardiac risk factors, respectively, but even lower with proton therapy (0.13% [ range, 0.02%-0.5%] and 0.06% [ range, 0.004%-0.3%], respectively). The median estimated excess absolute risk of breast cancer recurrence after 10 years was 0.10% (range, 0.0%-0.9%) with photons and 0.02% (range, 0.0%-0.07%) with protons. The association between age of the patient and benefit from proton therapy was weak, almost non-existing (Spearman rank correlations of - 0.15 and - 0.30 with and without cardiac risk factors, respectively).Conclusions: Modern photon therapy yields limited risk of cardiac toxicity in most patients, but proton therapy can reduce the predicted risk of cardiac toxicity by up to 2.9% and the risk of breast cancer recurrence by 0.9% in individual patients. Predicted benefit correlates weakly with age. Combined assessment of the risk from cardiac exposure and inadequate target coverage is desirable for rational consideration of competing photon and proton therapy plans.

TI  - Revisiting the coupling between NDVI trends and cropland changes in the Sahel drylands: A case study in western Niger
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of human activities via land use/cover changes on NDVI trends is critical for an improved understanding of satellite-observed changes in vegetation productivity in drylands. The dominance of positive NDVI trends in the Sahel, the so-called re-greening, is sometimes interpreted as a combined effect of an increase in rainfall and cropland expansion or agricultural intensification. Yet, the impact of changes in land use has yet to be thoroughly tested and supported by empirical evidence. At present, no studies have considered the importance of the different seasonal NDVI signals of cropped and fallowed fields when interpreting NDVI trends, as both field types are commonly merged into a single 'cropland' class. We make use of the distinctly different phonology of cropped and fallowed fields and use seasonal NDVI curves to separate these two field types. A fuzzy classifier is applied to quantify cropped and fallowed areas in a case study region in the southern Sahel (Fakara, Niger) on a yearly basis between 2000 and 2014. We find that fallowed fields have a consistently higher NDVI than unmanured cropped fields and by using two seasonal NDVI metrics (the amplitude and the decreasing rate) derived from the MODIS time series, a clear separation between classes of fields is achieved (r = 0.77). The fuzzy classifier can compute the percentage of a pixel (250 m) under active cultivation, thereby alleviating the problem of small field sizes in the region. We find a predominant decrease in NDVI over the period of analysis associated with an increased area of cropped fields at the expense of fallowed fields. Our findings couple cropping abandonment (more frequent fallow years) with positive NDVI trends and an increase in the percentage of the cropped area (fallow period shortening) with negative trends. These findings profoundly impact our understanding of greening and browning trends in agrarian Sahelian drylands and in other drylands of developing countries characterized by limited use of fertilizers.

TI  - Coastal wetlands facing climate change and anthropogenic activities: A remote sensing analysis and modelling application
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Under high-intensity anthropogenic activities and accelerated climate change globally, estuarine and coastal wetland ecosystems (ECWEs) are facing the great challenge of surviving the destructive effects brought about by human activities and sea level rise (SLR). In this study, time -series Landsat images and object -oriented classifications were adopted to monitor the trends and status of ECWEs in the PNA (Pudong New Area) of Shanghai from 1989 to 2013. To study landward and seaward threats to the ECWEs, two types of models were employed to simulate the dynamics of the ECWEs at different time scales. A Markov Chain model and CLUE-S (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at a Small regional extent) were used to assess the impact of anthropogenic activities on the ECWEs from the landward direction in 2025. Additionally, SLAMM (Sea Level Affecting Saltmarsh Model) was utilized to evaluate the influence of SLR on the ECWEs from the seaward direction in 2100. The results showed that (1) more than 15,000 ha of the ECWEs were lost or degraded from 1989 to 2013 and (2) most of the ECWEs were transformed into drained lands for agriculture, aquaculture, or industrial or residential use under the rapid expansion of the city. Moreover, 54% of the agricultural land was converted to built-up areas or other uses. (3) The loss of agricultural land and increase in built-up areas will continue in the short-term future (up to 2025), and the sprawl of the built-up areas will extend in every direction in the PNA. (4) As modelled by the process -based SLAMM, the landscape changes in the ECWEs will be slight due to SLR by the end of the century, rather than distinct erosion in tidal flats being caused by SLR. In summary, driven by different forces, the ECWEs will be altered greatly and threatened by the impact of human activities and SLR from landward and seaward directions. On a short-term time scale, human activities will play a more important role in the modification and evolution of the ECWEs through direct exploitation of and interference with the structure and biogeochemical processes of the ECWEs. However, on a long-term time scale, the accelerated SLR will cause the continuous narrowing of the ECWEs. Considering the blockade due to the construction of dikes along the shoreline, destructive effects will influence the ECWEs, despite the feedback among the dominant plant species, geomorphology and hydrology.

TI  - Statistical properties of atmospheric greenhouse gas measurements: Looking down from space and looking up from the ground
T2  - CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing platforms can collect measurements on a global scale within a few days, which provides an unprecedented opportunity to characterize and understand the spatio-temporal variability of environmental variables. Because of the additional challenges of making precise and accurate measurements from space, it is essential to validate satellite remote sensing datasets with highly precise and accurate ground-based measurements. The focus of this article is on two sets of measurements: Atmospheric column-averaged carbon dioxide (CO2) collected by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission in its target mode of operation; and ground-based data used for validation from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). The current statistical modeling of the relationship between the less-precise OCO-2 satellite data (17) and the more-precise TCCON ground -based data (X) assumes a linear regression and heteroscedattic measurement errors that reside in both the OCO-2 data and the TCCON data. To obtain consistent estimates of the regression coefficients, it is critical to determine the error variance of each datum in the regression. In this article, a rigorous statistical procedure is presented for obtaining these error variances through modeling the spatial and/or temporal dependence structure in the OCO-2 and TCCON datasets. Numerical results for analyzing data at the Lamont TCCON station and the corresponding OCO-2 target-mode data (orbit number 3590) illustrate our procedure.

TI  - Reanalysis of global terrestrial vegetation trends from MODIS products: Browning or greening?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately monitoring global vegetation dynamics with modern remote sensing is critical for understanding the functions and processes of the biosphere and its interactions with the planetary climate. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index (VI) product has been a primary data source for this purpose. To date, the MODIS team had released several versions of VI products that have widely used in global change studies and practical applications. In this study, we re-examined the global vegetation activity by comparing the recent MODIS Collection 6 (C6) VIs with Collection 5 (C5) VIs including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Terra (2001-2015) and Aqua Satellites (2003-2015). We found substantial differences in global vegetation trends betweenTerra-C5 and -C6 VIs, especially EVI. From 2001 to 2015, global vegetation showed a remarkable greening trend in annual EVI from the Terra-C6 (0.28% year(-1) P < 0.001), in contrast to the decreasing EVI trend from the Terra-05 (-0.14% year(-1) P < 0.01). Spatially, large portions of the browning areas in tropical regions identified by Terra-05 VIs were not evident in Terra-C6 VIs. In contrast, the widespread greening areas in Terra-C6 VIs were consistent with Aqua C6 VIs and GIMMS3g NDVI. Our finding of a greening Earth supports the recent studies suggesting an enhanced land carbon sink. Our study suggests that most of the vegetation browning trends detected by MODIS Terra-C5 VIs were likely caused by sensor degradation, particularly for the period after 2007. Therefore, previous studies of temporal vegetation trends based solely on Terra-C5 VIs may need to be reevaluated. Our new analysis offers the most updated understanding of the global vegetation dynamics during the past 15 years and contributes to accurately understanding the role of vegetation played in the Earth's biogeochemical and climatic systems.

TI  - Characterizing global patterns of frozen ground with and without snow cover using microwave and MODIS satellite data products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - How organisms respond to climate change during the winter depends on snow cover, because the subnivium (the insulated and thermally stable area between snowpack and frozen ground) provides a refuge for plants, animals, and microbes. Satellite data characterizing either freeze/thaw cycles or snow cover are both available, but these two types of data have not yet been combined to map the subnivium. Here, we characterized global patterns of frozen ground with and without snow cover to provide a baseline to assess the effects of future winter climate change on organisms that depend on the subnivium. We analyzed two remote sensing datasets: the MODIS Snow Cover product and the NASA MEaSUREs Global Record of Daily Landscape Freeze/fhaw Status dataset derived from SSM/I and SSMIS. From these we developed a new 500-m resolution dataset that captures global patterns of the duration of snow-covered ground (D-ws) and the duration of snow-free frozen ground (D-wos) from 2000 to 2012. We also quantified how D-ws and D-wos, vary with latitude. Our results show that both mean and interannual variation in D-ws and D-wos change with latitude and topography. Mean D-ws increases with latitude. Counter-intuitively though, D-wos has longest duration at about 33 degrees N, decreasing both northward and southward, even though the duration of frozen ground (either snow covered or not) was shorter than that at higher latitudes. This occurs because snow cover in mid-latitudes is low and ephemeral, leaving longer periods of frozen, snow-free ground. Interannual variation in D-ws increased with latitude, but the slopes of this relationship differed among North America, Europe, Asia, and the Southern Hemisphere. Overall, our results show that, for organisms that rely on the subnivium to survive the winter, mid-latitude areas could be functionally colder than either higher or lower latitudes. Furthermore, because interannual variation in D-wos is greater at high latitudes, we would expect organisms there to be adapted to unpredictability in exposure to freezing. Ultimately, the effects of climate change on organisms during winter should be considered in the context of the subnivium, when warming could make more northerly areas functionally colder in winter, and changes in annual variation in the duration of snow-free but frozen conditions could lead to greater unpredictability in the onset and end of winter.

AB  - Daily evapotranspiration is a major component of water resources management plans. In arid ecosystems, the quest for an efficient water budget is always hard to achieve due to insufficient irrigational water and high evapotranspiration rates. Therefore, monitoring of daily evapotranspiration is a key practice for sustainable water resources management, especially in arid environments. Remote sensing techniques offered a great help to estimate the daily evapotranspiration on a regional scale. Existing open-source algorithms proved to estimate daily evapotranspiration comprehensively in arid environments. The only deficiency of these algorithms is the course scale of the used remote sensing data. Consequently, the adequate downscaling algorithm is a compulsory step to rationalize an effective water resources management plan. Daily evapotranspiration was estimated fairly well using an Advance Along-Track Scanner Radiometer (AATSR) in conjunction with (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) MERIS data acquired in July 2013 with 1 km spatial resolution and 3 days of temporal resolution under a surface energy balance system (SEBS) model. Results were validated against reference evapotranspiration ground truth values using standardized Penman-Monteith method with R-2 of 0.879. The findings of the current research successfully monitor turbulent heat fluxes values estimated from AATSR and MERIS data with a temporal resolution of 3 days only in conjunction with reliable meteorological data. Research verdicts are necessary inputs for a well-informed decisionmaking processes regarding sustainable water resource management.

TI  - Searching for Lyme borreliosis in Australia: results of a canine sentinel study
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lyme borreliosis is a common tick-borne disease of the northern hemisphere that is caused by bacterial spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) (Bbsl) complex. To date, there has been no convincing evidence for locally-acquired Lyme borreliosis on the Australian continent and there is currently a national debate concerning the nature and distributions of zoonotic tick-transmitted infectious disease in Australia. In studies conducted in Europe and the United States, dogs have been used as sentinels for tick-associated illness in people since they readily contact ticks that may harbour zoonotic pathogens. Applying this principle, we used a combination of serological assays to test dogs living in tick 'hot spots' and exposed to the Australian paralysis tick, Ixodes holocyclus, for evidence of exposure to B. burgdorferi (s.l.) antigens and other vector-borne pathogens.Results: Altogether, 555 dogs from four demographic groups were recruited into this study. One dog had evidence of exposure to Anaplasma spp. but no other dog was positive in screening tests. A total of 122 dogs (22.0%) had a kinetic ELISA (KELA) unit value > 100, and one dog with a high titre (399.9 KELA units) had been vaccinated against B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) before travelling to Australia. Older dogs and those with a history of tick paralysis were significantly more likely to have a KELA unit value > 100. Line immunoassay analysis revealed moderate-to-weak (equivocal) bands in 27 (4.9%) dogs.Conclusions: Except for a single dog presumed to have been exposed to Anaplasma platys, infection with Anaplasma spp. B. burgdorferi (s.l.), Ehrlichia spp., and Dirofilaria immitis, was not detected in the cohort of Australian dogs evaluated in this study. These results provide further evidence that Lyme borreliosis does not exist in Australia but that cross-reacting antibodies (false positive results) are common and may be caused by the transmission of other tick-associated organisms.

TI  - Monitoring and Modeling the Tibetan Plateau's climate system and its impact on East Asia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau is an important water source in Asia. As the "Third Pole" of the Earth, the Tibetan Plateau has significant dynamic and thermal effects on East Asian climate patterns, the Asian monsoon process and atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere. However, little systematic knowledge is available regarding the changing climate system of the Tibetan Plateau and the mechanisms underlying its impact on East Asia. This study was based on "water-cryosphere-atmosphere-biology" multi-sphere interactions, primarily considering global climate change in relation to the Tibetan Plateau-East Asia climate system and its mechanisms. This study also analyzed the Tibetan Plateau to clarify global climate change by considering multi-sphere energy and water processes. Additionally, the impacts of climate change in East Asia and the associated impact mechanisms were revealed, and changes in water cycle processes and water conversion mechanisms were studied. The changes in surface thermal anomalies, vegetation, local circulation and the atmospheric heat source on the Tibetan Plateau were studied, specifically, their effects on the East Asian monsoon and energy balance mechanisms. Additionally, the relationships between heating mechanisms and monsoon changes were explored.

TI  - Temperate rocky subtidal reef community reveals human impacts across the entire food web
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Food webs as representations of who eats whom are at the core of community ecology. Incorporation of tools from network theory enables assessment of how complex systems respond to natural and human-induced stressors, revealing how harvesting may degrade the properties and resilience of food webs. We present a comprehensive, coastal marine food web that includes 147 taxa cooccurring on shallow subtidal reefs along the highly productive and exploited Humboldt Current System of central Chile. This food web has connectance of 0.06, link density of 1204 and mean chain length of 4.3. The fractions of intermediate (76%), omnivorous (49%) and cannibalistic (8%) nodes are slightly lower than those observed in other marine food webs. Of the 147 nodes, 34 are harvested. Links to harvested nodes represented 50 to 100% of all trophic links of non-harvested nodes, illustrating the great impact that fishery pressure can have on the food web. The food web was compartmentalized into 5 sub-webs with high representation of harvested taxa. This structure changes if the fishery node is removed. Similarity analyses identified groups of harvested species with non-harvested nodes, suggesting that these tropho-equivalents could be sentinel species for the community-wide impacts of coastal fisheries. We conclude that fishing effects can be transmitted throughout the food web, with no compartments completely unaffected by harvesting. It is urgent to establish monitoring programs for community-wide effects of fisheries and assess whether resilience of these highly productive subtidal food webs has al ready been compromised, thereby identifying essential nodes that require stronger fisheries regulation.

TI  - Geology of the Gobi Altai and Tseel terranes in the central part of the Sagsai River Watershed, SE Mongolian Altai
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - A geological map is an indispensable tool for understanding the structure of the Earth's crust but high-quality geological maps are usually lacking in remote areas of mountainous Central Asia covered by vast deserts. The progress in remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS), as well as the advancement in analytical methods, have generated new challenges in producing modern geological maps in such regions. The presented 1: 50,000 geological map along the Sagsai River summarizes new and more accurate geological data from the geologically interesting region at the contact of the supracrustal and deep crustal Tugrug and Tseel units forming the metamorphosed accretionary wedge on the S and SW slopes of the Mongolian Altai. These geological units are formed by the lower Palaeozoic volcano-sedimentary sequences affected by Devonian Barrovian metamorphism ranging from lower greenschist to granulite facies. This metamorphic basement was subsequently intruded by the post-orogenic late Carboniferous Sagsai Pluton. The presented map shows complex relationships between different crustal levels of the metamorphosed accretionary wedge and post-tectonic intrusion evaluated using a GIS, numerical processing of remote sensing data as well as field documentation and laboratory studies.

TI  - Multiple temporal mosaicing for Landsat satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud removal is a very important preprocessing step when using aerial and spaceborne optical sensors for land surface and cover applications. Methods that have been proposed for identifying cloud-affected pixels range from classification and segmentation type approaches applied to individual images to outlier detection type methods applied to time-series of images. The choice of method is influenced by considerations including the requirements of the application, the image characteristics, and how frequently images over a given area are acquired. When many images are acquired in a period where land surface cover exhibits negligible change, an image formed by compositing from a series of images taken in a relatively short period of time will suffice for further analysis. It is highly desirable to fully automate this compositing process. To this end, we propose the multiple temporal mosaicing (MTM) algorithm. It uses, in the first instance, a cloud score for each pixel in the images to separate/partially separate cloud-affected pixels from noncloud pixels. These cloud scores are then combined with the output from existing cloud identification methods and date preference to determine the likelihood of given pixels being considered as good candidates to be included in the final image. Moreover, the spatial smoothness is incorporated to ensure that the pixels of a small neighborhood are from the same image so that the final image looks smoother. We apply MTM to two Landsat scenes. The resulting images show the effectiveness of this method. The methodology can be applied to images acquired from other sensors. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Chromophores in operative surgery: Current practice and rationalized development
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Chromophore-containing molecules feature extensively in surgical practice, with synthetic dyes gaining popularity over endogenous optical adjuncts. New applications for chromophores in diagnostics and operative treatment exploit unique chemical structures suited for illuminating target tissues beyond the visual spectrum, ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR). This review outlines the rationale for surgical chromophore application, the weaknesses and risks in each class of these compounds, and areas of foreseeable potential for employment of specialized contrast agents.Method: An English-language literature search applied the following Boolean Search String: "dye OR Lake OR Stain OR chromophore" AND "tox$ OR terato* OR carcino$ OR Allerg$ OR surg$ OR clinic" using EMBASE, PUBMED, PUBMED central and OVIDSp, with back-referencing through Web of Knowledge(TM).Results: Based on the primary literature, this study proposes a surgically relevant classification system of chromophores in current use, which facilitates risk/benefit consideration for the surgeon who employs them, and which facilitates clinically oriented development.Conclusions: The next stage of development for optically active surgical adjuncts must address practical constraints whilst minimizing risks of adverse effects. Exploiting the technology's full potential also requires improvements in the usefulness of imagery equipment. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Assimilation of MODIS Dark Target and Deep Blue observations in the dust aerosol component of NMMB-MONARCH version 1.0
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A data assimilation capability has been built for the NMMB-MONARCH chemical weather prediction system, with a focus on mineral dust, a prominent type of aerosol. An ensemble-based Kalman filter technique (namely the local ensemble transform Kalman filter - LETKF) has been utilized to optimally combine model background and satellite retrievals. Our implementation of the ensemble is based on known uncertainties in the physical parametrizations of the dust emission scheme. Experiments showed that MODIS AOD retrievals using the Dark Target algorithm can help NMMB-MONARCH to better characterize atmospheric dust. This is particularly true for the analysis of the dust outflow in the Sahel region and over the African Atlantic coast. The assimilation of MODIS AOD retrievals based on the Deep Blue algorithm has a further positive impact in the analysis downwind from the strongest dust sources of the Sahara and in the Arabian Peninsula. An analysis-initialized forecast performs better (lower forecast error and higher correlation with observations) than a standard forecast, with the exception of underestimating dust in the long-range Atlantic transport and degradation of the temporal evolution of dust in some regions after day 1. Particularly relevant is the improved forecast over the Sahara throughout the forecast range thanks to the assimilation of Deep Blue retrievals over areas not easily covered by other observational datasets.The present study on mineral dust is a first step towards data assimilation with a complete aerosol prediction system that includes multiple aerosol species.

TI  - Nutritional, Biophysical and Physiological Characteristics of Wild Rocket Genotypes As Affected by Soilless Cultivation System, Salinity Level of Nutrient Solution and Growing Period
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the aim of defining the best management of nutrient solution (NS) in a soilless system for obtaining high quality baby-leaf rocket, the present study focuses on two wild rocket genotypes ("Nature" and "Naturelle"), grown in a greenhouse under two Southern Italy growing conditions-autumn-winter (AW) and winter-spring (WS)-using two soilless cultivation systems (SCS)-at two electrical conductivity values (EC) of NS. The SCSs used were the Floating System (FS) and Ebb and Flow System (EFS) and the EC values were 2.5 and 3.5 dS m(-1) (EC2.5; EC3.5) for the AW cycle and 3.5 and 4.5 dS m(-1) (EC3.5; EC4.5) for the WS cycle. The yield, bio-physical, physiological and nutritional characteristics were evaluated. Higher fresh (FY) (2.25 vs. 1.50 kg m(-2)) and dry (DY) (230.6 vs. 106.1 g m(-2)) weight yield, leaf firmness (dry matter, 104.3 vs. 83.2 g kg(-1) FW; specific leaf area, 34.8 vs. 24.2 g cm(-2)) and antioxidant compounds (vitamin C, 239.0 vs. 152.7mg kg(-1) FW; total phenols, 997 vs. 450mg GAE mg kg(-1) FW; total glucosinulates-GLSs, 1,078.8 vs. 405.7mg kg(-1) DW; total antioxidant capacity-TAC, 11,534 vs. 8,637 mu mol eq trolox kg(-1) FW) and lower nitrates (1,470 vs. 3,460mg kg(-1) FW) were obtained under WS conditions. The seasonal differences were evident on the GLS profile: some aliphatic GLSs (gluconapoleiferin, glucobrassicanapin) and indolic 4-OH-glucobrassicin were only expressed in WS conditions, while indolic glucobrassicin was only detected in the AW period. Compared with EFS, FS improved leaf firmness, visual quality, antioxidant content (TAC, +11.6%) and reduced nitrate leaf accumulation (-37%). "Naturelle" performed better than "Nature" in terms of yield, visual quality and nutritional profile, with differences more evident under less favorable climatic conditions and when the cultivars were grown in FS. Compared to EC2.5, the EC3.5 treatment did not affect DY while enhancing firmness, visual quality, and antioxidant compounds (TAC, +8%), and reducing the nitrate content (-47%). The EC4.5 treatment reduced FY and DY and the antioxidant content. Despite seasonal climatic condition variability, FS and the moderate salinity level of NS (3.5 dS m(-1)) can be suggested as optimum.

TI  - Redefining radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer with single dose ablative treatment: a study protocol
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A shift towards less burdening and more patient friendly treatments for breast cancer is currently ongoing. In low-risk patients with early-stage disease, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is an alternative for whole breast irradiation following breast-conserving surgery. MRI-guided single dose ablative APBI has the potential to offer a minimally burdening, non-invasive treatment that could replace current breast-conserving therapy.Methods: The ABLATIVE study is a prospective, single arm, multicenter study evaluating preoperative, single dose, ablative radiation treatment in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Patients with core biopsy proven non-lobular invasive breast cancer, (estrogen receptor positive, Her2 negative, maximum tumor size 3.0 cm on diagnostic MRI) and a negative sentinel node biopsy are eligible. Radiotherapy (RT) planning will be performed using a contrast enhanced (CE) planning CT-scan, co-registered with a CE-MRI, both in supine RT position. A total of twenty-five consecutive patients will be treated with a single ablative RT dose of 20 Gy to the tumor and 15 Gy to the tumorbed. Follow-up MRIs are scheduled within 1 week, 2, 4 and 6 months after single-dose RT. Breast-conserving surgery is scheduled at six months following RT. Primary study endpoint is pathological complete response. Secondary study endpoints are the radiological response and toxicity. Furthermore, patients will fill out questionnaires on quality of life and functional status. Cosmetic outcome will be evaluated by the treating radiation oncologist, patient and 'Breast Cancer Conservation Treatment cosmetic results' software. Recurrence and survival rates will be assessed. The patients will be followed up to 10 years after diagnosis. If patients give additional informed consent, a biopsy and a part of the irradiated specimen will be stored at the local Biobank and used for future research on radiotherapy response associated genotyping.Discussion: The ABLATIVE study evaluates MRI-guided single dose ablative RT in patients with early-stage breast cancer, aiming at a less burdening and non-invasive alternative for current breast-conserving treatment.

TI  - The mouse mammary gland as a sentinel organ: distinguishing 'control' populations with diverse environmental histories
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There are numerous examples of laboratory animals that were inadvertently exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during the process of conducting experiments. Controlling contaminations in the laboratory is challenging, especially when their source is unknown. Unfortunately, EDC contaminations can interfere with the interpretation of data during toxicological evaluations. We propose that the male CD-1 mouse mammary gland is a sensitive bioassay to evaluate the inadvertent contamination of animal colonies.Methods: We evaluated mammary glands collected from two CD-1 mouse populations with distinct environmental histories. Population 1 was born and raised in a commercial laboratory with unknown EDC exposures; Population 2 was the second generation raised in an animal facility with limited exposures to xenoestrogens from caging, feed, etc. Mammary glands were collected from all animals and evaluated using morphometric techniques to quantify morphological characteristics of the mammary gland.Results: Population 1 ( with suspected history of environmental chemical exposure) and Population 2 (with known limited history of xenoestrogen exposure) were morphologically distinguishable in adult males, prepubertal females, and pubertal females. Mammary glands from males raised in the commercial animal facility were significantly more developed, with larger ductal trees and more branching points. The appearance of these mammary glands was consistent with prior reports of male mice exposed to low doses of bisphenol A (BPA) during early development. In females, the two populations were morphologically distinct at both prepuberty and puberty, with the most striking differences observed in the number, size, and density of terminal end buds, e.g. highly proliferative structures found in the developing mammary gland.Conclusions: Collectively, these results suggest that the mouse mammary gland has the potential to be used as a sentinel organ to evaluate and distinguish animal colonies raised in different environmental conditions including potential EDC exposures. Our findings could help researchers that wish to perform a posteriori evaluations to determine whether inadvertent contamination with xenoestrogens (and potentially other EDCs) has occurred in their animal colonies, especially after new materials (feed, caging, water bottles) have been introduced. Finally, our results challenge the relatively common practice of using historical controls in toxicological experiments.

TI  - In-operation field-of-view retrieval (IFR) for satellite and ground-based DOAS-type instruments applying coincident high-resolution imager data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the field of view (FOV) of a remote sensing instrument is particularly important when interpreting their data and merging them with other spatially referenced data. Especially for instruments in space, information on the actual FOV, which may change during operation, may be difficult to obtain. Also, the FOV of ground-based devices may change during transportation to the field site, where appropriate equipment for the FOV determination may be unavailable.This paper presents an independent, simple and robust method to retrieve the FOV of an instrument during operation, i.e. the two-dimensional sensitivity distribution, sampled on a discrete grid. The method relies on correlated measurements featuring a significantly higher spatial resolution, e.g. by an imaging instrument accompanying a spectrometer. The method was applied to two satellite instruments, GOME-2 and OMI, and a ground-based differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) instrument integrated in an SO2 camera. For GOME-2, quadrangular FOVs could be retrieved, which almost perfectly match the provided FOV edges after applying a correction for spatial aliasing inherent to GOME-type instruments. More complex sensitivity distributions were found at certain scanner angles, which are probably caused by degradation of the moving parts within the instrument. For OMI, which does not feature any moving parts, retrieved sensitivity distributions were much smoother compared to GOME-2. A 2-D super-Gaussian with six parameters was found to be an appropriate model to describe the retrieved OMI FOV. The comparison with operationally provided FOV dimensions revealed small differences, which could be mostly explained by the limitations of our IFR implementation. For the ground-based DOAS instrument, the FOV retrieved using SO2-camera data was slightly smaller than the flat-disc distribution, which is assumed by the state-of-the-art correlation technique. Differences between both methods may be attributed to spatial inhomogeneities.In general, our results confirm the already deduced FOV distributions of OMI, GOME-2, and the ground-based DOAS. It is certainly applicable for degradation monitoring and verification exercises. For satellite instruments, the gained information is expected to increase the accuracy of combined products, where measurements of different instruments are integrated, e.g. mapping of high-resolution cloud information, incorporation of surface climatologies. For the SO2-camera community, the method presents a new and efficient tool to monitor the DOAS FOV in the field.

TI  - Effectiveness of autodissemination stations containing pyriproxyfen in reducing immature <i>Aedes albopictus</i> populations
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is an aggressive, highly anthropophilic, day-biting mosquito with an expanding geographic range. Suppression of Ae. albopictus is difficult because of the abundance and prevalence of larval habitats within peridomestic environments, particularly cryptic habitats such as corrugated extension spouts, fence post openings, discarded food containers, etc. Because of the challenges of eliminating or treating larval habitats of this species, we tested an autodissemination concept to contaminate these habitats with the insect growth regulator pyriproxyfen.Methods: Our study was conducted in the City of Trenton (Mercer County), New Jersey, USA (40 degrees 12'N, 74 degrees 44'W). We selected six hot spots, where five or more Ae. albopictus males or females were collected based on weekly trap surveillance. A trapping unit was a city block, approximately 0.8 ha (hot spot), where we deployed 26 to 28 autodissemination stations per treatment plot. To gauge efficacy, we deployed BGS traps, oviposition cups, and sentinel cups in treatment and control locations.Results: We found a significant reduction in eggs (P < 0.0001) and larval populations (P < 0.0001) as a result of treatment. Pupal mortality, as determined through bioassays, was also significantly higher in the treatment sites (P < 0.0001).Conclusion: Our results clearly show the potential and unique use of the autodissemination stations to control immature Ae. albopictus in urban areas. Penetration of larvicides with existing methods are difficult to reach cryptic habitats, but the autodissemination approach, which exploits the oviposition behavior of the target pest, can be integrated into intervention programs. New tools are urgently needed to curb the expansion and public health implications of Ae. albopictus and other container-inhabiting species.

TI  - Sex differences in invasive pneumococcal disease and the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in the Netherlands, 2004 to 2015
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Implementation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in the Netherlands (PCV7 in 2006 and PCV10 in 2011) for infants caused a shift in serotypes in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). We explored sex differences in serotype-specific IPD incidence before and after vaccine introduction. Incidences in the pre-PCV7 (June 2004-May 2006), post-PCV7 (June 2008-May 2011) and post-PCV10 period (June 2013-May 2015), stratified by age, were compared. Incidence was higher in men for all age groups (overall in men: 16.7, 15.5 and 14.4/100,000 and women: 15.4, 13.6 and 13.9/100,000 pre-PCV7, post-PCV7 and post-PCV10, respectively), except for 20-39 year-olds after PCV7 and 40-64 year-olds after PCV10 introduction. After PCV7 and PCV10 introduction, the overall IPD incidence decreased in men aged 20-39 years (from 5.3 pre-PCV7 to 4.7 and 2.6/100,000 post-PCV7 and post-PCV10, respectively), whereas it showed a temporary increase in women (from 3.9/100,000 pre-PCV7 to 5.0/100,000 post-PCV7 and back to 4.0/100,000 post-PCV10) due to replacement disease. PCV10 herd effects were observed throughout, but in women older than 40 years, a significant increase in non-PCV10 serotype offset a decrease in overall IPD incidence. Ongoing surveillance of IPD incidence by sex is important to evaluate the long-term effects of PCV implementation.

TI  - An exploratory study on the aerosol height retrieval from OMI measurements of the 477 nm O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>2</sub> spectral band using a neural network approach
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an exploratory study on the aerosol layer height (ALH) retrieval from the OMI 477 nm O-2-O-2 spectral band. We have developed algorithms based on the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network (NN) approach and applied them to 3-year (2005-2007) OMI cloudfree scenes over north-east Asia, collocated with MODIS Aqua aerosol product. In addition to the importance of aerosol altitude for climate and air quality objectives, our long-term motivation is to evaluate the possibility of retrieving ALH for potential future improvements of trace gas retrievals (e.g. NO2, HCHO, SO2) from UV-visible air quality satellite measurements over scenes including high aerosol concentrations. This study presents a first step of this long-term objective and evaluates, from a statistic point of view, an ensemble of OMI ALH retrievals over a long time period of 3 years covering a large industrialized continental region. This ALH retrieval relies on the analysis of the O-2-O-2 slant column density (SCD) and requires an accurate knowledge of the aerosol optical thickness, tau. Using MODIS Aqua tau (550nm) as a prior information, absolute seasonal differences between the LIdar climatology of vertical Aerosol Structure for space-based lidar simulation (LIVAS) and average OMI ALH, over scenes with MODIS tau (550nm) >= 1.0, are in the range of 260-800m (assuming single scattering albedo omega(0) = 0.95) and 180-310m (assuming omega(0) = 0.9). OMI ALH retrievals depend on the assumed aerosol single scattering albedo (sensitivity up to 660 m) and the chosen surface albedo (variation less than 200m between OMLER and MODIS black-sky albedo). Scenes with tau <= 0.5 are expected to show too large biases due to the little impact of particles on the O-2-O-2 SCD changes. In addition, NN algorithms also enable aerosol optical thickness retrieval by exploring the OMI reflectance in the continuum. Comparisons with collocated MODIS Aqua show agreements between -0.02 +/- 0.45 and -0.18 +/- 0.24, depending on the season. Improvements may be obtained from a better knowledge of the surface albedo and higher accuracy of the aerosol model. Following the previous work over ocean of Park et al. (2016), our study shows the first encouraging aerosol layer height retrieval results over land from satellite observations of the 477 nm O-2-O-2 absorption spectral band.

TI  - Robustness and Uncertainties of the "Temperature and Greenness" Model for Estimating Terrestrial Gross Primary Production
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) plays a vital role in offsetting anthropogenic CO2 emission and regulating global carbon cycle. Various remote sensing approaches for estimating GPP have attracted considerable scientific attentions, yet their robustness and uncertainties remain unclear. Here we evaluate the performance of the "temperature and greenness" (TG) model, a representative remote sensing model in estimating GPP, using the global FLUXNET GPP based on parameter sensitive analysis and optimization strategies. The results show that the minimum (x(n)) and optimum (x(o)) temperatures for photosynthesis are sensitive parameters but maximum temperature (x(m)) not. Optimized xn and xo differ largely from their defaults for more than half of 12 plant functional types (PFTs). Parameter optimization significantly improves the TG's performance in forest ecosystems where temperature or solar radiation has significant contribution to GPP. For water-limited ecosystems where GPP are strongly dependent of EVI and EVI are sensitive to precipitation, parameter optimization has limited effects. These results imply that the TG model, and most likely for other kind of GPP models using same methodology, can't be significantly improved for all PFTs through parameter optimization only, and other key climatic variables should be incorporated into the model for better predicting terrestrial ecosystem GPP.

TI  - Separating overstory and understory leaf area indices for global needleleaf and deciduous broadleaf forests by fusion of MODIS and MISR data
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest overstory and understory layers differ in carbon and water cycle regimes and phenology, as well as ecosystem functions. Separate retrievals of leaf area index (LAI) for these two layers would help to improve modeling forest biogeochemical cycles, evaluating forest ecosystem functions and also remote sensing of forest canopies by inversion of canopy reflectance models. In this paper, overstory and understory LAI values were estimated separately for global needleleaf and deciduous broadleaf forests by fusing MISR and MODIS observations. Monthly forest understory LAI was retrieved from the forest understory reflectivity estimated using MISR data. After correcting for the background contribution using monthly mean forest understory reflectivities, the forest overstory LAI was estimated from MODIS observations. The results demonstrate that the largest extent of forest understory vegetation is present in the boreal forest zones at northern latitudes. Significant seasonal variations occur for understory vegetation in these zones with LAI values up to 2-3 from June to August. The mean proportion of understory LAI to total LAI is greater than 30 %. Higher understory LAI values are found in needleleaf forests (with a mean value of 1.06 for evergreen needleleaf forests and 1.04 for deciduous needleleaf forests) than in deciduous broadleaf forests (0.96) due to the more clumped foliage and easier penetration of light to the forest floor in needleleaf forests. Spatially and seasonally variable forest understory reflectivity helps to account for the effects of the forest background on LAI retrieval while compared with constant forest background. The retrieved forest overstory and understory LAI values were compared with an existing dataset for larch forests in eastern Siberia (40-75 degrees N, 45-180 degrees E). The retrieved overstory and understory LAI is close to that of the existing dataset, with an absolute error of 0.02 (0.06), relative error of 1.3% (14.3 %) and RMSE of 0.93 (0.29) for overstory (understory). The comparisons between our results and field measurements in eight forest sites show that the R-2 values are 0.52 and 0.62, and the RMSEs are 1.36 and 0.62 for overstory and understory LAI, respectively.

TI  - Estimation of surface energy fluxes in the Arctic tundra using the remote sensing thermal-based Two-Source Energy Balance model
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic has become generally a warmer place over the past decades leading to earlier snow melt, permafrost degradation and changing plant communities. Increases in precipitation and local evaporation in the Arctic, known as the acceleration components of the hydrologic cycle, coupled with land cover changes, have resulted in significant changes in the regional surface energy budget. Quantifying spatiotemporal trends in surface energy flux partitioning is key to forecasting ecological responses to changing climate conditions in the Arctic. An extensive local evaluation of the Two-Source Energy Balance model (TSEB) - a remotesensing-based model using thermal infrared retrievals of land surface temperature - was performed using tower measurements collected over different tundra types in Alaska in all sky conditions over the full growing season from 2008 to 2012. Based on comparisons with flux tower observations, refinements in the original TSEB net radiation, soil heat flux and canopy transpiration parameterizations were identified for Arctic tundra. In particular, a revised method for estimating soil heat flux based on relationships with soil temperature was developed, resulting in significantly improved performance. These refinements result in mean turbulent flux errors generally less than 50Wm(-2) at half-hourly time steps, similar to errors typically reported in surface energy balance modeling studies conducted in more temperate climatic regimes. The MODIS leaf area index (LAI) remote sensing product proved to be useful for estimating energy fluxes in Arctic tundra in the absence of field data on the local biomass amount. Model refinements found in this work at the local scale build toward a regional implementation of the TSEB model over Arctic tundra ecosystems, using thermal satellite remote sensing to assess response of surface fluxes to changing vegetation and climate conditions.

TI  - A 100 Hz 3.31 J all-solid-state high beam quality Nd:YAG laser for space debris detecting
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of space technology, human activities into space are increasing, thereby producing lots of space debris. And the space debris impact is the major cause for the mechanical damage to the space crafts and the main factor affecting the service life; it even endangers the life safety of the astronauts working outside the spacecraft and pose a threat to the astronomical observation and studies. Thus, the monitoring and early warning of space debris are gradually attracting wide attention. Obviously, laser detection as a good-directivity and strong anti-jamming active detecting means has a unique advantage in terms of a round-the-clock detection. Therefore, the developing of debris-detecting laser beam source becomes the most direct and effective means for increasing the space debris detection accuracy. The laser detecting ability is restricted by the laser beam quality, the pulse energy and the repetition frequency at the same time. The beam quality could affect the ability to detect and recognize space target. The bigger the laser pulse energy, the higher the repetition frequency and the smaller the detectable debris, the stronger the detecting ability will be. A good detection effect could be achieved at 80-100 Hz laser pulse repetition frequency. A further increase of the repetition frequency will greatly increase the difficulty and cost accordingly but the improvement of the detection performance is not obvious at all. Thus, repetition frequency around 100 Hz becomes the best choice for laser space debris detection. Based on the laser diode side-pumped rod-shaped amplifier, a high-repetition-frequency and high-beam-quality of joule level Nd:YAG nanosecond laser for space debris detection is developed in this work. The laser adopts MOPA structure, mainly including single longitudinal mode, pre-amplifier unit, SBS phase-conjugate beam control unit and energy extraction unit. In the energy extraction unit, beam splitting-amplifying-combining is adopted for reducing the thermal effect on beam quality by reducing the working current of the amplifier. Under the condition of 100 Hz high repetition frequency and 10.73 mu J single pulse energy injected by the single longitudinal mode seed, 3.31 J output energy is gained. The output laser beam has a 4.58 ns pulse width, far field beam spot of 2.12 times the value of the diffraction limit, and 0.87% energy stability (RMS).

TI  - Remotely sensed sea surface salinity in the hyper-saline Arabian Gulf: Application to landsat 8 OLI data
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a multivariable linear algorithm was developed to derive sea surface salinity (SSS) from remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) in the hyper-saline Arabian Gulf. In situ measured Rrs at Operational Land Imager (OLI) bands 1-4 were involved in the algorithm development. Comparisons between estimated and in situ measured SSS produced Res reaching 0.74 and RMSEs <2%. The proposed algorithm was applied to OLI scenes collected in November 2013 and March 2016 to demonstrate SSS changes from normal conditions when extreme events were encountered. The good agreement between satellite derived and in situ Rrs suggested that the algorithm uncertainties were primarily attributed to the algorithm parameterization and more measurements were required for performance improving. Compared with OLI-derived products, numerical simulations overestimated SSS by 3.4%. Our findings demonstrate the potential of high resolution satellite products to study short-lasting events and capture fine-scale features in the marine environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Production Calendar Based on Water Temperature, Spat Size, and Husbandry Practices Reduce OsHV-1 μ var Impact on Cultured Pacific Oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> in the Ebro Delta (Catalonia), Mediterranean Coast of Spain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2006, the production of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in the Ebro Delta area has dramatically declined from around 800 metric tons (MT) per year to 138 MT in 2011. This decline in production has had a significant socio-economic impact in a region where the shellfish sector is a traditional economic activity for many families. The identified agent responsible for this reduction in C. gigas production was Ostreid Herpesvirus microvar (OsHV-1 mu var), which has been associated with C. gigas spat mortalities in France, and in many other countries. In Spain the episodes of mortality became critical for the regional shellfish production between 2008 until 2014, with mortality percentage up to 100%. In this study, local hatchery C. gigas spat was used as sentinel animals for epidemiological studies and management tests carried out with the aim of reducing oyster mortality in the Ebro Delta area. A production calendar mainly based on water temperature dynamics was designed around an optimal schedule for spat immersion. The immersion calendar included two optimal periods for spat immersion, in summer when temperatures are >= 25 degrees C and at the end of autumn and beginning of winter when they are <= 13 degrees C. Such production planning has reduced mortalities from 80% (in 2014 and previous years) to 2-7.5% in 2015 in cemented oysters. Furthermore, other recommendations related to spat immersion size, culture density and methodology, and cementing calendar, which helped to achieve the results presented, were also recorded and transferred to local producers. This work presents a successfully tested management strategy reducing OsHV-1 mu var impact by designing new field management practices mainly focused on the handling and timing of spat immersion. This approach could be used as a management model in areas presenting similar production practices and environmental characteristics.

TI  - Automatic super-resolution shoreline change monitoring using Landsat archival data: a case study at Narrabeen-Collaroy Beach, Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term monitoring of shoreline changes is of significant importance for coastal erosion prediction and coastal planning. This paper presents the use of the Landsat archival dataset over 29 years to monitor shoreline changes at Narrabeen-Collaroy Beach, Australia. For each scene of Landsat data, a vector-based shoreline at subpixel level was automatically extracted by employing the super-resolution border segmentation method. Monthly cross-shore beach profile surveys at five locations along the beach are used as ground truth data to assess the results. The experimental results show that after the correction of tidal effects the RMSEs of the time-series shorelines at the five locations are all less than 10 m; RMSEs of annual mean shorelines are within 5.7 m. These results were achieved within the context that the Narrabeen-Collaroy Beach has been observed to vary in width by up to 80 m during this same period. In addition, the observed variabilities in shoreline change at different locations along the 3.6-km long embayment are also clearly observed from Landsat-derived results. The results indicate the feasibility of Landsat data for long-term shoreline change monitoring. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Deriving Flood-Mediated Connectivity between River Channels and Floodplains: Data-Driven Approaches
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The flood-mediated connectivity between river channels and floodplains plays a fundamental role in flood hazard mapping and exerts profound ecological effects. The classic nearest neighbor search (NNS) fails to derive this connectivity because of spatial heterogeneity and continuity. We develop two novel data-driven connectivity-deriving approaches, namely, progressive nearest neighbor search (PNNS) and progressive iterative nearest neighbor search (PiNNS). These approaches are illustrated through a case study in Northern Australia. First, PNNS and PiNNS are employed to identify flood pathways on floodplains through forward tracking. That is, progressive search is performed to associate newly inundated cells in each time step to previously inundated cells. In particular, iterations in PiNNS ensure that the connectivity is continuous -the connection between any two cells along the pathway is built through intermediate inundated cells. Second, inundated floodplain cells are collectively connected to river channel cells through backward tracing. Certain river channel sections are identified to connect to a large number of inundated floodplain cells. That is, the floodwater from these sections causes widespread floodplain inundation. Our proposed approaches take advantage of spatial-temporal data. They can be applied to achieve connectivity from hydro-dynamic and remote sensing data and assist in river basin planning and management.

TI  - Long-term ground deformation patterns of Bucharest using multitemporal InSAR and multivariate dynamic analyses: a possible transpressional system?
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this exploratory research is to capture spatial evolution patterns in the Bucharest metropolitan area using sets of single polarised synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data and multitemporal radar interferometry. Three sets of SAR data acquired during the years 1992-2010 from ERS1/-2 and ENVISAT, and 2011-2014 from TerraSAR-X satellites were used in conjunction with the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) and persistent scatterers (PS) high-resolution multi-temporal interferometry (InSAR) techniques to provide maps of line-of-sight displacements. The satellite-based remote sensing results were combined with results derived from classical methodologies (i. e., diachronic cartography) and field research to study possible trends in developments over former clay pits, landfill excavation sites, and industrial parks. The ground displacement trend patterns were analysed using several linear and nonlinear models, and techniques. Trends based on the estimated ground displacement are characterised by long-term memory, indicated by low noise Hurst exponents, which in the long-term form interesting attractors. We hypothesize these attractors to be tectonic stress fields generated by transpressional movements.

TI  - Forest type classification with combination of advanced polarimetric decompositions and textures of L-band synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on distribution of forest types and land cover classes is essential for decision making and significant in climate regulation, biodiversity conservation, and societal issues. An approach for the combination of advanced polarimetric decompositions and textures of Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar full polarimetric data for the purpose of forest type classification is proposed. Using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, we classified forest types over a selected Indian region. Further, we tested the classification performance of the Wishart method for the same forest types. The classified results were assessed with confusion matrix-based statistics. The results suggest that incorporation of various polarimetric decompositions features into gray-level co-occurrence matrix textures refines the SVM classification overall accuracy (OA) from 73.82% (k = 0.69) to 76.34% (k = 0.72). The Wishart supervised classification algorithm has the OA of 73.38% (kappa = 0.68). We observed that integration of polarimetric information with textures can give complimentary information in forest type discrimination and produce high accuracy maps. Further, this approach overcomes the limitations of optical remote sensing data in continuous cloud coverage areas. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

TI  - Evaluating Water Controls on Vegetation Growth in the Semi-Arid Sahel Using Field and Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water loss is a crucial factor for vegetation in the semi-arid Sahel region of Africa. Global satellite-driven estimates of plant CO2 uptake (gross primary productivity, GPP) have been found to not accurately account for Sahelian conditions, particularly the impact of canopy water stress. Here, we identify the main biophysical limitations that induce canopy water stress in Sahelian vegetation and evaluate the relationships between field data and Earth observation-derived spectral products for up-scaling GPP. We find that plant-available water and vapor pressure deficit together control the GPP of Sahelian vegetation through their impact on the greening and browning phases. Our results show that a multiple linear regression (MLR) GPP model that combines the enhanced vegetation index, land surface temperature, and the short-wave infrared reflectance (Band 7, 2105-2155 nm) of the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellite sensor was able to explain between 88% and 96% of the variability of eddy covariance flux tower GPP at three Sahelian sites (overall = 89%). The MLR GPP model presented here is potentially scalable at a relatively high spatial and temporal resolution. Given the scarcity of field data on CO2 fluxes in the Sahel, this scalability is important due to the low number of flux towers in the region.

TI  - A distributed monthly water balance model: formulation and application on Black Volta Basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recharge assessment is of critical importance for groundwater resources evaluation in arid/semiarid areas, as these have typically limited surface water resources. There are several models for water balance evaluation. One of them is WetSpass, which has the ability to simulate spatially distributed recharge, surface runoff, and evapotranspiration for seasonally averaged conditions. This paper presents a modified methodology and model, WetSpass-M, in which the seasonal resolution is downscaled to a monthly scale. A generalized runoff coefficient was introduced, enabling runoff estimation for different land-use classes. WetSpass-M has been calibrated and validated with observed streamflow records from Black Volta. Baseflow from simulated recharge was compared with baseflow derived via a digital filter applied to the observed streamflow and has shown to be in agreement. Previous studies have concluded that for this basin, small changes in rainfall could cause a large change in surface runoff, and here a similar behavior is observed for recharge rates. An advantage of the new model is that it is applicable to medium-and large-sized catchments. It is useful as an assessment tool for evaluating the response of hydrological processes to the changes in associated hydrological variables. Since monthly data for streamflow and climatic variables are widely available, this new model has the potential to be used in regions where data availability at high temporal resolution is an issue. The spatial-temporal characteristics of the model allow distributed quantification of water balance components by taking advantage of remote sensing data.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Estimation Using Remote Sensing Technology Based on SEBAL Algorithm
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to obtain the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) values using Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) algorithm, during the year 2008 in Nekooabad agricultural and drainage network and Ben-Saman region located in Gavkhouni basin in Iran. For this purpose, the time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer images from Terra satellite are prepared and ETa values of the regions are estimated for this year. In order to evaluate the SEBAL algorithm performance, the algorithm was executed on Nekooabad agricultural network located in Najafabad region with enough land information and three different methods were used to verify the results. (1) Epan-method: The correlation coefficient between obtained ETa by SEBAL algorithm and the reference ET values (ET0) from pan evaporation method is about 86.72 %. (2) Penman-Monteith method: This method is used for result comparison (the correlation coefficient is about 90.47 %). (3) Water balance method: Considering the water withdrawal of the wells, precipitation and inflow and outflow to the region to the water balance equation, the ETa is estimated as the unknown variable. The results are compared with the result of SEBAL algorithm that shows an error of 7.21 %. SEBAL measured the ETa of Ben-Saman region about 228.16 mm, while there is not enough information of land change in recent years about this region. The results indicate that more cooperation is needed for implementing the special plans for water resources allocation to prevent irregular withdrawals.

TI  - Role of Contrast-Enhanced Sonography in the Evaluation of Axillary Lymph Nodes in Breast Carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives-To evaluate the diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced sonography for characterization of the lymph node status (metastatic or not) in patients with breast carcinomas by comparison with sentinel lymph node biopsy.Methods-From January to August 2015, 50 female patients with a histologic diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma were prospectively examined by ipsilateral axillary contrast-enhanced sonography. The test was performed by a single radiologist using an ultrasound system with a broadband 8-12-MHz, 38-mm high-resolution linear transducer. For the target lymph node, we chose a node with a sonographic pattern that was suspicious for malignancy: ie, a longitudinal-to-transverse diameter ratio of less than 2, absence of a central hyperechogenic hilum, or both. In cases with a lack of sonographic signs of malignancy, we evaluated the node with the maximal transverse diameter. Nodes were considered malignant in cases with total absence of contrast enhancement and in those with enhancement alterations. Within 1 week, all patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by a histologic test.Results-The histologic test showed benignity in 22 of 50 sentinel lymph nodes, whereas 28 were metastatic. Among the 22 patients with negative biopsy results, contrast-enhanced sonography showed 18 concordances and 4 false-positives results; among the 28 with positive biopsy results, contrast-enhanced sonography obtained 100% correct characterizations of the axillary status. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 100%, 82%, and 92%, respectively.Conclusions-Contrast-enhanced sonography appears to be a method with high accuracy for characterization of axillary lymph nodes, very close to the reference-standard sentinel lymph node biopsy. This technique seems to have overall high sensitivity.

CP  - 2nd International Water Safety Symposium (IWSS)
CL  - Incheon, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - Shoreline change has been measured with conventional surveying techniques such as Total station, GNSS, EDM etc. These measurements provide short/long term variation of nearshore evolution which enables us to estimate erosional and accretion sediment volume of the beach. This observation of ocean morphology currently has been utilized through the advance of optical imaging system and related digital image analysis. When deployed with proper viewing geometry, ground based digital imaging system can provide higher spatial/temporal resolution of shoreline change than satellite remote sensing data. In this study, we focus on generating time series of shore line change in Songjung beach in Busan, Korea where two DSLR imaging station have been successfully installed nearly at the end of each beach span. Via single photo photogrammetric techniques such as lens calibration, interior/exterior orientation, feature tracking, projection toward water surface, we aim to (1) calibrate out time lapse camera system, (2) verify with conventionally observed shorelines and finally (3) quantify the trend of ocean morphology in target sites. Understanding that shoreline monitoring system compliments existing conventional survey, its pros and cons should be treated as integrated method with conventional method.

TI  - Evaluation of Satellite Retrievals of Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> in the Arabian Gulf
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arabian Gulf is a highly turbid, shallow sedimentary basin whose coastal areas have been classified as optically complex Case II waters (where ocean colour sensors have been proved to be unreliable). Yet, there is no such study assessing the performance and quality of satellite ocean-colour datasets in relation to ground truth data in the Gulf. Here, using a unique set of in situ Chlorophyll-a measurements (Chl-a; an index of phytoplankton biomass), collected from 24 locations in four transects in the central Gulf over six recent research cruises (2015-2016), we evaluated the performance of VIIRS and other merged satellite datasets, for the first time in the region. A highly significant relationship was found (r = 0.795, p < 0.001), though a clear overestimation in satellite-derived Chl-a concentrations is evident. Regardless of this constant overestimation, the remotely sensed Chl-a observations illustrated adequately the seasonal cycles. Due to the optically complex environment, the first optical depth was calculated to be on average 6-10 m depth, and thus the satellite signal is not capturing the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM at similar to 25 m). Overall, the ocean colour sensors' performance was comparable to other Case II waters in other regions, supporting the use of satellite ocean colour in the Gulf. Yet, the development of a regional-tuned algorithm is needed to account for the unique environmental conditions of the Gulf, and ultimately provide a better estimation of surface Chl-a in the region.

TI  - Comparative analysis of selected semi-persistent and emerging pollutants in wild-caught fish and aquaculture associated fish using Bogue (<i>Boops boops</i>) as sentinel species
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The marine environment acts as a sink for diverse anthropogenic pollutants, although the environmental contamination may be non-uniformly distributed. In recent decades, the aquaculture sector has experienced a steady growth postulating as a good alternative for seafood production. However, a social debate exits about the differential level of pollutants in wild and farmed species. This study was designed to evaluate the level of pollutants in a sentinel species: Bogue (Boops boops) associated and non-associated to fish-farm cages. A total of 82 chemical substances were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, including persistent (polychlotobiphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCP5)), semi-persistent (bromodiphenyl ethers (BDEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), and emerging pollutants (such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) and UV-filters). In general, aquaculture-associated bogues showed lower levels of semi-persistent and emerging pollutants than wild-caught fish, especially when sums were considered. Thus, sum of BDEs was significantly lower in the aquaculture group (p = 0.01). A similar trend was also observed for benzo(a)anthracene, the UV-filter 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate and some OPFRs. In the case of persistent pollutants, the sum of dioxin-like PCBs and sum of DDTs were lower in the group of wild-caught bogues (p = 0.034 and p = 0.003, respectively) than in aquaculture-associated bogues, as previously described for some aquaculture species. Fish feed appear as an important factor in the uptake of such substances suggesting a diet intervention to reduce their levels in the aquaculture products. Another interesting result is that for almost all chemical substances analyzed, bogues captured near sewage outfalls showed the highest levels of pollutants, pointing out the need of stringent measures for wastewater treatment units discharging in coastal areas. On the light of these results, further research in specific farmed and wild fish species in relation to their dietary value and pollutant's levels seems to be mandatory.

TI  - Aerosol impacts on radiative and microphysical properties of clouds and precipitation formation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Through modifying the number concentration and size of cloud droplets, aerosols have intricate impacts on radiative and microphysical properties of clouds, which together influence precipitation processes. Aerosol-cloud interactions for a mid-latitude convective cloud system are investigated using a two-moment aerosol-aware bulk microphysical scheme implemented into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Three sensitivity experiments with initial identical dynamic and thermodynamic conditions, but different cloud-nucleating aerosol concentrations were conducted. Increased aerosol number concentration has resulted in more numerous cloud droplets of overall smaller sizes, through which the optical properties of clouds have been changed. While the shortwave cloud forcing is significantly increased in more polluted experiments, changes in the aerosol number concentration have negligible impacts on the longwave cloud forcing. For the first time, it is found that polluted clouds have higher cloud base heights, the feature that is caused by more surface cooling due to a higher shortwave cloud forcing, as well as a drier boundary layer in the polluted experiment compared to the clean. The polluted experiment was also associated with a higher liquid water content (LWC), caused by an increase in the number of condensation of water vapor due to higher concentration of hygroscopic aerosols acting as condensation nuclei. The domain-averaged accumulated precipitation is little changed under both polluted and clean atmosphere. Nevertheless, changes in the rate of precipitation are identified, such that under polluted atmosphere light rain is reduced, while both moderate and heavy rain are intensified, confirming the fact that if an ample influx of water vapor exists, an increment of hygroscopic aerosols can increase the amount of precipitation.

TI  - Elevation Change and Improved Velocity Retrieval Using Orthorectified Optical Satellite Data from Different Orbits
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical satellite products are available at different processing levels. Of these products, terrain corrected (i.e., orthorectified) products are the ones mostly used for glacier displacement estimation. For terrain correction, a digital elevation model (DEM) is used that typically stems from various data sources with variable qualities, from dispersed time instances, or with different spatial resolutions. Consequently, terrain representation used for orthorectifying satellite images is often in disagreement with reality at image acquisition. Normally, the lateral orthoprojection offsets resulting from vertical DEM errors are taken into account in the geolocation error budget of the corrected images, or may even be neglected. The largest offsets of this type are often found over glaciers, as these may show strong elevation changes over time and thus large elevation errors in the reference DEM with respect to image acquisition. The detection and correction of such orthorectification offsets is further complicated by ice flow which adds a second offset component to the displacement vectors between orthorectified data. Vice versa, measurement of glacier flow is complicated by the inherent superposition of ice movement vectors and orthorectification offset vectors. In this study, we try to estimate these orthorectification offsets in the presence of terrain movement and translate them to elevation biases in the reference surface. We demonstrate our method using three different sites which include very dynamic glaciers. For the Oriental Glacier, an outlet of the Southern Patagonian icefield, Landsat 7 and 8 data from different orbits enabled the identification of trends related to elevation change. For the Aletsch Glacier, Swiss Alps, we assess the terrain offsets of both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A: a superior DEM appears to be used for Landsat in comparison to Sentinel-2, however a systematic bias is observed in the snow covered areas. Lastly, we demonstrate our methodology in a pipeline structure; displacement estimates for the Helheim-glacier, in Greenland, are mapped and corrected for orthorectification offsets between data from different orbits, which enables a twice as dense a temporal resolution of velocity data, as compared to the standard method of measuring velocities from repeat-orbit data only. In addition, we introduce and implement a novel matching method which uses image triplets. By formulating the three image displacements as a convolution, a geometric constraint can be exploited. Such a constraint enhances the reliability of the displacement estimations. Furthermore the implementation is simple and computationally swift.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A groundwater prospect map was developed for the Akoko-Edo Local Government Area in Edo State in Nigeria using topographic, geological and soil maps for the area and remote sensing imagery. LandSat-OLI image were subjected to haze reduction and preprocessing algorithms, respectively. Reclassified raster layers of lineaments density, lithology, slope steepness, drainage density, geomorphology, topographic wetness index, land use/land cover and soil were generated from the acquired datasets. All these themes and their individual features were then assigned weights according to their relative importance in groundwater occurrence and the corresponding normalized weights were obtained based on the Saaty's Analytical Hierarchical Process. These parameters were then combined using weighted overlay tool in ArcGIS 10.3 to produce groundwater potential map of the study area. The results showed that 0.02% of the area is likely to have poor prospects of finding a suitable groundwater resource, 24% of the area is likely to have fair prospects, 64% of the area is likely to have moderate prospects and 12% of the area is likely to have good prospects. The study concludes that geomatics application can play an important role with geophysical survey in groundwater exploration.

TI  - Dissecting common and divergent molecular pathways elicited by CdSe/ZnS quantum dots in freshwater and marine sentinel invertebrates
T2  - NANOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water ecosystems represent main targets of unintentional contamination of nanomaterials, due to industrial waste or other anthropogenic activities. Nanoparticle insult to living organisms may occur in a sequential way, first by chemical interactions of the material with the target membrane, then by progressive internalisation and interaction with cellular structures and organelles. These events trigger a signal transduction, through which cells modulate molecular pathway in order to respond and survive to the external elicitation. Therefore, the analysis of the global changes of the molecular machinery, possibly induced in an organism upon exposure to a given nanomaterial, may provide unique clues for proper and exhaustive risk assessment. Here, we tested the impact of core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs coated by a positively charged polymer on two aquatic species, the polyp Hydra vulgaris and the coral S. pistillata, representative of freshwater and sea habitats, respectively. By using reliable approaches based on animal behaviour and physiology together with a whole transcriptomic profiling, we determined several toxicity endpoints. Despite the difference in the efficiency of uptake, both species were severely affected by QD treatment, resulting in dramatic morphological damages and tissue bleaching. Global transcriptional changes were also detected in both organisms, but presenting different temporal dynamics, suggesting both common and divergent functional responses in the two sentinel organisms. Due to the striking conservation of structure and genomic organisation among animals throughout evolution, our expression profiling offers new clues to identify novel molecular markers and pathways for comparative transcriptomics of nanotoxicity.

TI  - DISCRIMINATING SEDIMENT AND CLEAR WATER OVER CAOSTAL WATER USING GD TECHNIQUE
T2  - Ekologia (Bratislava)
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently two algorithms are being used routinely by the MODIS Atmosphere and Ocean Team in order to distinguish sediment influence and clear water pixels over turbid water area. These two algorithms require complicated computational analyses. In this paper, a simple algorithm based on empirical technique to detect the sediment-influenced pixels over coastal waters is proposed as an alternative to these two algorithms. This study used apparent reflectance acquired from MODIS 1,113 product. This algorithm is based on the gradient difference of the line connecting the 0.47-and 1.24-mu m channels and 0.47-and 0.66-mu m channels of a log log graph of the apparent reflectance values against MODIS wavelengths. Over clear-water areas (deep blue sea), the 0.47-, 0.66-and 1.24-1.mu m channels fitted very well in line with correlation R > 0.99. Over turbid waters, a substantial increase of 0.661.mu m in the reflectance leads to a low correlation value. By computing the difference between the gradient of the line connecting 0.47- and 0.66 mu m and the gradient of the line connecting 0.47- and 1.24 mu m, the threshold to discriminate turbid and shallow coastal waters from clear-water pixels can be obtained. If the gradient difference is greater than 0, the pixels were then marked as sediment-influenced pixels. This proposed algorithm works well for MODIS Terra and Aqua sensor. The comparison of this algorithm with an established algorithm also showed a good agreement.

TI  - Annual Gross Primary Production from Vegetation Indices: A Theoretically Sound Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A linear relationship between the annual gross primary production (GPP) and a PAR-weighted vegetation index is theoretically derived from the Monteith equation. A semi-empirical model is then proposed to estimate the annual GPP from commonly available vegetation indices images and a representative PAR, which does not require actual meteorological data. A cross validation procedure is used to calibrate and validate the model predictions against reference data. As the calibration/validation process depends on the reference GPP product, the higher the quality of the reference GPP, the better the performance of the semi-empirical model. The annual GPP has been estimated at 1-km scale from MODIS NDVI and EVI images for eight years. Two reference data sets have been used: an optimized GPP product for the study area previously obtained and the MOD17A3 product. Different statistics show a good agreement between the estimates and the reference GPP data, with correlation coefficient around 0.9 and relative RMSE around 20%. The annual GPP is overestimated in semiarid areas and slightly underestimated in dense forest areas. With the above limitations, the model provides an excellent compromise between simplicity and accuracy for the calculation of long time series of annual GPP.

TI  - Estimation of influenza-attributable medically attended acute respiratory illness by influenza type/subtype and age, Germany, 2001/02-2014/15
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The total burden of influenza in primary care is difficult to assess. The case definition of medically attended "acute respiratory infection" (MAARI) in the German physician sentinel is sensitive; however, it requires modelling techniques to derive estimates of disease attributable to influenza. We aimed to examine the impact of type/subtype and age.Methods: Data on MAARI and virological results of respiratory samples (virological sentinel) were available from 2001/02 until 2014/15. We constructed a generalized additive regression model for the periodic baseline and the secular trend. The weekly number of influenza-positive samples represented influenza activity. In a second step, we distributed the estimated influenza-attributable MAARI (iMAARI) according to the distribution of types/subtypes in the virological sentinel.Results: Season-specific iMAARI ranged from 0.7% to 8.9% of the population. Seasons with the strongest impact were dominated by A(H3), and iMAARI attack rate of the pandemic 2009 (A(H1)pdm09) was 4.9%. Regularly the two child age groups (0-4 and 5-14 years old) had the highest iMAARI attack rates reaching frequently levels up to 15%-20%. Influenza B affected the age group of 5- to 14-year-old children substantially more than any other age group. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated both comparability and stability of the model.Conclusion: We constructed a model that is well suited to estimate the substantial impact of influenza on the primary care sector. A(H3) causes overall the greatest number of iMAARI, and influenza B has the greatest impact on school-age children. The model may incorporate time series of other pathogens as they become available.

TI  - Monitoring the On-Orbit Calibration of Terra MODIS Reflective Solar Bands Using Simultaneous Terra MISR Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On December 18, 2015, the Terra spacecraft completed 16 years of successful operation in space. Terra has five instruments designed to facilitate scientific measurements of the earth's land, ocean, and atmosphere. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) instruments provide information for the temporal studies of the globe. After providing over 16 years of complementary measurements, a synergistic use of the measurements obtained from these sensors is beneficial for various science products. The 20 reflective solar bands (RSBs) of MODIS are calibrated using a combination of solar diffuser and lunar measurements, supplemented by measurements from pseudoinvariant desert sites. MODIS views the on-board calibrators and the earth via a two-sided scan mirror at three spatial resolutions: 250 m using 40 detectors in bands 1 and 2, 500 m using 20 detectors in bands 3 and 4, and 1000 m using 10 detectors in bands 8-19 and 26. Simultaneous measurements of the earth's surface are acquired in a push-broom fashion by MISR at nine view angles spreading out in the forward and backward directions along the flight path. While the swath width for MISR acquisitions is 360 km, MODIS scans a wider swath of 2330 km via its two-sided scan mirror. The reflectance of the MODIS scan mirror has an angle dependence characterized by the response versus scan angle (RVS). Its on-orbit change is derived using the gain from a combination of on-board and earth-view measurements. The on-orbit RVS for MODIS has experienced a significant change, especially for the short-wavelength bands. The on-orbit RVS change for the short-wavelength bands (bands 3, 8, and 9) at nadir is observed to be greater than 10% over the mission lifetime. Due to absence of a scanning mechanism, MISR can serve as an effective tool to evaluate and monitor the on-orbit performance of the MODIS RVS. Furthermore, it can also monitor the detector and scan-mirror differences for the MODIS bands using simultaneous measurements from earth-scene targets, e.g., North Atlantic Ocean and North African desert. Simultaneous measurements provide the benefit of minimizing the impact of earth-scene features while comparing the radiometric performance using vicarious techniques. Long-term observations of both instruments using select ground targets also provide an evaluation of the long-term calibration stability. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the use of MISR to monitor and enhance the on-orbit calibration of the MODIS RSB. The radiometric calibration requirements for the MODIS RSB are +/- 2% in reflectance and +/- 5% in radiance at typical radiance levels within +/- 45 degrees of nadir. The results show that the long-term changes in the MODIS reflectance at nadir frames are generally within 1%. The MODIS level 1B calibrated products, generated after correcting for the on-orbit changes in the gain and RVS, do not have any correction for changes in the instrument's polarization sensitivity. The mirror-side-dependent polarization sensitivity exhibits an on-orbit change, primarily in the blue bands, that manifests in noticeable mirror side differences in the MODIS calibrated products. The mirror side differences for other RSB are observed to be less than 1%, therefore demonstrating an excellent on-orbit performance. The detector differences in the blue bands of MODIS exhibit divergence in recent years beyond 1%, and a calibration algorithm improvement has been identified to mitigate this effect.Short-term variations in the recent year caused by the forward updates were identified in bands 1 and 2 and are planned to be corrected in the next reprocess.

TI  - HEMORRHAGE AFTER MAJOR PANCREATIC RESECTION: INCIDENCE, RISK FACTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OUTCOME
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims: Hemorrhage is a rare but dreaded complication after pancreatic surgery. The aim of this study was to examine the incidence, risk factors, management, and outcome of postpancreatectomy hemorrhage in a tertiary care center.Materials and Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 500 consecutive patients undergoing major pancreatic resections at our institution. Postpancreatectomy hemorrhage was defined according to the International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery criteria.Results: A total of 68 patients (13.6%) developed postpancreatectomy hemorrhage. Thirty-four patients (6.8%) had a type A, 15 patients (3.0%) had a type B, and the remaining 19 patients (3.8%) had a type C bleed. Postoperative pancreatic fistula Grades B and C and bile leakage were significantly associated with severe postpancreatectomy hemorrhage on multivariable logistic regression. For patients with postpancreatectomy hemorrhage Grade C, the onset of bleeding was in median 13 days after the index operation, ranging from 1 to 85 days. Twelve patients (63.2%) had sentinel bleeds. Surgery lead to definitive hemostatic control in six of eight patients (75.0%). Angiography was able to localize the bleeding source in 8/10 (80.0%) cases. The success rate of angiographic hemostasis was 8/8. (100.0%). The mortality rate among patients with postpancreatectomy hemorrhage Grade C was 2/19 (10.5%), and both fatalities occurred late as a consequence of eroded vessels in association with pancreaticogastrostomy.Conclusion: Delayed hemorrhage is a serious complication after major pancreatic surgery. Sentinel bleed is an early warning sign. Postoperative pancreatic fistula and bile leakage are important risk factors for severe postpancreatectomy hemorrhage.

TI  - Constraints on the Progenitor of SN 2016gkg from Its Shock-cooling Light Curve
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - SN 2016gkg is a nearby SN IIb discovered shortly after explosion. Like several other Type. IIb events with early-time data, SN 2016gkg displays a double-peaked light curve, with the first peak associated with the cooling of a low-mass extended progenitor envelope. We present unprecedented intranight-cadence multi-band photometric coverage of the first light curve peak of SN 2016gkg obtained from the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope network, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, the Swift satellite, and various amateur-operated telescopes. Fitting these data to analytical shock-cooling models gives a progenitor radius of similar to 40-150 R. with similar to 2- 40. x. 10(-2) M circle dot of material in the extended envelope (depending on the model and the assumed hostgalaxy extinction). Our radius estimates are broadly consistent with values derived independently (in other works) from HST imaging of the progenitor star. However, the shock-cooling model radii are on the lower end of the values indicated by pre-explosion imaging. Hydrodynamical simulations could refine the progenitor parameters deduced from the shock-cooling emission and test the analytical models.

TI  - Identification of Dyslipidemic Patients Attending Primary Care Clinics Using Electronic Medical Record (EMR) Data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) Database
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to define the optimal algorithm to identify patients with dyslipidemia using electronic medical records (EMRs). EMRs of patients attending primary care clinics in St. John ' s, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada during 2009-2010, were studied to determine the best algorithm for identification of dyslipidemia. Six algorithms containing three components, dyslipidemia ICD coding, lipid lowering medication use, and abnormal laboratory lipid levels, were tested against a gold standard, defined as the existence of any of the three criteria. Linear discriminate analysis, and bootstrapping were performed following sensitivity/specificity testing and receiver ' s operating curve analysis. Two validating datasets, NL records of 2011-2014, and Canada-wide records of 20102012, were used to replicate the results. Relative to the gold standard, combining laboratory data together with lipid lowering medication consumption yielded the highest sensitivity (99.6%), NPV (98.1%), Kappa agreement (0.98), and area under the curve (AUC, 0.998). The linear discriminant analysis for this combination resulted in an error rate of 0.15 and an Eigenvalue of 1.99, and the bootstrapping led to AUC: 0.998, 95% confidence interval: 0.997-0.999, Kappa: 0.99. This algorithm in the first validating dataset yielded a sensitivity of 97%, Negative Predictive Value (NPV) = 83%, Kappa = 0.88, and AUC = 0.98. These figures for the second validating data set were 98%, 93%, 0.95, and 0.99, respectively. Combining laboratory data with lipid lowering medication consumption within the EMRis the best algorithm for detecting dyslipidemia. These results can generate standardized information systems for dyslipidemia and other chronic disease investigations using EMRs.

TI  - Toward Automated Land Cover Classification in Landsat Images Using Spectral Slopes at Different Bands
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For last two decades, various techniques have been advanced for classification of satellite imageries. A vast majority of them are supervised/semisupervised requiring manual selection of samples for each class. Some of the unsupervised approaches are based on hard thresholds and particular to image acquisition modules. In this study, we propose a spectral-slope-based classification technique and subsequently summarize the changes in temporal image sets. Using the properties of spectral slopes, we propose a set of rules for selection of training samples from Landsat imageries for classifying the land cover. The images are initially classified into three classes: water, vegetation, and vegetation-void. Further, vegetation and vegetation-void regions are classified into proper vegetation and dry cropland, and urban land and bare land, respectively. The initial classification is performed by support vector machines, and the second-level classification is performed through k-means clustering and subsequent labeling of clusters to subclasses. Considering temporal images of the same scene, postclassification change summarization is carried out to quantize the land variations, both qualitatively (type of change) and quantitatively (volume of change). The approach has been used in the analysis of images acquired by different sensors operating under similar wavelength ranges.

TI  - Impacts of changing climate and snow cover on the flow regime of Jhelum River, Western Himalayas
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the change in climate variables and snow cover dynamics and their impact on the hydrological regime of the Jhelum River basin in Western Himalayas. This study utilized daily streamflow records from Mangla dam, spanning a time period of 19 years (1995-2013), along with precipitation and temperature data over 52 years (1961-2013) from 12 different climate stations in the catchment. Additionally, moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing product MOD10A2 was utilized to analyze the change in snow cover dynamics during 2000-2013. The Pearson and Kendall rank correlation tests were used to scrutinize snow cover trends and correlation between temperature, precipitation, snow cover area (SCA) and streamflows records. Basin-wide trend analysis showed a slightly increasing tendency in temperature (tau = 0.098) and precipitation (tau = 0.094), during the years 1961-2013. The changes in streamflow indicated a positive (r > 0.12) relationship with respect to temperature but variable trends (r = -0.45-0.41) with respect to precipitation during both the winter and monsoon seasons. This indicates that temperature has a significant impact on the hydrological regime of the basin. MODIS data-based investigations suggested an expansion in SCA during 2000-2013. The changes in SCA of highaltitude zones (> 2000 m a.s.l.) depicted a stronger positive correlation with climate variables and streamflow compared with those obtained for low-altitude regions (< 2000 m a.s.l.). Overall, these results signify that highaltitude areas contribute to the streamflow largely in the form of snow-and glacier-melt during the early summer season. The streamflow is then further augmented by monsoon rainfall in the low-elevation regions during late summer.

TI  - Using precipitation, vertical root distribution, and satellite-retrieved vegetation information to parameterize water stress in a Penman-Monteith approach to evapotranspiration modeling under Mediterranean climate
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have shown that global Penman-Monteith equation based (PM-based) models poorly simulate water stress when estimating evapotranspiration (ET) in areas having a Mediterranean climate (AMC). In this study, we propose a novel approach using precipitation, vertical root distribution (VRD), and satellite-retrieved vegetation information to simulate water stress in a PM-based model (RS-WBPM) to address this issue. A multilayer water balance module is employed to simulate the soil water stress factor (SWSF) of multiple soil layers at different depths. The water stress factor (WSF) for surface evapotranspiration is determined by VRD information and SWSF in each layer. Additionally, four older PM-based models (PMOV) are evaluated at 27 flux sites in AMC. Results show that PMOV fails to estimate the magnitude or capture the variation of ET in summer at most sites, whereas RS-WBPM is successful. The daily ET resulting from RS-WBPM incorporating recommended VI (NDVI for shrub and EVI for other biomes) agrees well with observations, with R-2=0.60 (RMSE= 18.72 Wm(-2)) for all 27 sites and R-2=0.62 (RMSE= 18.21 Wm(-2)) for 25 nonagricultural sites. However, combined results from the optimum older PM-based models at specific sites show R-2 values of only 0.50 (RMSE= 20.74 Wm(-2)) for all 27 sites. RS-WBPM is also found to outperform other ET models that also incorporate a soil water balance module. As all inputs of RS-WBPM are globally available, the results from RS-WBPM are encouraging and imply the potential of its implementation on a regional and global scale.

TI  - Predicting root zone soil moisture with soil properties and satellite near-surface moisture data across the conterminous United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based near-surface (0-2cm) soil moisture estimates have global coverage, but do not capture variations of soil moisture in the root zone (up to 100 cm depth) and may be biased with respect to ground-based soil moisture measurements. Here, we present an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) hydrologic data assimilation system that predicts bias in satellite soil moisture data to support the physically based Soil Moisture Analytical Relationship (SMAR) infiltration model, which estimates root zone soil moisture with satellite soil moisture data. The SMAR-EnKF model estimates a regional-scale bias parameter using available in situ data. The regional bias parameter is added to satellite soil moisture retrievals before their use in the SMAR model, and the bias parameter is updated continuously over time with the EnKF algorithm. In this study, the SMAR-EnKF assimilates in situ soil moisture at 43 Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) monitoring locations across the conterminous U.S. Multivariate regression models are developed to estimate SMAR parameters using soil physical properties and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) evapotranspiration data product as covariates. SMAR-EnKF root zone soil moisture predictions are in relatively close agreement with in situ observations when using optimal model parameters, with root mean square errors averaging 0.051 [cm(3) cm(-3)] (standard error, s.e. = 0.005). The average root mean square error associated with a 20-fold cross-validation analysis with permuted SMAR parameter regression models increases moderately (0.082 [cm(3) cm(-3)], s.e. =.0.004). The expected regional-scale satellite correction bias is negative in four out of six ecoregions studied (mean = -0.12 [-], s.e. = 0.002), excluding the Great Plains and Eastern Temperate Forests (0.053 [-1], s.e. = 0.001). With its capability of estimating regional-scale satellite bias, the SMAR-EnKF system can predict root zone soil moisture over broad extents and has applications in drought predictions and other operational hydrologic modeling purposes.

M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity of annual Spanish influenza activity is currently estimated from historical data of the Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System (SISSS) using qualitative indicators from the European Influenza Surveillance Network. However, these indicators are subjective, based on qualitative comparison with historical data of influenza-like illness rates. This pilot study assesses the implementation of Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) intensity levels during the 2014-2015 influenza season within the 17 sentinel networks covered by SISSS, comparing them to historically reported indicators. Intensity levels reported and those obtained with MEM at the epidemic peak of the influenza wave, and at national and regional levels did not show statistical difference (P = 0.74, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), suggesting that the implementation of MEM would have limited disrupting effects on the dynamic of notification within the surveillance system. MEM allows objective influenza surveillance monitoring and standardization of criteria for comparing the intensity of influenza epidemics in regions in Spain. Following this pilot study, MEM has been adopted to harmonize the reporting of intensity levels of influenza activity in Spain, starting in the 2015-2016 season.

TI  - Seeing Christ through Hearing the Apocalypse: An Exploration of John's Use of <i>Ekphrasis</i> in Revelation 1 and 19
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Utilizing rhetorical criticism, this study explores the manner in which Revelation describes two visions of Christ (Rev. 1.12-18; 19.11-16) in order to understand how such descriptions are used in the service of the author's rhetoric. As a rhetorical technique, ekphrasis mediates what a speaker sees to an audience through descriptive words. A successful ekphrasis bridges the distance between the verbal and the visual, causing hearers to see for themselves, and evokes an emotional response (pathos) in the audience. The visions of Rev. 1 and 19 are thus understood as poetic-rhetorical acts, or mimesis: representations of life that point toward reality beyond the particulars, intended to evoke an emotional response. Such characterization of Christ through ekphrasis moves the audience to embrace the text's worldview of a critical distance from Roman imperial ideology and a commitment to Jesus as Lord over against the deceitful powers of empire.

TI  - Is Routine Axillary Imaging Necessary in Clinically Node-Negative Patients Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend axillary imaging prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients who are clinically node negative (cN0) by physical examination. However, the benefit of this approach remains uncertain. The purpose of this study was to determine whether abnormal axillary imaging pre-NAC predicts nodal metastases post-NAC (ypN+) in cN0 patients.cN0 patients undergoing NAC followed by axillary surgery were identified. Rates of ypN+ were compared among patients with abnormal pre-treatment axillary imaging vs. normal or no pre-treatment imaging using Fisher's exact test.From May 2008 to March 2016, 402 eligible cN0 patients were identified. The median age of the patients was 49.5 years, and the median tumor size was 4 cm. Of these patients, 38% were estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-), 30% were HER2+ , and 32% were triple negative. All had pre-NAC mammograms, 40% axillary ultrasound, 83% MRI, and 51% PET. Abnormal nodes on imaging were seen in 208 patients (52%); 128 had pre-NAC node biopsy, and 75 were positive. Overall, 28% of the patients (n = 111) were ypN+ post-NAC. Although the incidence of ypN+ was significantly higher in patients with abnormal nodes on pre-NAC imaging (p = 0.001), 54% did not require axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) post-NAC. Among the patients with normal nodes on pre-NAC imaging, 20% were ypN+ post-NAC.Half of patients with abnormal nodes on pre-NAC imaging did not require ALND post-NAC, while 20% of those with normal pre-NAC nodes had disease post-NAC, indicating that in cN0 patients already selected for NAC, axillary imaging pre-NAC does not predict the need for axillary surgery post-NAC with sufficient accuracy to be clinically useful.

TI  - First mass development of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae)-its surveillance and control in Germany
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus has undergone a dramatic expansion of its range in the last few decades. Since its first detection in 2007 in Germany at the motorway A5 coming from Italy via Switzerland to Germany, it has been continuously introduced by vehicles, most probably from Italy. After a hint from an alert gardener in an allotment garden area in Freiburg, Southwest Germany, in 2015, a surveillance programme was started focusing on the garden area and adjacent areas as well as most of the cemeteries as potential infestation areas. The surveillance programme confirmed a high infestation of the allotment garden. The container index (CI) exceeded almost 30% in August 2015. In lethal gravid Aedes traps (GATs) and BG-Sentinel traps, 4038 adults were caught. It could be proven that the Aedes population is more or less still spatially restricted to the allotment garden area which is adjacent to a train station where trucks from Novara, Italy, arrive loaded on trains. Outside the garden area, only a few breeding sites with developmental stages and adults were found within a radius of approximately 600 m from the highly infested garden area. It is most likely that Ae. albopictus females are constantly introduced as 'blind passengers' to Freiburg via trucks from Italy to Freiburg, Germany. After the first detection of the mass development of Ae. albopictus immediate and comprehensive control measures were initiated to reduce or even eliminate the Aedes population. Citizen awareness, especially of the gardeners, was increased by providing thorough information about the biology and control of Ae. albopictus. Beside environmental management, tablets based on Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) were applied. The success of the control activities by the gardeners is reflected by the data gained during monthly inspection of the garden plots. The number of gardens without any container increased from 17% in July to 22% in August and 35% in September, 2015, resulting in a successful reduction of the Ae. albopictus population. The study underlines the importance of a comprehensive surveillance programme to assess the population density of Ae. albopictus as a basis for integrated control activities.

TI  - Analysis of lineaments within the Wajid Group, SW Saudi Arabia, and their tectonic significance
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Wajid Group is a Cambro-Permian sedimentary succession in southwest Saudi Arabia. This group is a well-known groundwater aquifer in the Wadi Al-Dawasir and Najran areas. The group also represents siliciclastic hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Rub' Al-Khali Basin. TheWajid Group is exposed in an area extending from Wadi Al-Dawasir southward to Najran city. This study aims to map and characterize the lineament traces of the Wajid Group outcrops. Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS satellite images with 30-m resolution, Spot-5 satellite images with 2.5-m resolution and SRTM digital elevation models (DEM) with 30-m resolution were used for lineament trace detection. Those lineament traces supplemented by aero-magnetic lineaments detected from reduced to pole magnetic anomaly map of the studied outcrop. Multi-scale lineament trace maps were generated, and the lineament datasets, including orientation and length, were analyzed statistically. Eight lineament trace trends were identified including NW-SE, NNW-SSE, N-S, NNE-SSW, NE-SW, ENE-WSW, E-W, and WNW-ESE. The northerly, northwesterly, and northeasterly trending lineament traces are predominant. The lineament trace lengths are generally followed the power law distribution. The lineament trace trends were validated through field investigation of the Wajid Group outcrop. The reported outcrop fracture trends are consistent with major lineament trace trends. Lineaments within the Wajid Group outcrop are also consistent with those of the southern portion of the Arabian Shield. The results of this study provide insight into the tectonic origin of the Wajid Group outcrop lineaments, and understanding of the lineaments distribution which can help to predict the fluid flow behavior within the groundwater fractured aquifers or hydrocarbon fractured reservoirs in Rub' AlKhali Basin.

TI  - ASTROPHYSICS AND CREATION: PERCEIVING THE UNIVERSE THROUGH SCIENCE AND PARTICIPATION
T2  - ZYGON
M3  - Article
AB  - I explore how the notion of divine creation could be made understandable in a worldview dominated by empirical science. The crucial question concerns the empirical basis of belief in creation. Astronomical observations have changed our worldview in an exemplary manner. I show by an example from imaginative literature that human beings can perceive stars by means other than astronomical observation. This alternative mode may be described as "participatory perception," in which a human experiences the world not by objectifying separation as in science, but by personal involvement. I relate such perceptions to "embodied cognitive science," a topical interdisciplinary field of research in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. Embodied cognitions initiate processes that can convey personal experiences of the stars. Such cognitions may involve religious apprehensions and give rise to sophisticated values. It is argued that the knowledge available through astrophysics and interpretation of the universe as divine creation represent two different ways of perceiving the same reality and should thus be seen as mutually complementary.

TI  - Global patterns of shallow groundwater temperatures
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Only meters below our feet, shallow aquifers serve as sustainable energy source and provide freshwater storage and ecological habitats. All of these aspects are crucially impacted by the thermal regime of the subsurface. Due to the limited accessibility of aquifers however, temperature measurements are scarce. Most commonly, shallow groundwater temperatures are approximated by adding an offset to annual mean surface air temperatures. Yet, the value of this offset is not well defined, often arbitrarily set, and rarely validated. Here, we propose the usage of satellite-derived land surface temperatures instead of surface air temperatures. 2 548 measurement points in 29 countries are compiled, revealing characteristic trends in the offset between shallow groundwater temperatures and land surface temperatures. Here it is shown that evapotranspiration and snow cover impact on this offset globally, through latent heat flow and insulation. Considering these two processes only, global shallow groundwater temperatures are estimated in a resolution of approximately 1 km x 1 km. When comparing these estimated groundwater temperatures with measured ones a coefficient of determination of 0.95 and a root mean square error of 1.4 K is found.

TI  - Mapping of Vegetation Using Multi-Temporal Downscaled Satellite Images of a Reclaimed Area in Saemangeum, Republic of Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to adapt and evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-temporal downscaled images technique for classifying the typical vegetation types of a reclaimed area. The areas reclaimed from estuarine tidal flats show high spatial heterogeneity in soil salinity conditions. There are three typical vegetation types for which the distribution is restricted by the soil conditions. A halophyte-dominated vegetation is located in a high saline area, grass vegetation is found in a mid- or low saline area, and reed/small-reed vegetation is situated in a low saline area. Multi-temporal satellite images were used to classify the vegetation types. Landsat images were downscaled to take into account spatial heterogeneity using cokriging. A random forest classifier was used for the classification, with downscaled Landsat and RapidEye images. Classification with RapidEye images alone demonstrated a lower level of accuracy than when combined with multi-temporal downscaled images. The results demonstrate the usefulness of a downscaling technique for mapping. This approach can provide a framework which is able to maintain low costs whilst producing richer images for the monitoring of a large and heterogeneous ecosystem.

TI  - Utility of high-frequency ultrasonography in the diagnosis of benign and malignant skin tumors
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY VENEREOLOGY & LEPROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Various benign and malignant tumors may arise from the skin. These may be of epidermal, dermal, subcutaneous or appendageal origin. Skin biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of skin tumors. There is paucity of published data on the role of imaging modalities in diagnosis of skin tumors. High-frequency ultrasonography ( 7- 50 MHz) is a potential non-invasive, objective modality which can be utilized in the diagnosis and localization of skin tumors. It provides valuable information about the tumor characteristics such as size, shape, depth, consistency and vascularity before invasive skin biopsy or surgery is planned. Sentinel lymph nodes in malignant melanoma can be well visualized and studied by this technique. It is also a good modality to detect local recurrence of tumors during post-operative follow up, especially those with a high likelihood of local recurrence or lesions excised with inadequate margins. High-frequency ultrasonography is additive to clinical diagnosis and can be considered a useful non-invasive method to plan the management of various skin tumors and is of prognostic value in some cases.

TI  - Comparison of Passive Microwave-Derived Early Melt Onset Records on Arctic Sea Ice
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two long records of melt onset (MO) on Arctic sea ice from passive microwave brightness temperatures (Tbs) obtained by a series of satellite-borne instruments are compared. The Passive Microwave (PMW) method and Advanced Horizontal Range Algorithm (AHRA) detect the increase in emissivity that occurs when liquid water develops around snow grains at the onset of early melting on sea ice. The timing of MO on Arctic sea ice influences the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the ice-ocean system throughout the melt season by reducing surface albedos in the early spring. This work presents a thorough comparison of these two methods for the time series of MO dates from 1979 through 2012. The methods are first compared using the published data as a baseline comparison of the publically available data products. A second comparison is performed on adjusted MO dates we produced to remove known differences in inter-sensor calibration of Tbs and masking techniques used to develop the original MO date products. These adjustments result in a more consistent set of input Tbs for the algorithms. Tests of significance indicate that the trends in the time series of annual mean MO dates for the PMW and AHRA are statistically different for the majority of the Arctic Ocean including the Laptev, E. Siberian, Chukchi, Beaufort, and central Arctic regions with mean differences as large as 38.3 days in the Barents Sea. Trend agreement improves for our more consistent MO dates for nearly all regions. Mean differences remain large, primarily due to differing sensitivity of in-algorithm thresholds and larger uncertainties in thin-ice regions.

TI  - Lymphatic drainage patterns of oral maxillary tumors: Approachable locations of sentinel lymph nodes mainly at the cervical neck level
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. There is debate if the lymphatic drainage pattern of oral maxillary cancer is to the retropharyngeal lymph nodes or to the cervical lymph nodes. Insight in drainage patterns is important for the indication for neck treatment. The purpose of this study was to identify the lymphatic drainage pattern of oral maxillary cancer via preoperative lymphoscintigraphy.Methods. Eleven consecutive patients with oral maxillary cancer treated in our center between December 1, 2012, and April 22, 2016 were studied. Sentinel lymph nodes identified by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy after injection of Tc-99m-nanocolloid and by intraoperative detection using a gamma-probe, were surgically removed and histopathologically examined.Results. In 10 patients, sentinel lymph nodes were detected and harvested at cervical levels I, II, or III in the neck. In 2 patients, a parapharyngeal sentinel lymph node was detected. One of the harvested sentinel lymph nodes (1/19) was tumor positive.Conclusion. This study suggests the likelihood of 73% of exclusively cervical level I to III sentinel lymph nodes in oral maxillary cancer. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Climatological analysis of aerosol optical properties over East Africa observed from space-borne sensors during 2001-2015
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is aimed at analyzing spatial and temporal characteristics of aerosols retrieved from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) sensors over East Africa (EA). Data spanning for a period of 15 years during 2001-2015 was used to investigate aerosol optical depth (AOD(550)), Angstrom exponent (AE(470_660)) and absorption aerosol Index (AAI) over EA and selected locations within EA. Validation results of MODIS Terra versus the Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD(550) revealed that the former underestimated aerosol loading over the studied regions due to uncertainties in surface reflectance. The annual mean AOD(550), AAI, and AE(470-660) were found to be 0.20 +/- 0.01, 0.81 +/- 0.03, and 1.39 +/- 0.01, respectively with peak values observed during the local dry seasons. The spatial seasonal distributions of mean AOD(550) suggested high (low) values during the local dry (wet) periods. The high AOD values found along the borders of southwest of Uganda were attributed to smoke particles; while higher (lower) values of AE470-660 (AAI) dominated most parts of the study domain. Low AOD (0.1-0.2) centers were located in high-altitude regions with relatively high vegetation cover over western and central parts of Kenya, and central and northern parts of Tanzania. Furthermore, latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in AOD(550) showed a "southern low and northern high" and a "western low and eastern high" profile, respectively during JJA, as other seasons showed heterogeneous variations. Trend analysis revealed a general increase in AOD and AAI and a decrease in AE; while impact factors significantly affected AOD distribution over EA. HYSPLIT back trajectory analyses revealed diverse transport pathways originated from the Arabian Deserts, central Africa, and southwest of Indian Ocean along with locally produced aerosols during different seasons.

TI  - Preclinical uPAR-targeted multimodal imaging of locoregional oral cancer
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Establishing adequate resection margins and lymphatic mapping are crucial for the prognosis of oral cancer patients. Novel targeted imaging modalities are needed, enabling pre- and intraoperative detection of tumour cells, in combination with improved post-surgical examination by the pathologist. The urokinase-receptor (uPAR) is overexpressed in head and neck cancer, where it is associated with tumour progression and metastasis.Material and methods: To determine suitability of uPAR for molecular imaging of oral cancer surgery, human head and neck tumours were sectioned and stained for uPAR to evaluate the expression pattern compared to normal mucosa. Furthermore, metastatic oral squamous carcinoma cell line OSC-19 was used for targeting uPAR in in vivo mouse models. Using anti-uPAR antibody ATN-658, equipped with a multimodal label, the in vivo specificity was investigated and the optimal dose and time-window were evaluated.Results: All human oral cancer tissues expressed uPAR in epithelial and stromal cells. Hybrid ATN-658 clearly visualized tongue tumours in mice using either NIRF or SPECT imaging. Mean fluorescent TBRs over time were 4.3 +/- 0.7 with the specific tracer versus 1.7 +/- 0.1 with a control antibody. A significant difference in TBRs could be seen between 1 nmol (150 mu g) and 0.34 nmol (50 mu g) dose groups (n = 4, p < 0.05). Co-expression between BLI, GFP and the NIR fluorescent signals were seen in the tongue tumour, whereas human cytokeratin staining confirmed presence of malignant cells in the positive cervical lymph nodes.Conclusion: This study shows the applicability of an uPAR specific multimodal tracer in an oral cancer model, combining SPECT with intraoperative guidance.

TI  - Human exposure and sensitivity to globally extreme wildfire events
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme wildfires have substantial economic, social and environmental impacts, but there is uncertainty whether such events are inevitable features of the Earth's fire ecology or a legacy of poor management and planning. We identify 478 extreme wildfire events defined as the daily clusters of fire radiative power from MODIS, within a global 10 x 10 km lattice, between 2002 and 2013, which exceeded the 99.997th percentile of over 23 million cases of the EFRP100 km(-2) in the MODIS record. These events are globally distributed across all flammable biomes, and are strongly associated with extreme fire weather conditions. Extreme wildfire events reported as being economically or socially disastrous (n = 144) were concentrated in suburban areas in flammable-forested biomes of the western United States and southeastern Australia, noting potential biases in reporting and the absence of globally comprehensive data of fire disasters. Climate change projections suggest an increase in days conducive to extreme wildfire events by 20 to 50% in these disaster-prone landscapes, with sharper increases in the subtropical Southern Hemisphere and European Mediterranean Basin.

TI  - NEW RECORDS OF <i>AEDES AEGYPTI</i> IN SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA, 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes aegypti is an important subtropical vector species and is predicted to have a limited year-round distribution in the southern United States. Collection of the species has not been officially verified in Oklahoma since 1940. Adult mosquitoes were collected in 42 sites across 7 different cities in Oklahoma using 3 different mosquito traps between May and September 2016. Between July and September 2016, 88 Ae. aegypti adults were collected at 18 different sites in 4 different cities across southern Oklahoma. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mini light traps baited with CO2 attracted the highest numbers of Ae. aegypti individuals compared to Biogents (BG)-Sentinel((R)) traps baited with Biogents (BG)-lure and octenol and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gravid traps baited with Bermuda grass-infused water. The discovery of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes within urban/exurban areas in Oklahoma is important from an ecological as well as a public health perspective.

TI  - Is remote sensing useful for finding and monitoring urban farms?
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, the need for fresh fruits and vegetables in urban areas grows while the difficulty of bringing these perishable products to these areas also increases. Small-scale agriculture located in urban areas is a highly effective and profitable way to provide these products to communities that are far from extensive commercial agricultural areas. Here we describe how remote sensing can be used with data mining approaches to monitor urban and peri-urban farms within cities in both developed and developing countries. Using very high resolution satellite imagery together with moderate and coarse resolution imagery and information from social media and the web, we analyze the usefulness of different methods to identify farms within urban boundaries in four countries. The analysis shows how a mixed-method approach is necessary in order to identify where urban farming is occurring and to monitor its change through time. Although remote sensing-based vegetation and water indices were useful, without ancillary data they are not effective at remotely mapping the locations of urban farms. However, remote sensing is a good way to monitor vegetation condition in locations where actively managed urban farms are known to exist. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Seroprevalence of Zika Virus in Wild African Green Monkeys and Baboons
T2  - MSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently spread through the Americas and has been associated with a range of health effects, including birth defects in children born to women infected during pregnancy. Although the natural reservoir of ZIKV remains poorly defined, the virus was first identified in a captive "sentinel" macaque monkey in Africa in 1947. However, the virus has not been reported in humans or nonhuman primates (NHPs) in Africa outside Gabon in over a decade. Here, we examine ZIKV infection in 239 wild baboons and African green monkeys from South Africa, the Gambia, Tanzania, and Zambia using combinations of unbiased deep sequencing, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), and an antibody capture assay that we optimized using serum collected from captive macaque monkeys exposed to ZIKV, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus. While we did not find evidence of active ZIKV infection in wild NHPs in Africa, we found variable ZIKV seropositivity of up to 16% in some of the NHP populations sampled. We anticipate that these results and the methodology described within will help in continued efforts to determine the prevalence, natural reservoir, and transmission dynamics of ZIKV in Africa and elsewhere.IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus originally discovered in a captive monkey living in the Zika Forest of Uganda, Africa, in 1947. Recently, an outbreak in South America has shown that ZIKV infection can cause myriad health effects, including birth defects in the children of women infected during pregnancy. Here, we sought to investigate ZIKV infection in wild African primates to better understand its emergence and spread, looking for evidence of active or prior infection. Our results suggest that up to 16% of some populations of nonhuman primate were, at some point, exposed to ZIKV. We anticipate that this study will be useful for future studies that examine the spread of infections from wild animals to humans in general and those studying ZIKV in primates in particular.

TI  - Climate legacy and lag effects on dryland plant communities in the southwestern US
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change effects on vegetation will likely be strong in the southwestern U.S., which is projected to experience large increases in temperature and changes in precipitation. Plant communities in the southwestern U.S. may be particularly vulnerable to climate change as the productivity of many plant species is strongly water-limited. This study examines the relationship between climate and vegetation condition using a time-series of Landsat imagery across grassland, shrubland, and woodland communities on the Colorado Plateau, USA. We improve on poorly understood inter-annual climate-vegetation relationships by exploring how the responses of different plant communities depend on climate legacies (>12 months) and lag behind shorter-term (3-12 month) changes in water availability. Our results show a prolonged drying trend on the Colorado Plateau since the early 1990s that was punctuated in several years by intense droughts. In areas that experienced sustained dry conditions or a drying trend, vegetation greenness (a proxy for production) increased linearly when conditions were interrupted by wetting events. In contrast, in areas that experienced sustained wet conditions or a wetting trend, vegetation greenness was weakly or not related to wetting events, indicating that production may saturate if vegetation experiences sufficient water availability. Shrubland and woodland communities had stronger relationships with climate at long lags (6-12 months) and many maintained greenness under sustained water deficit, whereas grassland communities had stronger relationships at short lags (3-6 months) and lost greenness even in periods of short-term drought. The results of our study show the importance of identifying climate legacies and lags when assessing indicators of ecological drought, which can be used to improve forecasts of which plant communities will be vulnerable under future climate change.

TI  - Integrated monitoring of chemicals and their effects on four sentinel species, <i>Limanda limanda</i>, <i>Platichthys flesus</i>, <i>Nucella lapillus</i> and <i>Mytilus</i> sp., in Seine Bay: A key step towards applying biological effects to monitoring
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The International workshop on Integrated Assessment of CONtaminants impacts on the North sea (ICON) provided a framework to validate the application of chemical and biological assessment thresholds (BACs and EACs) in the Seine Bay in France. Bioassays (oyster larval anomalies, Corophium arenarium toxicity assay and DR Calux) for sediment and biomarkers: ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), DNA strand breaks using the Comet assay, DNA adducts, micronucleus (MN), PAH metabolites, imposex, intersex and fish external pathologies were analysed in four marine sentinel species (Platichthys flesus, Limanda limanda, Mytilus sp. and Nucella lapilus). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and heavy metals were analysed in biota and sediment. Results for sediment and four species in 2008-2009 made it possible to quantify the impact of contaminants using thresholds (Environmental Assessment Criteria/EAC(2008): 70% and EAC(2009): 60%) and effects (EAC(2008): 50% and EAC(2009): 40%) in the Seine estuary. The Seine estuary is ranked among Europe's most highly polluted sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Targeting the Nuclear Cathepsin L CCAAT Displacement Protein/Cut Homeobox Transcription Factor-Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition Pathway in Prostate and Breast Cancer Cells with the Z-FY-CHO Inhibitor
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) promotes tumor migration and invasion by downregulating epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and upregulating mesenchymal markers such as vimentin. Cathepsin L (Cat L) is a cysteine protease that can proteolytically activate CCAAT displacement protein/cut homeobox transcription factor (CUX1). We hypothesized that nuclear Cat L may promote EMT via CUX1 and that this could be antagonized with the Cat L-specific inhibitor Z-FYCHO. Mesenchymal prostate (ARCaP-M and ARCaP-E overexpressing Snail) and breast (MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 overexpressing Snail) cancer cells expressed lower E-cadherin activity, higher Snail, vimentin, and Cat L activity, and a p110/p90 active CUX1 form, compared to epithelial prostate (ARCaP-E and ARCaP-Neo) and breast (MCF-7 and MCF-7 Neo) cancer cells. There was increased binding of CUX1 to Snail and the E-cadherin promoter in mesenchymal cells compared to epithelial prostate and breast cells. Treatment of mesenchymal cells with the Cat L inhibitor Z-FY-CHO led to nuclear-to-cytoplasmic relocalization of Cat L, decreased binding of CUX1 to Snail and the E-cadherin promoter, reversed EMT, and decreased cell migration/invasion. Overall, our novel data suggest that a positive feedback loop between Snail-nuclear Cat L-CUX1 drives EMT, which can be antagonized by Z-FY-CHO. Therefore, Z-FY-CHO may be an important therapeutic tool to antagonize EMT and cancer progression.

TI  - Impacts of Land Cover and Seasonal Variation on Maximum Air Temperature Estimation Using MODIS Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily maximum surface air temperature (Tamax) is a crucial factor for understanding complex land surface processes under rapid climate change. Remote detection of Tamax has widely relied on the empirical relationship between air temperature and land surface temperature (LST), a product derived from remote sensing. However, little is known about how such a relationship is affected by the high heterogeneity in landscapes and dynamics in seasonality. This study aims to advance our understanding of the roles of land cover and seasonal variation in the estimation of Tamax using the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) LST product. We developed statistical models to link Tamax and LST in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China for five major land-cover types (i.e., forest, shrub, water, impervious surface, cropland, and grassland) and two seasons (i.e., growing season and non-growing season). Results show that the performance of modeling the Tamax-LST relationship was highly dependent on land cover and seasonal variation. Estimating Tamax over grasslands and water bodies achieved superior performance; while uncertainties were high over forested lands that contained extensive heterogeneity in species types, plant structure, and topography. We further found that all the land-cover specific models developed for the plant non-growing season outperformed the corresponding models developed for the growing season. Discrepancies in model performance mainly occurred in the vegetated areas (forest, cropland, and shrub), suggesting an important role of plant phenology in defining the statistical relationship between Tamax and LST. For impervious surfaces, the challenge of capturing the high spatial heterogeneity in urban settings using the low-resolution MODIS data made Tamax estimation a difficult task, which was especially true in the growing season.

TI  - Socio-environmental drivers of forest change in rural Uganda
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical deforestation and forest degradation are among the top global threats to biodiversity, carbon storage and rural livelihoods, but the social processes underlying these changes remain difficult to observe across large spatial scales and in data-poor contexts such as tropical Africa. We link longitudinal survey data from agricultural households in rural Uganda to high-resolution satellite data on forest cover change, and use this linked dataset to investigate processes at two scales: tree planting and harvesting at the parcel scale, and deforestation and reforestation at the community scale. This multi-scale analysis reveals that tree planting is more common on parcels with secure tenure, by educated heads and in isolated communities. Deforestation is highest in land-rich, agrarian communities with low population density and high baseline forest cover. These results provide explicit evidence that the social drivers of forest change in Uganda vary across scales, indicating a need for additional multi-scale studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Accounting for Correlated Observation Error in a Dual-Formulation 4D Variational Data Assimilation System
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Appropriate specification of the error statistics for both observational data and short-term forecasts is necessary to produce an optimal analysis. Observation error stems from instrument error, forward model error, and error of representation. All sources of observation error, particularly error of representation, can lead to nonzero correlations. While correlated forecast error has been accounted for since the early days of atmospheric data assimilation, observation error has typically been treated as uncorrelated until relatively recently. Thinning, averaging, and/or inflation of the assigned observation error variance have been employed to compensate for unaccounted error correlations, especially for high-resolution satellite data.In this study, the benefits of accounting for nonzero vertical (interchannel) correlation for both the Advanced Technology Microwave Satellite (ATMS) and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) in the NRL Atmospheric Variational Data Assimilation System-Accelerated Representer (NAVDAS-AR) are assessed. The vertical observation error covariance matrix for the ATMS and IASI instruments was estimated using the Desroziers method. The results suggest lowering the assigned error variance and introducing strong correlations, especially in the moisture-sensitive channels. Strong positive impact on forecast skill (verified against both the ECMWF analyses and high-quality radiosonde data) is shown in both the ATMS and IASI instruments. Additionally, the convergence of the iterative solver in NAVDAS-AR can be improved by small modifications to the observation error covariance matrices, resulting in further reduction in RMS error.

TI  - Exploitation of SAR and Optical Sentinel Data to Detect Rice Crop and Estimate Seasonal Dynamics of Leaf Area Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents and evaluates multitemporal LAI estimates derived from Sentinel-2A data on rice cultivated area identified using time series of Sentinel-1A images over the main European rice districts for the 2016 crop season. This study combines the information conveyed by Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A into a high-resolution LAI retrieval chain. Rice crop was detected using an operational multi-temporal rule-based algorithm, and LAI estimates were obtained by inverting the PROSAIL radiative transfer model with Gaussian process regression. Direct validation was performed with in situ LAI measurements acquired in coordinated field campaigns in three countries (Italy, Spain and Greece). Results showed high consistency between estimates and ground measurements, revealing high correlations (R-2 > 0.93) and good accuracies (RMSE < 0.83, rRMSE(m) < 23.6% and rRMSE(r) < 16.6%) in all cases. Sentinel-2A estimates were compared with Landsat-8 showing high spatial consistency between estimates over the three areas. The possibility to exploit seasonally-updated crop mask exploiting Sentinel-1A data and the temporal consistency between Sentinel-2A and Landsat-7/8 LAI time series demonstrates the feasibility of deriving operationally high spatial-temporal decametric multi-sensor LAI time series useful for crop monitoring.

TI  - Rural settlement changes in compound land use areas: Characteristics and reasons of changes in a mixed mining-rural-settlement area in Shanxi Province, China
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of rural settlements moving and relocation for coal mining and rural settlements expansion for new village construction, the rural settlements have been dramatically changed in the mixed mining rural-settlement area of the Pinglu District of Shuozhou City in northern Shanxi Province of China. There are few studies that assess the characteristics and reasons of rural settlement changes in this compound area. This paper used satellite data and secondary data information on social and economic development in a mixed-method case study to analyze the characteristics and reasons of rural settlement changes in Pinglu District of Shuozhou City in northern Shanxi Province of China over the period 1986-2013. Three significant research findings were: (1) There were notable changes in the distribution of the rural settlements, and the total area of rural settlements increased by 1862.28 ha between 1986 and 2013, with the transformation of cultivated land to rural settlements being the most dominant change in land use. (2) The rural settlements increased with buffer radius increased up to 6-8 km which has become the standard boundary for rural settlement distribution. (3) The influential factors that have been identified for rural settlement changes included avoiding impacts due to coal mining, an urgency to build simple houses for the compensation, the relocation of farmers, the construction of new villages and land reclamation of abandoned rural settlements. These findings are useful for resource-based rural settlement management, providing reasonable compensation and relocation options when acquiring land in mining areas both within and beyond the study area in China.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Wind modulation of upwelling at the shelf-break front off Patagonia: Observational evidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The South-Atlantic Patagonian shelf is the largest chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) hot spot in Southern Ocean color images. While a persistent 1500 km long band of high Chl-a along the shelf-break front (SBF) is indicative of upwelling, the mechanisms that drive it are not entirely known. Along-front wind oscillations can enhance upwelling and provide a nutrient pumping mechanism at shelf-break fronts of western boundary currents. Here we assess wind-induced upwelling at the SBF off Patagonia from daily satellite Chl-a and winds, historical hydrographic observations, cross-shelf Chl-a fluorescence transects from two cruises, and in situ winds and water column structure from a mooring site. Satellite Chl-a composites segregated by along-front wind direction indicate that surface Chl-a is enhanced at the SBF with southerly winds and suppressed with northerly winds. Northerly winds also result in enhanced Chl-a further offshore (similar to 25-50 km). Synoptic transects as well as mean hydrographic sections segregated by along-front winds show isopycnals tilted upward for southerly winds. Spring observations from the mooring also suggest that southerly winds destratify the water column and northerly winds restratify, in agreement with Ekman transport interacting with the front. Moreover, changes in water column temperature lag along-front wind forcing by 2-4 days. Our results suggest that oscillations in along-front winds, on timescales typical of atmospheric storms (2-10 days), can significantly modulate the upwelling and Chl-a concentrations at the SBF off Patagonia, revealing the importance of wind-induced upwelling for shelf-slope exchange at shelf-break fronts of western boundary currents.

TI  - A Satellite Survey of Cloud Cover and Water Vapor in the Southwestern USA and Northern Mexico
T2  - PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud cover and water vapor conditions in the southwestern USA and northern Mexico were surveyed as a preparatory work for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) in situ site testing program. Although the telescope site is already selected, the TMT site testing team decided to make public these results for its usefulness for the community. Using 58 months of meteorological satellite observations between 1993 July and 1999 September, different atmospheric parameters were quantified from data of the 10.7 mu m and of 6.7 mu m windows. In particular, cloud cover and water vapor conditions were identified in preferred areas. As a result of the aerial analysis, 15 sites of existing and potential telescope were selected, compared, and ranked in terms of their observing quality. The clearest sites are located along the spine of the Baja peninsula and into southern California on mountain peaks above the temperature inversion layer. A steep gradient of cloudiness was observed along the coast where coastal cloud and fog are trapped below the inversion layer. Moving from west to east over the continent, a significant increase in cloudiness was observed. The analysis shows that San Pedro Martir, San Gorgonio Mountain and San Jacinto Peak have the largest fraction of clear sky conditions (similar to 74%). The site with the optimal combination of clear skies and low precipitable water vapor is Boundary Peak, Nevada. An approach based in satellite data provided a reliable method for sites comparison.

TI  - Geospatial Techniques for Assessment of Bank Erosion and Accretion in the Marala Alexandria Reach of the River Chenab, Pakistan
T2  - SAINS MALAYSIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are widely used for change detection in rivers caused by erosion and accretion. Digital image processing techniques and GIS analysis capabilities are used for detecting temporal variations of erosion and accretion characteristics between the years 1999 and 2011 in a 40 km long Marala Alexandria reach of River Chenab. Landsat satellite images for the years 1999, 2007 and 2011 were processed to analyze the river channel migration, changes in the river width and the rate of erosion and accretion. Analyses showed that the right bank was under erosion in both time spans, however high rate of deposition is exhibited in middle reaches. The maximum erosion was 1569843 m(2) and 1486160 m(2) along the right bank at a distance of 24-28 km downstream of the Marala barrage in the time span of 1999-2007 and 2007-2011, respectively. Along right bank mainly there is trend of accretion but erosion is much greater between 20 and 28 km reach. Maximum accretion was 5144584 m(2) from 1999-2007 and 2950110 m(2) from 2007-2011 on the right bank downstream of the Marala Barrage. The derived results of channel migration were validated by comparing with SRTM data to assess the accuracy of image classification. Integration of remote sensing data with GIS is efficient and economical technique to assess land losses and channel changes in large rivers.

TI  - Spatial 3D distribution of soil organic carbon under different land use types
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) has been assessed in three dimension (3D) in several studies, but little is known about the combined effects of land use and soil depth on SOC stocks in semi-arid areas. This paper investigates the 3D distribution of SOC to a depth of 1 m in a 4600-ha area in southeastern Iran with different land uses under the irrigated farming (IF), dry farming (DF), orchards (Or), range plants on the Gachsaran formation (RaG), and range plants on a quaternary formation (RaQ). Predictions were made using the artificial neural networks (ANNs), regression trees (RTs), and spline functions with auxiliary covariates derived from a digital elevationmodel (DEM), the Landsat 8 imagery, and land use types. Correlation analysis showed that the main predictors for SOC in the topsoil were covariates derived from the imagery; however, for the lower depths, covariates derived from both the DEM and imagery were important. ANNs showed more efficiency than did RTs in predicting SOC. The results showed that 3D distribution of SOC was significantly affected by land use types. SOC stocks of soils under Or and IF were significantly higher than those under DF, RaG, and RaQ. The SOC below 30 cm accounted for about 59% of the total soil stock. Results showed that depth functions combined with digital soil mapping techniques provide a promising approach to evaluate 3D SOC distribution under different land uses in semi-arid regions and could be used to assess changes in time to determine appropriate management strategies.

TI  - Characterizing fragmentation trends of the Himalayan forests in the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand, India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fragmentation is a major conservation issue, which includes interdependent components of forest loss and changes in their spatial patterns. Over the years, the Himalayan forests have experienced major changes, but data and documentation on patterns and causes of forest fragmentation are limited. In this study, we analyzed temporal changes (1990-2014) of forest loss and fragmentation using Landsat imageries in the Kumaon division of Uttarakhand state, India. To assess mechanisms causing forest fragmentation, we investigated changes in following quantitative parameters describing forest fragmentation: (i) forest area density (P-f), (ii) overall forest connectivity (P-ff), (iii) anthropogenic fragmentation (P-fa), and (iv) natural fragmentation (P-fn). We found that this region is undergoing intensive forest fragmentation, shifting from forest-dominated landscapes to fragmented forests intermixed with agricultural lands and urban settlements. Overall, intact forest patches decreased between 1990 and 2009 (1442 km(2)), followed by a small gain from 2009 to 2014 (260 km(2)). In lower altitudes, anthropogenic activities caused fragmentation; while in higher altitudes, fragmentation can be attributed to natural causes. All districts within the region show a decreasing trend of forest cover area, with the highest rate of forest cover loss for the low-lying district of Udham Singh Nagar and the lowest rate for the high-lying district of Bageshwar. This trend can be associated with increasing population density in low-lying districts than high lying districts. Our results emphasize on delineating spatial trends of forest loss and fragmentation to support the identification of conservation sites. The findings can further help in developing forest policies for maintaining local livelihood options in the Himalayan region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multivariate Preoperative and Intraoperative Predictors of Postmastectomy Radiation Therapy in Patients for Whom Immediate Breast Reconstruction Is Planned
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Postmastectomy radiation therapy often impacts decision-making and outcomes of breast reconstruction. However, plastic surgeons typically have limited information regarding the likelihood of radiation therapy when decisions about immediate breast reconstruction are made. The study objective was to examine whether commonly available information can be used to predict the probability of radiation therapy.Methods: A retrospective review was performed of patients undergoing mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of variables available in greater than 95 percent of patients was performed in relation to predicting radiation therapy.Results: A total of 322 patients were reviewed, of whom 55 (17.1 percent) received radiation therapy, which was indicated for patients having four or more positive axillary lymph nodes in all cases. Multivariate logistic regression identified the intraoperative sentinel lymph node frozen section results (OR, 27.3), tumor size (OR, 1.7), and age (OR, 0.96) as significant predictors. The sentinel lymph node frozen section exhibited negative and positive predictive values for radiation therapy of 95.4 percent and 54.3 percent, respectively. When sentinel lymph node frozen section was combined with tumor size greater than or equal to 2.0 cm, the positive predictive value increased to 80.5 percent.Conclusion: Immediate breast reconstruction patients who have negative intraoperative sentinel lymph node frozen section results have a less than 5 percent chance of radiation therapy, whereas patients with positive intraoperative sentinel lymph node frozen section results and tumor size greater than or equal to 2.0 cm have a greater than 80 percent chance of radiation-therapy.

TI  - Successful Aging Among African American Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes
T2  - JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES B-PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Rowe and Kahn's concept of successful aging remains an important model of well-being; additional research is needed, however, to identify how economically and socially disadvantaged older adults experience well-being, including the role of life events. The findings presented here help address this gap by examining the subjective construction of well-being among urban African American adults (age = 50) with Type 2 diabetes.Method: As part of the National Institute on Aging-funded Subjective Experience of Diabetes among Urban Older Adults study, ethnographers interviewed African American older adults with diabetes (n = 41) using an adaptation of the McGill Illness Narrative Interview. Data were coded using an inductively derived codebook. Codes related to aging, disease prognosis, and "worldview" were thematically analyzed to identify constructions of well-being.Results: Participants evaluate their well-being through comparisons to the past and to the illnesses of friends and family. Diabetes self-care motivates social engagement and care of others. At times, distrust of medical institutions means wellbeing also is established through nonadherence to suggested biomedical treatment.Discussion: Hardship and illness in participants' lives frame their diabetes experience and notions of well-being. Providers need to be aware of the social, economic, and political lenses shaping diabetes self-management and subjective well-being.

TI  - Retrieval of island shallow water depth from the GaoFen-1 multi-spectral imagery
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance to fully exploit the oceanic application potential of the GaoFen-1 data, which is the first domestic high-resolution satellite of Earth observation in China. In this study, a GaoFen-1 multi-spectral image is used to retrieve the island shallow water depth of Jinqing Island in Xisha sea area by adopting the dual-band linear model and log-ratio model, after serials of image processing including image geometric correction, atmospheric correction and sun-glint correction. The accuracy of the two models is evaluated by using actual water depth data. Meanwhile, possible influence factors of retrieval accuracy of island shallow water depth from satellite data are discussed. It is shown that the result from the dual-linear model is obviously better than that from the log-ratio model, and the dual-band linear model is more suitable for the retrieving shallow water depth of Jinqing Island. For water depth less than 20 m, the overall root mean square (RMS) error is 1.8 m with RMS error of 1.14 m within 5 m, which reaches the level of accuracy of water depth inversion by satellite remote sensing.

TI  - Declining riverine sediment input impact on spring phytoplankton bloom off the Yangtze River Estuary from 17-year satellite observation
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Off the Yangtze River Estuary and its adjacent waters (the YRE) are one of the fastest changing regions in the world in terms of the effects of anthropogenic disturbance. Here we address quantitative analysis whether reducing river to sea sediment may cause declining water turbidity then a better light available condition for the algal growth, therefor increasing phytoplankton bloom magnitude in the YRE in the bloom season. An area of high phytoplankton productivity zone is estimated by theoretical and satellite data analysis, which matches well with the spatial distribution of accumulative times of the reported algal bloom events at the decadal time scale. We present 17-year (1998-2014) satellite and hydrological data to reveal an increasing trend in Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) in the spring bloom season (May to June), which has strong correlation with the decreasing in the sediment discharge from the Yangtze river to the East China Sea. Changes in Chl-a and the sediment load are inversely related in terms of both temporal variation and their corresponding magnitudes (R-2=0.38, p=0.008, n=17). Furtherly, this relationship is not sensitivity to one-year time lag analysis. On the other hand, euphotic depth in the bloom period shows no significant change, which reflects a balance between the increasing phytoplankton biomass enhancing water turbidity and declining riverine sediment decreasing turbidity. Finally, a stepwise multiple linear regression is used to determine which of the five relatively independent environmental variables most significantly contribute to the interannual variability of the bloom magnitude. The most significant effect (p=0.00007) is also found in the riverine sediment load. Therefor, our results suggest that anthropogenic derived riverine sediment change has been significantly impacted spring phytoplankton production in the YRE.

TI  - Radar interferometry offers new insights into threats to the Angkor site
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The conservation of World Heritage is critical to the cultural and social sustainability of regions and nations. Risk monitoring and preventive diagnosis of threats to heritage sites in any given ecosystem are a complex and challenging task. Taking advantage of the performance of Earth Observation technologies, we measured the impacts of hitherto imperceptible and poorly understood factors of groundwater and temperature variations on the monuments in the Angkor World Heritage site (400 km(2)). We developed a two-scale synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) approach. We describe spatial-temporal displacements (at millimeter-level accuracy), as measured by high-resolution TerraSAR/TanDEM-X satellite images, to provide a new solution to resolve the current controversy surrounding the potential structural collapse of monuments in Angkor. Multidisciplinary analysis in conjunction with a deterioration kinetics model offers new insights into the causes that trigger the potential decline of Angkor monuments. Our results show that pumping groundwater for residential and touristic establishments did not threaten the sustainability of monuments during 2011 to 2013; however, seasonal variations of the groundwater table and the thermodynamics of stone materials are factors that could trigger and/or aggravate the deterioration of monuments. These factors amplify known impacts of chemical weathering and biological alteration of temple materials. The InSAR solution reported in this study could have implications for monitoring and sustainable conservation of monuments in World Heritage sites elsewhere.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Low-Rise Gable-Roof Building from Single Submeter SAR Images Based on Local Multilevel Segmentation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-rise gable-roof buildings are a typical building type in shantytowns and rural areas of China. They exhibit fractured and complex features in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images with submeter resolution. To automatically detect these buildings with their whole and accurate outlines in a single very high resolution (VHR) SAR image for mapping and monitoring with high accuracy, their dominant features, i.e., two adjacent parallelogram-like roof patches, are radiometrically and geometrically analyzed. Then, a method based on multilevel segmentation and multi-feature fusion is proposed. As the parallelogram-like patches usually exhibit long strip patterns, the building candidates are first located using long edge extraction. Then, a transition region (TR)-based multilevel segmentation with geometric and radiometric constraints is used to extract more accurate edge and roof patch features. Finally, individual buildings are identified based on the primitive combination and the local contrast. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by processing a complex 0.1 m resolution Chinese airborne SAR scene and a TerraSAR-X staring spotlight SAR scene with 0.23 m resolution in azimuth and 1.02 m resolution in range. Building roofs are extracted accurately and a detection rate of similar to 86% is achieved on a complex SAR scene.

TI  - Spatial pattern and differentiation characteristics of urban heat island intensity in Guangzhou City
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Along with the rapid urbanization, the expansion of population and explosion of urban impervious surface, the phenomenon of urban heat island is becoming more and more prominent and influences social and economic development seriously in negative ways. Based on Landsat 8_OLI image data in 2014, a mono-window algorithm was implemented for the retrieval of land surface temperature in Guangzhou. The retrieval temperature, together with GS+/GIS spatial analysis technology, was used for the analysis of the hierarchical characteristics of thermal intensity and its spatial differential characteristics. The results show that the area size of heat island intensity levels completely followed the normal distribution with a fitting degree of R-2 = 0.971 and the dominant pattern effect of V and VI intensity levels. The centers of heat island intensity level were observed in forms of "single center", "single center surrounded by multiple sub-centers", and multiple center", which followed certain orders of succession. The centers of the rank of cold island intensity were also observed in forms of contiguous cold island center, single cold island center and abnormal cold island center with inconspicuous order of succession. The results of the variable function show that the heat island intensity had high spatial predictability, and obvious regional differences as well as probable hierarchical structure. The results of the study may be helpful for the understanding of the effects of urbanization and regional ecological environment, and the promotion of the sustainable development of the city.

TI  - Improving Soil Moisture Estimation with a Dual Ensemble Kalman Smoother by Jointly Assimilating AMSR-E Brightness Temperature and MODIS LST
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainties in model parameters can easily result in systematic differences between model states and observations, which significantly affect the accuracy of soil moisture estimation in data assimilation systems. In this research, a soil moisture assimilation scheme is developed to jointly assimilate AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System) brightness temperature (TB) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Land Surface Temperature (LST) products, which also corrects model bias by simultaneously updating model states and parameters with a dual ensemble Kalman filter (DEnKS). Common Land Model (CoLM) and a Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) are adopted as model and observation operator, respectively. The assimilation experiment was conducted in Naqu on the Tibet Plateau from 31 May to 27 September 2011. The updated soil temperature at surface obtained by assimilating MODIS LST serving as inputs of RTM is to reduce the differences between the simulated and observed TB, then AMSR-E TB is assimilated to update soil moisture and model parameters. Compared with in situ measurements, the accuracy of soil moisture estimation derived from the assimilation experiment has been tremendously improved at a variety of scales. The updated parameters effectively reduce the states bias of CoLM. The results demonstrate the potential of assimilating AMSR-E TB and MODIS LST to improve the estimation of soil moisture and related parameters. Furthermore, this study indicates that the developed scheme is an effective way to retrieve downscaled soil moisture when assimilating the coarse-scale microwave TB.

TI  - Improved modeling of snow and glacier melting by a progressive two-stage calibration strategy with GRACE and multisource data: How snow and glacier meltwater contributes to the runoff of the Upper Brahmaputra River basin?
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow and glacier melting and accumulation are important processes of the hydrological cycle in the cryosphere, e.g., high-mountain areas. Glaciers and snow cover respond to climate change notably over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) as the Earth's Third Pole where complex topography and lack of ground-based observations result in knowledge gaps in hydrological processes and large uncertainties in model output. This study develops a snow and glacier melt model for a distributed hydrological model (Coupled Routing and Excess Storage model, CREST) using the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR) basin in the TP as a case study. Satellite and ground-based precipitation and land surface temperature are jointly used as model forcing. A progressive two-stage calibration strategy is developed to derive model parameters, i.e., (1) snow melting processes (stage I) and (2) glacier melting and runoff generation and routing using multisource data (stage II). Stage-I calibration is performed using the MODIS snow cover area (SCA) product and a blending snow water equivalent (SWE) product combined with partial in situ measurements. Stage-II calibration is based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite-derived total water storage (TWS) changes and streamflow observed at a gauging station of the lower reach of the UBR. Results indicate that the developed two-stage calibration method provides more reliable streamflow, snow (both SCA and SWE), and TWS change simulations against corresponding observations than commonly used methods based on streamflow and/or SCA performance. The simulated TWS time series shows high consistency with GRACE counterparts for the study period 2003-2014, and overestimated melting rates and contributions of glacier meltwater to runoff in previous studies are improved to some degree by the developed model and calibration strategy. Snow and glacier runoff contributed 10.6% and 9.9% to the total runoff, and the depletion rate of glacier mass was approximate to -10 mm/a (approximate to -2.4 Gt/a, Gt/a is gigaton (km(3) of water) per year) over the UBR basin during the study period. This study is valuable in examining the impacts of climate change on hydrological processes of cryospheric regions and providing an improved approach for simulating more reliable hydrological variables over the UBR basin and potentially similar regions globally.

TI  - Melanoma long non-coding RNA signature predicts prognostic survival and directs clinical risk-specific treatments
T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Various studies have demonstrated that the Breslow thickness, tumor ulceration and mitotic index could serve as prognostic markers in patients with cutaneous melanoma. Recently, however, as these clinicopathological biomarkers lack efficient interpretation of endogenous mechanism of melanoma, the emphasis on the prognosis of melanoma has transformed to molecular tumor markers.Objective: This study was designed to identify survival-related long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs), and based on the different expressions of these lncRNAs, clinical risk-specific diagnosis and adjuvant therapy could be employed on melanoma patients, especially patients in the early course of disease or patients with a Breslow thickness no more than 2 mm.Methods: The clinical information and corresponding RNA expression data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset and Gene Expression Omnibus dataset (GSE65904). All samples were categorized into one training dataset and two validation datasets. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was then used to identify survival-related lncRNAs and risk assessment signature was constructed in training dataset. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the utility of this signature in predicting the duration of survival of patients both in the training dataset and two validation datasets. Meanwhile receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to evaluate the predictive effectiveness of this signature in two validation datasets.Results: It was found that the signature was effective while used for risk stratification, and Kaplan-Meier analyses indicated that the duration of survival of patients in high-risk groups were significantly shorter than that of low-risk groups. Moreover, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.711 (95% confidence interval: 0.618-0.804) and 0.698 (95% confidence interval: 0.614-0.782) when this signature was used to predict the patients' duration of survival in two validation datasets respectively, indicating the superior specificity and sensitivity of this signature.Conclusion: We identified a four-IncRNA prognostic signature with the ability of risk stratification for melanoma patients. Risk score acquired from this signature, combining with differential diagnosis and differential adjuvant therapy, could potentially improve the prognosis quality of life for patients, especially patients in the early course of disease or patients with a Breslow thickness no more than 2 mm.

TI  - Differences in the dynamic properties of rain fade between temperate and tropical regions
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the dynamic properties of rain attenuation is important for designing effective attenuation mitigation methods, especially for Ka-band frequencies, which are particularly sensitive to degradation by rain attenuation. In this paper, the fade duration and fade slope are estimated using satellite data from Thailand and Japan, to investigate the characteristics of rain attenuation in tropical and temperate regions, respectively. For the tropical region, data from the Thaicom 2 and 3 satellites are used, and data from a Japanese communication satellite (CS) are used for the temperate area. Due to the different operating frequencies of the Thaicom 2 and 3 and the CS satellites, the scaling formula from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) R P.618-12 is used to standardize the data. The Thaicom satellite frequencies of 12.57 (Thaicom 2) and 12.59 (Thaicom 3) GHz in the Ku-band are scaled up to 19.45 GHz, the operating frequency of the CS satellite. Finally, differences of the fade duration and fade slope property in tropical and temperate areas are found and it is confirmed that the rain attenuation effect in tropical areas is more serious than in temperate areas.

TI  - Preoperative Axillary Lymph Node Evaluation in Breast Cancer <i>Current Issues and Literature Review</i>
T2  - ULTRASOUND QUARTERLY
M3  - Review
AB  - Axillary lymph node (ALN) status is an important prognostic factor for overall breast cancer survival. In current clinical practice, ALN status is evaluated before surgery via multimodal imaging and physical examination. Mammography is typically suboptimal for complete ALN evaluation. Currently, ultrasonography is widely used to evaluate ALN status; nonetheless, results may vary according to operator. Ultrasonography is the primary imaging modality for evaluating ALN status. Other imaging modalities including contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography can play additional roles in axillary nodal staging. The purpose of this article is (1) to review the strengths and weaknesses of current imaging modalities for nodal staging in breast cancer patients and (2) to discuss updated guidelines for ALN management with regard to preoperative ALN imaging.

TI  - Annual Dynamics of Shortwave Radiation as Consequence of Smoothing of Previously Plowed and Harrowed Soils in Poland
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoothing a rough, deeply plowed soil increases its albedo, which determines a lower amount of shortwave radiation absorbed by its surface layer. That surface emits less longwave radiation, leading to a reduction in its temperature, which in turn can affect the climate, influencing the energy transfer between soil, vegetation, and the atmosphere. This paper presents a multistage procedure for estimating the annual dynamics of shortwave radiation reflected from bare soils as a consequence of smoothing the previously plowed and disk-harrowed fields in Poland. This procedure takes into account the spatial diversity of soil units and their properties within bare soil surfaces (extracted from Landsat 8 images), analyzed using digital maps of land use and soils as well as soil datasets stored in soil databases. One minimum and two peaks were found in the annual distribution of the radiation amount reflected from the soils only when smoothing the data. Expressing this reflected radiation as a fraction of the daily energy reaching the studied areas with clear-skies, it was predicted that those spring and summer peaks can reach about 2.2%-2.3% and 1%, respectively, of the incident shortwave radiation for soils that had been plowed and disk harrowed.

TI  - Synergistic Use of Nighttime Satellite Data, Electric Utility Infrastructure, and Ambient Population to Improve Power Outage Detections in Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural and anthropogenic hazards are frequently responsible for disaster events, leading to damaged physical infrastructure, which can result in loss of electrical power for affected locations. Remotely-sensed, nighttime satellite imagery from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) can monitor power outages in disaster-affected areas through the identification of missing city lights. When combined with locally-relevant geospatial information, these observations can be used to estimate power outages, defined as geographic locations requiring manual intervention to restore power. In this study, we produced a power outage product based on Suomi-NPP VIIRS DNB observations to estimate power outages following Hurricane Sandy in 2012. This product, combined with known power outage data and ambient population estimates, was then used to predict power outages in a layered, feedforward neural network model. We believe this is the first attempt to synergistically combine such data sources to quantitatively estimate power outages. The VIIRS DNB power outage product was able to identify initial loss of light following Hurricane Sandy, as well as the gradual restoration of electrical power. The neural network model predicted power outages with reasonable spatial accuracy, achieving Pearson coefficients (r) between 0.48 and 0.58 across all folds. Our results show promise for producing a continental United States (CONUS)- or global-scale power outage monitoring network using satellite imagery and locally-relevant geospatial data.

TI  - Conversion of tundra to exposed peat habitat by snow geese (<i>Chen caerulescens caerulescens</i>) and Ross's geese (<i>C-rossii</i>) in the central Canadian Arctic
T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The region south of Queen Maud Gulf in Canada's central Arctic now annually harbors several million nesting and non-breeding Ross's (Chen rossii) and lesser snow geese (C. caerulescens caerulescens). Here, and in other Arctic and Subarctic areas, abundant goose populations have been demonstrated to have impacted biomass and composition of vegetative communities. We applied the classification scheme that Didiuk and Ferguson (Land cover mapping of Queen Maud Gulf Migratory Bird Sanctuary, Nunavut. Environment Canada, Ottawa, 2005) used on 1986-1992 Landsat Imagery to produce a habitat map for 2011 of the eastern portion of the Queen Maud Gulf Bird Migratory Bird Sanctuary (QMGMBS). We used a Geographic Information System for change detection between 1988 and 2011 and found a > fivefold increase in area of exposed peat habitat from 269 to 1373 km(2) in our 36,370 km(2) study area. About 323 km(2) (24) % of the area classified as exposed peat in 2011 was previously wet sedge meadow, a preferred feeding habitat of geese, and which declined from 2856 to 1488 km(2) (-48 %) in our study area. Combined open water categories declined from 9688 to 7960 km(2) (-18 %), suggesting that some of the reduction in wet sedge meadow could have been caused by drawdown. However, of the 1981 km(2) of open water that was lost between 1988 and 2011, only 142 km(2) (7 %) was classified as exposed peat and 250 km(2) (13 %) as active deposits, while 171 km(2) (9 %) was classified as wet sedge meadow. Of the remaining open water coverage that was lost, 118 km(2) (6 %) was classified as hummock or graminoid tundra, 459 km(2) (23 %) as moss-lichen or lichen-heath tundra, and 764 km(2) (39 %) as low shrub tundra/shrub thicket. Approximately 562 km(2) (41 %) of exposed peat in 2011 was formerly moss-lichen and lichen-heath tundra, upland habitats commonly used by nesting snow geese and Ross's geese. By 2011, the proportion of ground covered by exposed peat habitat surrounding the four largest known colonies of light geese, all in the eastern half of QMGMBS, was strongly linked to the amount of previously vegetated habitat (i.e., potential exposed peat), and was inversely related to distance from colony perimeters. About 50 % of the spatial variance in coverage by exposed peat was explained by nearness to nesting by large concentrations of light geese. While some increase in exposed peat was likely a result of drier conditions in 2011 compared to 1988, spatial patterns of habitat change suggest that much of the increase in exposed peat was likely a result of intensive foraging in wet sedge meadow habitat and nest-building activities in tundra habitats by high densities of snow geese and Ross's geese. Of the 269 km(2) of exposed peat originally identified in 1988, only 55 km(2) of it was still classified as exposed peat in 2011, but detailed ground studies will be required to determine at what rate exposed peat habitats revert back to wet sedge meadow and other vegetated tundra. We recommend comparison of habitat changes in areas with and without large populations of lesser snow geese and Ross's geese to better assess changes caused by geese in relation to any change that may result from changes in hydrology over time.

AB  - The management of breast cancer during pregnancy poses unique challenges and requires a multi-disciplinary approach. In this review, we discuss the treatment of breast cancer in pregnancy and recent updates regarding the safety of surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments, including both oncologic and fetal outcomes. The treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy mirrors that outside of pregnancy, with a few important differences dictated by the balance of maternal versus fetal health. Overall, surgical treatment, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, and/or adjuvant chemotherapy are feasible in most women during pregnancy. Further research to determine the safety of these therapies in pregnancy-associated breast cancer is warranted.

TI  - Trypanosomiasis challenge estimation using the diminazene aceturate (Berenil) index in Zebu in Gabon
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - A longitudinal study was conducted within a cattle ranch in Gabon to determine the diminazene aceturate (Berenil) index (DAI) in a group of Zebu, raised under low tsetse density; this measure providing an assessment of trypanosomiasis risk. The objective was to evaluate the trypanosomiasis pressure thus informing trypanosomiasis control methods and cattle management. Twenty female adult Zebu were monitored for 24 weeks during the dry season. Blood samples were collected on a weekly basis and subjected to parasitological and haematological analysis (n = 480), using the buffy-coat method and the packed cell volume value (PCV), respectively, infected animals were treated with a single intramuscular injection of diminazene aceturate (8 mg/kg). Twenty-nine single infectious events were recorded and a DAI of 1.45 was calculated. Two trypanosome species were identified: Trypanosoma congolense (96.2%) and Trypanosoma vivax (3.8%). The mean PCV value of the infected animals was lower (26.6) compared to non-infected animals (32.0). This study shows that DAI may be a useful tool to assess trypanosomiasis. However, this is a time-consuming method that may be improved by using randomly selected sentinel animals to adapt the chemoprophylactic schemes, hence decreasing the costs and the drug resistance risk.

TI  - Using mixed objects in the training of object-based image classifications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Image classification for thematic mapping is a very common application in remote sensing, which is sometimes realized through object-based image analysis. In these analyses, it is common for some of the objects to be mixed in their class composition and thus violate the commonly made assumption of object purity that is implicit in a conventional object-based image analysis. Mixed objects can be a problem throughout a classification analysis, but are particularly challenging in the training stage as they can result in degraded training statistics and act to reduce mapping accuracy. In this paper the potential of using mixed objects in training object-based image classifications is evaluated. Remotely sensed data were submitted to a series of segmentation analyses from which a range of under- to over-segmented outputs were intentionally produced. Training objects were then selected from the segmentation outputs, resulting in training data sets that varied in terms of size (i.e. number of objects) and proportion of mixed objects. These training data sets were then used with an artificial neural network and a generalized linear model, which can accommodate objects of mixed composition, to produce a series of land cover maps. The use of training statistics estimated based on both pure and mixed objects often increased classification accuracy by around 25% when compared with accuracies obtained from the use of only pure objects in training. So rather than the mixed objects being a problem, they can be an asset in classification and facilitate land cover mapping from remote sensing. It is, therefore, desirable to recognize the nature of the objects and possibly accommodate mixed objects directly in training. The results obtained here may also have implications for the common practice of seeking an optimal segmentation output, and also act to challenge the widespread view that object-based classification is superior to pixel-based classification.

TI  - Social and Economic Ideologies Differentially Predict Prejudice Across the Political Spectrum, but Social Issues Are Most Divisive
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Liberals and conservatives both express prejudice toward ideologically dissimilar others (Brandt et al., 2014). Previous work on ideological prejudice did not take advantage of evidence showing that ideology is multidimensional, with social and economic ideologies representing related but separable belief systems. In 5 studies (total N = 4912), we test 3 competing hypotheses of a multidimensional account of ideological prejudice. The dimension-specific symmetry hypothesis predicts that social and economic ideologies differentially predict prejudice against targets who are perceived to vary on the social and economic political dimensions, respectively. The social primacy hypothesis predicts that such ideological worldview conflict is experienced more strongly along the social than economic dimension. The social-specific asymmetry hypothesis predicts that social conservatives will be more prejudiced than social liberals, with no specific hypotheses for the economic dimension. Using multiple target groups, multiple prejudice measures (e. g., global evaluations, behavior), and multiple social and economic ideology measures (self-placement, issue positions), we found relatively consistent support for the dimension-specific symmetry and social primacy hypotheses, and no support for the social-specific asymmetry hypothesis. These results suggest that worldview conflict and negative intergroup attitudes and behaviors are dimension-specific, but that the social dimension appears to inspire more political conflict than the economic dimension.

TI  - Fast Segmentation and Classification of Very High Resolution Remote Sensing Data Using SLIC Superpixels
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Speed and accuracy are important factors when dealing with time-constraint events for disaster, risk, and crisis-management support. Object-based image analysis can be a time consuming task in extracting information from large images because most of the segmentation algorithms use the pixel-grid for the initial object representation. It would be more natural and efficient to work with perceptually meaningful entities that are derived from pixels using a low-level grouping process (superpixels). Firstly, we tested a new workflow for image segmentation of remote sensing data, starting the multiresolution segmentation (MRS, using ESP2 tool) from the superpixel level and aiming at reducing the amount of time needed to automatically partition relatively large datasets of very high resolution remote sensing data. Secondly, we examined whether a Random Forest classification based on an oversegmentation produced by a Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) superpixel algorithm performs similarly with reference to a traditional object-based classification regarding accuracy. Tests were applied on QuickBird and WorldView-2 data with different extents, scene content complexities, and number of bands to assess how the computational time and classification accuracy are affected by these factors. The proposed segmentation approach is compared with the traditional one, starting the MRS from the pixel level, regarding geometric accuracy of the objects and the computational time. The computational time was reduced in all cases, the biggest improvement being from 5 h 35 min to 13 min, for a WorldView-2 scene with eight bands and an extent of 12.2 million pixels, while the geometric accuracy is kept similar or slightly better. SLIC superpixel-based classification had similar or better overall accuracy values when compared to MRS-based classification, but the results were obtained in a fast manner and avoiding the parameterization of the MRS. These two approaches have the potential to enhance the automation of big remote sensing data analysis and processing, especially when time is an important constraint.

TI  - Scalable Bag of Subpaths Kernel for Learning on Hierarchical Image Representations and Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) framework has gained increasing interest for the last decade. One of its key advantages is the hierarchical representation of an image, where object topological features can be extracted and modeled in the form of structured data. We thus propose to use a structured kernel relying on the concept of bag of subpaths to directly cope with such features. The kernel can be approximated using random Fourier features, allowing it to be applied on a large structure size (the number of objects in the structured data) and large volumes of data (the number of pixels or regions for training). With the so-called scalable bag of subpaths kernel (SBoSK), we also introduce a novel multi-source classification approach performing machine learning directly on a hierarchical image representation built from two images at different resolutions under the GEOBIA framework. Experiments run on an urban classification task show that the proposed approach run on a single image improves the classification overall accuracy in comparison with conventional approaches from 2% to 5% depending on the training set size and that fusing two images allows a supplementary 4% accuracy gain. Additional evaluations on public available large-scale datasets illustrate further the potential of SBoSK, with overall accuracy rates improvement ranging from 1% to 11% depending on the considered setup.

TI  - Extracting of prospective groundwater potential zones using remote sensing data, GIS, and a probabilistic approach in Bojnourd basin, NE of Iran
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Various groundwater potential zones for the assessment of groundwater availability in the Bojnourd basin have been investigated using remote sensing, GIS, and a probabilistic approach. Five independent groundwater factors, including topography, ground slope, stream density, geology units, lineament density, and a groundwater productivity factor, i.e., springs' discharge, were applied. Discharge rates of 226 springs over the area were collected, and the probabilistic model was designed by the discharge rates of springs as the dependent variable. For training the probabilistic model, a ratio of 70/30% of springs' discharge was applied and discharge rates of 151 springs were selected to randomly train the model. The frequency ratio for each factor was calculated, and the groundwater potential zones were extracted by summation of frequency ratio maps. The groundwater potential map was also classified into four classes, viz., "very good" (with a frequency ratio of > 6.75), "good" (5.5FR6.75), "moderate" (4.75FR5.5), and "poor" (FR4.75). Then, the model was verified based on a success-rate curve method which resulted in obtaining an accuracy ratio of 75.77%. Finally, sensitivity analysis was applied by a factor removal method in five steps. Results reveal that topography factor has the biggest effect on the groundwater potential map and removing this factor eventuates in the lowest accuracy of the final map (AUC = 63.73%). The groundwater potential map is fairly affected by removing the lineament density factor with an accuracy of 68.80%. Removing the lineament density factor has the lowest effect on the final map with accuracy of 68.80%.

TI  - Remote sensing training in African conservation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of remote sensing (RS) to assist with conservation planning, implementation and monitoring is well described, and particularly relevant in African areas that are inaccessible due to terrain, finances or politics. We provide an African perspective on remote sensing (RS) training for conservation and ecology over the last decade through investigating (1) recent use of RS in African conservation literature, (2) use of RS in African conservation agencies, (3) RS training by African institutions and (4) RS capacity development by ad hoc events. Africa does not produce most of the research using RS in conservation and ecological studies conducted on Africa, with authors with correspondence addresses in the USA predominating (33% of a bibliometric analysis), although South Africa-based authors constituted 20% (with an increase between 2000 and 2015), Kenya 6% and Tanzania and Ethiopia 4% each. Ideally research should be conducted close to the point of use to ensure relevance and data residence in the country concerned. This is a point for attention, possibly through international funding to increase the capacity of African academic institutions to conduct research using RS to answer conservation questions. Part of this will need to include attention on data and software costs, internet speeds and human capacity. Data costs have been alleviated by free Landsat and MODIS data, and the Copernicus programs, but there is need for higher resolution imagery to be freely available for certain conservation projects. Open Source software may well offer a long-term solution to software costs. This would require that teaching is realigned to employer requirements, which are shifting in many countries and agencies from proprietary software to Open Source due to licensing costs. Low internet connectivity in many areas of Africa might limit the uptake of new data processing options that require connectivity, although over time these tools may become available to more users. However, human capacity is developing. Of the 72 academic institutions surveyed, a number of conservation programs supplied either tailored RS teaching or used 'service modules' to provide RS skills to young graduating conservation professionals, showing a recognition of the importance of RS in conservation in Africa. This study highlights the success of capacity development in Africa, and the increasing use of remote sensing for conservation in Africa.

TI  - Crystalline methamphetamine use and methamphetamine-related harms in Australia
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and AimsConcerns about crystal methamphetamine use and harm have increased in multiple countries. This paper describes how changes in the availability and use of crystal methamphetamine have impacted on methamphetamine-related harms in Australia.Design and MethodsData on methamphetamine use were obtained from population-level surveys, health service data and surveys of drug use among sentinel groups of ecstasy users and people who inject drugs. Data were obtained on seizures, arrests, clandestine laboratory detections, hospital separations, mental health unit admissions, drug telephone helpline calls and drug treatment episodes. Segmented linear regression models were fitted to identify changes in these series using log-transformed data where appropriate.ResultsThe availability of crystal methamphetamine has increased as evidenced by increased laboratory detections, domestic seizures and purity of the seized drug. Population surveys do not report an increase in the number of people who used at least once in the past year. However, more users report using crystal methamphetamine rather than lower-purity powder methamphetamine and more regular use. Indicators of methamphetamine-related harms have increased in parallel with this change. Amphetamine-related helpline calls, drug treatment, arrests and hospital admissions for amphetamine disorders and psychosis all peaked in the mid-2000s, declined for several years and have increased steeply since 2010.Discussion and ConclusionsThe increased availability and use of crystal methamphetamine have been associated with increased regular use and harms. Treatment is required for those experiencing problems and the capacity of health services to provide care needs to be enhanced.[Degenhardt L, Sara G, Connor JP, McKetin R, Roxburgh A, Dobbins T, Farrell M, Burns L, Hall WD.

TI  - Using spectrum differentiation and combination for target detection of minerals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the techniques that have been developed in spectroscopy, derivative analysis is particularly promising for use with remote sensing data. In the first step of this research we apply the derivative spectrum in a real hyperspectral image and introduce a new target detection approach called "DCEM". For this purpose, 1st to 5th orders of derivative spectrum were applied to the DCEM. The outcome of this research has shown that the application of derivative spectrum in target detection is perfectly advisable in a specific derivative order for each target. This order can be introduced as an optimized order or the Best DCEM. The spectrum differentiation eliminates low frequency components of the spectrum. Despite the little information included in those low frequency components of a signal or spectrum, their complete elimination cause an information loss problem. Hence, in the second step of this research an ensemble classifier approach was employed for the combined use of both spectra and the best derivative order. This simultaneous use of the derivative and zero order spectra is introduced as "ECEM". Experiments were conducted via a HyMap hyperspectral airborne image in eastern Iran. The detection results show that both proposed methods significantly outperform CEM in ROC and AUC values. The best performance upgrade in DCEM detection was about 24% for Kaolinite target and about 28% for Alunite target in ECEM. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Detecting modern desert to urban transitions from space in the surroundings of the Giza World Heritage site and Greater Cairo
T2  - JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decades, Greater Cairo, Egypt, is increasing in population and in built-up extension. Some of the new buildings are informal, constructed in absence of government planning processes, and threaten the Heritage Cultural Site of the Giza Pyramids. In addition, the fertile land of the Nile floodplain is being urbanized despite the government's building prohibition since the 1990s. Therefore, constant monitoring of construction activity is crucial in the rapidly changing environment of this area. Here, we present a data fusion approach that overcomes the limitations of single medium resolution sensor approaches, and also identifies areas in transition from desert to urban. We use multi-temporal multi-sensor supervised land use classification and include a new land use class for detecting undefined disturbances. Synthetic aperture radar ( SAR) data is combined with multi-spectral data for creating the land use land cover (LULC) maps using artificial neural networks (ANN). Specifically, ERS SAR data is combined with Landsat 5TM for 1998 and Envisat ASAR IMS with Landsat 7 ETM+ for 2004 and 2010. With this data fusion approach, it is measured an increase of 73% of Greater Cairo built-up extent from 1998 to 2010. Finally, we show the relationship between the aforementioned disturbances and the new built-up areas, detecting 26% of the total new built-up areas constructed from 1998 to 2010 where undefined disturbances were identified in previous land use maps.

TI  - Potential of TerraSAR-X and Sentinel 1 imagery to map deforested areas and derive degradation status in complex rain forests of Ecuador
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the use of TerraSAR-X (X-Band) and Sentinel-1 (C-Band) SAR data for detecting degraded forests and deforestation in the Sumaco Biosphere Reserve, Ecuador. The study area shows a complex topography and permanent cloud cover, which complicates forest monitoring from optical remote sensing. Thresholds of canopy cover for degraded forest were identified by field data. Then a straightforward object-based approach was applied. Statistics on SAR backscatter were estimated from the objects and used as input to a random forest classification to map forest and non-forest areas. Finally, forest degradation was assessed using a moving window procedure applying the earlier identified thresholds on the forest/non-forest map. The SAR data were found adequate to map deforestation (overall accuracy of 81% for forest/non forest maps) but less accurate to fully assess forest degradation. However, multi-temporal SAR data can be useful to construct baseline data of the forest extent. Polarization and interferometric information could enhance the presented results for classifying forest/non forest areas and mapping forest degradation.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Dynamics of Phytoplankton Primary Production in Lake Taihu Derived from MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the long-term variations in primary production in Lake Taihu using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, based on the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM). We firstly test the applicability of VGPM in Lake Taihu by comparing the results between the model-derived and the in situ results, and the results showed that a strong significant correlation (R-2 = 0.753, p < 0.001, n = 63). Then, VGPM was used to map temporal-spatial distributions of primary production in Lake Taihu. The annual mean daily primary production of Lake Taihu from 2003 to 2013 was 1094.06 +/- 720.74 mgCm(-2)d(-1). Long-term primary production maps estimated from the MODIS data demonstrated marked temporal and spatial variations. Spatially, the primary production in bays, especially in Zhushan Bay and Meiliang Bay, was consistently higher than that in the open area of Lake Taihu, which was caused by chlorophyll-a concentrations resulting from high nutrient concentrations. Temporally, the seasonal variation of primary production from 2003 to 2013 was: summer > autumn > spring > winter, with significantly higher primary production found in summer and autumn than in winter (p < 0.005, t-test), primarily caused by seasonal variations in water temperature. On a monthly scale, the primary production exerts a clear character of bimodality, increasing from January to May, decreasing in June or July, and finally reaching its highest value during August or September. Wind is another important factor that could affect the spatial variations of primary production in the large, eutrophic and shallow Lake Taihu.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Change of Lake Water Extent in Wuhan Urban Agglomeration Based on Landsat Images from 1987 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban lakes play an important role in urban development and environmental protection for the Wuhan urban agglomeration. Under the impacts of urbanization and climate change, understanding urban lake-water extent dynamics is significant. However, few studies on the lake-water extent changes for the Wuhan urban agglomeration exist. This research employed 1375 seasonally continuous Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI data scenes to evaluate the lake-water extent changes from 1987 to 2015. The random forest model was used to extract water bodies based on eleven feature variables, including six remote-sensing spectral bands and five spectral indices. An accuracy assessment yielded a mean classification accuracy of 93.11%, with a standard deviation of 2.26%. The calculated results revealed the following: (1) The average maximum lake-water area of the Wuhan urban agglomeration was 2262.17 km(2) from 1987 to 2002, and it decreased to 2020.78 km(2) from 2005 to 2015, with a loss of 241.39 km(2) (10.67%). (2) The lake-water areas of loss of Wuhan, Huanggang, Xianning, and Xiaogan cities, were 114.83 km(2), 44.40 km(2), 45.39 km(2), and 31.18 km(2), respectively, with percentages of loss of 14.30%, 11.83%, 13.16%, and 23.05%, respectively. (3) The lake-water areas in the Wuhan urban agglomeration were 226.29 km(2), 322.71 km(2), 460.35 km(2), 400.79 km(2), 535.51 km(2), and 635.42 km(2) under water inundation frequencies of 5%-10%, 10%-20%, 20%-40%, 40%-60%, 60%-80%, and 80%-100%, respectively. The Wuhan urban agglomeration was approved as the pilot area for national comprehensive reform, for promoting resource-saving and environmentally friendly developments. This study could be used as guidance for lake protection and water resource management.

TI  - Aluminum hydroxide supported on zeolites for fluoride removal fromdrinking water
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Problems of fluorosis are still affecting millions of people around the world including Ethiopia. Hence the need to find sustainable solutions is still worth investigating. In this study, commercial zeolite Y (ZY) and natural stilbite (STI) from Ethiopia are evaluated as support for aluminum hydroxide (AO) and studied for fluoride removal from aqueous solution. The composites (STI-AO) and (ZY-AO) are synthesized at different zeolite to AO ratios by modifying the procedure used for synthesizing AO, reported earlier.RESULTS: The X-ray diffraction profiles show that zeolite structures are stable during modification processes. The Si/Al ratio of composites decreases as the amount of AO is increased due to increase in Al content. The PZC of STI, initially at 2.5, increased to 9.2 in STI-AO. Textural properties of ZY and ZY-AO proved to block certain microporosity by the AO. Optimum conditions to reduce an initial fluoride concentration of 10 mg L-1 to below the WHO guideline value of 1.5 mg L-1 were 2 g L-1 for the 2:1 systems and 4 g L-1 for the 6:1 systems.CONCLUSION: Zeolite-AO composites have very good equilibrium fluoride adsorption capacity compared with most reported materials. Hence thesematerials can be considered alternative adsorbents for the removal of fluoride from drinking water. (C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

TI  - Changing weather and climate in Northern Ghana: comparison of local perceptions with meteorological and land cover data
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Local perspectives on changing weather and climate and analyses of meteorological data represent two different but potentially complementary ways of knowing about the local-scale impacts of global climate change. This paper uses quantitative social survey data from the Kassena and Nankana Districts of Northern Ghana and the best available meteorological records to examine recent changes in weather patterns for this region. The most commonly mentioned changes perceived by respondents include changes in the timing or predictability of rains, and overall drier conditions. Both of these changes are corroborated by precipitation datasets: The onset of the peak rainy season has shifted progressively later over the past decade, by up to a month, and the rainy season has been drier over the past 3-5 years compared to the past 10-35 years, mainly due to lower rainfall during peak months (June and July). Many respondents also said that conditions had become windier, and we find that this perception varies spatially within the districts, but no meteorological data are available for this climate parameter in this region. The common perception that deforestation is responsible for observed changes in weather patterns is partly supported by Landsat imagery indicating a reduction in dense vegetation in recent decades. This comparison highlights some of the potential benefits and challenges involved in giving more voice to community perspectives in the co-production of knowledge on global climate change and its regional impacts.

TI  - Estimating the Potential Benefits of Green Stormwater Infrastructure on Developed Sites Using Hydrologic Model Simulation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This manuscript outlines a novel approach to predicting green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) performance by utilizing continuous simulations with the Environmental Protection Agency's Stormwater Management Model (SWMM). Simulations using continuous rain data were used to estimate the long-term (annual) benefits of implementing bioretention cells (BRCs) at selected sites instead of focusing on their performance during large events (e.g., 10 yr storm) for which these practices were not designed. In addition, the simulations (66 total) provided estimates of potential runoff volume reduction (22%-76% of runoff volume) for comparing BRC implementation on a wide range of soil types (saturated hydraulic conductivity 0.07-18.18 cm/h). This study indicates that soils (Types A, B, and C) with saturated hydraulic conductivity of 0.3 cm/h can result in a minimum of 50% reduction in annual runoff. For soils with hydraulic conductivities of less than 0.3 cm/h, the soil property, effective suction at the wetting front (S-f), was an important indicator of infiltration rate since those soils in the "higher" range of effective suction at the wetting front, resulted in substantially higher infiltration. The models for this work were built and tested based on the geographic information system (GIS) analysis of readily available parcel data (e.g., geographic location, soil, and area) and remote sensing data (e.g., site imperviousness) for Lucas County, Ohio. It was estimated that over 60% of the developed land in Lucas County, OH is suitable for installing bioretention cells, which could significantly (>70%) reduce stormwater runoff from parking lots. This transferable approach can be used to identify preferred sites for installing green stormwater infrastructure, where the hydrologic performance benefits are maximized.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation in reef-scale carbonate storage of large benthic foraminifera: a case study on One Tree Reef
T2  - CORAL REEFS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large benthic foraminifera (LBFs) are a vital component of coral reef carbonate production, often overlooked due to their small size. These super-abundant calcifiers are crucial to reef calcification by generation of lagoon and beach sands. Reef-scale carbonate production by LBFs is not well understood, and seasonal fluctuations in this important process are largely unquantified. The biomass of five LBF species in their algal flat habitat was quantified in the austral winter (July 2013), spring (October 2013), and summer (February 2014) at One Tree Reef. WorldView-2 satellite images were used to characterize and create LBF habitat maps based on ground-referenced photographs of algal cover. Habitat maps and LBF biomass measurements were combined to estimate carbonate storage across the entire reef flat. Total carbonate storage of LBFs on the reef flat ranged from 270 tonnes (winter) to 380 tonnes (summer). Satellite images indicate that the habitat area used by LBFs ranged from 0.6 (winter) to 0.71 km(2) (spring) of a total possible area of 0.96 km(2). LBF biomass was highest in the winter when algal habitat area was lowest, but total carbonate storage was the highest in the summer, when algal habitat area was intermediate. Our data suggest that biomass measurements alone do not capture total abundance of LBF populations (carbonate storage), as the area of available habitat is variable. These results suggest LBF carbonate production studies that measure biomass in discrete locations and single time points fail to capture accurate reef-scale production by not incorporating estimates of the associated algal habitat. Reef-scale measurements in this study can be incorporated into carbonate production models to determine the role of LBFs in sedimentary landforms (lagoons, beaches, etc.). Based on previous models of entire reef metabolism, our estimates indicate that LBFs contribute approximately 3.9-5.4% of reef carbonate budgets, a previously underappreciated carbon sink.

TI  - The FLuorescence EXplorer Mission Concept-ESA's Earth Explorer 8
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In November 2015, the FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) was selected as the eighth Earth Explorer mission of the European Space Agency. The tandem mission concept will provide measurements at a spectral and spatial resolution enabling the retrieval and interpretation of the full chlorophyll fluorescence spectrum emitted by the terrestrial vegetation. This paper provides a mission concept overview of the scientific goals, the key objectives related to fluorescence, and the requirements guaranteeing the fitness for purpose of the resulting scientific data set. We present the mission design at the time of selection, i.e., at the end of project phase Phase A/B1, as developed by two independent industrial consortia. The mission concepts both rely on a single payload Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer, covering the spectral range from 500 to 780 nm. In the oxygen absorption bands, its spectral resolution will be 0.3 nm with a spectral sampling interval of 0.1 nm. The swath width of the spectrometer is 150 km and the spatial resolution will be 300 x 300 m(2). The satellite will fly in tandem with Sentinel-3 providing different and complementary measurements with a temporal collocation of 6 to 15 s. The FLEX launch is scheduled for 2022.

TI  - Investigations on aerosols transport over micro- and macro-scale settings of West Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol content dynamics in a virtual system were investigated. The outcome was extended to monitor the mean concentration diffusion of aerosols in a predefined macro and micro scale. The data set used were wind data set from the automatic weather station; satellite data set from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer aerosol index and multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer; ground data set from Aerosol robotic network. The maximum speed of the macro scale (West Africa) was less than 4.4 m/s. This low speed enables the pollutants to acquire maximum range of about 15 km. The heterogeneous nature of aerosols layer in the West African atmosphere creates strange transport pattern caused by multiple refractivity. It is believed that the multiple refractive concepts inhibit aerosol optical depth data retrieval. It was also discovered that the build-up of the purported strange transport pattern with time has enormous potential to influence higher degrees of climatic change in the long term. Even when the African Easterly Jet drives the aerosols layer at about 10 m/s, the interacting layers of aerosols are compelled to mitigate its speed to about 4.2 m/s (macro scale level) and boost its speed to 30 m/s on the micro scale level. Mean concentration diffusion of aerosols was higher in the micro scale than the macro scale level. The minimum aerosol content dynamics for non-decaying, logarithmic decay and exponential decay particulates dispersion is given as 4, 1.4 and 0 respectively.

TI  - Modelling directional effects on remotely sensed land surface temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a markedly directional variable and its remotely sensed measurement may be strongly affected by viewing and illumination geometries. This study proposes the use of LST products collocated in space and time, but obtained with different viewing angles, to calibrate a simple model capable of characterizing the LST angular variability. The exercise is performed using MODIS (Aqua and Terra) and SEVIRI (Meteosat) LST products, for an area covering Mediterranean Europe and Northern Africa and encompassing the full years of 2011,2012, 2013 and 2014. The approach relies on a kernel model that is composed by an "emissivity kernel" and a "solar kernel", associated to observation angle anisotropy and to shadowing/sunlit effects on the surface, respectively. The spatial distribution of the kernel coefficients is shown to reflect characteristics of the landscape, both in terms of vegetation cover and topography. Model performance is assessed through several comparison exercises over the 4-year period under analysis. Cross-validation results show that the angular correction by the kernel model leads to a decrease of the root mean square difference between SEVIRI and MODIS daytime (night-time) LST products, from the original uncorrected values of 3.5 K (1.5 K) to 2.3 K (1.3 K). Comparison of both MSG and MODIS LST products against in situ daytime measurements gathered over 2 years at a validation site in Evora (Portugal) reveals that the angular correction leads to a decrease in root mean square error from 4.6 K (2.0 K) to 3.8 K (1.9 K) for MODIS (SEVIRI). The kernel model may be a useful tool to quantify the LST uncertainties associated with viewing and illumination angles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improved Wallis Dodging Algorithm for Large-Scale Super-Resolution Reconstruction Remote Sensing Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A sub-block algorithm is usually applied in the super-resolution (SR) reconstruction of images because of limitations in computer memory. However, the sub-block SR images can hardly achieve a seamless image mosaicking because of the uneven distribution of brightness and contrast among these sub-blocks. An effectively improved weighted Wallis dodging algorithm is proposed, aiming at the characteristic that SR reconstructed images are gray images with the same size and overlapping region. This algorithm can achieve consistency of image brightness and contrast. Meanwhile, a weighted adjustment sequence is presented to avoid the spatial propagation and accumulation of errors and the loss of image information caused by excessive computation. A seam line elimination method can share the partial dislocation in the seam line to the entire overlapping region with a smooth transition effect. Subsequently, the improved method is employed to remove the uneven illumination for 900 SR reconstructed images of ZY-3. Then, the overlapping image mosaic method is adopted to accomplish a seamless image mosaic based on the optimal seam line.

TI  - A Generalized Model for Intersensor NDVI Calibration and Its Comparison With Regression Approaches
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has accumulated decades of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. For long-term environmental studies, multisensor NDVI discrepancies should be initially corrected via intersensor NDVI calibration. This paper proposes a generalized model and its simplified form for the calibration by incorporating sensor-,atmosphere-,andobservationalgeometry-related parameters into an analytical function. The models are first validated using the tandem Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Earth Observing One (EO-1) Advanced Land Imager (ALI) NDVIs and then used to evaluate current intercalibration methods. The results show that surface reflectance is the most critical factor for linear intercalibrations followed by water vapor. While other atmospheric parameters as well as solar zenith angle have minor effects on linear intercalibrations. The strong nonlinear relationships between the spectral band adjustment factors and NDVI may explain why quadratic functions are used for NDVI intercalibration. Although quadratic intercalibrations are generally more accurate than linear intercalibrations, they may still perform poorly when water vapor exhibits significant spatial variations. In addition, the uncertainties associated with current NDVI intercalibrations are discussed based on the proposed models. This paper furthers the understanding of multisensor NDVI intercalibration and provides insight into intercalibration of other remote sensing indices.

TI  - The ever increasing diversity of begomoviruses infecting non-cultivated hosts: new species from <i>Sida</i> spp. and <i>Leonurus</i> <i>sibiricus</i>, plus two New World alphasatellites
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Begomoviruses (whitefly-transmitted, single-stranded DNA plant viruses) are among the most damaging pathogens causing epidemics in economically important crops worldwide. Besides cultivated plants, many weed and wild hosts act as virus reservoirs where recombination may occur, resulting in new species. The aim of this study was to further characterise the diversity of begomoviruses infecting two major weed genera, Sida and Leonurus. Total DNA was extracted from samples collected in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Parana and Mato Grosso do Sul during the years 2009-2011. Viral genomes were enriched by rolling circle amplification (RCA), linearised into unit length genomes using various restriction enzymes, cloned and sequenced. A total of 78 clones were obtained: 37 clones from Sida spp. plants and 41 clones from Leonurus sibiricus plants. Sequence analysis indicated the presence of six bipartite begomovirus species and two alphasatellites. In Sida spp. plants we found Sida micrantha mosaic virus (SiMMV), Euphorbia yellow mosaic virus (EuYMV), and three isolates that represent new species, for which the following names are proposed: Sida chlorotic mottle virus (SiCMoV), Sida bright yellow mosaic virus (SiBYMV) and Sida golden yellow spot virus (SiGYSV), an OldWorld-like begomovirus. L. sibiricus plants had a lower diversity of begomoviruses compared to Sida spp., with only Tomato yellow spot virus (ToYSV) and EuYMV (for the first time detected infecting plants of the genus Leonurus) detected. Two satellite DNA molecules were found: Euphorbia yellow mosaic alphasatellite, for the first time detected infecting plants of the genus Sida, and a new alphasatellite associated with ToYSV in L. sibiricus. These results constitute further evidence of the high species diversity of begomoviruses in non-cultivated hosts, particularly Sida spp.

TI  - Outcomes of Sentinel Lymph Node-Positive Breast Cancer Patients Treated with Mastectomy Without Axillary Therapy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Early-stage breast cancer patients with minimal axillary disease identified by sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) have low regional recurrence rates when treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy (XRT) and many avoid a completion axillary lymph node dissection (CLND). As the incidence of total mastectomy (TM) has increased, it has become important to characterize which TM patients with a positive SLN may not benefit from further axillary treatment.An institutional database was utilized to identify patients treated with a TM for invasive breast cancer and who had a positive SLN from 1994 to 2010. Clinicopathologic factors were analyzed. Regional recurrence rate, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) were determined.A total of 525 patients with invasive breast cancer and a positive SLN were treated with TM, including 58 patients who did not have CLND or XRT and 12 patients who did not have CLND but did receive XRT. Median follow-up was 66 months. The incidence of regional recurrence was not significantly different for patients who received no further axillary treatment compared to those who underwent CLND without XRT or those treated with XRT without CLND (10 years rate: 3.8 vs. 1.6 and 0 % respectively). RFS and OS were not significantly different among patients who received no further axillary treatment compared to those who underwent CLND, XRT, or both.In select patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with mastectomy with a positive SLN, CLND may be avoided without adversely affecting recurrence or survival.

TI  - Large-scale anomalies in sea-surface temperature and air-sea fluxes during wind relaxation events off the United States West Coast in summer
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - In summertime along the U.S. West Coast, the winds exhibit a three-stage cycle spanning similar to 12 days. The prevailing upwelling-favorable winds weaken (relax) or reverse off the Pacific Northwest, then reintensify, then weaken off central California. We study the sea-surface temperature (SST) response to these "northern" and "southern" wind relaxations. (1) Satellite data indicate northern wind relaxations result in SST anomalies O(+1 degrees C) extending similar to 2000 km offshore. Surface heat flux reanalyses indicate the warm anomaly is mainly from decreased latent cooling. (2) After the winds reintensify, SST becomes anomalously cold along central and southern California. (3) During the southern wind relaxations, the cold SST anomaly persists but the SST warms with time. This warming is not driven by surface heat flux. The latent cooling is reduced, yet unlike during the northern relaxation, this change is canceled by a decrease in solar radiation due to increased cloudiness. In the region south of Point Conception, reduced southward advection of cold water and increased northward advection of warm water by the coastal countercurrent could explain the warming. Reduced Ekman pumping likely contributes to the warming trend during the southern relaxations, and reduced wind-driven entrainment at the base of the mixed layer likely contributes to the warming during both relaxations. Whether the net surface heat flux is the main driver of SST anomalies during wind relaxation depends on the regional response of clouds. Southern wind relaxations follow episodes of enhanced surface cooling, which may contribute to greater cloudiness during southern than northern wind relaxations.Plain Language Summary In summertime along the United States West Coast, the winds exhibit a 3-stage cycle spanning similar to 12 days. The prevailing southward winds weaken (relax) or reverse off the Pacific Northwest, then reintensify, then weaken off central and southern California. This leads to variability in the strength of wind-driven coastal upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich ocean water that fuels economically important fisheries. In a previous paper, we studied the atmospheric pressure patterns that force that wind event cycle. Here, we use satellite data to study the sea-surface temperature (SST) response to the "northern" and "southern" (Pacific Northwest vs. central California) wind relaxations. We find that 1) the 3-stage wind event cycle creates substantial SST anomalies extending similar to 2000 km offshore, 2) the heat exchange between the atmosphere and ocean during these events is different in the northern vs. southern wind relaxations due to differences in cloud cover, and 3) the wind intensification (stage 2 of the event cycle) preconditions the SST to be cold before the southern relaxations, preventing the expected warm SST anomaly from developing during the subsequent relaxation and possibly contributing to the greater cloud cover observed during southern relaxations, which has implications for human mortality during California heat waves.

TI  - A 30+Year AVHRR Land Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record and Its Application to Wheat Yield Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor provides a unique global remote sensing dataset that ranges from the 1980s to the present. Over the years, several efforts have been made on the calibration of the different instruments to establish a consistent land surface reflectance time-series and to augment the AVHRR data record with data from other sensors, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In this paper, we present a summary of all the corrections applied to the AVHRR surface reflectance and NDVI Version 4 Product, developed in the framework of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Data Record (CDR) program. These corrections result from assessment of the geolocation, improvement of cloud masking, and calibration monitoring. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the surface reflectance over the AERONET sites by a cross-comparison with MODIS, which is an already validated product, and evaluation of a downstream leaf area index (LAI) product. We demonstrate the utility of this long time-series by estimating the winter wheat yield over the USA. The methods developed by Becker-Reshef et al. (2010) and Franch et al. (2015) are applied to both the MODIS and AVHRR data. Comparison of the results from both sensors during the MODIS-era shows the consistency of the dataset with similar errors of 10%. When applying the methods to AVHRR historical data from the 1980s, the results have errors equivalent to those derived from MODIS.

TI  - Phenology-adaptive pixel-based compositing using optical earth observation imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The need for operational monitoring of landscape processes on the national to global scale led to an increased demand for pixel-based composites using complete earth observation (EO) archives. Commonly, composites are generated without explicit consideration of temporal criteria but are rather based on optimizing band indices within a pre-defined temporal window. However, for certain applications phenology-adapted composites that represent the land surface as being in the same phenological stage are required, e.g. tree type discrimination where greening up or senescence dates are modified by terrain elevation. We developed a novel pixel-based compositing technique that dynamically adjusts the selection process to the underlying land surface phenology (LSP) of each pixel. By doing so, phenologically sound composites across large areas can be derived for regular intervals and different phenological points in time, e.g. peak, end or minimum of season. Various day-of-year (DOY) scoring functions were implemented to flexibly define the phenological target. The technique is general enough for global application and can be applied to any kind of gridded EO archive, herein demonstrated for MODIS and Landsat data. Multi-annual composites were successfully generated for Zambia for most seasons. As an exception, we found even very frequent MODIS observations to be insufficient for peak vegetation composites due to interference with the rainy season. The phenology-adaptive composites were compared to static ones, i.e. using a single target DOY. Results clearly indicated that biomass levels differ significantly between the techniques, and a phenological normalization across elevation gradients and land cover classes could be achieved. However, the implications are non-trivial and the characteristics of both methods need to be considered cautiously before deciding which approach is superior with regards to a specific thematic application. The quality of the MODIS and Landsat composites, as well as the performance of the phenology-adaptive and static compositing techniques were assured using a quantitative cross-comparison. A 12-year annual time series demonstrated the feasibility for land cover change and modification mapping. Several change processes were clearly discriminable. The resulting phenologically coherent composites are important to establish national, regional or even global landscape monitoring, reporting and verification systems.

TI  - Calibrating Satellite-Based Indices of Burn Severity from UAV-Derived Metrics of a Burned Boreal Forest in NWT, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are a dominant disturbance to boreal forests, and in North America, they typically cause widespread tree mortality. Forest fire burn severity is often measured at a plot scale using the Composite Burn Index (CBI), which was originally developed as a means of assigning severity levels to the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) computed from Landsat satellite imagery. Our study investigated the potential to map biophysical indicators of burn severity (residual green vegetation and charred organic surface) at very high (3 cm) resolution, using color orthomosaics and vegetation height models derived from UAV-based photographic surveys and Structure from Motion methods. These indicators were scaled to 30 m resolution Landsat pixel footprints and compared to the post-burn NBR (post-NBR) and differenced NBR (dNBR) ratios computed from pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery. The post-NBR showed the strongest relationship to both the fraction of charred surface (exponential R-2 = 0.79) and the fraction of green crown vegetation above 5 m (exponential R-2 = 0.81), while the dNBR was more closely related to the total green vegetation fraction (exponential R-2 = 0.69). Additionally, the UAV green fraction and Landsat indices could individually explain more than 50% of the variance in the overall CBI measured in 39 plots. These results provide a proof-of-concept for using low-cost UAV photogrammetric mapping to quantify key measures of boreal burn severity at landscape scales, which could be used to calibrate and assign a biophysical meaning to Landsat spectral indices for mapping severity at regional scales.

TI  - Magnetic Field Perturbations from Currents in the Dark Polar Regions During Quiet Geomagnetic Conditions
T2  - SPACE SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - In the day-side sunlit polar ionosphere the varying and IMF dependent convection creates strong ionospheric currents even during quiet geomagnetic conditions. Observations during such times are often excluded when using satellite data to model the internal geomagnetic main field. Observations from the night-side or local winter during quiet conditions are, however, also influenced by variations in the IMF. In this paper we briefly review the large scale features of the ionospheric currents in the polar regions with emphasis on the current distribution during undisturbed conditions. We examine the distribution of scalar measurements of the magnetic field intensity minus predictions from a geomagnetic field model. These 'residuals' fall into two main categories. One category is consistently distributed according to the well-known ionospheric plasma convection and its associated Birkeland currents. The other category represent contributions caused by geomagnetic activity related to the substorm current wedge around local magnetic midnight. A new observation is a strong IMF control of the residuals in the midnight sector indicating larger ionospheric currents in the substorm current wedge in the northern polar region for and correspondingly in the southern hemisphere for B-y < 0.

TI  - From remote sensing to a serious game: Digital reconstruction of an abandoned medieval village in Southern Italy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The digital reconstruction of the history of a buried medieval village is the main focus of this paper. The study, based on remote sensing and historical sources, is the starting point of the development of a serious game aimed at educational purposes and exploitation of remote sensing data in the field of edutainment. The selected historical scenario is Yrsum, a village in Basilicata ( South of Italy), founded in the 11th century and abandoned in the 14th century. A LiDAR survey along with satellite multispectral data (suitably elaborated for feature extraction) as well as the historical sources and archaeological records provided useful information on the forma urbis' of the medieval settlement from its foundation to its abandonment. The extraction of the archaeological features and the analysis of urban pattern put in evidence similarities with some medieval settlements based on "motte and bailey" typology that spread in Southern Italy, France and England from the 11th to the 13th century. After the virtual reconstruction, an interactive application articulated both on bi-dimensional and three-dimensional elements have been developed. The major novelty compared to most common video games has been the possibility to derive the game from rigorously scientific data. The player enjoys and learns within a logic of an edutainment game (a combination of education and entertainment), which has become by now a well-established concept but still rarely applied in the field of cultural heritage.

TI  - Scheme of Parameter Estimation for Generalized Gamma Distribution and Its Application to Ship Detection in SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the detection applications of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, a crucial problem is developing precise models for clutter statistics. Generalized gamma distribution (G Gamma D) has been widely applied in many fields of signal processing, and it has been demonstrated to be an appropriate model for describing the statistical behaviors of SAR sea clutter, wherein parameter estimation is a key issue for determining the practical application of G Gamma D. Work that contains three major aspects is performed in this paper. First, an approximate estimator for G Gamma D parameters based on the well-known "method-of-log-cumulants" is derived; a theoretical comparison between the approximate estimator and other known estimators is also presented. Second, based on this estimator, a scheme of parameter estimation is further given by comprehensively considering estimation precision, speed, and applicable conditions. The simulation results show that the presented scheme is fast and effective. Third, we assess the fitting performance of G Gamma D and the proposed scheme using real SAR sea clutter data, and compare the model with generalized-K distribution. The experiments on single-look complex and multilookprocessing L-band ALOS-PALSAR and C-band RADARSAT-2 SAR data verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme of G Gamma D parameter estimation. Moreover, several examples of ship detection in real SAR images testify to the usefulness of the proposed scheme in practical applications.

TI  - AIRS-observed warm core structures of tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific
T2  - DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) temperature profiles during the period 2003-2013 are used to examine the warm core structures and evolution characteristics associated with the formation and development of western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclones (TCs). The warm core with a steady 1.5-K warming in the layer of 500-300 hPa occurs 24h prior to tropical storm formation. Apparent eye warming extends upward to upper troposphere and downward to near surface after tropical storm formation. TC intensity shows a robust positive correlation with the warm core strength and has a weaker but still significant positive correlation with the warm core height (the weaker correlation is primarily attributed to the scattered warm core heights of weak TCs). Future 24-h intensity change of TCs has little correlation with the warm core height while it has a significant negative correlation with the warm core strength. Weak to moderate warm core at 500-200 hPa may be a necessary but not sufficient initial condition for TC rapid intensification. AIRS-observed warm core structures, in combination with other environmental factors, have the potential to improve the prediction of tropical storm formation and rapid intensification of WNP TCs.

TI  - Feasibility, accuracy and prognosis of sentinel lymph node biopsy before neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer. A prospective study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objective: It remains controversial whether sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) should be performed before or after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of SLNB before NAT at a single institution, and to determine its relation to patient prognosis.Methods: A prospective study of T1c-T2-T3 N0 breast cancer patients, after ultrasound examination, who underwent SLNB prior to NAT. Overall, disease-specific and disease-free survival were calculated by KaplaneMeier curves.Results: SLNB before NAT was performed in 123 patients from December 2006 to May 2014. The identification rate was 100%. SLNB was positive in 42.3% of cases (27.6% macrometastases). NAT was chemotherapy in 88.6% of cases and endocrine-therapy in 11.4%. Lymphadenectomy was avoided in 72.4% of cases. Median follow-up was 40 months (range 8-100). Overall and disease-free survival was 90.2% and 88.6% respectively. SLN involvement was not related to patient outcome (p 0.72); however there were significant differences in survival according to molecular-like subtypes (p < 0.025) and NAT response (p < 0.0001).Conclusions: SLNB prior to NAT is an accurate method of axillary staging associated with a high identification rate. It avoided lymphadenectomy in more than 70% of patients. SLN involvement did not worsen the prognosis in our cohort. (C) 2017 IJS Publishing Group Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Field-Scale Spatial Variability of Soil Moisture and L-Band Brightness Temperature from Land Surface Modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although soil moisture is an essential variable within the Earth system and has been extensively investigated, there is still a limited understanding of its spatiotemporal distribution and variability. Thus, the objective of this study is to attempt to reproduce the spatial variability of soil moisture and brightness temperature as measured by point-based and airborne remote sensing measurements. To do so, Environment and Climate Change Canada's Surface Prediction System (SPS) is run at very high resolution (100 m) over a region of Manitoba (Canada) where an extensive soil moisture experiment took place in the summer of 2012 [SMAP Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12)]. Results show that realistic finescale soil texture improves the quality of SPS outputs. Soil moisture spatial average evolution in time is well simulated by SPS. Simulated spatial variability is underestimated when compared to point-based measurements, although results are improved when examined domainwide versus comparisons using grid points corresponding to measurement sites. SPS brightness temperature fields compare well with remote sensing data in terms of spatial variability. It is shown that during drier periods, factors other than soil texture become important with respect to soil moisture spatial variability. However, during periods with plenty of precipitation, soil texture seems essential in improving simulated soil moisture spatial variability at high resolutions. These results support the conclusion that SPS could provide very high-resolution soil moisture products for research and operational purposes if high-resolution soil texture and vegetation products are made available on a larger scale.

TI  - Overlapping Land Claims Limit the Use of Satellites to Monitor <i>No-Deforestation</i> Commitments and <i>No-Burning</i> Compliance
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide many businesses have recently pledged to sourcing agricultural and timber products exclusively from deforestation and fire-free supply chains. Geoinvestigations-monitoring the activities of plantation companies using satellites and concession maps-are now applied to identify which companies breach their commitments and regulations. We investigate the limitations of geoinvestigations by analyzing land-use and fire in and around 163 Indonesian concessions of oil-palm and pulpwood, where recurring forest and peat-land fires are a national and international concern.We reveal a mismatch between de jure and de facto land occupancy inside and outside concessions. Independent farmers are present in concessions while some companies expand outside concessions. Thus, both actors may be responsible for deforestation and fire inside and outside concessions. On peat-land, fire can start outside and spread into concessions, while draining in concessions may promote fire outside. These dynamics make attribution of fire and deforestation in Indonesian concessions impossible without detailed field investigations.This study highlights the need to combine very high-resolution satellite data with extensive field investigations of de facto land ownership, claims and disputes inside and outside concessions. In Indonesia, such activities could fall under the One Map Policy, whose remit is to identify and resolve overlapping land claims.

TI  - Surveillance and comparison of surgical prognosis for asymptomatic and symptomatic non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The treatment of non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NF-PNETs) still remains controversial. It is uncertain whether asymptomatic patients have better prognosis than symptomatic patients and whether surgery is necessary for asymptomatic patients.Methods: Patients with NF-PNETs who were managed surgically or by surveillance between June 2007 and December 2013 were retrospectively studied. The choice of surgery or surveillance was based entirely on the patient's desire. Survival prognosis was compared between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, and evaluated among patients who were under surveillance.Results: Of the 53 patients with NF-PNETs, 48 (90%) were treated surgically. 25 patients (47%) were symptomatic patients, 23 (43%) asymptomatic, and five (10%) detected by surveillance. Among the latter group, one patient suffered from tumor progression and four had stable disease. When compared with symptomatic NF-PNETs, asymptomatic NF-PNETs showed lower pathology grades (P = 0.006), better 3year cumulative progression-free survival and overall survival after surgical treatment. Parenchymapreserving resection was associated with a higher risk of pancreatic fistula (71 vs. 17%, P = 0.007). A positive lymph node status (P = 0.003) and perineural or vascular invasion (P 0.01) were significant predictors of tumor recurrence or metastasis. Patients with grade G3 disease (P = 0.005) or a tumor size > 4 cm (P = 0.019) had poor prognosis.Conclusions: Compared with symptomatic NF-PNETs, asymptomatic NF-PNETs had a lower degree of malignancy and better prognosis. Surveillance for small asymptomatic NF-PNETs needs to be further studied. (C) 2017 IJS Publishing Group Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Joint use of remote sensing data and volunteered geographic information for exposure estimation: evidence from Valparaiso, Chile
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of natural hazards on mankind has increased dramatically over the past decades. Global urbanization processes and increasing spatial concentrations of exposed elements induce natural hazard risk at a uniquely high level. To mitigate affiliated perils requires detailed knowledge about elements at risk. Considering a high spatiotemporal variability of elements at risk, detailed information is costly in terms of both time and economic resources and therefore often incomplete, aggregated, or outdated. To alleviate these restrictions, the availability of very-high-resolution satellite images promotes accurate and detailed analysis of exposure over various spatial scales with large-area coverage. In the past, valuable approaches were proposed; however, the design of information extraction procedures with a high level of automatization remains challenging. In this paper, we uniquely combine remote sensing data and volunteered geographic information from the OpenStreetMap project (OSM) (i.e., freely accessible geospatial information compiled by volunteers) for a highly automated estimation of crucial exposure components (i.e., number of buildings and population) with a high level of spatial detail. To this purpose, we first obtain labeled training segments from the OSM data in conjunction with the satellite imagery. This allows for learning a supervised algorithmic model (i.e., rotation forest) in order to extract relevant thematic classes of land use/land cover (LULC) from the satellite imagery. Extracted information is jointly deployed with information from the OSM data to estimate the number of buildings with regression techniques (i.e., a multi-linear model from ordinary least-square optimization and a nonlinear support vector regression model are considered). Analogously, urban LULC information is used in conjunction with OSM data to spatially disaggregate population information. Experimental results were obtained for the city of Valparaiso in Chile. Thereby, we demonstrate the relevance of the approaches by estimating number of affected buildings and population referring to a historical tsunami event.

TI  - Developing empirical monthly groundwater recharge equations based on modeling and remote sensing data - Modeling future groundwater recharge to predict potential climate change impacts
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater recharge is one of main components of the water budget that is difficult to quantify due to complexity of recharge processes and limited observations. In the present work a simple regression equation for monthly groundwater recharge estimation is developed by relating simulated recharge from a calibrated Soil and Water Assessment tool (SWAT) model to effective precipitation. Monthly groundwater recharge and actual evapotranspiration (AET) were computed by applying a calibrated (SWAT) model for a ten year period (2005-2015) in Vosvozis river basin in NE Greece. SWAT actual evapotranspiration (AET) results were compared to remotely sensed AET values from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), indicating the integrity of the modeling process. Water isotopes of H-2 and O-18, originally presented herein, were used to infer recharge resources in the basin and provided additional evidence of the applicability of the developed formula. Results showed that the developed recharge estimation method can be effectively applied using MODIS evapotranspiration data, without having to adhere to numerical modeling which is many times constrained by the lack of available data especially in poorly gauged basins. Future trends of groundwater recharge up to 2100 using an ensemble of five downscaled climate change projections indicated that annual recharge will increase up to the middle of the present century and gradually decrease thereafter. However, the predicted magnitude is highly variable depending on the Global Climate Model (GCM) used. While winter recharge will likely increase in the future, summer recharge is expected to decrease as a result of temperature rise in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Meningococcal Disease in Children in Argentina A 3-year Active Sentinel Hospital Surveillance Study
T2  - PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Meningococcal disease (MD) is a medical emergency and a serious public health problem. As new meningococcal vaccines become available, MD surveillance is crucial to provide baseline epidemiologic data before implementing preventive measures. We estimated MD incidence and epidemiology in Argentina using hospital-based surveillance.Methods: Three-year prospective active surveillance in patients = 15 years of age was conducted at 6 pediatric hospital sentinel units (March 2012 to February 2015).Results: Of 184,360 hospitalized patients, 1444 (0.78%) had suspected meningitis or MD. Of these, 268 (19%) presented probable acute bacterial meningitis or MD, 168 (63%) were culture positive and 51 (30%) tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis. Of 100 culture-negative cases, 30 had positive meningococcal polymerase chain reaction. Thirteen patients presented other uncommon MD manifestations, resulting in a total of 94 MD cases and an annual incidence of 5.1/10(4) hospitalized patients [95% confidence interval (CI): 4-6]. Fifty-four (57%) patients were males, 48% were <1 year of age and the median age was 12.5 months (1 month to 15 years). Clinical presentations were the following: meningococcemia and meningitis (37%), meningitis (30%), meningococcemia (16%), arthritis (10%), bacteremia (5%) and pneumonia (2%). Twenty-eight percent had complications. Nine children died (case fatality rate: 10%), and 8 had sequelae. Serogroups were identified for 84 isolates. Serogroup W was associated with age <1 year (odds ratio: 3.18; 95% CI: 1.14-8.99); meningococcemia was associated with mortality (P = 0.0038).Conclusions: Highest rates of MD were observed among young infants. This study provides baseline data to estimate the impact of introducing meningococcal vaccines in Argentina.

TI  - COMPARISON OF TWO NEW TRAPS TO THE BIOGENTS BG-SENTINEL TRAP FOR COLLECTING <i>AEDES ALBOPICTUS</i> IN NORTH FLORIDA
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple surveillance traps are currently available for adult mosquito surveillance. In this study, 2 new types, the Maxttrace Uno and Maxttrace Breeze mosquito traps, were compared against the BioGent (TM)-seSentinel trap (BGS) for overall success in collecting Aedes albopictus in a 1,027- m(2) vehicle enclosure and in the field. The enclosure test results showed both traps collected significantly fewer Ae. albopictus, compared to the BGS trap. The modification of using all BG lures for each trap did not increase the number of mosquitoes collected in the 2 new traps, when compared to collection with the original lures tested in the vehicle enclosure. Field test results showed that BGS trap collected higher numbers of Ae. albopictus than the 2 new traps, regardless of switching lure or not. Overall, the BGS trap was the most effective trap and the 2 new traps could be used as additional tools for the collection of Ae. albopictus.

TI  - Effect of pan-sharpening multi-temporal Landsat 8 imagery for crop type differentiation using different classification techniques
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the potential of pan-sharpening multi-temporal Landsat 8 imagery for the differentiation of crops in a Mediterranean climate. Five Landsat 8 images covering the phenological stages of seven major crops types in the study area (Cape Winelands, South Africa) were acquired. A statistical pan-sharpening algorithm was used to increase the spatial resolution of the 30 m multispectral bands to 15 m. The pan-sharpened images and original multispectral bands were used to generate two sets of input features at 30 and 15 m resolutions respectively. The two sets of spatial variables were separately used as input to decision trees (DTs), k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forests (RF) machine learning classifiers. The analyses were carried out in both the object based image analysis (OBIA) and pixel-based image analysis (PBIA) paradigms. For the OBIA experiments, three image segmentation scenarios were tested (good, over and under segmentation). The PBIA experiments were carried out at 30 m and 15 m resolutions. The results show that pan-sharpening led to dramatic (,-15%) improvements in classification accuracies in both the PBIA and OBIA approaches. Compared to the other classifiers, SVM consistently produced superior results. When applied to the pah-sharpened imagery SVM produced an overall accuracy of nearly 96% using OBIA, while PBIA's overall accuracy was 1.63% lower. We conclude that pan-sharpening Landsat 8 imagery is highly beneficial for classifying agricultural fields whether an object- or pixel-based approach is used. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Crossing the (watershed) divide: satellite data and the changing politics of international river basins
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Acquiring freshwater resources is a necessary component of sustainable human settlement subject to increasing pressure from population and climate changes. This sometimes scarce resource primarily comes from rivers, and international river basins (IRBs), where watersheds and watercourses cross political boundaries, are often spaces of great political tension and conflict worldwide. Such conflict potential has garnered interest from a wide range of research communities, and each emphasises public access to hydrologic data as integral to successful international management of IRBs. However; these hydrologic data, especially measurements of river flow rate, are often closely guarded state secrets. Satellites have been cited as a key technology set to challenge this data monopoly that have yet been unable to calculate river flow rate without some form of guarded ancillary data. Now, at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG) offers a means of circumventing data limitations without any a priori information, and the forthcoming NASA/CNES Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite also promises to estimate flow rates solely from its novel measurements following launch. In this paper, we explore how these newly available estimates of river flow rate could reconfigure water-management and interstate relations in IRBs, and demonstrate AMHG, for two cases: the Ganges-Brahmaputra and Mekong. For these basins we find that satellite flow rate retrievals will likely reinforce and favour state-level negotiations of water resource governance. Also, satellite flow retrievals can have the direct, concrete effect of improving hydrologic understanding of the upstream Ganges-Brahmaputra, a sorely needed advance that will positively benefit millions of Bangladeshis and affect state-level interactions between India, China, and Bangladesh. Finally, we avoid offering prescriptive water management solutions for each case, as local stakeholders will ultimately determine if and how such satellite retrievals will be used.

TI  - Describing Trajectories of Homeless Service Use in Hawai'i Using Latent Class Growth Analysis
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The State of Hawai'i, like many other areas across the United States, has large numbers of individuals and families experiencing homelessness, many of whom seek support through statewide shelters and services. This study explored the diversity of ways in which individuals and families moved through Hawai'i's homeless service system. Using administrative data, a cohort of new service users was tracked across time to trace the developmental trajectories of their homeless service use. The sample consisted of adults who had entered the service system for the first time in the fiscal year (FY) of 2010 (N = 4655). These individuals were then tracked through the end of FY 2014, as they used emergency shelter, transitional shelter, and outreach services. A latent class growth analysis was conducted and identified four distinct patterns of service use: low service use (n = 3966, 85.2%); typical transitional shelter use (n = 452, 9.7%); atypical transitional use (n = 127, 2.7%), and potential chronic service use (n = 110, 2.4%). Multinomial logistic regression models were then used to determine if select demographic, family, background experience (e. g., education, employment), or health variables were associated with class membership. The distinct profiles for class membership are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Appendectomy is an extremely common surgical procedure usually performed for an inflammatory process within this organ. Upon occasion, the pathology within the appendix is a neoplastic process which requires definitive oncologic management.Methods: The optimal management strategies for appendiceal neoplasms were reviewed and pertinent literature critically evaluated. The technology for appendectomy for an inflammatory process and an appendectomy for a neoplastic process were compared and contrasted.Results: A new surgical procedure called "radical appendectomy" was described and its merits for optimizing the management of an appendiceal neoplasm enumerated. The technology of radical appendectomy was described. The possible shortcomings that may be encountered in performing a new surgical methodology for appendectomy was presented and the results of a technically perfect radical appendectomy enumerated. The integration of a radical appendectomy with perioperative hyperthermic chemotherapy was described.Conclusions: When a malignancy exists as the cause of appendiceal pathology, the radical appendectomy will provide the maximal amount of information required for optimal decisions regarding patient management.

TI  - The drinking water contamination crisis in Flint: Modeling temporal trends of lead level since returning to Detroit water system
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since Flint returned to its pre-crisis source of drinking water close to 25,000 water samples have been collected and tested for lead and copper in >10,000 residences. This paper presents the first analysis and time trend modeling of lead data, providing new insights about the impact of this intervention. The analysis started with geocoding all water lead levels (WLL) measured during an 11-month period following the return to the Detroit water supply. Each data was allocated to the corresponding tax parcel unit and linked to secondary datasets, such as the composition of service lines, year built, or census tract poverty level. Only data collected on residential parcels within the City limits were used in the analysis. One key feature of Flint data is their collection through two different sampling initiatives: (i) voluntary or homeowner-driven sampling whereby concerned citizens decided to acquire a testing kit and conduct sampling on their own (non-sentinel sites), and (ii) State-controlled sampling where data were collected bi-weekly at selected sites after training of residents by technical teams (sentinel sites). Temporal trends modeled from these two datasets were found to be statistically different with fewer sentinel data exceeding WLL thresholds ranging from 10 to 50 mu g/L. Even after adjusting for housing characteristics the odds ratio (OR) of measuring WLL above 15 mu g/L at non-sentinel sites is significantly >1 (OR = 1.480) and it increases with the threshold (OR = 2.055 for 50 mu g/L)Joinpoint regression showed that the city-wide percdntage of WLL data above 15 mu g/L displayed four successive trends since the return to Detroit Water System. Despite the recent improvement in water quality, the culprit for differences between sampling programs needs to be identified as it impacts exposure assessment and might influence whether there is compliance or not with the Lead and Copper Rule.

TI  - Monitoring soil salinity via remote sensing technology under data scarce conditions: A case study from Turkey
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its negative impacts on land productivity and plant growth, soil salinization is a significant problem particularly in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Among the natural factors of soil salinization, parent materials including high amount of salts and minerals in soil structure, known as primary salinization, can be addressed. Conventional irrigation techniques and poor drainage systems are predominant human-induced activities that result in secondary salinization. Countries with especially dryland environment, face difficulty in providing adequate food for their rapidly increasing population since each year lots of cultivated land are abandoned due to adverse effects of primary and secondary soil salinization. Therefore, monitoring, mapping and predicting soil salinization is of utmost importance regarding lessening and/or preventing further increase in soil salinity through some protective measures. The subject of concern becomes even more pronounced particularly in agricultural lands as is the case in the vicinity of Tuz (Salt) Lake Region in Turkey. This research focuses mainly on multi-temporal monitoring of Tuz Lake Region in order to track changes in areas of salty spots in years 1990, 2002, 2006, 2011 and 2015. A total number of 25 Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 images obtained between 1990 and 2015 were analysed in this study. Field electrical conductivity (EC) measurements for 322 soil samples in year 2002 were checked; and 28 of these samples were selected for generating salinity maps representing areas in the vicinity of the lake. All satellite images were radiometrically and atmospherically corrected prior to classification. Following the pre-processing step, five soil salinity indices were applied on all satellite images. 28 soil samples were then overlaid on images in order to extract the exact index values related to soil samples and regression approach was used to relate satellite image-derived salinity indices and field measurements. Linear and exponential regression analyses were conducted separately as the next step for all indices based on data gathered in 2002. Salinity index (SI) 1 = B-147B showed the best result with R2 value of 0.93 and 0.83 for exponential and linear regression analysis, respectively. Salinity maps for years 1990, 2006, 2011 and 2015 were further produced utilizing the exponential and linear regression expressions attained for year 2002. Besides, this study detected land cover changes in the area from year 2000-2006, and from 2006 to 2012 by using CORINE land cover data to analyse the possible relationships between land cover change and salinity changes.

TI  - Introduction of <i>Aethina tumida</i> (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) in the regions of Calabria and Sicily (southern Italy)
T2  - APIDOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aethina tumida (small hive beetle, SHB) was first detected in September 2014 in Calabria region, southern Italy, and in a single apiary in Sicily in November 2014. In September 2015, SHB was again recorded in Calabria, and in 2016, only sentinel honey bee nucleus colonies were found to be infested. Its phylogenetic relationship and possible origin were investigated comparing the cox1 sequences with the corresponding region available in the GenBank database. The neighbour-joining method revealed that the first Italian specimen belonged to a group also containing an African specimen from Cameroon. The Italian specimens differ from the SHBs spread worldwide and are split into two different groups: group B1 includes the AfricCam3 sequence and the first SHB identified in Calabria; group B2 includes specimens from Calabria and the only one from Sicily which share identical cox1 sequences. SHB in Italy appears to have been introduced from Africa and includes independent or contemporary incursions in the two concerned regions. The most likely scenario is that SHB was introduced into Calabria followed by man-mediated migration to Sicily.

TI  - Bilateral removal of the mandibular and medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes through a single ventral midline incision for staging of head and neck cancers in dogs: a description of surgical technique
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, there is no standard protocol for removal of regional lymph nodes for the staging of head and neck cancers in dogs. Palpation and fine needle aspiration of mandibular lymph nodes are most commonly performed for staging of head and neck cancers. Although cytology is commonly performed for staging of head and neck, cancers histopathology is required for definitive lymph node staging. When regional lymph node biopsy is performed, mandibular lymph nodes are most commonly sampled due to their accessibility. The medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes may be the most relevant draining lymph node of the head and neck, but they are not routinely sampled due to their anatomic location medial to the salivary glands. The technique described here will allow for a standardized surgical approach for the efficient removal of both mandibular and medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes for staging of head and neck tumours via a single ventral midline approach.

TI  - "Prosumage" and the British electricity market
T2  - ECONOMICS OF ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Domestic electricity consumers with PV panels have become known as "prosumers"; some of them also have energy storage and we have named the combination "prosumage". The challenges of renewable intermittency could be offset by storing power, and many engineering studies consider the role and value of storage which is properly integrated into the 'smart grid'. Such a system with holistic optimal control may fail to materialise for regulatory, economic, or behavioural reasons. We therefore model the impact of naive prosumage: households which use storage only to maximise self-consumption of FY with no consideration of the wider system. We find it is neither economic for arbitrage nor particularly beneficial for shaving peaks and filling troughs in national net demand. The extreme case of renewable selfsufficiency, becoming completely independent of the grid, is still prohibitively expensive in Britain and Germany, and even in a country like Spain with a much better solar resource.

TI  - The SUMO Ship Detector Algorithm for Satellite Radar Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Search for Unidentified Maritime Objects (SUMO) is an algorithm for ship detection in satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. It has been developed over the course of more than 15 years, using a large amount of SAR images from almost all available SAR satellites operating in L-, C- and X-band. As validated by benchmark tests, it performs very well on a wide range of SAR image modes (from Spotlight to ScanSAR) and resolutions (from 1-100 m) and for all types and sizes of ships, within the physical limits imposed by the radar imaging. This paper describes, in detail, the algorithmic approach in all of the steps of the ship detection: land masking, clutter estimation, detection thresholding, target clustering, ship attribute estimation and false alarm suppression. SUMO is a pixel-based CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) detector for multi-look radar images. It assumes a K distribution for the sea clutter, corrected however for deviations of the actual sea clutter from this distribution, implementing a fast and robust method for the clutter background estimation. The clustering of detected pixels into targets (ships) uses several thresholds to deal with the typically irregular distribution of the radar backscatter over a ship. In a multi-polarization image, the different channels are fused. Azimuth ambiguities, a common source of false alarms in ship detection, are removed. A reliability indicator is computed for each target. In post-processing, using the results of a series of images, additional false alarms from recurrent (fixed) targets including range ambiguities are also removed. SUMO can run in semi-automatic mode, where an operator can verify each detected target. It can also run in fully automatic mode, where batches of over 10,000 images have successfully been processed in less than two hours. The number of satellite SAR systems keeps increasing, as does their application to maritime surveillance. The open data policy of the EU's Copernicus program, which includes the Sentinel-1 satellite, has hugely increased the availability of SAR images. This paper aims to cater to the consequently expected wider demand for knowledge about SAR ship detectors.

AB  - Introduction. Ethnography has become popular in library and information science, though researchers seldom describe their methodology clearly. Ethnography is also described as a metatheory and a methodology. However, ethnography is best understood as a methodology, which inherits ontological assumptions from the metatheory with which it is being used.Theoretical argument. Metatheory is similar to one of Thomas Kuhn's meanings of paradigm. Paradigms share common ontological stances. Ethnography is not a metatheory but a methodology because ethnographic methods-as-tools, such as interviewing and participant observation, can be used with different paradigms.Analysis. In library and information science, each of the four main metatheories (scientific, critical, constructivist, and postmodern) is associated with different types of ethnography based on shared worldview or ontological assumptions. Ethnographic methods-as-tools can be used in different types of ethnography and are often adapted to reflect a study's ontological assumptions, as illustrated in information research examples.Conclusions. Information researchers should explicitly articulate their ontological stance and theoretical paradigm and explain how their methodological choices, including the use of ethnography, are consistent with their stance and paradigm. This would help eliminate confusion about whether ethnography is a metatheory or methodology and improve the alignment of theory to method of ethnographic research.

TI  - Variability of Yellow River turbid plume detected with satellite remote sensing during water-sediment regulation
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water Sediment Regulations (WSRs) of the Yellow River (YR) have fundamentally altered the dynamics of freshwater and sediment transport in YR estuary and might profoundly affect water quality and ecosystem of the adjacent Bohai Sea. In this study, empirical algorithms were established to infer sea surface salinity and turbidity of YR plume using on surface reflectance products of MODIS and GOCI satellites in combination with observations from hydrographic surveys during the 2014 WSR event. Inter- and intraday variability of salinity and turbidity were quantitatively assessed and correlated with external forces including river discharge, tides, Coriolis force, and wind-driven circulation. The results revealed the enhanced offshore extension of turbid plume as WSR drastically increased freshwater and sediment discharge to river mouth. During WSR event, the area of low salinity plume ( < 25 psu) increased to 267 km(2), while sediment plume (SR645 > 0.12sr(-1)) occupied a maximum area of 162 lung. Intraday variation observed from geostationary GOCI data clearly illustrated the dominance of tidal current on short term dispersal pattern of freshwater and sediment plume. In comparison, wind field dominated the seasonal variation in flume transport but had insignificant impact on short term river plume dynamic during WSR. Overall, this study demonstrated that the spatial and temporal dynamic of YR plume was successfully captured by satellite remote sensing, which provided an effective tool for evaluating the environmental and ecological impact of WSRs.

TI  - Assessing Neighbor and Population Growth Influences on Agricultural Land Conversion
T2  - APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses remote sensing data to assess the extent of agricultural land converted to developed (built-up) land in Alberta, Canada, from 2000 to 2012. Pairing aggregated conversion values with county-level census data, we further investigate the impacts of population growth and conversion activities in the neighboring areas on agricultural land conversion. To account for the omitted variable bias and spatial dependency, a first-differenced spatial regression model is used. The results show that spillover effects can be attributed to both neighbor conversion activities and neighboring population growth. Controlling for spatial dependence is important for producing estimates with minimized risk of bias. A policymaker who considers land use strategies in isolation from neighbors may make decisions with potentially adverse impacts. The dominant influences of population growth and spatial lag effects direct recommendations on regional planning mandates and mechanisms that promote densification in urban areas.

TI  - An Activatable Fluorescent γ-Polyglutamic Acid Complex for Sentinel Lymph Node Imaging
T2  - BIOLOGICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) are the first lymph nodes (LN) where cancer cells metastasize from the primary tumor. We designed fluorophore-quencher-based activatable nanoparticles for SLN imaging. We selected TAMRA as a fluorophore and BHQ2 or QSY7 as a quencher. Ternary anionic complexes were constructed with generation 4th polyamidoamine dendrimer (G4) modified with TAMRA and p-SCN-Bn-DTPA (DTPA), polyethyleneimine (PEI) modified with BHQ2 or QSY7, and gamma-polyglutamic acid (gamma-PGA) by the electrostatic self-assembly system. TAMRA-G4-DTPA/PEI-BHQ2/gamma-PGA and TAMRA-G4-DTPA/PEI-QSY7/gamma-PGA complexes had a particle size of about 40nm and a zeta -potential of 50 mV, and showed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) quenching. Fluorescence microscopy studies demonstrated that TAMRA-G4-DTPA/PEI-QSY7/gamma-PGA complex produced intracellular fluorescent signals in the lysosome. During in vivo fluorescent imaging, TAMRA-G4-DTPA/PEI-QSY7/gamma-PGA complex enabled the detection of mouse popliteal LN. The fluorophore-quencher conjugated gamma-PGA complex based on FRET quenching would be useful for fluorescence-based optical imaging of SLN.

TI  - Characterizing Spatial Neighborhoods of Refugia Following Large Fires in Northern New Mexico USA
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial patterns resulting from large fires include refugial habitats that support surviving legacies and promote ecosystem recovery. To better understand the diverse ecological functions of refugia on burn mosaics, we used remotely sensed data to quantify neighborhood patterns of areas relatively unchanged following the 2011 Las Conchas fire. Spatial patterns of refugia measured within 10-ha moving windows varied across a gradient from areas of high density, clustered in space, to sparsely populated neighborhoods that occurred in the background matrix. The scaling of these patterns was related to the underlying structure of topography measured by slope, aspect and potential soil wetness, and spatially varying climate. Using a nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis of species cover data collected post-Las Conchas, we found that trees and forest associates were present across the refugial gradient, but communities also exhibited a range of species compositions and potential functions. Spatial patterns of refugia quantified for three previous burns (La Mesa 1977, Dome 1996, Cerro Grande 2000) were dynamic between fire events, but most refugia persisted through at least two fires. Efforts to maintain burn heterogeneity and its ecological functions can begin with identifying where refugia are likely to occur, using terrain-based microclimate models, burn severity models and available field data.

TI  - Multi-Criteria Assessment of Land Cover Dynamic Changes in Halgurd Sakran National Park (HSNP), Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Using Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Halgurd Sakran National Park (HSNP) is Iraq's first designated national park, located in the Kurdistan Region, which has suffered multiple armed conflicts over the past decades. This study assesses how vegetation dynamics have affected the landscape structure and composition of the core zone of the park over the last 31 years. Spatio-temporal changes in land cover were mapped for three points in time using remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and landscape metrics. Land cover changes were mapped using random forest classifications of satellite images from Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 LDCM acquired in 1984, 1998, and 2015. Five landscape pattern metrics were analysed at class and landscape levels in order to quantify landscape patterns arising from land use and land cover (LULC) change in HSNP using FRAGSTATS 4.2. These landscape pattern metrics were patch metrics, area metrics, shape metrics interspersion/juxtaposition and contagion metrics and diversity metrics. Significant changes in cultivated areas after 1991 were observed, which indicate the role of anthropogenic activities in land cover change. Areas of bare surface and forest lands declined and became more fragmented in 1984 and 1998 while, at the same time, cultivated areas increased, with a continuing fragmentation of pasture land. Internal migration of people was one of the major drivers of LULC change. The results reveal that significant LULC changes in terms of composition and spatial structure over the 31-year period have occurred in the designated protected area. Landscape metrics were able to assess the trend of spatial patchiness over the studied period. A discussion of the significance of changes in land use systems for understanding the causes and consequences of change is provided.

M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common cancer among women and the fourth leading cause of death from cancer. The most common sites of metastasis are the pelvic lymph nodes, vagina, and the pelvic sidewalls. Distant metastases are uncommon but can involve the bone, lung, and liver. Characteristics associated with increased rate of distant metastasis include bulky tumor, endometrial extension, lymph node involvement, and advanced disease. We report the case of a woman with stage II cervical carcinoma, who presented with dysphagia due to cervical cancer metastases to the mediastinum.

TI  - Mapping Above-Ground Biomass of Winter Oilseed Rape Using High Spatial Resolution Satellite Data at Parcel Scale under Waterlogging Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is one of the three most important oil crops in China, and is regarded as a drought-tolerant oilseed crop. However, it is commonly sensitive to waterlogging, which usually refers to an adverse environment that limits crop development. Moreover, crop growth and soil irrigation can be monitored at a regional level using remote sensing data. High spatial resolution optical satellite sensors are very useful to capture and resist unfavorable field conditions at the sub-field scale. In this study, four different optical sensors, i.e., Pleiades-1A, Worldview-2, Worldview-3, and SPOT-6, were used to estimate the dry above-ground biomass (AGB) of oilseed rape and track the seasonal growth dynamics. In addition, three different soil water content field experiments were carried out at different oilseed rape growth stages from November 2014 to May 2015 in Northern Zhejiang province, China. As a significant indicator of crop productivity, AGB was measured during the seasonal growth stages of the oilseed rape at the experimental plots. Several representative vegetation indices (VIs) obtained from multiple satellite sensors were compared with the simultaneously-collected oilseed rape AGB. Results showed that the estimation model using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with a power regression model performed best through the seasonal growth dynamics, with the highest coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.77), the smallest root mean square error (RMSE = 104.64 g/m(2)), and the relative RMSE (rRMSE = 21%). It is concluded that the use of selected VIs and high spatial multiple satellite data can significantly estimate AGB during the winter oilseed rape growth stages, and can be applied to map the variability of winter oilseed rape at the sub-field level under different waterlogging conditions, which is very promising in the application of agricultural irrigation and precision agriculture.

TI  - Selecting Appropriate Spatial Scale for Mapping Plastic-Mulched Farmland with Satellite Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the area of plastic-mulched farmland (PMF) has undergone rapid growth and raised remarkable environmental problems. Therefore, mapping the PMF plays a crucial role in agricultural production, environmental protection and resource management. However, appropriate data selection criteria are currently lacking. Thus, this study was carried out in two main plastic-mulching practice regions, Jizhou and Guyuan, to look for an appropriate spatial scale for mapping PMF with remote sensing. The average local variance (ALV) function was used to obtain the appropriate spatial scale for mapping PMF based on the GaoFen-1 (GF-1) satellite imagery. Afterwards, in order to validate the effectiveness of the selected method and to interpret the relationship between the appropriate spatial scale derived from the ALV and the spatial scale with the highest classification accuracy, we classified the imagery with varying spatial resolution by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm using the spectral features, textural features and the combined spectral and textural features respectively. The results indicated that the appropriate spatial scales from the ALV lie between 8 m and 20 m for mapping the PMF both in Jizhou and Guyuan. However, there is a proportional relation: the spatial scale with the highest classification accuracy is at the 1/2 location of the appropriate spatial scale generated from the ALV in Jizhou and at the 2/3 location of the appropriate spatial scale generated from the ALV in Guyuan. Therefore, the ALV method for quantitatively selecting the appropriate spatial scale for mapping PMF with remote sensing imagery has theoretical and practical significance.

TI  - Sub-pixel analysis to enhance the accuracy of evapotranspiration determined using MODIS images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A study was carried out to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ET) over a 1074 km(2) of the humid area of Perak State (Malaysia), where water and evaporation cycle deeply influences the climate, natural resources and human living aspects. Images from both Terra and Aqua platforms of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor were used for ET estimation by employing the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model. As a part of the accuracy assessment process, in-situ measurements on soil temperature and reference ET (ET0) were recorded at the time of satellite overpass. In order to enhance the accuracy of the generated ET maps, MODIS images were subjected to sub-pixel analysis by assigning weights for different land surface cover (urban, agriculture and multi-surface areas) reflections. The weighting process was achieved by integrating ET from pure pixels with the respective site-specific ET0 of each land cover. The enhanced SEBAL model estimated ET exhibited a good correlation with the in-situ measured Penman-Montieth ET0, with R-2 values for the Aqua and the Terra platforms of 0.67 and 0.73, respectively. However, the correlation of the non-enhanced ET maps resulted in R-2 values of 0.61 and 0.68 for the Aqua and the Terra platforms, respectively. Hence, the results of this study revealed the feasibility of employing the sub-pixel analysis method for an accurate estimation of ET over large areas.

TI  - Coseismic Slip in the 2016 M<sub>w</sub> 7.8 Ecuador Earthquake Imaged from Sentinel-1A Radar Interferometry
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The M-w 7.8 Ecuador earthquake on 16 April 2016 is the sixth earthquake larger than Mw 7 to rupture the subduction mega-thrust between the Nazca and South American plates since the Mw 8.8 Colombia-Ecuador earthquake in 1906. We use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images from Sentinel-1A to determine coseismic surface displacements associated with this earthquake. The interferograms exhibit a relatively simple pattern of deformation, with maximum displacements of 0.7 and 0.3 m on the descending and ascending images, respectively. We invert the interferograms for both rupture geometry and slip distribution in the earthquake. We find that the data are best described by slip on a fault dipping 17 degrees to the east and that these InSAR data cannot uniquely constrain the strike. The maximum inferred slip is just over 2.5 m at about 20 km depth, with the main slip in the depth range of about 10-25 km. The geodetic moment of our preferred slip model is 7.15 x 10(20) N.m, equivalent to M-w 7.87. Our results suggest that there is little, if any, partitioning of the oblique plate convergence. The 2016 Ecuador earthquake is coincident with the location of the 1942 Mw 7.8 earthquake, with both earthquakes most likely rupturing an asperity that also failed in the 1906 M-w 8.8 earthquake.

TI  - MODIS 3 km and 10 km aerosol optical depth for China: Evaluation and comparison
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - scale aerosol optical depth (AOD) distribution, the 3 km product, which is expected to perform well in analyzing aerosols and identifying local air pollution, especially in the severely polluted atmosphere of China. However, few detailed evaluations of regional variations have been conducted. In this paper, we evaluate MODIS 3 km and 10 km AOD products for China against ground-based measurements and compare their performance with respect to spatial and temporal variations. The ground validations indicate that the two products are generally correlated well to ground-based observations. Spatially, the 3 km product slightly outperform the 10 km product in well-developed areas of southern China. Temporally, both products perform worse during spring and summer. Atmospheric clouds and underlying surface are two key factors that influence the accuracy and number of retrievals for both products. The comparison analysis reveals the newly introduced AOD product clearly shows good relationships with the coarse resolution retrievals in spatial and temporal variation but significant differences regarding details. The 3 km AOD product provides better aerosol gradients, more retrievals in bare areas of western China and some spikes of diurnal variation in cloudy days. Seasonal comparisons show the 3 km AOD product is higher than the 10 km product in all seasons, especially during spring and summer. Although the 3 km product for China generally performs slightly worse than the 10 km product, the added information of the MODIS 3 km AOD product shows potential for studying local aerosol characterization, and may facilitate studies of air pollution.

TI  - A Data-Driven Assessment of Biosphere-Atmosphere Interaction Impact on Seasonal Cycle Patterns of XCO<sub>2</sub> Using GOSAT and MODIS Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using measurements of the column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction (XCO2) from GOSAT and biosphere parameters, including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index (LAI), gross primary production (GPP), and land surface temperature (LST) from MODIS, this study proposes a data-driven approach to assess the impacts of terrestrial biosphere activities on the seasonal cycle pattern of XCO2. A unique global land mapping dataset of XCO2 with a resolution of 1 degrees by 1 degrees in space, and three days in time, from June 2009 to May 2014, which facilitates the assessment at a fine scale, is first produced from GOSAT XCO2 retrievals. We then conduct a statistical fitting method to obtain the global map of seasonal cycle amplitudes (SCA) of XCO2 and NDVI, and implement correlation analyses of seasonal variation between XCO2 and the vegetation parameters. As a result, the spatial distribution of XCO2 SCA decreases globally with latitude from north to south, which is in good agreement with that of simulated XCO2 from CarbonTracker. The spatial pattern of XCO2 SCA corresponds well to the vegetation seasonal activity revealed by NDVI, with a strong correlation coefficient of 0.74 in the northern hemisphere (NH). Some hotspots in the subtropical areas, including Northern India (with SCA of 8.68 +/- 0.49 ppm on average) and Central Africa (with SCA of 8.33 +/- 0.25 ppm on average), shown by satellite measurements, but missed by model simulations, demonstrate the advantage of satellites in observing the biosphere-atmosphere interactions at local scales. Results from correlation analyses between XCO2 and NDVI, EVI, LAI, or GPP show a consistent spatial distribution, and NDVI and EVI have stronger negative correlations over all latitudes. This may suggest that NDVI and EVI can be better vegetation parameters in characterizing the seasonal variations of XCO2 and its driving terrestrial biosphere activities. We, furthermore, present the global distribution of phase lags of XCO2 compared to NDVI in seasonal variation, which, to our knowledge, is the first such map derived from a completely data-driven approach using satellite observations. The impact of retrieval error of GOSAT data on the mapping data, especially over high-latitude areas, is further discussed. Results from this study provide reference for better understanding the distribution of the strength of carbon sink by terrestrial ecosystems and utilizing remote sensing data in assessing the impact of biosphere-atmosphere interactions on the seasonal cycle pattern of atmospheric CO2 columns.

TI  - Integration of remote sensing based surface information into a three-dimensional microclimate model
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change urges cities to consider the urban climate as part of sustainable planning. Urban micro climate models can provide knowledge on the climate at building block level. However, very detailed information on the area of interest is required. Most microclimate studies therefore make use of assumptions and generalizations to describe the model area. Remote sensing data with area wide coverage provides a means to derive many parameters at the detailed spatial and thematic scale required by urban climate models. This study shows how microclimate simulations for a series of real world urban areas can be supported by using remote sensing data. In an automated process, surface materials, albedo, LAI/LAD and object height have been derived and integrated into the urban microclimate model ENVI-met. Multiple microclimate simulations have been carried out both with the dynamic remote sensing based input data as well as with manual and static input data to analyze the impact of the RS-based surface information and the suitability of the applied data and techniques. A valuable support of the integration of the remote sensing based input data for ENVI-met is the use of an automated processing chain. This saves tedious manual editing and allows for fast and area wide generation of simulation areas. The analysis of the different modes shows the importance of high quality height data, detailed surface material information and albedo.

TI  - Temporal cross-correlation between influenza-like illnesses and invasive pneumococcal disease in The Netherlands
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: While the burden of community-acquired pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is still considerable, there is little insight in the factors contributing to disease. Previous research on the lagged relationship between respiratory viruses and pneumococcal disease incidence is inconclusive, and studies correcting for temporal autocorrelation are lacking.Objectives: To investigate the temporal relation between influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and IPD, correcting for temporal autocorrelation.Methods: Weekly counts of ILI were obtained from the Sentinel Practices of NIVEL Primary Care Database. IPD data were collected from the Dutch laboratory-based surveillance system for bacterial meningitis from 2004 to 2014. We analysed the correlation between time series, pre-whitening the dependent time series with the best-fit seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to the independent time series. We performed cross-correlations between ILI and IPD incidences, and the (pre-whitened) residuals, in the overall population and in the elderly.Results: We found significant cross-correlations between ILI and IPD incidences peaking at lags -3 overall and at 1 week in the 65+ population. However, after pre-whitening, no cross-correlations were apparent in either population group.Conclusion: Our study suggests that ILI occurrence does not seem to be the major driver of IPD incidence in The Netherlands.

TI  - Expanding veterinary biosurveillance in Washington, DC: The creation and utilization of an electronic-based online veterinary surveillance system
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To enhance the early detection of emerging infectious diseases and bioterrorism events using companion animal-based surveillance.Methods: Washington, DC, small animal veterinary facilities (n = 17) were surveyed to determine interest in conducting infectious disease surveillance. Using these results, an electronic-based online reporting system was developed and launched in August 2015 to monitor rates of canine influenza, canine leptospirosis, antibiotic resistant infections, canine parvovirus, and syndromic disease trends.Results: Nine of the 10 facilities that responded expressed interest conducting surveillance. In September 2015,17 canine parvovirus cases were reported. In response, a campaign encouraging regular veterinary preventative care was launched and featured on local media platforms. Additionally, during the system's first year of operation it detected 5 canine leptospirosis cases and 2 antibiotic resistant infections. No canine influenza cases were reported and syndromic surveillance compliance varied, peaking during National Special Security Events.Conclusions: Small animal veterinarians and the general public are interested in companion animal disease surveillance. The system described can serve as a model for establishing similar systems to monitor disease trends of public health importance in pet populations and enhance biosurveillance capabilities.

TI  - Applying Indigenous Knowledge to Innovations in Social Work Education
T2  - RESEARCH ON SOCIAL WORK PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Grounded in an indigenous holistic worldview and borrowing from the four Rs (values of relationships, responsibility, reciprocity, and redistribution), this article supports the inclusion of translational science and the integration of core metacompetencies into social work doctoral education as innovations in the field of social work science. The author argues that these innovations will enhance the ability of social-work-trained researchers to serve on transdisciplinary research teams, which are necessary to address complex metaproblems found in the natural world. Further, the author asserts that transdisciplinary scientific integration is helpful to social work science, as it builds awareness and appreciation of social work scholarly inquiry, promotes the inclusion of social work values in scientific research, and helps erode the scientific hierarchy that has traditionally existed between the natural and social sciences. By leveraging personal experiences in transdisciplinary education, the author offers a conceptual framework for innovations in doctoral education.

TI  - Methods for Mapping Forest Disturbance and Degradation from Optical Earth Observation Data: a Review
T2  - CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in remote sensing-based monitoring of forest disturbances and forest degradation from optical Earth Observation data. Part one comprises an overview and tabular description of currently available optical remote sensing sensors, which can be used for forest disturbance and degradation mapping. Part two reviews the two main categories of existing mapping approaches: first, classical image-to-image change detection and second, time series analysis.Recent Findings With the launch of the Sentinel-2a satellite and available Landsat imagery, time series analysis has become the most promising but also most demanding category of degradation mapping approaches. Four time series classification methods are distinguished. The methods are explained and their benefits and drawbacks are discussed. A separate chapter presents a number of recent forest degradation mapping studies for two different ecosystems: temperate forests with a geographical focus on Europe and tropical forests with a geographical focus on Africa.Summary The review revealed that a wide variety of methods for the detection of forest degradation is already available. Today, the main challenge is to transfer these approaches to high-resolution time series data from multiple sensors. Future research should also focus on the classification of disturbance types and the development of robust up-scalable methods to enable near real-time disturbance mapping in support of operational reactive measures.

TI  - Analysing the origin of rain- and subsurface water in seasonal wetlands of north-central Namibia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the origins of rain- and subsurface waters of north-central Namibia's seasonal wetlands, which are critical to the regions water and food security. The region includes the southern part of the Cuvelai system seasonal wetlands (CSSWs) of the Cuvelai Basin, a transboundary river basin covering southern Angola and northern Namibia. We analysed stable water isotopes (SWIs) of hydrogen (HDO) and oxygen (H2(18)O) in rainwater, surface water and shallow groundwater. Rainwater samples were collected during every rainfall event of the rainy season from October 2013 to April 2014. The isotopic ratios of HDO (delta D) and oxygen H218O (delta O-18) were analysed in each rainwater sample and then used to derive the annual mean value of (delta D, delta O-18) in precipitation weighted by each rainfall volume. Using delta diagrams (plotting delta D vs. delta O-18), we showed that the annual mean value was a good indicator for determining the origins of subsurface waters in the CSSWs. To confirm the origins of rainwater and to explain the variations in isotopic ratios, we conducted atmospheric water budget analysis using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) multi-satellite precipitation analysis (TMPA) data and ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalysis data. The results showed that around three-fourths of rainwater was derived from recycled water at local-regional scales. Satellite-observed outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and complementary satellite data from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) series implied that the isotopic ratios in rainwater were affected by evaporation of raindrops falling from convective clouds. Consequently, integrated SWI analysis of rain-, surface and subsurface waters, together with the atmospheric water budget analysis, revealed that shallow groundwater of small wetlands in this region was very likely to be recharged from surface waters originating from local rainfall, which was temporarily pooled in small wetlands. This was also supported by tritium (H-3) counting of the current rain- and subsurface waters in the region. We highly recommend that shallow groundwater not be pumped intensively to conserve surface and subsurface waters, both of which are important water resources in the region.

TI  - Wildfire and exotic grass invasion alter plant productivity in response to climate variability in the Mojave Desert
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual grass invasions often increase the frequency and extent of wildfire. Climate variability and fire history may have modifying effects on invasion success and its link to changing fire regimes.Characterize the role of climate variability and fire history in vegetation shifts of an invaded desert landscape.Pre- and post-fire landscape vegetation greenness were assessed on multiple, independent wildfires in Mojave Desert shrublands using a 34 year record of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from 1685 Landsat images and matched with a record of precipitation using linear regression.Annual maximum NDVI, and its annual variance of monthly maximum values, were significantly higher on post-fire than pre-fire landscapes. Additionally, post-fire landscapes showed greater sensitivity to antecedent precipitation received the previous 4 months than pre-fire and unburned landscapes. Ground surveys of vegetation indicate that post-fire landscapes show little indication of recovery of native shrub cover and density but instead are dominated by the exotic grass red brome (Bromus rubens L.). Increased NDVI sensitivity to precipitation is likely related to the growth of red brome, which dominates burned landscapes. Record precipitation in the fall of 2004 contributed to the record NDVI values in 2005 likely driven by high density of red brome.The heightened response of post-fire vegetation to extreme and more variable precipitation events appears to be contributing to the emergence of an invasive grass-fire cycle that constrains the re-establishment of fire sensitive native shrubs while reinforcing the dominance of exotic grasses.

TI  - Fifteen-year monitoring of the turbidity dynamics in large lakes and reservoirs in the middle and lower basin of the Yangtze River, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Middle and Lower Yangtze River (MLY) basin holds the most freshwater in East Asia; however, the conditions of basin-scale water turbidity remain unknown. In this work, a remote sensing algorithm was developed to estimate the concentrations of the total suspended sediments (TSS) in large lakes and reservoirs over the MLY basin and was based on a band ratio between 555 nm and 645 nm of the atmospherically corrected surface reflectance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In situ samples used to calibrate the algorithm were collected from 58 lakes and reservoirs with a TSS range of 1 to 300 mg L-1, and the uncertainty of this algorithm was 30-40%. The algorithm was subsequently applied to a total of 102 lakes and reservoirs located in the MLY basin to derive TSS maps from 2000 to 2014 at a 250 m spatial resolution, and the first comprehensive document of the TSS distributions and dynamics of large inland waters of the MLY basin was created. The seasonal patterns among the selected water bodies were similar, with the largest TSS concentrations occurring in the first and fourth quarters in a year and the lowest values occurring in the third quarter. In contrast, spatial heterogeneities were revealed by the 15-year long-term mean TSS climatology information. Although most lakes downstream of Poyang Lake were turbid with 15-year TSS climatology values of 45-100 mg L-1, waters between Poyang and Doting Lake were relatively clearer with TSS climatology values of 15-45 mg L-1, and the clearest waters (<15 mg L-1) were found in reservoirs. The turbidity of 64.5% (e.g., 49/76) for lakes in Class II exhibited a decreasing trend over the 15-year period, and the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) and Dongting Lake in Class I also showed significant TSS declines. Analysis with meteorological data shows that the intra-annual variations appear to be significantly correlated with local precipitation, with a time lag of two months for TSS. The prominent TSS decreasing trend of the lakes in Class,II was probably linked to the significant NDVI increase in the MLY basin, whereas the TSS decrease in the TGR and Dongting Lake is likely to be attributed to the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam. The TSS environmental data record (EDR) of large inland waters presented in this study serves as an important reference for future water quality monitoring and evaluation in the MLY and in China.

TI  - Impact of sentinel lymph node mapping on recurrence patterns in endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has emerged as a promising solution to the ongoing debate regarding lymphadenectomy in the initial surgical management of endometrial cancer. Currently, little is known about its possible impact on location of disease recurrence compared to systematic lymphadenectomy.Methods. In this retrospective study, 472 consecutive patients with endometrial cancer who underwent either SLN mapping (SLN cohort, n = 275) or systematic lymphadenectomy (LND cohort, n = 197) from sequential, non-overlapping historical time points were compared. Clinical characteristics were extracted from a prospectively gathered electronic database. Both overall and pelvic sidewall recurrence free survival (RFS) were evaluated at 48-month post-operative follow-up.Results. No significant difference in overall RFS could be identified between the cohorts at 48 months (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.43-1.28, p = 0.29). However, the SLN cohort had improved pelvic sidewall RFS compared to the LND cohort (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.74, p = 0.007). The pelvic sidewall recurrences accounted for 30% of recurrences in the SLN cohort (8 out of 26 recurrences) compared to 71.4% in the LND cohort (20 out of 28 recurrences).Conclusions. SLN mapping may enable more efficient detection of the LNs at greatest risk of metastasis and help to guide adjuvant therapy, which in turn seems to decrease the risk of pelvic sidewall recurrences.

TI  - Is the Distinction between Two Kinds of "Christian Philosophy" Meaningful?
T2  - FILOZOFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with an attractive distinction between two kinds of Christian philosophy according to Winfried Loffier, who claims that: i) there are two basic (irreducible to each other) kinds of Christian philosophy, namely Augustinian and Thomistic; ii) Thomistic is more preferable, because it is immune to questionable blending philosophy and theology. The core of the study is the critique of Loffler's argumentation: First, it disputes plausibility of the sharp distinction between the two kinds of Christian philosophy. Second, it criticizes the idea of neutral premises in philosophy. Third, it attacks the theory of "patching up the gaps" in our knowledge with theological premises.

TI  - A Novel Application of Double-Paddle Peroneal Chimeric Flap as External Sentinel Monitor in Hypopharyngeal Reconstruction
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Monitoring the viability of buried free flaps in hypopharyngeal reconstruction is difficult. Various methods have been proposed to monitor these buried flaps, but limitations remain.Method: We present a method of using double-paddle chimeric peroneal flaps that permanently externalizes a flap skin paddle as a monitoring paddle in hypopharyngeal reconstructions. This study was performed in amedical center in southern Taiwan; between 2013 and 2015, 10 patients underwent double-paddle chimeric peroneal flap reconstruction in advanced stages of hypopharyngeal cancer. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records from these surgeries, searching for either short-term postoperative complications or long-term follow-up morbidity and researched relevant articles for comparisons with other monitoring methods.Results: None of the 10 flaps underwent total loss. The rate of stenosis and that of fistula formation was 10%. The average postoperative hospital stay was 39 days. Six of 10 patients were able to resume at least a soft diet after reconstruction, and none of the patients experienced significant complications.Conclusions: The peroneal flap is a useful flap because it is thin and pliable, has minimal donor site morbidity in patients without peripheral vascular disease, and has the potential of multiple skin paddles so that one skin paddle can be used for monitoring the buried flap. Using this method, direct clinical monitoring is feasible, and early detection of vascular complications is possible. Furthermore, the drawbacks of using a monitoring paddle produced by a deepithelialized bridge can be avoided.

TI  - Spatiotemporal regression Kriging to predict precipitation using time-series MODIS data
T2  - CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate prediction of the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation is an important guide for more efficient agricultural production. However in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, it is difficult to ensure accuracy due to sparse and unevenly distributed precipitation monitoring stations. The precipitation on raster grids must be predicted from point data. The combined China monthly mean meteorological data sets were used to build spatiotemporal geostatistical models to predict mean monthly precipitation in Xinjiang. Predictions in space and time were made for precipitation using spatiotemporal regression Kriging with some covariates. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer 1-month images time series, topographic layers representing the normalized difference vegetation index and digital elevation model, and a temporal index to adjust for yearly periodic were used as covariates. The optimal covariates were selected by the all subset regression method to determine which predictor variables to be included in the multiple regression models. The accuracy of our mean monthly precipitation predictions was assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation. The prediction accuracy of the proposed spatiotemporal regression Kriging approach was compared with spatiotemporal multi-linear regression and spatiotemporal Kriging. These experimental results show that the normalized difference vegetation index, latitude, longitude, elevation, and time periodicity index are the optimal covariates for mean monthly precipitation prediction. The spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation in Xinjiang exhibits a distinctive pattern; in the north and west, there is more precipitation than in the south and east, respectively and more precipitation in the mountains than on the plains. Precipitation is closely related to topography. Annually, summer precipitation is the highest, followed by, spring and autumn, with winter the driest season in Xinjiang. Considering regression residuals the product-sum model was found to be suitable to fit the spatiotemporal variogram at higher accuracy. Precipitation maps generated by spatiotemporal regression Kriging were more accurate than those produced by the other tested methods, with lower MAE, RMSE, and BIAS values, and higher COR values for validation sampling sites. Spatiotemporal regression Kriging is an efficient method for accurate spatiotemporal prediction of precipitation in Xinjiang.

TI  - The progress of operational forest fire monitoring with infrared remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Forest wildfires pose significant and growing threats to human safety, wildlife habitat, regional economies and global climate change. It is crucial that forest fires be subject to timely and accurate monitoring by forest fire managers and other stake-holders. Measurement by spaceborne equipment has become a practical and appealing method to monitor the occurrence and development of forest wildfires. Here we present an overview of the principles and case studies of forest fire monitoring (FFM) with satellite- and drone-mounted infrared remote sensing (IRRS). This review includes four types of FFM-relevant IRRS algorithms: bi-spectral methods, fixed threshold methods, spatial contextual methods, and multi-temporal methods. The spatial contextual methods are presented in detail since they can be applied easily with commonly available satellite IRRS data, including MODIS, VIIRS, and Landsat 8 OLI. This review also evaluates typical cases of FFM using NOAA-AVHRR, EOS-MODIS, S-NPP VIIRS, Landsat 8 OLI, MSG-SEVIRI, and drone infrared data. To better implement IRRS applications in FFM, it is important to develop accurate forest masks, carry out systematic comparative studies of various forest fire detection systems (known as forest fire products), and improve methods for assessing the accuracy of forest fire detection. Medium-resolution IRRS data are effective for landscape-scale FFM, and the VIIRS 375 m contextual algorithm and RST-FIRES algorithm are helpful for closely tracking forest fires (including small and short-lived fires) and forest-fire early warning.

TI  - Fiber-based 1150-nm femtosecond laser source for the minimally invasive harmonic generation microscopy
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmonic generation microscopy (HGM) has become one unique tool of optical virtual biopsy for the diagnosis of cancer and the in vivo cytometry of leukocytes. Without labeling, HGM can reveal the submicron features of tissues and cells in vivo. For deep imaging depth and minimal invasiveness, people commonly adopt 1100- to 1300-nm femtosecond laser sources. However, those lasers are typically based on bulky oscillators whose performances are sensitive to environmental conditions. We demonstrate a fiber-based 1150-nm femtosecond laser source, with 6.5-nJ pulse energy, 86-fs pulse width, and 11.25-MHz pulse repetition rate. It was obtained by a bismuth borate or magnesium-doped periodically poled lithium niobate (MgO:PPLN) mediated frequency doubling of the 2300-nm solitons, generated from an excitation of 1550-nm femtosecond pulses on a large mode area photonic crystal fiber. Combined with a home-built laser scanned microscope and a tailor-made frame grabber, we achieve a pulse-per-pixel HGM imaging in vivo at a 30-Hz frame rate. This integrated solution has the potential to be developed as a stable HGM system for routine clinical use. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Potential of RapidEye and WorldView-2 Satellite Data for Improving Rice Nitrogen Status Monitoring at Different Growth Stages
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For in-season site-specific nitrogen (N) management of rice to be successful, it is crucially important to diagnose rice N status efficiently across large areas within a short time frame. In recent studies, the FORMOSAT-2 satellite images with traditional blue (B), green (G), red (R), and near-infrared (NIR) wavebands have been used to estimate rice N status due to its high spatial resolution, daily revisit capability, and relatively lower cost. This study aimed to evaluate the potential improvements of RapidEye and WorldView-2 data over FORMOSAT-2 for rice N status monitoring, as the former two sensors provide additional wavelengths besides the traditional four wavebands. Ten site-year N rate experiments were conducted in Jiansanjiang, Heilongjiang Province of Northeast China from 2008 to 2011. Plant samples and field hyperspectral data were collected at three growth stages: panicle initiation (PI), stem elongation (SE), and heading (HE). The canopy-scale hyperspectral data were upscaled to simulate the satellite bands. Vegetation index (VI) analysis, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), and partial least squares regression (PLSR) were performed to derive plant N status indicators. The results indicated that the best-performed VIs calculated from the simulated RapidEye and WorldView-2 bands, especially those based on the red edge (RE) bands, explained significantly more variability for above ground biomass (AGB), plant N uptake (PNU), and nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) estimations than their FORMOSAT-2-based counterparts did, especially at the PI and SE stages. The SMLR and PLSR models based on the WorldView-2 bands generally had the best performance, followed by the ones based on the RapidEye bands. The SMLR results revealed that both the NIR and RE bands were important for N status estimation. In particular, the NIR1 band (760-900 nm from RapidEye or 770-895 nm from WorldView-2) was most important for estimating all the N status indicators. The RE band (690-730 nm or 705-745 nm) improved AGB, PNU, and NNI estimations at all three stages, especially at the PI and SE stages. AGB and PNU were best estimated using data across the stages while plant N concentration (PNC) and NNI were best estimated at the HE stage. The PLSR analysis confirmed the significance of the NIR1 band for AGB, PNU, and NNI estimations at all stages except for the HE stage. It also showed the importance of including extra bands (coastal, yellow, and NIR2) from the WorldView-2 sensor for N status estimation. Overall, both the RapidEye and WorldView-2 data with RE bands improved the results relative to FORMOSAT-2 data. However, the WorldView-2 data with three extra bands in the visible and NIR regions showed the highest potential in estimating rice N status.

TI  - A remote sensing extraction algorithm of enclosure culture area in shallow lakes based on gradient transform
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Mastering the tempo-spatial distribution information of enclosure culture areas is useful for a scientific planning of enclosure culture areas of shallow lakes and making effective measurements to improve water quality. This study took Lake Yangcheng as a study area, which is a typical enclosure culture area in the lower reaches of Yangtze River. An extraction algorithm of remote sensing images is proposed through the gradient transformation of remote sensing data based on the differences between enclosure and non-enclosure areas in spectral space. A high-resolution ZY-3 image was used to acquire the spatial distribution of enclosure culture areas in shallow lakes. The enclosure culture areas extracted using the proposed extraction algorithm and the manual visual interpretation were compared to evaluate the classification accuracy. The results show that the overall classification accuracy reached to 90.66%. The proposed method could be used to monitor the dynamic changes of enclosure culture areas in shallow lakes based on the ZY-3 images.

TI  - Foliage clumping index of main vegetation types in Daxing'an Mountains, Northeast China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The foliage clumping index quantifies the cluster degree of the leaf spatial distribution under random canopy. It is of comparable importance for establishment of ecological models. MODIS BRDF model parameter products (MCD43A1 data) and land cover types (MCD12Q1 data) were used in this study to simulate the reflectivity of the hot spots and dark spots, and calculate the nor. malized difference between hotspot and darkspot (NDHD) based on the Ross-Li semi-empirical model. Least square method was then used to simulate the relationship between NDHD and the foliage clumping index and foliage clumping index products of 500-m resolution in August 2014 were retrieved. Measurements of the foliage clumping index in Daxing'an Mountains were conducted by using the TRAC (Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies) sampling instrument for model validation and analysis. Results showed that it was a feasible algorithm to retrieve clumping index from MCD43A1 product with the correlation of simulated data and the measured data of significance (R-2 = 0.8879). The MODIS near infrared wave band was more sensitive than that on red band to foliage clumping index change. With the increase of the solar zenith angle, the clumping index retrieved by Ross-Li model had a linear increase (R-2 = 0.9699), which indicated that the foliage clumping index related to the solar zenith angle.

TI  - Impact of climate and elevation on snow cover using integrated remote sensing snow products in Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is rapidly altering snow cover conditions in seasonal snow-covered regions of the Tibetan Plateau. This study presents a systematic analysis of the changes in snow cover and its response to climate change on the Tibetan Plateau during the period 2001-2014 using MODIS daily snow cover products under cloud free conditions and AMSR-E SSM/I daily SWE products. The results indicated that 1) the snow-covered area (SCA) tended to increase at elevations below 2000 m.a.s.l., whereas it decreased at elevations above 2000 m.a.s.l. The SCA exhibited a mean decrease over the entire plateau. 2) The SCD and SWE tended to decrease on the Tibetan Plateau, particularly at high elevations. 3) Decreased snowfall and increased rainfall and temperature are the main reasons for the SCD and SWE decrease over the Tibetan Plateau during the period 2001-2014.4) Snowfall had a positive feedback effect, whereas rainfall and temperature both had negative feedback effects on the attenuation of snow cover. 5) With increasing elevation, the positive feedback of snowfall on snow cover increased significantly, whereas the negative feedback effect of rainfall and temperature also increased.

TI  - Using Satellite Observations to Characterize the Response of Estuarine Turbidity Maxima to External Forcing
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the spatial and temporal character of turbidity maxima in the Columbia River Estuary (CRE) using satellite observations. Surface reflectance data measured by the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were calibrated against in situ measurements of surface turbidity (R-2 = 0.85 for 205 measurements). More than 1500 satellite images from 2000 to 2015 were then conditionally sampled to explore the physical processes that drive the spatial distribution of the turbidity field. We find satellite measurements are able to describe seasonal, spring-neap, and spatial features of the estuarine turbidity maxima (ETM) that are not easily observable by other means. System-wide levels of turbidity are most sensitive to river flow and spring-neap tidal range, with a weaker correlation to wind and waves. Maximum surface turbidity is observed in winter during elevated flow from coastal tributaries and remains elevated during the spring freshet of the main stem Columbia. Two ETM with asymmetric along-channel profiles are observed, one in the North Channel and another in the South Channel. Turbidity distributions migrate downstream as tidal range and river flow increase but appear to become topographically trapped near topographic holes at river kilometers 15-20. Hence, depth-sensitive circulation processes like internal asymmetry and gravitational circulation are likely important mechanisms for trapping particles and determining ETM location. These conclusions confirm the theoretical result that along-channel distributions of turbidity should have an asymmetric distribution and emphasize the role of bottom topography.

TI  - Combining Spectral Data and a DSM from UAS-Images for Improved Classification of Non-Submerged Aquatic Vegetation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of aquatic vegetation is an important component in the assessment of freshwater ecosystems. Remote sensing with unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) can provide sub-decimetre-resolution aerial images and is a useful tool for detailed vegetation mapping. In a previous study, non-submerged aquatic vegetation was successfully mapped using automated classification of spectral and textural features from a true-colour UAS-orthoimage with 5-cm pixels. In the present study, height data from a digital surface model (DSM) created from overlapping UAS-images has been incorporated together with the spectral and textural features from the UAS-orthoimage to test if classification accuracy can be improved further. We studied two levels of thematic detail: (a) Growth forms including the classes of water, nymphaeid, and helophyte; and (b) dominant taxa including seven vegetation classes. We hypothesized that the incorporation of height data together with spectral and textural features would increase classification accuracy as compared to using spectral and textural features alone, at both levels of thematic detail. We tested our hypothesis at five test sites (100 m x 100 m each) with varying vegetation complexity and image quality using automated object-based image analysis in combination with Random Forest classification. Overall accuracy at each of the five test sites ranged from 78% to 87% at the growth-form level and from 66% to 85% at the dominant-taxon level. In comparison to using spectral and textural features alone, the inclusion of height data increased the overall accuracy significantly by 4%-21% for growth-forms and 3%-30% for dominant taxa. The biggest improvement gained by adding height data was observed at the test site with the most complex vegetation. Height data derived from UAS-images has a large potential to efficiently increase the accuracy of automated classification of non-submerged aquatic vegetation, indicating good possibilities for operative mapping.

TI  - Patterns of clinical practice for sentinel lymph node biopsy in women with node-negative breast cancer: the results of a national survey in Japan
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is now accepted as the standard of care for axillary staging in women with node-negative breast cancer. Currently, dye, radioisotope (RI), and fluorescence indocyanine green (fICG) are tracers available. Importance of these three tracers has been recognized for SLN biopsy but the trend for SLN mapping has not been reported. Aim of this national wide survey was to evaluate practice patterns of SLN biopsy in Japan.This survey was conducted to examine the clinical practice of SLN biopsy in centers where one or more Japanese Breast Cancer Society (JBCS) board-certified surgeons practice breast cancer care. Their responses were recorded from 1 to 30 Oct 2014 and received by mail or fax in Japan. The questionnaire included three items: the number of breast cancer patients treated per year, the number of SLN biopsy procedures in a single year, and the methods for SLN detection.A total of 412 responses excluding the 63 centers that do not perform the surgery were analyzed. Out of them, 206 (50 %) centers had a gamma probe, 118 (29 %) had an NIR fluorescence imaging system, and both were available at 49 (12 %) of the centers. Neither RI nor fICG was available in 137 (33 %). The dye method was preferentially used in private hospitals. In 412 centers, a total of 36,221 patients underwent SLN biopsy per year and 23,038 (64 %) received radioactive tracer. fICG was co-applied with RI in 83 and 13 % of patients, respectively. Single mapping with RI alone was used in only 4 % of patients. The non-radioactive method was used for routine SLN biopsy in 13,183 (36 %) patients [8533 (24 %) for dye alone and 4650 (12 %) for fICG alone].A radioactive tracer was used in 64 % of women with early breast cancer for SLN biopsy while approximately 24 % received dye alone, which was especially prevalent in PHs. The fICG was used in only 12 % as a non-radioactive method but incentive package for fICG by national health insurance plan could increase the number of NIR imaging systems and improve the sensitivity for SLN biopsy in Japan.

TI  - Organizing earth observation data inside a spatial data infrastructure
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientists as well public institutions dealing with geospatial data often work with a large amount of heterogeneous data deriving from different sources. Without a well-defined, organized structure they face problems in finding and reusing existing data, and as consequence this may cause data inconsistency and storage problems. A catalog system based on the metadata of spatial data facilitates the management of large amount of data and offers service to retrieve, discover and exchange geographic data in an quick and easy fashion. Currently, most online catalogs are more focusing on the geographic data and there has been only few interests in catalogizing Earth observation data, in which in addition the acquisition information matters. This article presents an automatic metadata extraction approach that creates from different optical data deriving from various satellite missions of scientific interest (i.e. MODIS, LANDSAT, RapidEye, Suomi-NPP VIIRS, Sentinel-1A, Sentinel-2A) metadata information, based on an extended model of the standard ISO 19115. The XML schema ISO 19139-2 with the support of gridded and imagery information defined in ISO 19115-2 was examined, and based on the requirements of experts working in the research field of Earth observation the schema was extended. The XML schema ISO 19139-2 and its extension has been deployed as a new schema plugin in the spatial catalog Geonetwork Open Source in order to store all relevant metadata information about satellite data and the appropriate acquisition and processing information in an online catalog. A real-world scenario that is productively used in the EURAC research group institute for Applied Remote Sensing illustrates a workflow management for Earth observation data including data processing, metadata extraction, generation and distribution.

TI  - Putting people in the picture: Combining big location-based social media data and remote sensing imagery for enhanced contextual urban information in Shanghai
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a set of interrelated processes; the most visible among them are changes in the built-up environment. We relate those changes to human activity as expressed by online social media messages. This approach might shed light on urban dynamics currently intractable through existing datasets and methodologies. Microwave remote sensing images are used to identify urban built-up areas and changes within those areas in an objective way, while geocoded mobile social media messages deliver valuable information about human activity and the vitality found in those areas. A tithe-series stack of 36 TerraSAR-X Stripmap images and roughly six million social media messages were processed, classified, and visually and quantitatively analyzed for an experiment in Shanghai. We derived four possible cases of land classification by combining the results of both sources to a single raster layer at a 400 m cell size. Quantifying these cases in a 2-by-2 confusion matrix shows positive and negative matches between built-up areas and social media messages. We see that correlation of positive matches is 72%. A combination of remotely sensed and social media data is a step towards a more granular analysis of urbanization processes than is possible from either data source alone. We put people in the picture of traditional remote sensing analysis. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

T2  - AQUATIC ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Overabundant growth of emergent lacustrine plants can cause biodiversity, ecosystem service and economic loss. The two-basined Wuchang Lake is a typical small shallow lake within the Yangtze River floodplain. Expansion of the emergent macrophyte Zizania latifolia at Wuchang Lower Lake (to 49 km(2) in area, c. 87.0% of Lower Lake) has increasingly denied the local community open water for fishing since the 1980s. To better understand the causes of these changes and potential remediation, we used annual Landsat imagery from 1975 to 2012 to determine the patterns of expansion between years as well as the effects of water levels in different seasons and trophic status on the annual extent of macrophytes in the Lower Lake. These analyses showed that: (1) Z. latifolia progressively covered the Lower Lake, while remaining confined to one inlet in the Upper Lake; (2) despite the generally increasing trend, there were obvious annual variations in area of Z. latifolia; (3) variation of water level in spring contributed to between-year variation in area and was significantly negatively correlated with expansion in Z. latifolia. Based on these results, to reduce the expansion in Z. latifolia, we recommend maintaining spring Lower Lake water levels above at least at 11.6 m and better at 12 m, cutting shoots in June and July, with subsequent shoot removal in autumn.

TI  - Collaborative Data Downloading by Using Inter-Satellite Links in LEO Satellite Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite systems have attracted great attention from academic and industrial communities in recent years. There are many satellites that have been launched for weather forecast, environment monitoring, and target surveillance. One important task of the satellites is to download the data they have collected in space to the ground servers via earth stations (ESs). Since satellites move at high speed along their own orbits and have very limited contact time with ESs, satellites may not be able to download all the data they have to the ground on time. In this paper, we propose a collaborative scheme that allows satellites to offload data among themselves using inter-satellite links (ISLs) before they come into contact with the ES, such that satellites will carry the right amount of data according to the length of their contact time with the ES and the throughput of data downloading at the ES is maximized. We develop an iterative optimization algorithm that jointly schedules data offload among the satellites and data downloading from satellites to the ES. Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The simulation results show that the data downloading throughput by using ISL data offload can be increased significantly. In many cases, the throughput reaches close to 100% of the capacity of the ES.

TI  - Human Activity Influences on Vegetation Cover Changes in Beijing, China, from 2000 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For centuries, the rapid development of human society has already made human activity the dominant factor in the terrestrial ecosystem. As the city of greatest importance in China, the capital Beijing has experienced eco-environmental changes with unprecedented economic and population growth during the past few decades. To better understand the ecological transition and its correlations in Beijing, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were used to investigate vegetation coverage changes using a dimidiate pixel model. Piecewise linear regression, bivariate-partial correlation analysis, and factor analysis were applied to the probing of the relationship between vegetation coverage changes and climatic/human-induced factors. The results showed that from 2000 to 2005, 2005 to 2010, and 2010 to 2015, Beijing experienced both restoration (6.33%, 10.08%, and 12.81%, respectively) and degradation (13.62%, 9.35%, and 9.49%, respectively). The correlation analysis results between climate and vegetation changes demonstrated that from 2000 to 2015, both the multi-year annual mean temperature (r = -0.819, p < 0.01) and the multi-year annual mean precipitation (r = 0.653, p < 0.05) had a significantly correlated relationship with vegetation change. The Beijing-Tianjin Sandstorm Source Control Project (BTSSCP) has shown beneficial spatial effects on vegetation restoration; the total effectiveness in conservation areas (84.94 in 2000-2010) was much better than non-BTSSCP areas (34.34 in 2000-2010). The most contributory socioeconomic factors were the population (contribution = 54.356%) and gross domestic product (GDP) (contribution = 30.677%). The population showed a significantly negative correlation with the overall vegetation coverage (r = -0.684, p < 0.05). The GDP was significantly negatively correlated with vegetation in Tongzhou, Daxing, Central city, Fangshan, Shunyi, and Changping (r = -0.601, p < 0.01), while positively related in Huairou, Miyun, Pinggu, Mentougou and Yanqing (r = 0.614, p < 0.01). These findings confirm that human activity is a very significant factor in impacting and explaining vegetation changes, and that some socioeconomic influences on vegetation coverage are highly spatially heterogeneous, based on the context of different areas.

AB  - The validation study of leaf area index (LAI) products over rugged surfaces not only gives additional insights into data quality of LAI products, but deepens understanding of uncertainties regarding land surface process models depended on LAI data over complex terrain. This study evaluated the performance of MODIS and GLASS LAI products using the intercomparison and direct validation methods over southwestern China. The spatio-temporal consistencies, such as the spatial distributions of LAI products and their statistical relationship as a function of topographic indices, time, and vegetation types, respectively, were investigated through intercomparison between MODIS and GLASS products during the period 2011-2013. The accuracies and change ranges of these two products were evaluated against available LAI reference maps over 10 sampling regions which standed for typical vegetation types and topographic gradients in southwestern China.The results show that GLASS LAI exhibits higher percentage of good quality data (i.e. successful retrievals) and smoother temporal profiles than MODIS LAI. The percentage of successful retrievals for MODIS and GLASS is vulnerable to topographic indices, especially to relief amplitude. Besides, the two products do not capture seasonal dynamics of crop, especially in spring over heterogeneously hilly regions. The yearly mean LAI differences between MODIS and GLASS are within +/- 0.5 for 64.70% of the total retrieval pixels over southwestern China. The spatial distribution of mean differences and temporal profiles of these two products are inclined to be dominated by vegetation' types other than topographic indices. The spatial and temporal consistency of these two products is good over most area of grasses/cereal crops; however, it is poor for evergreen broadleaf forest. MODIS presents more reliable change range of LAI than GLASS through comparison with fine resolution reference maps over most of sampling regions. The accuracies of direct validation are obtained for GLASS LAI (r=0.35, RMSE = 1.72, mean bias = 0.71) and MODIS LAI (r = 0.49, RMSE = 1.75, mean bias = 0.67). GLASS performs similarly to MODIS, but may be marginally inferior to MODIS based on our direct validation results. The validation experience demonstrates the necessity and importance of topographic consideration for LAI estimation over mountain areas. Considerable attention will be paid to the improvements of surface reflectance, retrieval algorithm and land cover types so as to enhance the quality of LAI products in topographically complex terrain.

TI  - Monitoring of wetland inundation dynamics in the Delmarva Peninsula using Landsat time-series imagery from 1985 to 2011
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands provide important ecosystem services, the provision of which is largely controlled by fluctuations in inundation and soil saturation. Inundation is highly dynamic and can vary substantially through time in response to multiple drivers, including precipitation and evapotranspiration. This research focused on developing a practical and effective framework for regional, long-term monitoring of wetland inundation dynamics using airborne LiDAR intensity data (Lang et al., 2013) and Landsat time-series imagery. Subpixel water fraction (SWF) maps indicating the percent of surface water within each 30-m pixel were generated on an annual basis over the entire Delmarva Peninsula on the East Coast of the United States from 1985 to 2011. Comprehensive accuracy assessments of the SWF maps were conducted using historical high-resolution aerial photography to determine the reference condition. The assessment resulted in an estimated root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.78% for the sample of open water areas (mean SWF was similar to 40% for this region of the map). Moreover, a separate accuracy assessment targeting inundation in wetlands (i.e. presence or absence of water) yielded an overall accuracy of 93%. Accuracies derived indicated that Landsat data can be calibrated to accurately extract long-term water information at the regional scale. Characteristics of inundation were examined with respect to different wetland types defined by water regime and dominant vegetation types, as well as different physical drivers. Results showed that tidal wetlands typically exhibited more intensive inundation than nontidal wetlands, and a higher degree of inundation was associated with emergent wetlands compared to wetland areas dominated by woody vegetation. Analysis of change drivers revealed that tide exerted a statistically significant influence on coastal inundation with r(2) values of 32-36% and p < 0.01, whereas inundation changes in inland wetland areas were in part driven by precipitation with r(2) values of 25-34% and p < 0.08. Because an up-to-date archive of Landsat imagery is globally available and LiDAR data are becoming increasingly more affordable, the developed framework can be easily implemented to generate a continuous inundation record in many regions of the globe to assist in ongoing and future studies focused on wetland hydrology and wetland management.

TI  - Determining oxidative stress and EROD activity in dab (<i>Limanda limanda</i>) in the North and Baltic Seas
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The North and Baltic Seas are heavily trafficked marine areas with extensive anthropogenic activities, including cargo and fishing vessels, waste dumping, oil platforms, industrial activities and contamination from coastal runoff. In order to evaluate the environmental health of these regions, we used the demersal fish dab (Limanda limanda) as a sentinel species. The current study used well-established biomarkers for PAH exposure and oxidative stress, measuring EROD activity, the acute antioxidant response as well as oxidation of proteins detected as protein carbonyl levels. Results show the strongest biomarker results in an area with extensive oil drilling, where dab displayed high levels of EROD activities. This was also seen in dab captured in the Baltic Sea where elevated levels of oxidized glutathione and a trend towards higher EROD activity were observed. The obtained results did, however, not indicate a coherent biomarker response. The study was conducted off shore where many areas have presumably low levels of pollutants, and we could detect minor effects using the biomarker approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Management of the clinically node negative neck in squamous cell carcinoma of the maxilla
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The management of the clinically node negative (N0) neck in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the maxilla (MSCC) is a matter of debate. In this retrospective cohort study the incidence of occult metastases is determined in clinically N0 MSCCs, as well as histopathological factors associated with occult metastases.Patients and methods: 95 patients with clinically N0 MSCCs had maxillectomy. 18 patients with elective treatment of the neck were excluded. The remaining 77 patients followed a 'watch and wait' strategy for the neck and were included in this study. The incidence of occult metastases was calculated and Cox regression analysis was used to assess the predictive and prognostic value of clinical and histopathological parameters.Results: Occult metastases occurred in 14.3% (11/77) in the whole cohort and in 19.0% (11/58) in T2-T4 clinically N0 MSCC. Patients with T4 clinically N0 MSCC, showed the highest rate of occult metastases (24.1%). 45.5% of the occult metastases developed in the contralateral neck. The hazard ratio to develop occult metastasis was 5.39 (p = 0.017) for perineural growth and 11.12 (p = 0.003) for perivascular invasion. Salvage for cervical recurrence was poor at 40%.Conclusion: We recommend elective treatment of the neck or improved diagnostics to detect occult metastases in T2-T4 clinically N0 MSCC or when the biopsy specimen shows perineural growth or perivascular invasion. Since the contralateral neck was involved in 45.5% of the regional recurrences, we emphasize the importance of bilateral neck management. Improved diagnostics, like sentinel node biopsy, could possibly further reduce occult metastatic disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cross-Sectional View of Atmospheric Aerosols over an Urban Location in Central India
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface, column and vertically resolved variations of physical and optical properties of atmospheric aerosol over Hyderabad, a tropical urban location in central India are explored on the basis of ground based and satellite retrieved data. Annual mean aerosol optical depth (tau) observed with Microtops sun-photometer is 0.61 +/- 0.07 and seasonally it varied from 0.71 +/- 0.06 in pre-monsoon to 0.55 +/- 0.05 in winter. Aerosol types are categorized based on angstrom ngstrom exponent (alpha) and t relations; revealed that the study region is dominated by mixed type (MT) aerosol followed by urban/industrial aerosols under high tau (HUI) category. A consistent diurnal variation of black carbon (BC) is observed irrespective of seasonal variation with annual BC mass concentration is found to be 9.7 +/- 1.9 mu g m(-3). During Telangana Survey day, which was the least pollutant day showed a reduction of 75% BC concentration during day time in comparison to five years average values, indicating the influence of anthropogenic effect over Hyderabad. Vertical information's on aerosol are analyzed using Cloud Aerosol Lidar Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and ground based Lidar (LAMP) data. LAMP data analysis shows a significant elevated aerosol layer up to 4 km during pre-monsoon while aerosols are confined below 3 km during post-monsoon and winter. Long term CALIPSO observations revealed that during post-monsoon to winter, the study area is dominated (similar to 60%) by 'urban' aerosol; while during pre-monsoon period similar to 75% of the aerosol type belongs to 'dusty mix' category. A decline in short wave flux at the top of the atmosphere (0.66 Wm(-2) yr(-1)) is observed, as revealed by long term Clouds and Earths Radiant Energy System (CERES) data analysis with higher decline rate observed in winter (1 Wm(-2) yr(-1)) followed by pre-monsoon (0.8 Wm(-2) yr(-1)).

TI  - Implicit Regularization for Reconstructing 3D Building Rooftop Models Using Airborne LiDAR Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With rapid urbanization, highly accurate and semantically rich virtualization of building assets in 3D become more critical for supporting various applications, including urban planning, emergency response and location-based services. Many research efforts have been conducted to automatically reconstruct building models at city-scale from remotely sensed data. However, developing a fully-automated photogrammetric computer vision system enabling the massive generation of highly accurate building models still remains a challenging task. One the most challenging task for 3D building model reconstruction is to regularize the noises introduced in the boundary of building object retrieved from a raw data with lack of knowledge on its true shape. This paper proposes a data-driven modeling approach to reconstruct 3D rooftop models at city-scale from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. The focus of the proposed method is to implicitly derive the shape regularity of 3D building rooftops from given noisy information of building boundary in a progressive manner. This study covers a full chain of 3D building modeling from low level processing to realistic 3D building rooftop modeling. In the element clustering step, building-labeled point clouds are clustered into homogeneous groups by applying height similarity and plane similarity. Based on segmented clusters, linear modeling cues including outer boundaries, intersection lines, and step lines are extracted. Topology elements among the modeling cues are recovered by the Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) technique. The regularity of the building rooftop model is achieved by an implicit regularization process in the framework of Minimum Description Length (MDL) combined with Hypothesize and Test (HAT). The parameters governing the MDL optimization are automatically estimated based on Min-Max optimization and Entropy-based weighting method. The performance of the proposed method is tested over the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed method can robustly produce accurate regularized 3D building rooftop models.

TI  - Activity of <i>Culicoides</i> spp. (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) inside and outside of livestock stables in late winter and spring
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Culicoides Latreille, 1809 midge species are the putative vectors of Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in Europe. To gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of the diseases, basic knowledge about the overwintering of the vectors is needed. Therefore, we investigated culicoid activity in relation to air temperature at livestock stables during late winter and spring season. Ceratopogonids were captured weekly indoors and outdoors on three cattle farms, three horse farms and one sheep farm in the federal state of Brandenburg, Germany between January and May, 2015 by BG-Sentinel UV-light suction traps. First seasonal activity was measured inside a sheep barn and cattle stables in mid-March, suggesting the existence of a preceding vector-free period. The first species at all trapping sites were members of the Obsoletus Complex followed by Culicoides punctatus (Meigen), 1804 and Culicoides pulicaris (Linnaeus), 1758 simultaneously. In total, 160 collections were made, including 3465 Culicoides specimens with 2790 (80.6%) of them being members of the Obsoletus Complex. The remaining 675 individuals belonged to six other culicoid species. 59.8% of all Culicoides were collected indoors, and almost five times as many midges were sampled on cattle farms as on horse farms. Cattle farms harboured seven species while only two species were found on the horse and the sheep farms, respectively. Temperatures, husbandry practises and the presence/quality of potential breeding sites might be responsible for the difference in species and numbers of caught specimens between livestock holdings.

TI  - Assessment of Three Methods for Near Real-Time Estimation of Leaf Area Index From AVHRR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near real-time (NRT) estimation of leaf area index (LAI) is essential for monitoring rapid surface process changes within operational systems. This paper assesses the performances of three methods for the NRT estimation of LAI: 1) Whittaker (Whit); 2) Gaussian process model (GPM); and 3) the climatological temporal smoothing and gap filling (CTSGF). The methods were evaluated using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer time series over a selection of BELMANIP2 sites representative of seasonal patterns of global biome vegetated areas and under varying level of noise and missing observations (gaps). A simulation experiment was designed to evaluate the predictive capabilities of the three methods with an emphasis on the global and local structure of missing observations in the time series. The results show that the three methods achieve similar performances (RMSE < 0.4) when the fraction of missing data over the whole time series is lower than 65% or the length of gaps is smaller than 10 days. Conversely, for fraction of gaps higher than 65% or periods of gaps longer than 10 days, CTSGF is found to provide more accurate (RMSE < 0.4 up to 60 days with missing data) NRT estimates of LAI than Whit and GPM. CTSGF uses the baseline seasonal cycle derived from the interannual median values of LAI to fill gaps in the time series and improve the NRT projections. Our findings support the operational use of the CTSGF algorithm for NRT estimation of biophysical products at the global scale.

TI  - Distribution of a Coastal Delphinid Under the Impact of Long-Term Habitat Loss: Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins off Taiwan's West Coast
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - For the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, an obligatory shallow water inshore species, the degradation of coastal habitats can have major consequences for population persistence and distribution. Off Taiwan's west coast (TWC), these animals are predominantly seen in two areas separated by a stretch of coast with only sporadic sightings, suggesting that either (a) only two sectors of TWC offer sufficiently suitable habitat for the dolphins or (b) a recent environmental change limits the population connectivity. We measured the extent of habitat destruction due to land reclamation off TWC since 1972 using a habitat integrity index (HII) and applied general linear models (GLMs) to compare HII with sightings of dolphins per unit effort (SPUE). While early Landsat data reveal extensive continuity and diversity of coastal habitats, by 2013, a total area of over 222 km(2) was lost to land reclamation (23 % of dolphin habitat and 40 % of dolphin foraging habitat). GLM analysis showed a significant relationship between HII and SPUE; the lower HII the lower SPUE, indicating that off TWC, the current discontinuous distribution of humpback dolphins is likely due to a different extent of habitat degradation rather than natural patchiness of their environment. We emphasize that the history of coastal habitat alteration must be considered when interpreting cetacean distribution from survey data and formulating habitat management decisions, especially in areas experiencing extensive anthropogenic coastal change.

TI  - Bohai Sea Ice Parameter Estimation Based on Thermodynamic Ice Model and Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimate two essential sea ice parametersnamely, sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea ice thickness (SIT)for the Bohai Sea using a combination of a thermodynamic sea ice model and Earth observation (EO) data from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and microwave radiometer. We compare the SIC and SIT estimation results with in-situ measurements conducted in the study area and estimates based on independent EO data from near-infrared/optical instruments. These comparisons suggest that the SAR-based discrimination between sea ice and open-water works well, and areas of thinner and thicker ice can be distinguished. A larger comprehensive training dataset is needed to set up an operational algorithm for the estimation of SIC and SIT.

TI  - Long-term outcome of 6-month maintenance chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children
T2  - LEUKEMIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), excess shortening of maintenance therapy resulted in high relapse rate, as shown by our previous trial, TCCSG L92-13, in which maintenance therapy was terminated at 1 year from initiation of treatment. In this study, we aimed to confirm the long-term outcome of L92-13, and to identify who can or cannot be cured by shorter duration of maintenance therapy. To obtain sentinel cytogenetics information that had been missed before, we performed genetic analysis with genomic microarray and target intron-capture sequencing from diagnostic bone marrow smear. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 10 years from the end of therapy was 66.0 +/- 2.8%. Females (n= 138) had better DFS (74.6 +/- 3.7%) than males (n= 142, 57.5 +/- 4.2%, P= 0.002). Patients with TCF3-PBX1 (n= 11) and ETV6-RUNX1 (n= 16) had excellent DFS (90.9 +/- 8.7% and 93.8 +/- 6.1%, respectively), whereas high hyperdiploidy (n= 23) was the most unfavorable subgroup, with 56.6 +/- 10.3% of DFS. Short duration of therapy can cure more than half of pediatric ALL, especially females, TCF3-PBX1 and ETV6-RUNX1. Our retrospective observations suggest a gender/karyotype inhomogeneity on the impact of brief therapy.

TI  - Airborne Laser Scanning Based Forest Inventory: Comparison of Experimental Results for the Perm Region, Russia and Prior Results from Finland
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne laser scanning (ALS) based stand level forest inventory has been used in Finland and other Nordic countries for several years. In the Russian Federation, ALS is not extensively used for forest inventory purposes, despite a long history of research into the use of lasers for forest measurement that dates back to the 1970s. Furthermore, there is also no generally accepted ALS-based methodology that meets the official inventory requirements of the Russian Federation. In this paper, a method developed for Finnish forest conditions is applied to ALS-based forest inventory in the Perm region of Russia. Sparse Bayesian regression is used with ALS data, SPOT satellite images and field reference data to estimate five forest parameters for three species groups (pine, spruce, deciduous): total mean volume, basal area, mean tree diameter, mean tree height, and number of stems per hectare. Parameter estimates are validated at both the plot level and stand level, and the validation results are compared to results published for three Finnish test areas. Overall, relative root mean square errors (RMSE) were higher for forest parameters in the Perm region than for the Finnish sites at both the plot and stand level. At the stand level, relative RMSE generally decreased with increasing stand size and was lower when considered overall than for individual species groups.

TI  - Clinical and microbiological features of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella associated with HIV-infected patients, Gauteng Province, South Africa
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to define factors associated with HIV-infected versus uninfected patients with invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) and factors associated with mortality, which are inadequately described in Africa.Laboratory-based surveillance for iNTS was undertaken. At selected sentinel sites, clinical data (age, sex, HIV status, severity of illness, and outcome) were collected.Surveillance was conducted in Gauteng, South Africa, from 2003 to 2013. Clinical and microbiological differences between HIV-infected and uninfected patients were defined and risk factors for mortality established.Of 4886 iNTS infections in Gauteng from 2003 to 2013, 3106 (63.5%) were diagnosed at sentinel sites. Among persons with iNTS infections, more HIV-infected persons were aged >= 5 years (chi(2)= 417.6; P< 0.001) and more HIV-infected children were malnourished (chi(2)=5.8; P=0.02). Although 760 (30.6%) patients died, mortality decreased between 2003 [97/263 (36.9%)] and 2013 [926/120 (21.7%)]. On univariate analysis, mortality was associated with patients aged 25 to 49 years [odds ratio (OR)=2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.7-2.7; P< 0.001 and >= 50 years (OR=3.0; 95% CI=2.2-4.1; P< 0.001) compared with children< 5 years, HIV-infected patients (OR=2.4; 95% CI=1.7-3.4; P< 0.001), and severe illness (OR=5.4; 95% CI=3.6-8.1; P< 0.001). On multivariate analysis, mortality was associated with patients aged =50 years [adjusted OR (AOR)=3.6, 95% CI=2.1-6.1, P< 0.001] and severe illness (AOR=6.3; 95% CI=3.8-10.5; P< 0.001).Mortality due to iNTS in Gauteng remains high primarily due to disease severity. Interventions must be aimed at predisposing conditions, including HIV, other immune-suppressive conditions, and malignancy.

TI  - Land-cover classification and analysis of change using machine-learning classifiers and multi-temporal remote sensing imagery
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent human activity and rapid urbanization have led to an assortment of environmental issues. Monitoring land-cover change is critical to efficient environmental management and urban planning. The current study had two objectives. The first was to compare pixel-based random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) classifier methods and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm both in pixel-based and object-based approaches for classification of land-cover in a heterogeneous landscape for 2010. The second was to examine spatio-temporal land-cover change over the last two decades (1990-2010) using Landsat data. This study found that the object-based SVM classifier is the most accurate with an overall classification accuracy of 93.54% and a kappa value of 0.88. A post-classification change detection algorithm was used to determine the trend of change between land-cover classes. The most significant change from 1990 to 2010 was caused by the expansion of built-up areas. In addition to the net changes, the rate of annual change for each phenomenon was calculated to obtain a better understanding of the process of change. Between 1990 and 2010, an average of 4.53% of lands turned to the built-up annually and there was an annual decrease of about 0.81% in natural land. If the current trend of change continues, regardless of the actions of sustainable development, drastic declines in natural areas will ensue. The results of this study can be a valuable baseline for land-cover managers in the region to better understand the current situation and adopt appropriate strategies for management of land-cover.

AB  - Decisions on antibiotic-resistant infection (ARI) prevention in dynamic health care settings should be agile and target the right process at the right time. Health information technologies can aid the recognition of high-risk situations for ARI transmission and timely facilitate operators' situational awareness (SA) in various military and civilian health care locations or transport platforms. High SA is one of the significant predictors of better performance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the developed health information visualization (VIZ) on the users' SA regarding situations when risks of ARI transmission and exposure are high. The enrolled 19 subjects assessed the proposed VIZ artifacts representing 1 scenario, compared the VIZ effectiveness against the currently employed local methods, and reported their SA (perception and comprehension) with the use of a pre-and post-self-rating questionnaire. The results showed that the VIZ significantly increased SA in the study subjects and revealed the importance of communicating the risk of exposure to ARIs. The VIZ enabled the participants to quickly acknowledge the high-risk individuals (super-spreaders), locations (hot spots), and biosafety (deficient infection prevention). The study concluded that SA-oriented technologies may be promising for promoting better infection prevention practices.

TI  - Utilizing Landsat-8 data in mapping of sabkha, mangroves, and land covers in Jizan coastal plain, southwestern Saudi Arabia
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital image processing methods were applied on Landsat-8 data to differentiate different natural land covers and urban areas in Jizan, Red Sea Coast, Saudi Arabia. The computer-aided works were combined with field investigation to confirm the achieved results. The false-color image with bands 5, 4, and 3 in RGB, respectively, was found useful in delineating between sabkha and non-sabkha areas. The sabkha areas are characterized by hues of light brown color, and the non-sabkha areas have hues of light grey to light bluish color. A false-color image with bands 5, 6, and 4 clearly differentiates between mangroves in hues of red color and other vegetation in hues of orange color. The principal component analysis (PCA) image clearly shows the wadi drainage and estuary in several shades of green color; the coastal sabkha areas have hues of blue, which range from light blue (denoting dry sabkha) to dark blue (denoting wet sabkha), and sand dunes are shown in fuchsia color. The results of this study identify features such as urban populated areas, land vegetation, moisture intensity in the sediments, shallow and deep waters, reef islands, sabkha and non-sabkha areas, salt dome, shores, tidal flats, wadi drainage, mangrove habitat, the width of shallow seawater, and land-seawater contacts. Several maps are produced in this study showing the distribution of the abovementioned features. These maps will be useful as a base reference for further studies by geologists, engineering geologists, hydrogeologists, and governmental decision leaders.

TI  - Biogeochemical properties of sinking particles in the southwestern part of the East Sea (Japan Sea)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the biological pump system in the East Sea (Japan Sea) by conducting an analysis of the total particle flux, biogenic material composition, and carbon isotope ratios of sinking particles. The samples were collected for one year starting from March 2011 using time-series sediment traps deployed at depths of 1040 m and 2280 m on bottom-tethered mooring at Station EC1 (3733 degrees N, 131.45 degrees E; 2300 m water depth) in the Ulleung Basin (UB), southwestern part of the East Sea. The temporal variation in the particulate organic carbon (POC) flux at 1000 m shows a good relationship with the primary production in the corresponding surface water. The ratio of POC flux at 1000 m to satellite-based primary production in the corresponding region in the UB was similar to 3%, which is comparable to the values of 2 to 5% estimated from previous studies of other part of the East Sea. The lithogenic material accounted for >17% of the sinking particles at 1000 m and for a larger fraction of 40 to 60% at 2280 m. The radiocarbon contents of the sinking POC at both trap depths imply the additional supply of aged POC, with a much greater contribution at 2280 m. Overall, the particle flux in the deep interior of the East Sea appears to be controlled by the supply of complex sources, including aeolian input, the lateral supply of resuspended sediments, and biological production in the surface water.

TI  - Safety and Effectiveness of Sodium Stibogluconate and Paromomycin Combination for the Treatment of Visceral Leishmaniasis in Eastern Africa: Results from a Pharmacovigilance Programme
T2  - CLINICAL DRUG INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction In 2010, WHO recommended a new first-line treatment for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Eastern Africa. The new treatment, a combination of intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) sodium stibogluconate (SSG) and IM paromomycin (PM) was an improvement over SSG monotherapy, the previous first-line VL treatment in the region. To monitor the new treatment's safety and effectiveness in routine clinical practice a pharmacovigilance (PV) programme was developed.Methods A prospective PV cohort was developed. Regulatory approval was obtained in Sudan, Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia. Twelve sentinel sites sponsored by the Ministries of Health, M,decins Sans FrontiSres (MSF) and Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) participated. VL patients treated using the new treatment were consented and included in a common registry that collected demographics, baseline clinical characteristics, adverse events, serious adverse events and treatment outcomes. Six-monthly periodic safety update reports (PSUR) were prepared and reviewed by a PV steering committee.Results Overall 3126 patients were enrolled: 1962 (62.7%) from Sudan, 652 (20.9%) from Kenya, 322 (10.3%) from Ethiopia and 190 (6.1%) from Uganda. Patients were mostly male children (68.1%, median age 11 years) with primary VL (97.8%). SSG-PM initial cure rate was 95.1%; no geographical differences were noted. HIV/VL co-infected patients and patients older than 50 years had initial cure rates of 56 and 81.4%, respectively, while 1063 (34%) patients had at least one adverse event (AE) during treatment and 1.92% (n = 60) had a serious adverse event (SAE) with a mortality of 1.0% (n = 32). There were no serious unexpected adverse drug reactions.Conclusions This first regional PV programme in VL supports SSG-PM combination as first-line treatment for primary VL in Eastern Africa. SSG-PM was effective and safe except in HIV/VL co-infected or older patients. Active PV surveillance of targeted safety, effectiveness and key VL outcomes such us VL relapse, PKDL and HIV/VL co-infection should continue and PV data integrated to national and WHO PV databases.

AB  - Mucosal melanoma in the region of head and neck is a rare and aggressive tumor. Diagnosis is usually late due to the quick, vertical spread of the disease, the a lack of early or specific signs and because of the location of lesions. The mainstay of treatment is radical surgical resection. The value of sentinel lymph node biopsy, lymphadenectomy and radiotherapy is still unclear. The objective of this study is to report five patients with primer malignant mucosal melanoma and briefly summarize the current literature of the etiology, staging and treatment of the disease.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating the application of the sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) in gynecological cancers among German hospitals.Between March and June 2016 an online questionnaire on SLND in gynecologic cancers was sent by email to all German gynecologic cancer centers, all university hospitals and general hospitals for which an email address was available. The survey contained 61 questions regarding the SLND in vulvar, cervical, endometrial and ovarian cancer.In total, 63 clinics, including 13 (20.6%) university hospitals, 28 (44.4%) hospitals offering maximum care and 22 (34.9%) general hospitals, responded to the questionnaire. Most clinics (46/63, 73%) performed SLND in vulvar cancer with a median amount of 7.8 (range 1-43) SLND per year. 56.5% of the clinics included patients according to the German national guidelines and performed ultrastaging of negative SLN. Furthermore, 18/63 (28.5%) of the responding clinics applied SLND in cervical cancer including 7 (77.8%) centers which conducted isolated SLND without radical pelvic lymph node dissection (LND). Preoperative imaging with planar lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) was applied in 12/18 (66.7%) of the clinics. SLND in endometrial cancer was reported by 4/63 (6.4%) hospitals. Three of them (75%) regularly performed a subsequent radical pelvic LND. One clinic (1.5%) reported SLND in ovarian cancer in combination with radical LND.Especially in vulvar and cervical cancer, isolated SLND appears to be partially implemented in the routine surgical treatment. However, this survey illustrates a wide heterogeneity regarding inclusion criteria and application of the SLND approach.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Estimates Derived Using Multi-Platform Remote Sensing in a Semiarid Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key component of the water balance, especially in arid and semiarid regions. The current study takes advantage of spatially-distributed, near real-time information provided by satellite remote sensing to develop a regional scale ET product derived from remotely-sensed observations. ET is calculated by scaling PET estimated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products with downscaled soil moisture derived using the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite and a second order polynomial regression formula. The MODis-Soil Moisture ET (MOD-SMET) estimates are validated using four flux tower sites in southern Arizona USA, a calibrated empirical ET model, and model output from Version 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). Validation against daily eddy covariance ET indicates correlations between 0.63 and 0.83 and root mean square errors (RMSE) between 40 and 96 W/m(2). MOD-SMET estimates compare well to the calibrated empirical ET model, with a -0.14 difference in correlation between sites, on average. By comparison, NLDAS-2 models underestimate daily ET compared to both flux towers and MOD-SMET estimates. Our analysis shows the MOD-SMET approach to be effective for estimating ET. Because it requires limited ancillary ground-based data and no site-specific calibration, the method is applicable to regions where ground-based measurements are not available.

TI  - The image of the people, its heroes and antiheroes in Soviet painting of the 1920s-1930s (themes of the Revolution and the Civil War)
T2  - VOPROSY PSIKHOLOGII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to themes of revolution and Civil War in Russia. Paintings which embodied this theme are considered from the perspective of the psychology of art. Using in this field the psychological approach of Lev S. Vygotsky and the concept of image typical Suite of Sergei M. Eisenstein in the characteristics of the image of the people in the movie, the authors bring together methods of analysis, which jointly correspond to the Russian scholar method formed in the same historical period as the Soviet art. The tragic theme of a series of paintings - correspond to the historical reality - is revealed. The authors show that one group of art works depicting the people who suffered in the October Revolution and the Civil War, written in the genre of a kind of memorial, or in a dramatically powerful manner. These genre varieties were expressed by means of image typical Suite. So here "the outside" content (plot, according to the theory of L.S. Vygotsky) to be transmitted to the state and/or action, and a reflection was in "the internal" one (emotional and psychological). Another group of works - created at the battle subject - differs grand and propagandistic composition or romantically and effective one. It characterized the coincidence of the original idea (plot) and its interpretation (of the story). The third group of creations depicted the figures of executioners and conquerors opposing of images of national heroes. This group was based on "conflict clashes" of the plot and story (L.S. Vygotsky), as the plot was expressed by means of the most exquisite landscape paintings, and the plot was identified on the process of the deformation of moral norms. This confrontation gave to the painters the opportunity to conceptualize the tragic history of the people as a great mental value, which they summarized in the conceptual psychology and philosophical idea - "the image of the people as opposed to his heroes and enemies". As a result, the authors of this paper focused their attention to the disclosure of the experiences of the people who find themselves an important source of collectivist worldview.

TI  - Analysis of Errors in Estimating Changes in Water Body Areas by Satellite Data: Case Study of Thermokarst Lakes in Yamal Peninsula
T2  - WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Errors in the estimates of changes in the area of individual water bodies and their groups have been studied in the central part of Yamal Peninsula based on Landsat satellite imagery. For the first time, the overlap zone of two satellite images along satellite trajectory has been proposed for the choice of the most efficient algorithm for identifying water surfaces and estimating the errors in water body area measurements. Empirical equations have been derived to describe the relationship between the error in estimates of changes in the areas of individual water bodies and their groups and the areas themselves. The seasonal and many-year variations in water body areas have been identified in the zone of intense construction of facilities at the Bovanenkovskoe oil-gas condensate field.

TI  - A Combination of Feature Tracking and Pattern Matching with Optimal Parametrization for Sea Ice Drift Retrieval from SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice drift strongly influences sea ice thickness distribution and indirectly controls air-sea ice-ocean interactions. Estimating sea ice drift over a large range of spatial and temporal scales is therefore needed to characterize the properties of sea ice dynamics and to better understand the ongoing changes of the climate in the polar regions. An efficient algorithm is developed for processing SAR data based on the combination of feature tracking (FT) and pattern matching (PM) techniques. The main advantage of the combination is that the FT rapidly provides the first guess estimate of ice drift in a few unevenly distributed keypoints, and PM accurately provides drift vectors on a regular or irregular grid. Thorough sensitivity analysis of the algorithm is performed, and optimal sets of parameters are suggested for retrieval of sea ice drift on various spatial and temporal scales. The algorithm has rather high accuracy (error is below 300 m) and high speed (the time for one image pair is 1 min), which opens new opportunities for studying sea ice kinematic processes. The ice drift can now be efficiently observed in the Lagrangian coordinate system on an irregular grid and, therefore, used for pointwise evaluation of the models running on unstructured meshes or for assimilation into Lagrangian models.

TI  - IMPROVED SURVIVAL IN MALE MELANOMA PATIENTS IN THE ERA OF SENTINEL NODE BIOPSY
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims: Sentinel node biopsy is a standard method for nodal staging in patients with clinically localized cutaneous melanoma, but the survival advantage of sentinel node biopsy remains unsolved. The aim of this case-control study was to investigate the survival benefit of sentinel node biopsy.Materials and Methods: A total of 305 prospective melanoma patients undergoing sentinel node biopsy were compared with 616 retrospective control patients with clinically localized melanoma whom have not undergone sentinel node biopsy. Survival differences were calculated with the median follow-up time of 71 months in sentinel node biopsy patients and 74 months in control patients. Analyses were calculated overall and separately in males and females.Results: Overall, there were no differences in relapse-free survival or cancer-specific survival between sentinel node biopsy patients and control patients. Male sentinel node biopsy patients had significantly higher relapse-free survival (P = 0.021) and cancer-specific survival (P = 0.024) than control patients. In females, no differences were found. Cancerspecific survival rates at 5 years were 87.8% in sentinel node biopsy patients and 85.2% in controls overall with 88.3% in male sentinel node biopsy patients and 80.6% in male controls and 87.3% in female sentinel node biopsy patients and 89.8% in female controls.Conclusion: Sentinel node biopsy did not improve survival in melanoma patients overall. While females had no differences in survival, males had significantly improved relapse-free survival and cancer-specific survival following sentinel node biopsy.

TI  - Inter-comparison of phytoplankton functional type phenology metrics derived from ocean color algorithms and Earth System Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean color remote sensing of chlorophyll concentration has revolutionized our understanding of the biology of the oceans. However, a comprehensive understanding of the structure and function of oceanic ecosystems requires the characterization of the spatio-temporal variability of various phytoplankton functional types (PFTs), which have differing biogeochemical roles. Thus, recent bio-optical algorithm developments have focused on retrieval of various PFTs. It is important to validate and inter-compare the existing PFT algorithms; however direct comparison of retrieved variables is non-trivial because in those algorithms PFTs are defined differently. Thus, it is more plausible and potentially more informative to focus on emergent properties of PFTs, such as phonology. Furthermore, ocean color satellite PFT data sets can play a pivotal role in informing and/or validating the biogeochemical routines of Earth System Models. Here, the phenological characteristics of 10 PFT satellite algorithms and 7 latest-generation climate models from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIPS) are inter compared as part of the International Satellite PFT Algorithm Inter-comparison Project. The comparison is based on monthly satellite data (mostly SeaWiFS) for the 2003-2007 period. The phonological analysis is based on the fraction of microplankton or a similar variable for the satellite algorithms and on the carbon biomass due to diatoms for the climate models. The seasonal cycle is estimated on a per-pixel basis as a sum of sinusoidal harmonics, derived from the Discrete Fourier Transform of the variable time series. Peak analysis is then applied to the estimated seasonal signal and the following phenological parameters are quantified for each satellite algorithm and climate model: seasonal amplitude, percent seasonal variance, month of maximum, and bloom duration. Secondary/double blooms occur in many areas and are also quantified. The algorithms and the models are quantitatively compared based on these emergent phenological parameters. Results indicate that while algorithms agree to a first order on a global scale, large differences among them exist; differences are analyzed in detail for two Longhurst regions in the North Atlantic: North Atlantic Drift Region (NADR) and North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre West (NASW). Seasonal cycles explain the most variance in zonal bands in the seasonally-stratified subtropics at about 30 latitude in the satellite PFT data. The CMIP5 models do not reproduce this pattern, exhibiting higher seasonality in mid and high-latitudes and generally much more spatially homogeneous patterns in phenological indices compared to satellite data. Satellite data indicate a complex structure of double blooms in the Equatorial region and mid-latitudes, and single blooms on the poleward edges of the subtropical gyres. In contrast, the CMIP5 models show single annual blooms over most of the ocean except for the Equatorial band and Arabian Sea. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparison of airborne LiDAR and shipboard acoustic data in complex shallow water environments: Filling in the white ribbon zone
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow coastal areas of oceans, seas and lakes pose significant remote sensing and navigational challenges due to the transient nature of bathymetric features that characterize these areas (e.g., shoals and shoaling). Seabed data/ maps often represent these areas as "white ribbon" zones, where sparse data coverage presents a particular challenge to defining and enforcing sustainable use of marine resources. Given the lengthy perimeter of coastlines, there is a need for cost-efficient methods for producing high resolution maps of shallow areas. The research described here compares airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with shipboard acoustic surveys around the Kvarken Archipelago of the northern Baltic Sea.The Kvarken Archipelago includes a unique, brackish shallow water marine environment with a number of moraines. The landscape of the area is characterised by fields of ridged, washboard-like De Geer moraines. The moraines combined with an ongoing glacio-isostatic uplift typical of the area, lead into succession of the elevated structures from the seafloor to land, where present seabed structures will rise on land in future. The ongoing modification of the environment by both climatic and geologic forces contributes to complex geomorphic and ecological feedback systems operating on a range of spatial and temporal scales.Airborne LiDAR can provide high resolution remote sensing data on shallow coastal areas. The technology is especially effective in areas with very shoal waters, like those found along the Finnish coast. LiDAR enables continuous detection of topographic (elevation) and bathymetric (depth) data and can thus generate continuous maps of transition zones between continental and marine areas. Environmental conditions such as water clarity and ice cover can affect LiDAR depth detection capabilities: these conditions require complementary accuracy assessment strategies. As LiDAR cannot determine detailed information on seafloor surface substrate, and anything on subsurface substrate type, geological conditions are determined through the application of acoustic-seismic. methods, sediment sampling and underwater video.Data from LiDAR surveys provide a detailed topographic and bathymetric map of the study area up to water depths of 14 m. The seabed bathymetry model shows a series of elevated, narrow, elongate features that appear throughout the study area. These parallel ridges represent the uppermost geomorphic features of the seafloor. Interpretation of acoustic bathymetric surveys indicates that these ridges are De Geer moraines. The general orientation of these moraines differs from that associated with older features of the northern Kvarken Archipelago. Eroded remnants of older De Geer moraines are overprinted at a high angle by the younger landforms. De Geer moraines in the study area thus represent two phases of deglaciation and finally the eastward ice-sheet/ice edge retreat. The combined approach of using LiDAR and acoustic bathymetric data provides new insights into past glacial dynamics of the Kvarken Archipelago and the Gulf of Bothnia.

TI  - A Comparison of MODIS/VIIRS Cloud Masks over Ice-Bearing River: On Achieving Consistent Cloud Masking and Improved River Ice Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The capability of frequently and accurately monitoring ice on rivers is important, since it may be possible to timely identify ice accumulations corresponding to ice jams. Ice jams are dam-like structures formed from arrested ice floes, and may cause rapid flooding. To inform on this potential hazard, the CREST River Ice Observing System (CRIOS) produces ice cover maps based on MODIS and VIIRS overpass data at several locations, including the Susquehanna River. CRIOS uses the respective platform's automatically produced cloud masks to discriminate ice/snow covered grid cells from clouds. However, since cloud masks are produced using each instrument's data, and owing to differences in detector performance, it is quite possible that identical algorithms applied to even nearly identical instruments may produce substantially different cloud masks. Besides detector performance, cloud identification can be biased due to local (e.g., land cover), viewing geometry, and transient conditions (snow and ice). Snow/cloud confusions and large view angles can result in substantial overestimates of clouds and ice. This impacts algorithms, such as CRIOS, since false cloud cover precludes the determination of whether an otherwise reasonably cloud free grid consists of water or ice. Especially for applications aiming to frequently classify or monitor a location it is important to evaluate cloud masking, including false cloud detections. We present an assessment of three cloud masks via the parameter of effective revisit time. A similar to 100 km stretch of up to 1.6 km wide river was examined with daily data sampled at 500 m resolution, examined over 317 days during winter. Results show that there are substantial differences between each of the cloud mask products, especially while the river bears ice. A contrast-based cloud screening approach was found to provide improved and consistent cloud and ice identification within the reach (95%-99% correlations, and 3%-7% mean absolute differences) between the independently observing platforms. River ice was also detected accurately (proportion correct 95%-100%) and more frequently. Owing to cross-platform compositing, it is possible to obtain an effective revisit time of 2.8 days and further error reductions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially dependent parameters of a two-component chaotic reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) model describing ocean ecology are observed by sampling a single species. We estimate the model parameters and the other species in the system by autosynchronization, where quantities of interest are evolved according to misfit between model and observations, to only partially observed data. Our motivating example comes from oceanic ecology as viewed by remote sensing data, but where noisy occluded data are realized in the form of cloud cover. We demonstrate a method to learn a large-scale coupled synchronizing system that represents the spatiotemporal dynamics and apply a network approach to analyze manifold stability.

TI  - Lost "in a Sort of Wilderness": The Epistemology of Love in Richardson's <i>The History of Sir Charles Grandison</i>
T2  - STUDIES IN PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Samuel Richardson's final novel, The History of Sir Charles Grandison, incorporates the foundations of a sensibility that we might call "psychological fiction" found in such novels as Madame de Lafayette's La Princesse de Cleves. Grandison depicts characters who revise, comment on, correct, and re-edit what they think they know about love, and Harriet Byron's anti-romantic worldview mirrors that of a narrator of psychological fiction. Knowledge deepens quite slowly in Grandison, often moving one step forward and two steps back. Rather than just moral instruction, Richardson explores through Grandison a finely nuanced dissection of sentiment that incorporates and comments on the work of the French moralistes. This article compares the epistemology of love in Grandison to that found in La Princesse de Cleves, which Richardson cites and had his characters discuss in the seventh volume of his final novel.

TI  - Differential Impact of Anniversary-Severe Cyclones on the Water Quality of a Tropical Coastal Lagoon
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping spatio-temporal dynamics of suspended load in a lagoon before-during-after a cyclone is crucial for monitoring sudden nutrient enrichment and associated processes such as algal blooms and siltation. However, not all cyclones produce similar impact on a coastal lagoon, some trigger algal blooms after passage while others just increase the overall turbidity. Asia's largest brackish water lagoon, Chilika Lagoon, India was hit by two anniversary-severe cyclones Phailin (12 October 2013) and Hudhud (12 October 2014) recently. Their impacts were analysed with respect to physical, biological and meteorological factors which favour or restrict a phytoplankton bloom after the passage of a storm. Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer surface reflectance data were used to examine the spatio-temporal variability in total suspended sediment (TSS) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration pre-and post-cyclone. Comparative results revealed that Phailin was associated with higher rainfall, wind speed and surface runoff compared with Hudhud. These factors contributed to higher TSS concentration in all sectors of the lagoon post-Phailin compared with post-Hudhud. Extreme TSS, limited light, high rainfall and runoff and increased flushing rate post-Phailin restricted the likelihood of a phytoplankton bloom in the lagoon, a commonly reported phenomenon after the passage of a cyclone. In contrast, sufficient light availability due to lower TSS, low runoff and flushing and stable wind supported a phytoplankton bloom post-Hudhud. The observed differential impacts were linked to the individual cyclone's characteristics such as differences in landfall locations, wind speed, trajectory after the landfall, differences in rainfall rate and surface runoff and speed of passage.

M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewA specialized epithelial cell with chemosensory properties of taste cells known from the mouth has been newly identified in the urethra and linked to pathogen recognition. We here describe its properties and its link to defence mechanisms, showing parallels to similar sentinel cells in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract.Recent findingsIn the urethra, slender epithelial cells with apical microvilli ('brush cells') express bitter and umami taste receptors and the downstream signalling cascade known from oropharyngeal gustation, utilizing it to monitor for bacterial products and bacterial growth facilitating conditions. Upon stimulation, they release acetylcholine, and their sensitivity is subjected to cholinergic feedback. They are approached by cholinoceptive sensory nerve fibres, and intraurethral bitter application evokes reflex detrusor activity. Similar cells in the respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosa additionally regulate immune function through local neurogenic inflammation and cytokine release, triggered by bacterial products and parasites.SummaryThis cell is interpreted to serve as chemosensory sentinel for potential hazardous compounds in the urethral lumen, triggering a protective mechanism (flushing through micturition) against further ascent. Dysfunction may be related to higher risk of infection or inadequate detrusor activity, pharmacological intervention may be considered to combat infection or detrusor overactivity.

TI  - A New Approach for Realistic 3D Reconstruction of Planar Surfaces from Laser Scanning Data and Imagery Collected Onboard Modern Low-Cost Aerial Mapping Systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past few years, accurate 3D surface reconstruction using remotely-sensed data has been recognized as a prerequisite for different mapping, modelling, and monitoring applications. To fulfill the needs of these applications, necessary data are generally collected using various digital imaging systems. Among them, laser scanners have been acknowledged as a fast, accurate, and flexible technology for the acquisition of high density 3D spatial data. Despite their quick accessibility, the acquired 3D data using these systems does not provide semantic information about the nature of scanned surfaces. Hence, reliable processing techniques are employed to extract the required information for 3D surface reconstruction. Moreover, the extracted information from laser scanning data cannot be effectively utilized due to the lack of descriptive details. In order to provide a more realistic and accurate perception of the scanned scenes using laser scanning systems, a new approach for 3D reconstruction of planar surfaces is introduced in this paper. This approach aims to improve the interpretability of the extracted planar surfaces from laser scanning data using spectral information from overlapping imagery collected onboard modern low-cost aerial mapping systems, which are widely adopted nowadays. In this approach, the scanned planar surfaces using laser scanning systems are initially extracted through a novel segmentation procedure, and then textured using the acquired overlapping imagery. The implemented texturing technique, which intends to overcome the computational inefficiency of the previously-developed 3D reconstruction techniques, is performed in three steps. In the first step, the visibility of the extracted planar surfaces from laser scanning data within the collected images is investigated and a list of appropriate images for texturing each surface is established. Successively, an occlusion detection procedure is carried out to identify the occluded parts of these surfaces in the field of view of captured images. In the second step, visible/non-occluded parts of the planar surfaces are decomposed into segments that will be textured using individual images. Finally, a rendering procedure is accomplished to texture these parts using available images. Experimental results from overlapping laser scanning data and imagery collected onboard aerial mapping systems verify the feasibility of the proposed approach for efficient realistic 3D surface reconstruction.

TI  - Qualitative evaluation of COSMO SkyMed in the detection of earthen archaeological remains: The case of Pachamacac (Peru)
T2  - JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Archaeological prospection of earthen buried structures, namely non-fired sun-dried mud bricks mixed with organic material, is a critical challenge to address. In fact, this building material exhibits a very low geophysical contrast compared to its surroundings and, therefore, earthen structures are very complex to be identified using remote sensing. In order to cope with this issue, in this paper, we focus on the evaluation of satellite X-band radar data (COSMO-SkyMed) capability for detecting earthen buried structures in a desert area. The results obtained from satellite radar data have been validated for a test site in Pachacamac (Peru) by using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and geomagnetic techniques. The test site is outside the fenced protected zone of Pachacamac, today in the tentative UNESCO list. This paper is the first attempt made until now in evaluating the detectability of earthen archaeological remains using satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Outcomes from our investigations clearly point out that the approach we adopted can be useful applied for preventive archaeology and for the planning of future excavation campaigns.

To overcome these constraints, we analyzed and optimized the performance of a combined Random Forest (RF) classifier/object-based approach and applied it to multisource satellite data to produce land use maps of a smallholder agricultural zone in Madagascar at five different nomenclature levels. The RF classifier was first optimized by reducing the number of input variables. Experiments were then carried out to (i) test cropland masking prior to the classification of more detailed nomenclature levels, (ii) analyze the importance of each data source (a high spatial resolution (HSR) time series, a very high spatial resolution (VHSR) coverage and a digital elevation model (DEM)) and data type (spectral, textural or other), and (iii) quantify their contributions to classification accuracy levels. The results show that RF classifier optimization allowed for a reduction in the number of variables by 1.5- to 6-fold (depending on the classification level) and thus a reduction in the data processing time. Classification results were improved via the hierarchical approach at all classification levels, achieving an overall accuracy of 91.7% and 64.4% for the cropland and crop subclass levels, respectively. Spectral variables derived from an HSR time series were shown to be the most discriminating, with a better score for spectral indices over the reflectances. VHSR data were only found to be essential when implementing the segmentation of the area into objects and not for the spectral or textural features they can provide during classification.

TI  - A Multimodality Hybrid Gamma-Optical Camera for Intraoperative Imaging
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of low profile gamma-ray detectors has encouraged the production of small field of view (SFOV) hand-held imaging devices for use at the patient bedside and in operating theatres. Early development of these SFOV cameras was focussed on a single modalitygamma ray imaging. Recently, a hybrid systemgamma plus optical imaginghas been developed. This combination of optical and gamma cameras enables high spatial resolution multi-modal imaging, giving a superimposed scintigraphic and optical image. Hybrid imaging offers new possibilities for assisting clinicians and surgeons in localising the site of uptake in procedures such as sentinel node detection. The hybrid camera concept can be extended to a multimodal detector design which can offer stereoscopic images, depth estimation of gamma-emitting sources, and simultaneous gamma and fluorescence imaging. Recent improvements to the hybrid camera have been used to produce dual-modality images in both laboratory simulations and in the clinic. Hybrid imaging of a patient who underwent thyroid scintigraphy is reported. In addition, we present data which shows that the hybrid camera concept can be extended to estimate the position and depth of radionuclide distribution within an object and also report the first combined gamma and Near-Infrared (NIR) fluorescence images.

TI  - Optoacoustic response of gold nanorods in soft phantoms using high-power diode laser assemblies at 870 and 905 nm
T2  - BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present paper we show the optoacoustic (OA) response of two solutions of gold nanorods dispersed in distilled water (0.8 mg/ml) and hosted in tissue-like phantoms by using small arrays of HPDLs at 870 and 905 nm as excitation sources. The HPDLs are coupled to a 7-to-1 optical fiber bundle with output diameter of 675 mu m. Each solution of gold nanorods exhibits an absorption peak close to the operating wavelength, i.e. similar to 860 nm and similar to 900 nm, respectively, to optimize the generation of OA signals. The phantoms are made of agar, intralipid and hemoglobin to simulate a soft biological tissue with reduced properties of scattering. Three 3-mm diameter tubes done in the phantoms at different depths (0.9 cm, 1.8 cm, and 2.7 cm) have been filled with gold nanorods. In this way, OA signals with appreciable SNR are generated at different depths in the phantoms. The high OA response exhibited by gold nanorods suggests their application in OA spectroscopy as exogenous contrast agents to detect and monitor emerging diseases like metastasis and arteriosclerotic plaques.

TI  - A global analysis of factors controlling VIIRS nighttime light levels from densely populated areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of nighttime lights has been shown as a good surrogate for estimating population and economic activity at national and sub-national scales, using DMSP satellites. However, few studies have examined the factors explaining differences in nighttime brightness of cities at a global scale. In this study, we derived quantitative estimates of nighttime lights with the new VIIRS sensor onboard the Suomi NPP satellite in January 2014 and in July 2014, with two variables: mean brightness and percent lit area. We performed a global analysis of all densely populated areas (n = 4153, mostly corresponding to metropolitan areas), which we defined using high spatial resolution Landscan population data. National GDP per capita was better in explaining nighttime brightness levels (0.60 < Rs < 0.70) than GDP density at a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees (0.25 < Rs < 0.43), or than a city-level measure of GDP per capita (in proportion to each city's fraction of the national population: 0.49 < Rs < 0.62). We found that in addition to GDP per capita, the nighttime brightness of densely populated areas was positively correlated with MODIS derived percent urban area (0.46 < Rs < 0.60), the density of the road network (0.51 < Rs < 0.67), and with latitude (0.31 <Rs <0.42) at p <0.001. NDVI values (representing vegetation cover) were found to be negatively correlated with cities' brightness in winter time (-0.48 < Rs < 0.22), whereas snow cover (enhancing artificial light reflectance) was found to be positively correlated with cities' brightness in winter time (0.17 < Rs < 0.35). Overall, the generalized linear model we built was able to explain >45% of the variability in cities' nighttime brightness, when both physical and socio-economic variables were included. Within the generalized linear model, the percent of national GDP derived from income (rents) from natural gas and oil, was also found as one of the statistically significant variables. Our findings show that cities' nighttime brightness can change with the seasons as a function of vegetation and snow cover, two variables affecting surface albedo. Explaining cities' nighttime brightness is therefore affected not only by country level factors (such as GDP), but also by the built environment and by climatic factors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Climate change driven water budget dynamics of a Tibetan inland lake
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the hydrologic processes of inland lake basins in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) could provide insights into the responses of Tibetan lake dynamics to climate change. An efficient approach for this purpose is to represent complex hydrologic behaviors of such Tibetan lake watersheds with plausible hydrologic models. In this study, water level fluctuations of Lake Nam Co, an inland lake in the central TP, were investigated using a lumped lake-watershed model. The degree-day factor method was introduced to improve the model applicability in glacier-covered basins. The model simulated the hydrologic processes as well as the lake water budget. Remote sensing images (Landsat MSS, TM, ETM + and OLD from 1972 to 2015 were used to identify the glacier and lake boundaries. Multisource climate data (e.g., ground point observation, 0.25 degrees gridded APHRODITE and TRMM 3B42 v7 precipitation products) were used to drive the hydrologic model at a monthly time step. Results of trend analysis showed that basin-wide annual air temperature increased by the rate 0.04 degrees C/yr from 1961 to 2015. Mean annual precipitation slowly increased from 1961 to the mid-1990s, and then rapidly increased from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, and finally obviously decreased after the mid-2000s. As a response to climate change, glaciers decreased by 62.69 km(2) (29%) and lake area increased by 91.83 km(2) (4.7%) from 1972 to 2015. The analysis of lake water budget suggested that, the total basin runoff and on-lake precipitation contributed 1.36 km(3)/yr (66%) and 0.7 km(3)/yr (34%), respectively, to mean annual water gain of the lake. Glacier runoff Was 14% of the basin runoff and 10% of the total water gain of the lake. The percentages of lake evaporation, water seepage and water surplus were 65%, 20% and 15%, respectively. Lake level increased with the rate of 0.14 m/yr for the study period 1961-2015. It could be concluded that precipitation was the dominant controlling factor for the different magnitudes of lake level rising rates of 0.10, 0.41 and 0.06 m/yr for the periods of 1961-1998, 1999-2008 and 2009-2015, respectively.

TI  - Improving Winter Wheat Yield Estimation from the CERES-Wheat Model to Assimilate Leaf Area Index with Different Assimilation Methods and Spatio-Temporal Scales
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the accuracy of winter wheat yield estimation, the Crop Environment Resource Synthesis for Wheat (CERES-Wheat) model with an assimilation strategy was performed by assimilating measured or remotely-sensed leaf area index (LAI) values. The performances of the crop model for two different assimilation methods were compared by employing particle filters (PF) and the proper orthogonal decomposition-based ensemble four-dimensional variational (POD4DVar) strategies. The uncertainties of wheat yield estimates due to different assimilation temporal scales (phenological stages and temporal frequencies) and spatial scale were also analyzed. The results showed that, compared with the crop model without assimilation and with PF-based assimilation, a better yield estimate performance resulted when the POD4DVar-based strategy was used at the field scale. When using this strategy, root mean square errors (RMSE) of 523 kg.ha(-1), 543 kg.ha(-1) and 172 kg.ha(-1) and relative errors (RE) of 5.65%, 5.91% and 7.77% were obtained at the field plot scale, a pixel scale of 1 km and the county scale, respectively. Although the best yield estimates were obtained when all of the observed LAIs were assimilated into the crop model, an acceptable estimate of crop yield could also be achieved by assimilating fewer observations between jointing and anthesis periods of the crop growth season. With decreasing assimilation frequency and pixel resolution, the accuracy of the crop yield estimates decreased; however, the computation time decreased. Thus, it is important to consider reasonable spatio-temporal scales to obtain tradeoffs between accuracy and effectiveness in regional wheat estimates.

TI  - Mapping Urban Bare Land Automatically from Landsat Imagery with a Simple Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, hundreds of Earth observation satellites have been launched to collect massive amounts of remote sensing images. However, the considerable cost and time to process the significant amount of data have become the greatest obstacle between data and knowledge. In order to accelerate the transformation from remote sensing images to urban thematic maps, a strategy to map the bare land automatically from Landsat imagery was developed and assessed in this study. First, a normalized difference bare land index (NBLI) was presented to maximally differentiate bare land from other land types in Wuhan City, China. Then, an unsupervised classifier was employed to extract the bare land from the NBLI image without training samples or self-assigned thresholds. Experimental results showed good performance on overall accuracy (92%), kappa coefficient (0.84), area ratio (1.1321), and match rate (83.96%), respectively. Results in multiple years disclosed that bare lands in the study site gradually moved from inner loops to the outer loops since 2007, in two main directions. This study demonstrated that the proposed method was an accurate and reliable option to extract the bare land, which led to a promising approach to mapping urban land use/land cover (LULC) automatically with simple indices.

TI  - Point-surface fusion of station measurements and satellite observations for mapping PM<sub>2.5</sub> distribution in China: Methods and assessment
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particulate matters with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 mu m) is associated with adverse human health effects, and China is currently suffering from serious PM2.5 pollution. To obtain spatially continuous ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, several models established by the point-surface fusion of station measurements and satellite observations have been developed. However, how well do these models perform at national scale in China? Is there space to improve the estimation accuracy of PM2.5 concentration? The contribution of this study is threefold. Firstly, taking advantage of the newly established national monitoring network, we develop a national-scale generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model to estimate PM2.5 concentrations. Secondly, different assessment experiments are undertaken in time and space, to comprehensively evaluate and compare the performance of the widely used models. Finally, to map the yearly and seasonal mean distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in China, a pixel-based merging strategy is proposed. The results indicate that the conventional models (linear regression, multiple linear regression, and semi-empirical model) do not obtain the expected results at national scale, with cross-validation R values of 0.49-0.55 and RMSEs of 30.80-31.51 mu g/m(3), respectively. In contrast, the more advanced models (geographically weighted regression, back-propagation neural network, and GRNN) have great advantages in PM2.(5) estimation, with R values ranging from 0.61 to 0.82 and RMSEs from 20.93 to 28.68 mu g/m(3), respectively. In particular, the proposed GRNN model obtains the best performance. Furthermore, the mapped PM2.5 distribution retrieved from 3-km MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) products agrees quite well with the station measurements. The results also show that the approach used in this study has the capacity to provide reasonable information for the global monitoring of PM2.5 pollution in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Bi-Band Binary Mask Based Land-Use Change Detection Using Landsat 8 OLI Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and cover change (LUCC) is important for the global biogeochemical cycle and ecosystem. This paper introduced a change detection method based on a bi-band binary mask and an improved fuzzy c-means algorithm to research the LUCC. First, the bi-band binary mask approach with the core concept being the correlation coefficients between bands from different images are used to locate target areas with a likelihood of having changed areas. Second, the improved fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm was used to execute classification on the target areas. This improved algorithm used distances to the Voronoi cell of the cluster instead of the Euclidean distance to the cluster center in the calculation of membership, and some other improvements were also used to decrease the loops and save time. Third, the post classification comparison was executed to get more accurate change information. As references, change detection using univariate band binary mask and NDVI binary mask were executed. The change detection methods were applied to Landsat 8 OLI images acquired in 2013 and 2015 to map LUCC in Chengwu, north China. The accuracy assessment was executed on classification results and change detection results. The overall accuracy of classification results of the improved FCM is 95.70% and the standard FCM is 84.40%. The average accuracy of change detection results using bi-band mask is 88.92%, using NDVI mask is 81.95%, and using univariate band binary mask is 56.01%. The result of the bi-band mask change detection shows that the change from farmland to built land is the main change type in the study area: total area is 9.03 km(2). The developed method in the current study can be an effective approach to evaluate the LUCC and the results helpful for the land policy makers.

TI  - Reflectance-Elevation Relationships and Their Seasonal Patterns over Twelve Glaciers in Western China Based on Landsat 8 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Albedo/reflectance is of great importance for glaciers' mass balance and energy budget. Elevation could be a major factor of influence for glacier reflectance, and therefore when studying glacier reflectance, the altitude ranges should be considered. However, due to the limitations of traditional earth observation systems, conventional analyses usually consider the spatial and temporal patterns of the reflectance average, which is severely restricted. The launch of Landsat-8 gives us the opportunity to study the seasonal glacier reflectance-elevation relationship. We have obtained the monthly near-nadir reflectance per 100 m for twelve glaciers in western China based on 372 scenes of Landsat 8 images acquired from April 2013 to December 2015. Variations of monthly broadband reflectance, reflectance-elevation relationships and reflectance gradients are analyzed and discussed. The results show that the linear trend of the reflectance-elevation relationship (when the altitude is less than 6100 m) is very significant; elevation has greater influence than location on seasonal reflectance variations; and the level of glacier reflectance gradient may relate with its climate. This may be the first work that has used remote-sensing data to analyze seasonal glacier reflectance-elevation patterns.

TI  - The Influence of Land Use on the Grassland Fire Occurrence in the Northeastern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland, as one of the most important ecosystems on Earth, experiences fires that affect the local ecology, economy and society. Notably, grassland fires occur frequently each year in northeastern China. Fire occurrence is a complex problem with multiple causes, such as natural factors, human activities and land use. This paper investigates the disruptive effects of grassland fire in the northeastern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. In this study, we relied on thermal anomaly detection from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor to identify fire occurrences, and land use data were acquired by Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM). We discussed the relationship between land use and the spatial distribution of grassland fires. The results showed that the impact of land use on grassland fires was significant. Spatially, approximately 80% of grassland fires were clustered within 10 km of cultivated land, and grassland fires generally occurred in areas of intense human activity. The correlation between the spatial distribution of grassland fires and the land use degree in 2000, 2005 and 2010 was high, with R-2 values of 0.686, 0.716, 0.633, respectively (p < 0.01). These results highlight the importance of the relationship between land use and grassland fire occurrence in the northeastern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This study provides significance for local fire management and prevention.

TI  - Effect of a cold, dry air incursion on atmospheric boundary layer processes over a high-altitude lake in the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - High-altitude lakes are frequently exposed to extreme meteorological conditions, but the surface and atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) processes have received little attention under specific weather conditions. This study used the multi-source field data, re-analysis and remote sensing data to investigate the varying patterns and driving forces of the convective boundary layer (CBL) height over Ngoring Lake in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) before and after the cold air incursion. Daily cumulative surface heat flux and buoyancy flux over the land were markedly larger than those over the lake on a clear summer day, but an opposite pattern was observed accompanied by the cold air incursion. CBLS determined by the potential temperature thinned ( depth < 100 m) over the lake in the daytime and thickened (400-600 m) at night on a clear day. Along with the arrival of the cold air, CBL rapidly thickened to 2280 m over the lake, exceeded than the maximum value at adjacent Madoi station. Cold air dramatically cooled the middle-upper atmosphere but the temperature of the lower atmosphere cooled down slowly, partly due to a sharp increase of sensible heat flux over the lake, both of which linked up to weaken the potential temperature gradient. Moreover, increasing wind speed and vertical wind shear further facilitated the buoyancy flux to exert higher heat convection efficiency. All of these factors acted together to cause the rapid growth of CBL over the lake. This investigation provided a more in-depth knowledge of boundary layer dynamics in the lake rich region of the TP.

TI  - Omission of axillary staging in elderly patients with early stage breast cancer impacts regional control but not survival: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Management of early breast cancer in the elderly population is challenging due to different breast cancer biology and limited tolerance to aggressive treatments. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the omission of axillary staging impacts breast cancer outcomes in elderly patients.Patients and Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The electronic databases were searched in August 2014 using the following inclusion criteria:Population Elderly patients (>= 70 years) with early stage (T1/T2, N0) breast cancer.Intervention Axillary staging with a sentinel node biopsy, axillary sampling or axillary node dissection.Control No axillary surgery.Outcomes Local-regional recurrence, disease-free survival, overall survival.Study design RCTs.Results: Two RCTs met the eligibility criteria and were included. A meta-analysis of the included RCTs of 692 patients found that axillary staging reduced the risk of axillary recurrence compared to no axillary staging (RR 0.24, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.95, I-2 = 0%, p = 0.04). There were no differences observed in in -breast recurrence or distant recurrence (RR 1.20, 95% CI: 0.55 to 2.64, I-2 = 62%, p = 0.65, RR 1.17, 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.82, I-2 = 0%, p = 0.48, respectively). There were no differences observed in overall or breast-cancer specific mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.24, I-2 = 0%, p = 0.92, RR 1.07, 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.57,I-2 = 0%, p = 0.75, respectively).Discussion: Omission of axillary staging in elderly patients with clinically negative axillae results in increased regional recurrence but does not appear to impact survival.

TI  - The Impact of Energy Consumption on the Surface Urban Heat Island in China's 32 Major Cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supported by the rapid economic development in the last few decades, China has become the largest energy consumer in the world. Alongside this, the effect of the anthropogenic heat released from energy consumption is increasingly apparent. We quantified the daytime and nighttime surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) for the 32 major cities in mainland China, using MODIS land surface temperature data from 2008 to 2012, and estimated the energy consumption intensity (ECI) based on the correlation between energy consumption and the sum of nighttime lights. On this basis, the impact of energy consumption on the surface urban heat island in China's 32 major cities was analyzed, by directly examining the relationship between SUHII and the urban-suburban difference in ECI. The results show that energy consumption has a significantly positive correlation with the nighttime SUHII, but no correlation with the daytime SUHII. It indicates that the cities with a larger urban-suburban difference in ECI have a far greater impact on SUHII during the nighttime. Therefore, the statistical analysis of the historical observation data in this study provides evidence for a long-held hypothesis that the anthropogenic heat released from energy consumption is an important contributor to the urban thermal environment.

TI  - Investigating flood susceptible areas in inaccessible regions using remote sensing and geographic information systems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Every summer, North Korea (NK) suffers from floods, resulting in decreased agricultural production and huge economic loss. Besides meteorological reasons, several factors can accelerate flood damage. Environmental studies about NK are difficult because NK is inaccessible due to the division of Korea. Remote sensing (RS) can be used to delineate flood inundated areas in inaccessible regions such as NK. The objective of this study was to investigate the spatial characteristics of flood susceptible areas (FSAs) using multi-temporal RS data and digital elevation model data. Such study will provide basic information to restore FSAs after reunification. Defining FSAs at the study site revealed that rice paddies with low elevation and low slope were the most susceptible areas to flood in NK. Numerous sediments from upper streams, especially streams through crop field areas on steeply sloped hills, might have been transported and deposited into stream channels, thus disturbing water flow. In conclusion, NK floods may have occurred not only due to meteorological factors but also due to inappropriate land use for flood management. In order to mitigate NK flood damage, reforestation is needed for terraced crop fields. In addition, drainage capacity for middle stream channel near rice paddies should be improved.

TI  - The Use of CYFRA 21-1 for the Detection of Breast Cancer Axillary Lymph Node Metastases in Needle Washouts of Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsies
T2  - APPLIED IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR MORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the preoperative setting of breast cancer, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) guided by ultrasonography can be used to detect axillary lymph node metastases. The aim of the current study was to determine whether measurement in needle washouts of CYFRA 21-1, a soluble fragment of cytokeratin 19 (CK19), can improve the diagnosis of lymph node tumor deposits.Materials and Methods: Our prospective study included 329 breast cancer patients eligible for a sentinel node procedure. Eighty-two patients had a ultrasonography-guided FNAB of an abnormal or suspicious axillary node and were included in the current analysis. Samples were processed with smears and cellblock histology; afterwards, needles were washed with saline solution, and the CYFRA 21-1 content in the washouts was measured. The cutoff value for positive samples that expressed CK19, as shown by their immunohistochemistry, was determined by a receiver operating characteristic curve. On the basis of this value, the specificity and the sensitivity, as well as the positive and negative predictive values, were then calculated using cytology results as a reference standard.Results: Of the 82 axillary lymph nodes sampled, 61 were positive on cytology and were metastatic for breast cancer, as confirmed by surgery. The median CYFRA 21-1 concentration of positive samples was 88.94 ng/mL, whereas in the 21 negative nodes, its median concentration was 1.02 ng/mL (P<0.0001). A CYFRA 21-1 cutoff value of 1.98 ng/mL, obtained by the receiver operating characteristic curve, was able to clearly separate negative from positive samples and gave the test a sensitivity of 0.98 and a specificity of 1.00. Positive and negative predictive values were 1.00 and 0.95, respectively.Conclusions: The measurement of CYFRA 21-1 levels in needle washouts after axillary lymph node FNABs represents an accurate, sensitive, and highly predictive procedure in detecting metastatic deposits of breast cancer and is fit to complement cytology and CK19 immunohistochemistry as a diagnostic tool.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Variability in Sea Surface Temperatures for the Yellow Sea based on MODIS Dataset
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatio-temporal variabilities in sea surface temperature (SST) were analyzed using a time series of MODIS datasets for four separate regions in the Yellow Sea (YS) that were located along a north-south axis. The space variant temporal anomaly was further decomposed using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) for estimating spatially distributed SST. The monthly SSTs showed similar temporal patterns in each region, which ranged from 2.4 degrees C to 28.4 degrees C in the study years 2011 to 2013, with seasonal cycles being stronger at the higher latitudes and weaker at the lower latitudes. Spatially, although there were no significant differences among the four regions (p<0.05) in any year, the geographical distribution of SST was characterized by an obvious gradient whereby SST decreased along the north-south axis. The monthly thermal difference among regions was largest in winter since the SST in the southeast was mainly affected by the Yellow Sea Warm Currents. The EOF1 mode accounted for 56% of the total spatial variance and exhibited a warming signal during the study period. The EOF2 mode accounted for 8% of the total variance and indicated the warm current features in the YS. The EOF3 mode accounted for 6% of the total variance and indicated the topographical features. The methodology used in this study demonstrated the spatio temporal variabilities in the YS.

TI  - Volcanic ash cloud detection from MODIS image based on CPIWS method
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic ash cloud detection has been a difficult problem in moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) multispectral remote sensing application. Principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) are effective feature extraction methods based on second-order and higher order statistical analysis, and the support vector machine (SVM) can realize the nonlinear classification in low-dimensional space. Based on the characteristics of MODIS multispectral remote sensing image, via presenting a new volcanic ash cloud detection method, named combined PCA-ICA-weighted and SVM (CPIWS), the current study tested the real volcanic ash cloud detection cases, i.e., Sangeang Api volcanic ash cloud of 30 May 2014. Our experiments suggest that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the proposed CPIWS method reach 87.20 and 0.7958%, respectively, under certain conditions with the suitable weighted values; this has certain feasibility and practical significance.

TI  - Mineral mapping and ore prospecting using Landsat TM and Hyperion. data, Wushitala, Xinjiang, northwestern China
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Tianshan area, situated in central Asia, is one of the most important gold belts identified by many world-class, superlarge and large gold deposits. The Wushitala area, located in the eastern part of Southern Tianshan, Xinjiang (China), has a strong potential for gold and other metallic mineral deposits. However, no metallic mineral deposit or occurrence has been reported in detail for the Wushitala area in the past, apparently due to poor exploration. This study attempts to map alteration zones and acquire ore prospecting targets in the Wushitala area by integrating Landsat TM and Hyperion data with the ASTER spectral library mineral spectra. The Crosta technique and the anomaly-overlaying selection method were combined to process four temporal Landsat TM data (acquired in the same season in different years) so as to eliminate the random interference-caused false anomalies of alteration minerals (iron oxides and hydroxyl-bearing minerals and carbonates) while retaining the real anomalies. The matched filtering method was applied on Hyperion data for the detailed identification of hydrothermally altered minerals surrounding the granites in the north. The results of Hyperion data are spatially consistent with those of Landsat TM data. Furthermore, the results of Hyperion data show that the alteration minerals associated with the potash feldspar granite are dominated by muscovite and goethite. In our field campaign, fourteen sites (eleven acid intrusion-related and three structure-associated) distributed throughout the study area were inspected, all of which proved to be of geological genesis. Our study led to the discovery of three mineralization sites associated with acid intrusions and structures that were not previously documented. Due to the extensively distributed acid intrusions and structures along the southern Tianshan Belt, several other gold-iron-copper mineralized locations could be found with more detailed investigations. Our mineral prospecting methodology proved effective in the study area and is hereby suggested for application in similar geological settings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Compositing the Minimum NDVI for MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The maximum and minimum normalized difference vegetation indexes (NDVIs) describe two extremes of vegetation greenness during a predefined period. A maximum NDVI image can be composited easily via the direct selection of the maximum NDVI from multiple observations without the need to mask out cloud or snow. But, a minimum NDVI image cannot be built in a similar manner. In this paper, an approach was proposed to composite the minimum NDVI (the least vegetation greenness) image. The minimum spectral index that consists of the green (555 nm) and SWIR bands (2130 nm) from MODIS data, which was named here as the Brown Vegetation Index (BVI), was taken as a proxy to composite the minimum vegetation NDVI. This composite method performs well on a global scale for the NDVIs that were derived from MODIS land surface reflectance (MOD09A1) products. The BVI-based minimum NDVI was compared with the direct selection of the minimum NDVI after excluding contaminated observations using a refined cloud/snow mask. The comparison shows that the differ-ence for 97% of the minimum NDVI between the two approaches is within the range of +/- 0.1 NDVI unit. Various potential spectral indices for compositing the minimum NDVI were compared, which demonstrated the BVI-based approach was top rated. Several examples demonstrated that the composited minimum NDVI is valuable and effective for identifying evergreen forests, monsoon forests, and double cropping. The minimum NDVI combined with the maximum NDVI would simplify the way to describe intraannual vegetation changes.

TI  - Evaluating Four Remote Sensing Methods for Estimating Surface Air Temperature on a Regional Scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface air temperature is a basic meteorological variable to monitor the environment and assess climate change. Four remote sensing methods-the temperature-vegetation index (TVX), the univariate linear regression method, the multivariate linear regression method, and the advection-energy balance for surface air temperature (ADEBAT)-have been developed to acquire surface air temperature on a regional scale. To evaluate their utilities, they were applied to estimate the surface air temperature in northwestern China and were compared with each other through regressive analyses, t tests, estimation errors, and analyses on estimations of different underlying surfaces. Results can be summarized into three aspects: 1) The regressive analyses and t tests indicate that the multivariate linear regression method and the ADEBAT provide better accuracy than the other two methods. 2) Frequency histograms on estimation errors show that the multivariate linear regression method produces the minimum error range, and the univariate linear regression method produces the maximum error range. Errors of the multivariate linear regression method exhibit a nearly normal distribution and that of the ADEBAT exhibit a bimodal distribution, whereas the other two methods display negative skewness distributions. 3) Estimates on different underlying surfaces show that the TVX and the univariate linear regression method are significantly limited in regions with sparse vegetation cover. The multivariate linear regression method has estimation errors within 1 degrees C and without high levels of errors, and the ADEBAT also produces high estimation errors on bare ground.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma, though rare, is one of the most aggressive tumors a dermatologist faces. More than a third of patients with this diagnosis die from the disease. Numerous researchers have attempted to identify clinical and pathologic predictors to guide prognosis, but their studies have produced inconsistent results. Because the incidence of Merkel cell carcinoma is low and it appears in patients of advanced age, prospective studies have not been done and no clear treatment algorithm has been developed. This review aims to provide an exhaustive, up-to-date account of Merkel cell carcinoma for the dermatologist. We describe prognostic factors and the imaging techniques that are most appropriate for evaluating disease spread. We also discuss current debates on treating Merkel cell carcinoma.

TI  - Exaptation Revisited: Changes Imposed by Evolutionary Psychologists and Behavioral Biologists
T2  - Biology Theory
M3  - Article
AB  - Some methodological adaptationists (perhaps unconsciously) hijacked the term "exaptation," and took an occasion of Stephen Jay Gould's misspeaking as confirmation that it possessed an evolutionarily "designed" function and was a version of an adaptation, something it was decidedly not. Others provided a standard of evidence for exaptation that was inappropriate, and based on an adaptationist worldview. This article is intended to serve as both an analysis of and correction to those situations. Gould and Elisabeth Vrba's terms, "exaptation" and "aptation," as originally introduced, are very useful, unlike the faded adaptationist echo of "exaptation" devised by the methodological adaptationists, which has made the term incoherent. We will discuss how exaptation relates to function, to aptation, and to adaptation, both primary and secondary. These ideas have been rendered practically useless through their mistaken definitions and misapplications by evolutionary psychologists.

T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the muscle power and maximal isometric strength capacities of Olympic and visually impaired Paralympic judo athletes. Twenty-eight elite judo athletes (7 men and 7 women per group) from the permanent Brazilian National Paralympic and Olympic teams took part in this study. After a specific warm-up, the athletes performed loaded jump squat (JS), bench press (BP), and standing barbell row (SBR) exercises to determine their values of maximum mean propulsive power (MPP) in these respective exercises. The maximal isometric strength (MIS) was also determined for both upper and lower limbs, through the use of BP and half-squat (HS) exercises. Finally, the jumping ability was assessed using unloaded squat jump (SJ). The magnitude-based inference was used to compare the groups. The Olympic judo athletes presented a likely higher SJ height than the Paralympic athletes. The Olympic group presented almost certainly higher MPP in the loaded JS and in the SBR exercises and likely higher MPP in the BP exercise. Importantly, in the MIS assessments the differences between groups in the HS and BP exercises were rated as unclear. In conclusion, our results showed that both Olympic and Paralympic judo athletes present similar levels of maximal isometric strength, but muscle power performance is superior in Olympic athletes.

TI  - UV-associated decline in systemic folate: implications for human nutrigenetics, health, and evolutionary processes
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine whether UV exposure alters folate status according to C677T-MTHFR genotype, and to consider the relevance of this to human health and the evolutionary model of skin pigmentation.Methods: Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) satellite data were used to examine surface UV-irradiance, as a marker of UV exposure, in a large (n = 649) Australian cross-sectional study population. PCR/RFLP analysis was used to genotype C677T-MTHFR.Results: Overall, cumulative UV-irradiance (42 and 120 days pre-clinic) was significantly negatively related to red cell folate (RCF) levels. When the cohort was stratified by MTHFR-C677T genotype, the relationship between UV-irradiance (42 days pre-clinic) and RCF remained significant only in the cohorts containing carriers of the T allele. Statistically significant z-score statistics and interaction terms from genotype and UV-irradiance (p-interaction) demonstrated that genotype did modify the effect of UV-irradiance on RCF, with the largest effect of UV being demonstrated in the 677TT-MTHFR subjects.Conclusions: Data provide strong evidence that surface UV-irradiance reduces longterm systemic folate levels, and that this is influenced by the C677T-MTHFR gene variant. We speculate this effect may be due to 677TT-MTHFR individuals containing more 5,10CH2-H4PteGlu, and that this folate form may be particularly UV labile. Since UV-irradiance lowers RCF in an MTHFR genotype-specific way, there are likely implications for human health and the evolution of skin pigmentation.

TI  - 8 Uncovering the ancient canal-based <i>tuntian</i> agricultural landscape at China's northwestern frontiers
T2  - JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The tuntian system was a state-promoted system of military-agriculture, which originated in the Western Han dynasty (206 BC-9 AD). All the imperial dynasties in Chinese history adopted the practice of tuntian to cultivate and guard frontier areas as an important state policy for developing border areas and consolidating frontier defense. This paper describes the use of satellite remote sensing data to uncover an ancient canal-based tuntian system located in an oasis agricultural landscape adjacent to the ancient Kingdom of Loulan at the southern margin of the Tarim Basin. The remote sensing data examined include Chinese Gaofen-1 (GF-1) VHR imagery, Landsat-8 (LS-8) OLI data and ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model Version 2 (ASTER GDEMV2) products. The effective irrigated tuntian area was estimated to be 2800 ha and the maximum irrigated tuntian area was found to be more than 8000 ha during the area's most prosperous period. The overall spatial structure of Milan's tuntian agricultural landscape was explored using the patch-corridor-matrix model. By detailed analysis of satellite remote sensing data, this study reconstructed a 3D view of Milan's tuntian agricultural landscape in a GIS. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Fast Detection of Oil Spills and Ships Using SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we show the capabilities of a new maritime control system based on the processing of COSMO-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. This system aims at fast detection of ships that may be responsible for illegal oil dumping. In particular, a novel detection algorithm based on the joint use of the significance parameter, wavelet correlator and a two-dimensional Constant False Alarm Rate (2D-CFAR) is designed. Results show the effectiveness of such algorithms, which can be used by the maritime authorities to have a faster although still reliable response. The proposed algorithm, together with the short revisit time of the COSMO-SkyMed constellation, can help with tracking the scenario evolution from one acquisition to the next.

TI  - Estimating Vegetation Water Content of Corn and Soybean Using Different Polarization Ratios Based on L- and S-Band Radar Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation water content (VWC) is an important parameter of agriculture and forestry. In this letter, specific polarization ratios were evaluated for estimating VWC of corn and soybean. Backscattering coefficients (sigma(hh), sigma(vv), sigma(vh) and sigma(hv)), polarization ratios (sigma(hh)/sigma(vv), sigma(vv)/sigma(vh), and sigma(hh)/sigma(hv)), and the radar vegetation index derived from L-band (1.26 GHz) and S-band (3.15 GHz) radar data of the passive and active L-and S-band sensor (PALS) in Soil Moisture Experiments 2002 were implemented to develop various linear relationship models with field VWC measurements for corn and soybean, respectively. L-band shh/svv was found to be most correlated with corn VWC (R = 0.81), while for soybean, L-band shh/shv was the best parameter to estimate VWC with an R of 0.90. Based upon these analyses, prediction equations for the estimation of corn and soybean VWC using the polarization ratios were developed. Results indicated that L-band shh/svv was able to estimate corn VWC with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.53 kg/m(2) and a mean absolute relative error (MARE) of 11.48%. As for soybean, L-band shh/shv was capable of estimating soybean VWC with an RMSE of 0.12 kg/m(2) and an MARE of 13.33%. The main reason for these differences is most likely due to the disparate structure features and VWC distribution of corn and soybean. This letter proposes an effective method for acquiring VWC in regional areas, and it is also considered to be a powerful supplement for the current methods based on optical remotely sensed data.

TI  - Assimilation of Remotely-Sensed Leaf Area Index into a Dynamic Vegetation Model for Gross Primary Productivity Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative estimation of the magnitude and variability of gross primary productivity (GPP) is required to study the carbon cycle of the terrestrial ecosystem. Using ecosystem models and remotely-sensed data is a practical method for accurately estimating GPP. This study presents a method for assimilating high-quality leaf area index (LAI) products retrieved from satellite data into a process-oriented Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ-DGVM) to acquire accurate GPP. The assimilation methods, including the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-based ensemble four-dimensional (4D) variational assimilation method (PODEn4DVar), incorporate information provided by observations into the model to achieve a better agreement between the model-estimated and observed GPP. The LPJ-POD scheme performs better with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.923 and RMSD of 32.676 gC/m(2)/month compared with the LPJ-EnKF scheme (r = 0.887, RMSD = 38.531 gC/m(2)/month) and with no data assimilation (r = 0.840, RMSD = 45.410 gC/m(2)/month). Applying the PODEn4DVar method into LPJ-DGVM for simulating GPP in China shows that the annual amount of GPP in China varied between 5.92 PgC and 6.67 PgC during 2003-2012 with an annual mean of 6.35 PgC/yr. This study demonstrates that integrating remotely-sensed data with dynamic global vegetation models through data assimilation methods has potential in optimizing the simulation and that the LPJ-POD scheme shows better performance in improving GPP estimates, which can provide a favorable way for accurately estimating dynamics of ecosystems.

TI  - Optimized Sample Selection in SVM Classification by Combining with DMSP-OLS, Landsat NDVI and GlobeLand30 Products for Extracting Urban Built-Up Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of training samples used for data classification methods, such as support vector machines (SVMs), has had a considerable positive impact on the results of urban area extractions. To improve the accuracy of urban built-up area extractions, this paper presents a sample-optimized approach for classifying urban area data using a combination of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) for nighttime light data, Landsat images, and GlobeLand30, which is a 30-m global land cover data product. The proposed approach consists of three main components: (1) initial sample generation and data classification into built-up and non-urban built-up areas based on the maximum and minimum intervals of digital numbers from the DMSP-OLS data, respectively; (2) refined sample selection and optimization by the probability threshold of each pixel based on vegetation-cover, using the Landsat-derived normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and artificial surfaces extracted from the GlobeLand30 product as the constraints; (3) iterative classification and urban built-up area data extraction using the relationship between these three aspects of data collection together with the training sets. Experiments were conducted for several cities in western China using this proposed approach for the extraction of built-up areas, which were classified using urban construction statistical yearbooks and Landsat images and were compared with data obtained from traditional data collection methods, such as the threshold dichotomy method and the improved neighborhood focal statistics method. An analysis of the empirical results indicated that (1) the sample training process was improved using the proposed method, and the overall accuracy (OA) increased from 89% to 96% for both the optimized and non-optimized sample selection; (2) the proposed method had a relative error of less than 10%, as calculated by an accuracy assessment; (3) the overall and individual class accuracy were higher for artificial surfaces in GlobeLand30; and (4) the average OA obviously improved and the Kappa coefficient in the case of Chengdu increased from 0.54 to 0.80. Therefore, the experimental results demonstrated that our proposed approach is a reliable solution for extracting urban built-up areas with a high degree of accuracy.

TI  - Urban Growth Dynamics in Perth, Western Australia: Using Applied Remote Sensing for Sustainable Future Planning
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation data can provide valuable assessments for monitoring the spatial extent of (un)sustainable urban growth of the world's cities to better inform planning policy in reducing associated economic, social and environmental costs. Western Australia has witnessed rapid economic expansion since the turn of the century founded upon extensive natural resource extraction. Thus, Perth, the state capital of Western Australia, has encountered significant population and urban growth in response to the booming state economy. However, the recent economic slowdown resulted in the largest decrease in natural resource values that Western Australia has ever experienced. Here, we present multi-temporal urban expansion statistics from 1990 to 2015 for Perth, derived from Landsat imagery. Current urban estimates used for future development plans and progress monitoring of infill and density targets are based upon aggregated census data and metrics unrepresentative of actual land cover change, underestimating overall urban area. Earth observation provides a temporally consistent methodology, identifying areal urban area at higher spatial and temporal resolution than current estimates. Our results indicate that the spatial extent of the Perth Metropolitan Region has increased 45% between 1990 and 2015, over 320 km(2). We highlight the applicability of earth observation data in accurately quantifying urban area for sustainable targeted planning practices.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy in melanoma: Current controversies addressed
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is the most accurate staging tool for melanoma patients. The procedure is indicated especially for intermediate thickness melanoma (pT2/3). SNB can be of value in thin melanoma (>0.75 mm in thickness), with adverse prognostic factors, and in thick melanomas (pT4), although T4 patients are already at high risk of disease progression. Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) after positive SN yields additional non-sentinel lymph nodes (NSNs) in 20% of cases. Several factors are predictive for NSN positivity, such as primary tumor characteristics and SN tumor burden. The most used and best validated tumor burden parameter is the maximum diameter of the SN metastasis. Others are the microanatomic location of the metastasis in the SN and tumor penetrative depth. These parameters might be used to stratify risk and select patients for either adjuvant treatment trials (diameter >1 mm), or refraining from treatment (minimal SN tumor burden). There is no undisputed evidence for an overall treatment-related benefit for SNB-based management, although benefit has been suggested for a subgroup of node positive patients with intermediate-thickness melanomas. The DeCOG-SLT study failed to demonstrate a survival benefit for CLND after a positive SN. Results of the MSLT-2 and EORTC 1208 (MINITUB) trial, that both assess the role of CLND in SN positive patients have to be awaited. There might be a role for US-FNAC in melanoma staging. New SN visualization techniques can help allow easier identification of SNs in complex areas, shorten operation time and possibly reduce the amount of false-negative SNBs.

TI  - Vegetation Phenology Response towards Rainfall Distribution using MODIS-Aqua Vegetation Satellite Index Data
T2  - SAINS MALAYSIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology describes the plant life cycle or activity and it is important to understand it's interactions with climate. This study was conducted to identify plant phenological responses to average monthly rainfall and to extract the phenology metrics for dipterocarp forest, oil palms and rubber trees by using EVI vegetation indices from MODIS-Aqua (product MYD13Q1) and an average of monthly rainfall for 2007 and 2009. Rainfall patterns in 2007 showed normal rainfall distribution whilst in 2009 experienced less rain in a period of eleven years (2000-2010). The result showed that the EVI of the dipterocarp forest is varied in 2009 with EVI value ranges 0.39-0.64 compared to the more consistent EVI values of 0.33-0.57 in 2007. The phenological trends of oil palms fluctuate in 2007 compared to 2009 with EVI at 0.45-0.71 and 0.5-0.74, respectively. Phenological patterns of rubber trees in both years showed similar trend and the EVI range of 2009 was smaller than in 2007 with value of 0.39-0.62 and 0.30-0.73, respectively. The effect of lag period on vegetations' greenness was detected, especially after heavy rain period in both years which affects the correlation values between the average rainfall and EVI. The start and end of growing season of the dipterocarp forest for both years occurred in February and December. There is no clear difference between the lengths of season for oil palms in both years, which is 32 days longer in 2007 compared to 2009. Length of season for rubber tree is longer in 2007 and significantly shorter in 2009 at 176 and 113 days, respectively.

TI  - Axillary lymph node dissection on the run?
T2  - Facts, views & vision in ObGyn
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The standard approach of performing a completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) after a positive sentinel node for breast cancer patients is no longer generally accepted. This study applied the criterion of a 27% risk of having residual positive lymph nodes calculated by the MD Anderson nomogram to perform a cALND. This 27% cut-off is based on the number of positive non-sentinels in the Z0011 trial. A cohort of 166 cN0, sentinel positive breast cancer patients was used to validate the MD Anderson nomogram. ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis shows an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 0.76 and an optimal cut-off at 34% risk of positive non- SLNs (sensitivity 86%, specificity 57%). The 27% cut-off has a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 41% to detect positive non-sentinels. In a second cohort (N= 114) the 27% cut-off criterion was prospectively applied and appeared to be practice changing. Although we take minimal risk to leave disease behind (2/166 patients >3 positive nodes), 30.7 % in the first cohort and 54.4 % of the patients in the second cohort could be spared a cALND. The Z0011 criteria would have had more impact, omitting 90% of the cALND, but leaves more disease behind. The impact of leaving disease behind on survival remains unanswered but is awaited by long term follow up of large prospective cohort studies.

TI  - Ranking criteria for assessment of municipal solid waste dumping sites
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Priority wise channelization of resources is the key to successful environmental management, especially when funds are limited. The study in hand has successfully developed an algorithmic criterion to compare hazardous effects of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) dumping sites quantitatively. It is a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) that has made use of the scaling function to normalize the data values, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for assigning weights to input parameters showing their relevant importance, and Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) for aggregating the normalized scores. Input parameters have been divided into three classes namely Resident's Concerns, Groundwater Vulnerability and Surface Facilities. Remote Sensing data and GIS analysis were used to prepare most of the input data. To elaborate the idea, four dumpsites have been chosen as case study, namely Old-FSD, New-FSD, Saggian and Mahmood Booti. The comparison has been made first at class levels and then class scores have been aggregated into environmental normalized index for environmental impact ranking. The hierarchy of goodness found for the selected sites is New-FSD > Old-FSD > Mahmood Booti > Saggian with comparative scores of goodness to environment as 36.67, 28.43, 21.26 and 13.63 respectively. Flexibility of proposed model to adjust any number of classes and parameters in one class will be very helpful for developing world where availability of data is the biggest hurdle in research based environmental sustainability planning. The model can be run even without purchasing satellite data and GIS software, with little inaccuracy, using imagery and measurement tools provided by Google Earth.

TI  - Predicting Spatial Distribution of Key Honeybee Pests in Kenya Using Remotely Sensed and Bioclimatic Variables: Key Honeybee Pests Distribution Models
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Bee keeping is indispensable to global food production. It is an alternate income source, especially in rural underdeveloped African settlements, and an important forest conservation incentive. However, dwindling honeybee colonies around the world are attributed to pests and diseases whose spatial distribution and influences are not well established. In this study, we used remotely sensed data to improve the reliability of pest ecological niche (EN) models to attain reliable pest distribution maps. Occurrence data on four pests (Aethina tumida, Galleria mellonella, Oplostomus haroldi and Varroa destructor) were collected from apiaries within four main agro-ecological regions responsible for over 80% of Kenya's bee keeping. Africlim bioclimatic and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) variables were used to model their ecological niches using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). Combined precipitation variables had a high positive logit influence on all remotely sensed and biotic models' performance. Remotely sensed vegetation variables had a substantial effect on the model, contributing up to 40.8% for G. mellonella and regions with high rainfall seasonality were predicted to be high-risk areas. Projections (to 2055) indicated that, with the current climate change trend, these regions will experience increased honeybee pest risk. We conclude that honeybee pests could be modelled using bioclimatic data and remotely sensed variables in MaxEnt. Although the bioclimatic data were most relevant in all model results, incorporating vegetation seasonality variables to improve mapping the actual' habitat of key honeybee pests and to identify risk and containment zones needs to be further investigated.

TI  - SAR image analysis techniques for flood area mapping - literature survey
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Flood area mapping is an integral part of disaster management operation which gets value when the details about inundated region has been made available in real time mode as well as when the much required temporal information is shared to the disaster mitigation authorities at right time. The challenges of such real time flood area mapping operations can be met by spaceborn Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology which is capable of capturing the critical information of large and hard-to-reach territories during all weather and all time situations. Mapping the flood related information of SAR images require much attention as the pixels associated with the inundated regions exhibit similar reflectance with major part of the pixels associated with high altitude region, shadow, runway and broad road networks. Such challenges have been addressed by worldwide researchers with the help of image processing functions. Many such SAR image based flood area mapping models take the advantages of various image classification approaches as well as in integrating multiple image processing functions mainly to differentiate the inundated pixels from other pixels which exhibits similar reflectance by which the mapping accuracy is enhanced. This paper is dedicated, in understanding and documenting various such significant SAR image based flood area mapping models by highlighting its strengths. Significant SAR image bases flood area mapping models from 1990's to 2015 has been discussed. The respective references can be used by young researchers who are interested and willing to work in SAR image based flood area mapping techniques.

T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Invasive pneumococcal disease continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children younger than 5 years of age in India. We aimed to provide nationally representative data for the pattern of disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, trends in the serotype of invasive pneumococci, and invasive pneumococci antimicrobial resistance patterns, in India.Methods In this prospective hospital-based and retrospective laboratory-based surveillance study, we prospectively enrolled children aged younger than 5 years with suspected or proven invasive pneumococcal disease from 18 hospitals or institutional centres and retrospectively included laboratory-confirmed pneumococcal isolates from ten sentinel laboratories, together representing 11 states in India. Eligibility criteria were fever higher than 38 degrees C without localising symptoms, clinical presentation of suspected meningitis or pneumonia, and evidence of radiographic pneumonia. We cultured blood and other normally sterile body fluids, reconfirmed and serotyped pneumococcal isolates, and established antimicrobial susceptibility using standard study protocols.Findings Between Jan 1, 2011, and June 30, 2015, we enrolled 4377 patients. Among 361 (8%) patients with culture proven pneumococcal disease, all clinical data were known for 226 (63%); among these patients, 132 (58%) presented with pneumonia, 78 (35%) presented with meningitis, and 16 (7%) had other clinical conditions. 131 (3%) died overall and 29 (8%) patients with invasive pneumococcal disease died. Serotypes 14 (52 [14%] of 361), 1 (49 [14%]), 5 (37 [10%]), and 19F (33 [9%]) were the most common. Penicillin non-susceptibility occurred in isolates from 29 (8%) patients, co-trimoxazole resistance occurred in 239 (66%), erythromycin resistance occurred in 132 (37%), and chloramphenicol resistance occurred in 33 (9%). We found multidrug resistance in 33 (9%) of 361 patients.Interpretation The proportion of positive blood cultures, number of isolates, geographical representation, and data generated over the 4.5 years of the study are representative of data for most of India. Continued surveillance is warranted as the decision to introduce protein conjugated vaccine in India is made.

TI  - Mapping Rice Fields in Urban Shanghai, Southeast China, Using Sentinel-1A and Landsat 8 Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1A and Landsat 8 images have been combined in this study to map rice fields in urban Shanghai, southeast China, during the 2015 growing season. Rice grown in paddies in this area is characterized by wide inter-field variability in addition to being fragmented by other land-uses. Improving rice classification accuracy requires the use of multi-source and multi-temporal high resolution data for operational purposes. In this regard, we first exploited the temporal backscatter of rice fields and background land-cover types at the vertical transmitted and vertical received (VV) and vertical transmitted and horizontal received (VH) polarizations of Sentinel-1A. We observed that the temporal backscatter of rice increased sharply at the early stages of growth, as opposed to the relatively uniform temporal backscatter of the other land-cover classes. However, the increase in rice backscatter is more sustained at the VH polarization, and two-class separability measures further indicated the superiority of VH over VV in discriminating rice fields. We have therefore combined the temporal VH images of Sentinel-1A with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) derived from a single-date cloud-free Landsat 8 image. The integration of these optical indices with temporal backscatter eliminated all commission errors in the Rice class and increased overall accuracy by 5.3%, demonstrating the complimentary role of optical indices to microwave data in mapping rice fields in subtropical and urban landscapes such as Shanghai.

TI  - Incidence of invasive salmonella disease in sub-Saharan Africa: a multicentre population-based surveillance study
T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Available incidence data for invasive salmonella disease in sub-Saharan Africa are scarce. Standardised, multicountry data are required to better understand the nature and burden of disease in Africa. We aimed to measure the adjusted incidence estimates of typhoid fever and invasive non-typhoidal salmonella (iNTS) disease in sub-Saharan Africa, and the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of the causative agents.Methods We established a systematic, standardised surveillance of blood culture-based febrile illness in 13 African sentinel sites with previous reports of typhoid fever: Burkina Faso (two sites), Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Madagascar (two sites), Senegal, South Africa, Sudan, and Tanzania (two sites). We used census data and health-care records to define study catchment areas and populations. Eligible participants were either inpatients or outpatients who resided within the catchment area and presented with tympanic (>= 38.0 degrees C) or axillary temperature (>= 37.5 degrees C). Inpatients with a reported history of fever for 72 h or longer were excluded. We also implemented a health-care utilisation survey in a sample of households randomly selected from each study area to investigate health-seeking behaviour in cases of self-reported fever lasting less than 3 days. Typhoid fever and iNTS disease incidences were corrected for health-care-seeking behaviour and recruitment.Findings Between March 1, 2010, and Jan 31, 2014, 135 Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S Typhi) and 94 iNTS isolates were cultured from the blood of 13 431 febrile patients. Salmonella spp accounted for 33% or more of all bacterial pathogens at nine sites. The adjusted incidence rate (AIR) of S Typhi per 100 000 person-years of observation ranged from 0 (95% CI 0-0) in Sudan to 383 (274-535) at one site in Burkina Faso; the AIR of iNTS ranged from 0 in Sudan, Ethiopia, Madagascar (Isotry site), and South Africa to 237 (178-316) at the second site in Burkina Faso. The AIR of iNTS and typhoid fever in individuals younger than 15 years old was typically higher than in those aged 15 years or older. Multidrug-resistant S Typhi was isolated in Ghana, Kenya, and Tanzania (both sites combined), and multidrug-resistant iNTS was isolated in Burkina Faso (both sites combined), Ghana, Kenya, and Guinea-Bissau.Interpretation Typhoid fever and iNTS disease are major causes of invasive bacterial febrile illness in the sampled locations, most commonly affecting children in both low and high population density settings. The development of iNTS vaccines and the introduction of S Typhi conjugate vaccines should be considered for high-incidence settings, such as those identified in this study.

TI  - Colonial Legacies and State Institutions in China: Evidence From a Natural Experiment
T2  - COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - What is the legacy of Japanese colonial rule in East Asia? In this article, I use a geographic regression discontinuity design to examine of the long-run effects of Japanese rule over northern China. I find that the Japanese colonization of northern China had a positive long-run effect on state institutions-with persistent increases in schooling, health, and bureaucratic density. I also find suggestive evidence that colonization led to increases in wealth, as measured by census data and nighttime luminosity. The positive legacy of Japanese colonization in northern China suggests that intense state building efforts can pay long-run dividends, even in the context of a brutal and extractive regime.

M3  - Article
AB  - Trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness during the 2015 season in South Africa was assessed using a test-negative case control study design. Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 was the dominant circulating strain. Overall influenza vaccine coverage was 3.2% (29/899). The vaccine effectiveness estimate, against any influenza virus infection, adjusted for age, underlying conditions and timing within season was 46.2% (95% CI: -23.5 to 76.5), and 53.6% ( 95% CI: -62.6 to 80.3) against influenza A(H1N1) pdm09.

TI  - Population genetic analysis of the DARC locus (Duffy) reveals adaptation from standing variation associated with malaria resistance in humans
T2  - PLOS GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The human DARC (Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines) gene encodes a membranebound chemokine receptor crucial for the infection of red blood cells by Plasmodium vivax, a major causative agent of malaria. Of the three major allelic classes segregating in human populations, the FY*O allele has been shown to protect against P. vivax infection and is at near fixation in sub-Saharan Africa, while FY*B and FY*A are common in Europe and Asia, respectively. Due to the combination of strong geographic differentiation and association with malaria resistance, DARC is considered a canonical example of positive selection in humans. Despite this, details of the timing and mode of selection at DARC remain poorly understood. Here, we use sequencing data from over 1,000 individuals in twenty-one human populations, as well as ancient human genomes, to perform a fine-scale investigation of the evolutionary history of DARC. We estimate the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the most common FY*O haplotype to be 42 kya (95% CI: 34-49 kya). We infer the FY* O null mutation swept to fixation in Africa from standing variation with very low initial frequency (0.1%) and a selection coefficient of 0.043 (95% CI: 0.011-0.18), which is among the strongest estimated in the human genome. We estimate the TMRCA of the FY*A mutation in non-Africans to be 57 kya (95% CI: 48-65 kya) and infer that, prior to the sweep of FY*O, all three alleles were segregating in Africa, as highly diverged populations from Asia and does not satisfy Khomani San hunter-gatherers share the same FY*A haplotypes. We test multiple models of admixture that may account for this observation and reject recent Asian or European admixture as the cause.

TI  - Multi-slice SPECT/CT vs. lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative gamma ray probe for sentinel node mapping in HNSCC
T2  - EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the diagnostic potential of multi-slice single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) for preoperative sentinel node (SN) mapping in early stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Retrospective case-control study including data of consecutive HNSCC patients treated between November 2011 and December 2015. The diagnostic accuracy of multi-slice SPECT/CT was assessed with regard to the gold standard intraoperative gamma ray detection probe, using McNemar's test and calculating the area under the ROC curve. Additionally, the hot spot yield of SPECT/CT and planar lymphoscintigraphy (LS) was compared. Compared to the intraoperative gold standard, SPECT/CT showed an overall positive predictive value of 60.3% [confidence interval (CI) 46.6-73.0%)], a negative predictive value of 96.3% (CI 93.6-98.1%), and an accuracy of 90.8% (CI 89.1-92.4%). SPECT/CT detected more hot spots than LS and provided detailed anatomical information as well as relevant additional findings with potential impact on further patient management. Sentinel lymph node biopsy proved to be a reliable and safe procedure with an excellent SN excision rate (97%). Multi-slice SPECT/CT is a highly accurate diagnostic test and matches the gold standard intraoperative gamma ray detection probe.

TI  - Dynamics and determinants of land change in India: integrating satellite data with village socioeconomics
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine the dynamics and spatial determinants of land change in India by integrating decadal land cover maps (1985-1995-2005) from a wall-to-wall analysis of Landsat images with spatiotemporal socioeconomic database for similar to 630,000 villages in India. We reinforce our results through collective evidence from synthesis of 102 case studies that incorporate field knowledge of the causes of land change in India. We focus on cropland-fallow land conversions, and forest area changes (excludes non-forest tree categories including commercial plantations). We show that cropland to fallow conversions are prominently associated with lack of irrigation and capital, male agricultural labor shortage, and fragmentation of land holdings. We find gross forest loss is substantial and increased from similar to 23,810 km(2) (1985-1995) to similar to 25,770 km(2) (1995-2005). The gross forest gain also increased from similar to 6000 km(2) (1985-1995) to similar to 7440 km(2) (1995-2005). Overall, India experienced a net decline in forest by similar to 18,000 km(2) (gross loss-gross gain) consistently during both decades. We show that the major source of forest loss was cropland expansion in areas of low cropland productivity (due to soil degradation and lack of irrigation), followed by industrial development and mining/quarrying activities, and excessive economic dependence of villages on forest resources.

TI  - On the use of feature selection to improve the detection of sea oil spills in SAR images
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast and effective oil spill detection systems are crucial to ensure a proper response to environmental emergencies caused by hydrocarbon pollution on the ocean's surface. Typically, these systems uncover not only oil spills, but also a high number of look-alikes. The feature extraction is a critical and computationally intensive phase where each detected dark spot is independently examined. Traditionally, detection systems use an arbitrary set of features to discriminate between oil spills and look-alikes phenomena. However, Feature Selection (FS) methods based on Machine Learning (ML) have proved to be very useful in real domains for enhancing the generalization capabilities of the classifiers, while discarding the existing irrelevant features. In this work, we present a generic and systematic approach, based on FS methods, for choosing a concise and relevant set of features to improve the oil spill detection systems. We have compared five FS methods: Correlation-based feature selection (CFS), Consistency-based filter, Information Gain, ReliefF and Recursive Feature Elimination for Support Vector Machine (SVM-RFE). They were applied on a 141-input vector composed of features from a collection of outstanding studies. Selected features were validated via a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and the results were compared with previous works. Test experiments revealed that the classifier trained with the 6-input feature vector proposed by SVM-RFE achieved the best accuracy and Cohen's kappa coefficient (87.1% and 74.06% respectively). This is a smaller feature combination with similar or even better classification accuracy than previous works. The presented finding allows to speed up the feature extraction phase without reducing the classifier accuracy. Experiments also confirmed the significance of the geometrical features since 75.0% of the different features selected by the applied FS methods as well as 66.67% of the proposed 6-input featute vector belong to this category.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL FOOD
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the nutraceutical potential of choline as an added value to its well-known brain nutrient role. Several toxicity, antitoxicity, genotoxicity, antigenotoxicity, and longevity endpoints were checked in the somatic mutation and recombination test in in vivo Drosophila animal model. Cytotoxicity in human leukemia60 cell line (HL-60) promyelocytic and NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells, proapoptotic DNA fragmentation, comet assay, methylation status, and macroautophagy (MA) activity were tested in in vitro assays. Choline is not only safe but it is also able to protect against the DNA damage caused by an oxidative genotoxin. Moreover, it improves the life extension in the animal model. The in vitro results show that it is able to exhibit genetic damage against leukemia HL-60 cells. Single-strand breaks in DNA are observed at the molecular level in treatments with choline, although only a significant hypermethylation on the long interspersed elements-1 and a hypomethylation on the satellite-alpha DNA repetitive DNA sequences of HL-60 cells at the lowest concentration (0.447 mM) were observed. Besides, choline decreased MA at the lower assayed concentration and the MA response to topoisomerase inhibitor (etoposide) is maintained in the presence of treatment with 0.22mM choline. Taking into account the hopeful results obtained in the in vivo and in vitro assays, choline could be proposed as a substance with an important nutraceutical value for different purposes.

TI  - From local spectral measurements to maps of vegetation cover and biomass on the Qinghai-Tibet-Plateau: Do we need hyperspectral information?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Though the relevance of pasture degradation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is widely postulated, its extent is still unknown. Due to the enormous spatial extent, remote sensing provides the only possibility to investigate pasture degradation via frequently used proxies such as vegetation cover and aboveground biomass (AGB). However, unified remote sensing approaches are still lacking. This study tests the applicability of hyper- and multispectral in situ measurements to map vegetation cover and AGB on regional scales. Using machine learning techniques, it is tested whether the full hyperspectral information is needed or if multispectral information is sufficient to accurately estimate pasture degradation proxies. To regionalize pasture degradation proxies, the transferability of the locally derived ML-models to high resolution multispectral satellite data is assessed. 1183 hyperspectral measurements and vegetation records were performed at 18 locations on the QTP. Random Forests models with recursive feature selection were trained to estimate vegetation cover and AGB using narrow-band indices (NBI) as predictors. Separate models were calculated using NBI from hyperspectral data as well as from the same data resampled to WorldView-2, QuickBird and RapidEye channels. The hyperspectral results were compared to the multispectral results. Finally, the models were applied to satellite data to map vegetation cover and AGB on a regional scale. Vegetation cover was accurately predicted by Random Forest if hyperspectral measurements were used (cross validated R-2 = 0.89). In contrast, errors in AGB estimations were considerably higher (cross validated R-2 = 0.32). Only small differences in accuracy were observed between the models based on hyperspectral compared to multispectral data. The application of the models to satellite images generally resulted in an increase of the estimation error. Though this reflects the challenge of applying in situ measurements to satellite data, the results still show a high potential to map pasture degradation proxies on the QTP. Thus, this study presents robust methodology to remotely detect and monitor pasture degradation at high spatial resolutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research effort is to develop a method that will allow to map and evaluate thermal anomalies in SW USA from the MYD11A2 night land surface temperature (LST) imagery being available for the year 2014, that present higher spatial (1 km) and temporal (46 images per year) resolution than the MYD11C3 LST data (12 images per year at 5.6 km spatial resolution). The fact that is MYD11A2 LST imagery is projected to a rectangular grid did not affect the X, Y and elevation (H) spatial decorrelation stretch. Principal component analysis and linear regression models isolated and removed the X, Y, H (spatial) dependent variance included in the data while metrics devised verified the selective spatial variance reduction. The reconstructed 46 LST images represent the amount the LST deviates from the X, Y and H predicted for the year 2014. The thematic information content of the reconstructed LST images is verified by cluster analysis and mapped the spatial extend and the temporal variability of thermal anomalies within the study area. The positive thermal anomaly clusters are spatially arranged mainly west of Sierra Nevada in Great Basin Section where extensional tectonics create a series of titled elongated mountain blocks along the N to S direction in between basins bounded by normal faults, while the negative thermal anomaly clusters are spatially arranged along the coastal region, further north and in the western region far from the tilted mountain tectonic blocks of the Great Basin Section. The spatial maps that define regions with (positive or negative) thermal anomalies and distinct mean land response could assist landcover studies and support urban and rural planning in the context of emerging climatic change.

TI  - Modeling WEPP erodibility parameters in calcareous soils in northwest Iran
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling soil detachment rates at the regional scale is important for better understanding of the processes of erosion and the development of erosion models. Soil erodibility is an important factor for predicting soil loss, but its direct measurement at the watershed scale is difficult, time-consuming and costly. This study used stepwise multiple-linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to model Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) soil erodibility parameters, including the baseline inter-rill erodibility (K-ib), baseline rill erodibility (K-rb) and critical shear stress (tau(cb)) of cropland conditions in calcareous soils of northwest Iran. Simulated inter-rill and rill erosion experiments were conducted at 100 locations with three replications. K-ib, K-rb and tau(cb), and basic soil properties were measured at each location. Auxiliary variables related to Soil erodibility were derived from a Landsat 7 satellite image and a 30 m x 30 m digital elevation model (DEM). MLR and ANN models were employed to predict K-ib, K-rb and tau(cb) using two groups of input variables: i) more easily measurable basic soil properties (pedo-transfer functions (PTFs)) and ii) more easily measurable basic soil properties and auxiliary data (soil spatial prediction functions (SSPFs)). The resultsindicated that the WEPP models performed poorly in comparison to the derived models. PTFs and SSPFs generated from ANN models provided more reliable predictions than the MLR models. ANN-based SSPF models yielded the best results (with the highest R-2 and lowest RMSE values) for predicting Kib and Krb. ANN-based PTF model performed reasonably well for predicting Tcb. These results show that information from terrain attributes and remote sensing data are potential auxiliary variables for improving prediction of soil erodibility parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Reprogramming the Transcriptional Response to Hypoxia with a Chromosomally Encoded Cyclic Peptide HIF-1 Inhibitor
T2  - ACS SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The cellular response to hypoxia is orchestrated by HIF-1, a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of an alpha and a beta subunit that enables cell survival under low oxygen conditions by altering the transcription of over 300 genes. There is significant evidence that inhibition of HIF-1 would be beneficial for cancer therapy. We recently reported a cyclic hexapeptide that inhibits the HIF-1 alpha/HIF-1 beta protein-protein interaction in vitro and prevents HIF-1-mediated hypoxiaresponse signaling in cells. This cyclic peptide was identified from a library of 3.2 X 10(6) members generated using SICLOPPS split-intein mediated protein splicing. With a view to demonstrating the potential for encoding the production of a therapeutic agent in response to a disease marker, we have engineered human cells with an additional chromosomal control circuit that conditionally encodes the production of our cyclic peptide HIF-1 inhibitor. We demonstrate the conditional production of our HIF-1 inhibitor in response to hypoxia, and its inhibitory effect on HIF-1 dimerization and downstream hypoxia-response signaling. These engineered cells are used to illustrate the synthetic lethality of inhibiting HIF-1 dimerization and glycolysis in hypoxic cells. Our approach not only eliminates the need for the chemical synthesis and targeted delivery of our HIF-1 inhibitor to cells, it also demonstrates the wider possibility that the production machinery of other bioactive compounds may be incorporated onto the chroMosome of human cells. This work demonstrates the potential of sentinel circuits that produce molecular modulators of cellular pathways in response to environmental or cellular disease stimuli.

TI  - Improved Accuracy of the Asymmetric Second-Order Vegetation Isoline Equation over the RED-NIR Reflectance Space
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between two reflectances of different bands is often encountered in cross calibration and parameter retrievals from remotely-sensed data. The asymmetric-order vegetation isoline is one such relationship, derived previously, where truncation error was reduced from the first-order approximated isoline by including a second-order term. This study introduces a technique for optimizing the magnitude of the second-order term and further improving the isoline equation's accuracy while maintaining the simplicity of the derived formulation. A single constant factor was introduced into the formulation to adjust the second-order term. This factor was optimized by simulating canopy radiative transfer. Numerical experiments revealed that the errors in the optimized asymmetric isoline were reduced in magnitude to nearly 1/25 of the errors obtained from the first-order vegetation isoline equation, and to nearly one-fifth of the error obtained from the non-optimized asymmetric isoline equation. The errors in the optimized asymmetric isoline were compared with the magnitudes of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimates reported for four specific sensors aboard four Earth observation satellites. These results indicated that the error in the asymmetric isoline could be reduced to the level of the SNR by adjusting a single factor.

TI  - Modeling glacier-surface albedo across Svalbard for the 1979-2015 period: The HiRSvaC500-α data set
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Albedo is an important quantity for determining the energy balance of snow and ice surfaces and thus also for the mass balance of glaciers. It is especially important in polar regions where shortwave radiation fluxes typically provide most of the energy input to a glacier. In order to use albedo data in any spatially distributed glaciological modeling, it is vital that the albedo fields are not only of high accuracy but also available on sufficiently high spatial resolution and in a manner that is consistent over time. This article presents the newly developed data set HiRSvaC500-, which provides daily updated, gapless albedo fields for all glacierized areas of the Arctic archipelago Svalbard on a 500 m resolution over the period 1979-2015. Albedo modeling for creation of the data set is done using a multistep geostatistical approach on the basis of remotely sensed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo data and gridded ERA-Interim climate data. Validation of the modeled HiRSvaC500- albedo fields against in situ albedo measurements at automatic weather stations operated on two different glaciers suggests that the accuracy of the newly developed data set lies close to that of remotely sensed MODIS albedo data. An analysis of the HiRSvaC500- albedo data set yields a mean annual-average albedo of 0.754 across all glaciers of Svalbard over 1979-2015. A decrease of albedo with time is found, following a highly significant (95% level) trend of -0.010 per decade. For certain subregions, this trend even reaches up to -0.014 per decade.

TI  - Coupling of phenological information and simulated vegetation index time series: Limitations and potentials for the assessment and monitoring of soil erosion risk
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of soils used for agriculture at frequent intervals is crucial to support decision making and refining soil policies especially in the context of climate change. Along with rainfall erosivity, soil coverage by vegetation or crop residues is the most dynamic factor affecting soil erosion. Parcel-specific soil coverage information can be derived by satellite imagery with high geometric resolution. However, their usable number is mostly, due to cloud cover, not representative for the phenological characteristics of vegetated classes. To overcome temporal constraints, spatial and temporal fusion models, such as STARFM, are increasingly applied to derive high-resolution time series of remotely sensed biophysical parameters, based on fine spatial coarse temporal resolution imagery, such as Landsat, and coarse spatial fine temporal resolution imagery, such as MODIS. In this context, the current study introduces an evaluation scheme for simulated vegetation index time series which enables the assessment of their performance during multiple phenological phases. The evaluation scheme is based on Germany-wide available spatial predictions of phenological phases as well as RapidEye imagery and parcel-specific crop-type information. The evaluation results show that the simulation accuracy is basically controlled by the temporal distance between MODIS and Landsat base pairs, as well as the ability of the actual Landsat image to properly represent the phenological phase of the Landsat image simulated by MODIS. In addition, we discuss the potential of simulated index times series and corresponding phenological information for the dynamic (1) definition of temporal windows where soils are potentially covered by no, sparse or dense vegetation or crop residues and (2) parameterization of soil erosion models. The database thus obtained opens up new possibilities for an efficient and dynamic erosion monitoring, which can support soil protection and hazard prevention. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Analyze the spatial distribution of lava flows in Al-Ays Volcanic Area, Saudi Arabia, using remote sensing
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Al-Ays Volcanic Area (AAVA) experienced a massive earthquake swarm in 2009 under the Harrat Lunayyir (HL). To examine the space distribution of basaltic lava flows in AAVA, we present here an analysis of satellite images. This has helped to identify three generations of lava flows within AAVA for the first time, their spatial extent and relationship to geological features. Various remote sensing treatments were applied to the Landsat 8 image: (a) color composites, (b) band ratioing, (c) principal component analysis, and (d) a mathematical index. Spectral analysis of the maps assists with charting the spatial configuration of the lava flows. Total area occupied by basalts is similar to 677 km(2), of which the oldest lava flows occupy almost 52% (354 km(2)) and the lavas of intermediate age share 43% (295 km(2)) while the recent lava flows merely share 5% (28 km(2)), including 6.8 km(2) referring to the volcanic cones. It should be noted that the generation of lava flows outlines a rather small area, of <= 20 km radius, circumventing the swarm epicenter zone. These maps may prove useful in volcanic hazard mapping for the rugged terrain.

TI  - Application of time series of remotely sensed normalized difference water, vegetation and moisture indices in characterizing flood dynamics of large-scale arid zone floodplains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floodplains are a key ecological feature of arid and semi-arid regions and flooding is the main source of vegetation productivity. Characterizing the spatiotemporal flood dynamics, such as surface water and changes in subsequent vegetation growth vigour and biomass, is essential in better understanding of ecology and hydrology of these regions. Recent remotely sensed flooding studies of arid zone floodplains have concentrated on improving classification of surface water, particularly in mixed water-vegetation areas; less is known about the effect of surface water flooding pattern on emergent vegetation dynamics. We use an integrated framework for mapping both flood extents and the persistence of floodplain response changes of water, vegetation and moisture in Cooper Creek, Australia. We analysed pixel-based time series of multiple indices generated by daily MODIS data for 14 highly variable flow flood events between 2000 and 2012. Results indicate that for the extremely flat Cooper Creek floodplain, mapping inundation area by changes in vegetation growth vigour and biomass was significantly larger than surface water mapping area (16.2% for the 2004 flood event) and the difference in inundation mapping mainly occurs around the inundated edges. In addition, by studying surface water and subsequent vegetation response together, it is possible to generate new information, such as the lag time between flooding and peak vegetation growth vigour and biomass, and persistence time of surface water and green vegetation, which provide important insights to arid zone floodplain behaviour. The large extent and high frequency of MODIS images provide advantages in characterizing inundation dynamics for large-scale floodplains where instantaneous (daily) inundation extent is considerably smaller than total cumulative inundation extent, compared with sensors with higher spatial resolution but lower temporal resolution; however, the coarse resolution of MODIS (500 m) limits its performance for small flood events. Globally, this approach is suitable for other large, low-gradient floodplains in arid zones that show similar, long duration vegetation responses as observed in Cooper Creek.(C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Deforestation and its causal factors in Sinaloa, Mexico
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research was to study deforestation and its causes in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico. Using mapping of land use and vegetation in 1993 and 2011 at a scale of 1: 250 000, deforestation was estimated through a technique of detecting changes, and then characterized by consulting experts. Finally, a matrix of change was applied to analyze the losses, gains and transitions and to corroborate cartographically the results obtained by the experts and the detection of changes. The results indicate a deforestation of 126.50 km(2)/year and an average annual rate of 0.41%. The consultation of experts determined that the main causes of these processes are agricultural expansion and extension of infrastructure, with impacts of 49.40% and 18.8%, respectively. The matrix of change showed that the particular category of rainforest lost 2374.19 km(2), on the contrary, seasonal agriculture also increased by 3326.62 km(2) and human settlements increased from 191.51 km(2) to 623.28 km(2).

TI  - Estimating Invasion Success by Non-Native Trees in a National Park Combining WorldView-2 Very High Resolution Satellite Data and Species Distribution Models
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasion by non-native tree species is an environmental and societal challenge requiring predictive tools to assess invasion dynamics. The frequent scale mismatch between such tools and on-ground conservation is currently limiting invasion management. This study aimed to reduce these scale mismatches, assess the success of non-native tree invasion and determine the environmental factors associated to it. A hierarchical scaling approach combining species distribution models (SDMs) and satellite mapping at very high resolution (VHR) was developed to assess invasion by Acacia dealbata in Peneda-Geres National Park, the only national park in Portugal. SDMs were first used to predict the climatically suitable areas for A. dealdata and satellite mapping with the random-forests classifier was then applied toWorldView-2 very-high resolution imagery to determine whether A. dealdata had actually colonized the predicted areas (invasion success). Environmental attributes (topographic, disturbance and canopy-related) differing between invaded and non-invaded vegetated areas were then analyzed. The SDM results indicated that most (67%) of the study area was climatically suitable for A. dealbata invasion. The onset of invasion was documented to 1905 and satellite mapping highlighted that 12.6% of study area was colonized. However, this species had only colonized 62.5% of the maximum potential range, although was registered within 55.6% of grid cells that were considerable unsuitable. Across these areas, the specific success rate of invasion was mostly below 40%, indicating that A. dealbata invasion was not dominant and effective management may still be possible. Environmental attributes related to topography (slope), canopy (normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi), land surface albedo) and disturbance (historical burnt area) differed between invaded and non-invaded vegetated area, suggesting that landscape attributes may alter at specific locations with Acacia invasion. Fine-scale spatial-explicit estimation of invasion success combining SDM predictions with VHR invasion mapping allowed the scale mismatch between predictions of invasion dynamics and on-ground conservation decision making for invasion management to be reduced. Locations with greater potential to suppress invasions could also be defined. Uncertainty in the invasion mapping needs to be accounted for in the interpretation of the results.

TI  - Comparing Landsat-7 ETM+ and ASTER Imageries to Estimate Daily Evapotranspiration Within a Mediterranean Vineyard Watershed
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the capabilities of Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) imageries for mapping daily evapotranspiration (ET) within a Mediterranean vineyard watershed. We used Landsat and ASTER data simultaneously collected on four dates in 2007 and 2008, along with the simplified surface energy balance index (S-SEBI) model. We used previously ground-validated good quality ASTER estimates as reference, and we analyzed the differences with Landsat retrievals in light of the instrumental factors and methodology. Although Landsat and ASTER retrievals of S-SEBI inputs were different, estimates of daily ET from the two imageries were similar. This is ascribed to the S-SEBI spatial differencing in temperature, and opens the path for using historical Landsat time series over vineyards.

TI  - Rapid Surveillance for Vector Presence (RSVP): Development of a novel system for detecting <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe globally important Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses are primarily transmitted by the invasive mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. In Australia, there is an increasing risk that these species may invade highly urbanized regions and trigger outbreaks. We describe the development of a Rapid Surveillance for Vector Presence (RSVP) system to expedite presence-absence surveys for both species.Methodology/ Principal findingsWe developed a methodology that uses molecular assays to efficiently screen pooled ovitrap (egg trap) samples for traces of target species ribosomal RNA. Firstly, specific real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were developed which detect a single Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus first instar larva in samples containing 4,999 and 999 non-target mosquitoes, respectively. ImageJ software was evaluated as an automated egg counting tool using ovitrap collections obtained from Brisbane, Australia. Qualitative assessment of ovistrips was required prior to automation because ImageJ did not differentiate between Aedes eggs and other objects or contaminants on 44.5% of ovistrips assessed, thus compromising the accuracy of egg counts. As a proof of concept, the RSVP was evaluated in Brisbane, Rockhampton and Goomeri, locations where Ae. aegypti is considered absent, present, and at the margin of its range, respectively. In Brisbane, Ae. aegypti was not detected in 25 pools formed from 477 ovitraps, comprising approximate to 54,300 eggs. In Rockhampton, Ae. aegypti was detected in 4/6 pools derived from 45 ovitraps, comprising approximate to 1,700 eggs. In Goomeri, Ae. aegypti was detected in 5/8 pools derived from 62 ovitraps, comprising approximate to 4,200 eggs.Conclusions/SignificanceRSVP can rapidly detect nucleic acids from low numbers of target species within large samples of endemic species aggregated from multiple ovitraps. This screening capability facilitates deployment of ovitrap configurations of varying spatial scales, from a single residential block to entire suburbs or towns. RSVP is a powerful tool for surveillance of invasive Aedes spp., validation of species eradication and quality assurance for vector control operations implemented during disease outbreaks.

TI  - Application of airborne gamma-ray imagery to assist soil survey: A case study from Thailand
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne gamma-ray imagery (AGRI) provides coarse-resolution (approximately 400 x 400 m pixel) spatial information on gamma-ray emitting elements, i.e. potassium (K), thorium (Th) and uranium (U), in the upper half meter of the soil. These radioelements are a potential information source for soil mapping since their abundance is related to soil geochemistry, specifically the chemical composition of parent materials and their weathering products resulting from geomorphic and pedogenic processes.The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of AGRI for improving digital soil survey process in two phases: (1) a preliminary phase, where hypotheses of soil-landscape relationships are developed, and (2) a phase where soil map unit boundaries are placed or revised. The study also evaluated the match between AGRI and existing lithologic, geopedologic, and soil series maps. The study was conducted in a well-characterized complex soil landscape: the 560 km2 upper Pa Sak watershed in Petchaboon province, Thailand. The relationship between gamma-ray data and geological units was examined with box-and-whisker plots and confirmed by rock and soil samples. Rock and soil sample classifications were compared with the gamma-ray image and to typical radio element responses found in the literature.To interpret AGRI data in terms of regolith and soil genesis, we compared AGRI to two existing soil maps: geopedologic and soil series maps. First, the geopedologic map was split into four maps according to the geopedologic hierarchy: landscape, lithology, relief, and landform; at the latter (lowest) level, soil units are also associated. Secondly, soil series and geopedologic soil units were used to examine the distribution of radio element response to selected soil characteristics: parent material, texture, mineralogy, and thickness. The interpretations from best correlation in both soil maps were described in terms of the radioelement changes during pedogenic and geomorphic processes, based on a review of literature and supported by soil samples. In the hypotheses-generating stage, AGRI provided useful information in three forms (single signal, ratio, and ternary images enhanced with a hill shaded DEM) by relating these to lithology, material transport, and internal pedogenetic processes. AGRI correlated well with the classes of the geopedologic map (1:50,000) at the two higher levels (landscape and lithology) but to a lesser degree at the two lower levels (relief and landform in geopedologic approach). In the mapping stage, AGRI showed deficiencies in the soil series map (1:50,000) made by conventional aerial photo analysis and limited field surveys, especially in inaccessible areas but also in low-relief terraces and flood plains, which provided a basis for future field sampling to correct these deficiencies. AGRI suggested new boundaries, differentiating topsoil properties and the presence of plinthite, despite its coarse resolution.Clustering of gamma ray and elevation data (DEM) was carried out using fuzzy logic to generate various classification layers. Final map was produced using total weighted inverse distance of all the classes in a 3 by 3 window. Class label was assigned to the one with the largest total inverse distance over the entire set of fuzzy classification bands. The result shows relatively higher classification accuracy for soil parent material differentiation (overall accuracy of 72%).as compared to the classification for soil types (67%).

TI  - Thyroid pathology in deer mice (<i>Peromyscus maniculata</i>) from a reclaimed mine site on the athabasca oil sands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on naturally occurring thyroid disease in wild animals in general and in small mammals specifically is extremely limited. In the present field-based work, we investigated the structure and function of thyroid glands of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculata) studied as sentinels of ecosystem sustainability on reclaimed areas post-mining on the oil sands of northeastern Alberta, because of their greater sensitivity to contaminants relative to meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) on the same sites. Extraction of bitumen in the oil sands of northeastern Alberta, results in the release of contaminants including polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), metals, and metalloids to the environment that have a measurable biological cost to wildlife living in the affected areas. In previous investigations, deer mice exposed to pollution at reclaimed areas showed compromised ability to regenerate glutathione indicating oxidative stress, together with decreased testicular mass and body condition during the breeding season. In the present study, thyroid glands from those deer mice from the reclaimed site had markedly increased follicular cell proliferation and decreased colloid compared to animals from the reference site. This pathology was positively associated with the greater oxidative stress in the deer mice. Thyroid hormones, both thyroxine and triiodothyronine, were also higher in animals with greater oxidative stress indicating increased metabolic demands from contaminant related subclinical toxicity. This work emphasizes the value of using a combination of endocrinological, histological and oxidative stress biomarkers to provide sensitive measures of contaminant exposure in small mammals on the oil sands.

TI  - Assessment of MISR Cloud Motion Vectors (CMVs) Relative to GOES and MODIS Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs)
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud motion vector (CMV) winds retrieved from the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on the polar-orbiting Terra satellite from 2003 to 2008 are compared with collocated atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) retrieved from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imagery over the tropics and midlatitudes and from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery near the poles. MISR imagery from multiple view angles is exploited to jointly retrieve stereoscopic cloud heights and motions, showing advantages over the AMV heights assigned by radiometric means, particularly at low heights (< 3 km) that account for over 95% of MISR CMV sampling. MISR-GOES wind differences exhibit a standard deviation ranging with increasing height from 3.3 to 4.5 ms(-1) for a high-quality [quality indicator (QI) >= 80] subset where height differences are < 1.5 km. Much of the observed difference can be attributed to the less accurately retrieved component of CMV motion along the direction of satellite motion. MISR CMV retrieval is subject to correlation between error in retrieval of this along-track component and of height. This manifests as along-track bias varying with height to magnitudes as large as 2.5 ms (1) . The cross-track component of MISR CMVs shows small (< 0.5ms(-1)) bias and standard deviation of differences (1.7ms(-1)) relative to GOES AMVs. Larger differences relative to MODIS are attributed to the tracking of cloud features at heights lower than MODIS in multilayer cloud scenes.

TI  - Machine Learning: An Applied Econometric Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Machines are increasingly doing "intelligent" things. Face recognition algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function that predicts the presence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: How do these new empirical tools fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Machine learning not only provides new tools, it solves a different problem. Specifically, machine learning revolves around the problem of prediction, while many economic applications revolve around parameter estimation. So applying machine learning to economics requires finding relevant tasks. Machine learning algorithms are now technically easy to use: you can download convenient packages in R or Python. This also raises the risk that the algorithms are applied naively or their output is misinterpreted. We hope to make them conceptually easier to use by providing a crisper understanding of how these algorithms work, where they excel, and where they can stumble-and thus where they can be most usefully applied.

TI  - Navigating pressured ice: Risks and hazards for winter resource-based shipping in the Canadian Arctic
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Year-round shipping is becoming common in the Canadian Arctic, a region rich in increasingly accessible natural resources. Currently, an average of two round-trip winter voyages (four single transits) (January, February, March) are made annually through the Hudson Strait to service the Raglan nickel mine in Deception Bay, Quebec. During these winter transits it is common for vessels to encounter pressured ice and become beset (stuck) for hours to days at a time. Pressured (or ridged) ice is one of the most challenging navigational hazards in the Arctic as it is difficult to predict or even detect until a vessel comes into direct contact with it. Using ship logs from 33 one-way winter transits through the Hudson Strait during winter months between 2005 and 2014, we evaluate the temporal and spatial frequency of vessel besetment events and relate these events With satellite based imagery of the region in order to examine the potential of satellite-based detection of ridges for the possible future development of real-time or prediction analytics for ridging events. Results indicate that on average the ship was beset 42% of each transit while in the Hudson Strait and often became beset in areas and times of the year associated with high ridge densities. These findings provide a basis for improving observation and prediction of hazardous ice conditions through the use satellite imagery and historic analysis of besetting events, though additional research is needed.

TI  - INTERANNUAL VARIATION OF CHLOROPHYLL-A CONCENTRATION IN THE EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE WATERS OF PENINSULAR MALAYSIA
T2  - Malaysian Applied Biology
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a concentration is one of the major indicators of phytoplankton production in the ocean. Identification of chlorophyll-a distribution and productivity is important to understand physical and biological processes in the ocean. The objectives of this study are to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of chlorophyll-a and to identify influence of sea surface temperature (SST)and current on chlorophyll-a concentration variation in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) waters of Peninsular Malaysia. Satellite data of chlorophyll-a concentration and SST (2007 to 2014) were derived from MODIS-Aqua and geostrophic current was obtained from NOAA Ocean Watch. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was used to determine the spatial and temporal variation of chlorophyll-a. Five modes represented the variation of chlorophyll-a. Mode 1 (60.62%) explained seasonal pattern, Mode 2 (27.83%) indicated patterns during the southwest monsoon, Mode 3 (19.96%) highlighted the inter monsoon of northeast to southwest. Mode 4 (19.57%) represented the northeast monsoon and Mode 5 (18.98%) explained inter monsoon of southwest to northeast. Variation of chlorophyll-a concentration was influenced by variability in SST and current during the monsoons. Variability in magnitude and direction of current circulation was observed to affect SST distribution thus influences concentration and distribution of chlorophyll-a.

TI  - Agricultural land use change in Karamoja Region, Uganda
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine dramatic cropland expansion in Karamoja, Uganda by investigating the links between biophysical and political historical events leading to the current state of agricultural land use. Our objective was to quantify agricultural expansion, uncover the dominant drivers leading to the current state of agricultural land use and its impacts on livelihoods. Region wide analysis of remotely sensed data, land use policy and history as well as farmer interviews were undertaken. We posit that government programs instituting sedentary agriculture are the most significant drivers of cropland expansion in Karamoja. We show a 299% increase in cropland area between 2000 and 2011 with most expansion occurring in Moroto District (from 706 ha to 23,328 ha). We found no evidence of an increase in overall crop production or food security and food aid continues to be essential due to recurrent crop failures. Due to lack of resources for inputs (e.g., seeds and labor) cultivated fields remain very small in size and over 55% of once cultivated land is left fallow. Our findings bring into question whether continued promotion of rain-fed agriculture in Karamoja serves the best interests of the people. Current cropland expansion is directly competing and compromising pasture areas critical for livestock-based livelihoods. Without strong agricultural extension programs and major investments in climate-smart options, cropland expansion will continue to have a net negative impact, especially in the context of current climate projections which indicate a future decrease in rainfall, increase in temperature and an increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme events.

TI  - Floodplain Mapping through Support Vector Machine and Optical/Infrared Images from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS Sensors: Case Study from Varanasi
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are among the most destructive natural disasters causing huge loss to life and property. Any flood management strategy requires floodplain mapping through discrimination of the flood prone areas. The city of Varanasi or Benaras is believed to be the oldest continuously inhabited city of the world. This study aims to develop tools for mapping and discrimination of floodplain of river Ganga at Varanasi. During 2014 floods, the flooded areas were extracted through Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and by Modified NDWI (MNDWI) using the NIR and SWIR bands separately from that of the Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The inundated areas were then identified through Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classification. The results reveal that the MNDWI images provide a better result for flood discrimination than the NDWI images. Ground based measurements for floodplain distance varied between 11 +/- 5 m at Janki ghat (bank) and 80 +/- 5 m at Asi ghat. The validation between measured and SVMs derived values indicate a strong positive correlation of 0.88 and a low value of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 12.62. The t-test is suggestive of no significant difference between the observed and SVMs values at 95% confidence level, indicating a satisfactory performance of the SVMs for floodplain mapping using Landsat 8 imagery. Therefore, the methodology proposed in this study provides a novel and robust way for floodplain mapping and has potential applications in disaster management and mitigation in the flood affected regions.

TI  - Changes in Landscape Greenness and Climatic Factors over 25 Years (1989-2013) in the USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and quantifying changes in vegetation cover over large areas using remote sensing can be achieved using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of greenness. However, distinguishing gradual shifts in NDVI (e.g., climate related-changes) versus direct and rapid changes (e.g., fire, land development) is challenging as changes can be confounded by time-dependent patterns, and variation associated with climatic factors. In the present study, we leveraged a method that we previously developed for a pilot study to address these confounding factors by evaluating NDVI change using autoregression techniques that compare results from univariate (NDVI vs. time) and multivariate analyses (NDVI vs. time and climatic factors) for 7,660,636 1 km x 1 km pixels comprising the 48 contiguous states of the USA, over a 25-year period (1989-2013). NDVI changed significantly for 48% of the nation over the 25-year period in the univariate analyses where most significant trends (85%) indicated an increase in greenness over time. By including climatic factors in the multivariate analyses of NDVI over time, the detection of significant NDVI trends increased to 53% (an increase of 5%). Comparisons of univariate and multivariate analyses for each pixel showed that less than 4% of the pixels had a significant NDVI trend attributable to gradual climatic changes while the remainder of pixels with a significant NDVI trend indicated that changes were due to direct factors. While most NDVI changes were attributable to direct factors like wildfires, drought or flooding of agriculture, and tree mortality associated with insect infestation, these conditions may be indirectly influenced by changes in climatic factors.

TI  - What controls the magnitude of the daytime heat sink in a desert city?
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to increase knowledge of the causes of cooling in desert cities. We used a time series of Landsat images to characterize the changes in daytime land surface temperature during the period of rapid urbanization in Dubai. Changes in land cover and albedo were also quantified from Landsat data and the development of different land use types and variations in urban geometry were characterized. The results demonstrate that urban growth has promoted a heat sink and that all urban land use types contributed to this effect. Vegetation generated the largest cooling effect per unit surface area but impervious surfaces dominated the urban environment and are responsible for the majority of the heat sink created by the city. Changes in albedo were not causally related to the urban heat sink, however, variations in urban geometry, particularly the amount of shading cast by buildings, had some influence on the magnitude of cooling. This study provides evidence that the expansion of the heat sink during urbanization in a desert environment is influenced by the forms of land cover transition, the type of urban land use that is developed, the thermal properties of construction materials used and the geometry of the city environment that is constructed. Future research should concentrate upon understanding these mechanisms in order to plan future developments which maximize cooling and reduce the environmental impacts of desert cities.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING

AB  - This paper reports the validation results of burst misalignment for ScanSAR-ScanSAR interferometry of the Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) aboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2, DAICHI-2). After the internal software modification on 8 February 2015, ALOS-2 ScanSAR observation mode archives have been available for use in interferometric analysis, as it was planned. However, it has not been reported whether its burst misalignment satisfies the mission requirements: 90% or higher burst overlap ratio. The validation results in this paper confirm that the expected observation misalignment satisfies the required range, including minimal seasonal and orbital dependencies. The results in this paper are obtained directly from the azimuth offset of the single look complex (SLC) data and are not derived from the orbit records. Nine identical orbits and frame numbers are chosen and evaluated to investigate the average burst misalignment and orbital dependency.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - The extent and timing of regional lymphadenectomy and its role in patients with clinically localized primary melanoma has been the subject of considerable debate. While therapeutic lymphadenectomy for clinically positive nodes is uniformly accepted, the benefit of regional lymphadenectomy in patients with clinically uninvolved lymph nodes potentially harboring micrometastatic disease is less clear. Efforts to better select patients for complete regional lymphadenectomy after sentinel lymph node biopsy are underway. The future holds the promise of more stringent selection criteria and perhaps the identification of subgroups of patients for which a therapeutic benefit may be realized. Moreover, novel sensitive radiological techniques for detecting in vivo micrometastatic nodal disease may improve surgical precision, further decreasing potential morbidities of lymphadenectomy.

AB  - This article highlights the personal journey of reflective development that a non-Aboriginal White researcher and health professional underwent to be "fully positioned" in the everyday lives of a rural Australian Aboriginal community in Western Australia. The article explains the researcher's personal development in areas important to building respect, building relationships, and ensuring reciprocity while undertaking Aboriginal research. The researcher reports on the reflective evaluation of her worldview. Understanding that judgment is a natural tendency, the researcher used reflexivity as a tool to examine and contextualize her judgments, presumptions, and preconceptions, which positioned her to be open to differing viewpoints and actively explore alternate perspectives. The researcher explores her evolutionary understanding that cultural competence is not a destination but a continual journey, and she details her knowledge development regarding the Aboriginal research paradigm, which requires that all the learning, sharing, and growth taking place is reciprocal and engages all parties actively.

TI  - Cloud-Base Height Estimation from VIIRS. Part II: A Statistical Algorithm Based on A-Train Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of cloud-base height (CBH) is important to describe cloud radiative feedbacks in numerical models and is of practical relevance to the aviation community. Whereas satellite remote sensing with passive radiometers traditionally has provided a ready means for estimating cloud-top height (CTH) and cloud water path (CWP), assignment of CBH requires heavy assumptions on the distribution of CWP within the cloud profile. An attempt to retrieve CBH has been included as part of the VIIRS environmental data records, produced operationally as part of the Suomi-National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) and the forthcoming Joint Polar Satellite System. Through formal validation studies tied to the program, it was found that the operational CBH algorithmfailed tomeet performance specifications inmany cases. This paper presents a new methodology for retrieving CBH of the uppermost cloud layer, developed through statistical analyses relating cloud geometric thickness (CGT) toCTHandCWP. The semiempirical approach, which relates these parameters via piecewise fitting, enlists A-Train satellite data [CloudSat cloud profiling radar (CPR), CALIPSO/CALIOP, and Aqua MODIS]. CBH is provided as the residual difference between CTH and CGT. By eliminating cloud type-dependent assumptions on CWP distribution, artifacts common to the operational algorithm ( which contribute to high errors) are reduced. Special accommodations are made for handling optically thin cirrus and deep convection. An application to SNPP VIIRS is demonstrated, and the results are compared against global CloudSat observations. From the VIIRS-CloudSat daytime matchups (September-October 2013 and January-May 2015), the new algorithm outperforms the operational SNPP VIIRS algorithm, particularly when the retrieved CTH is accurate. Best performance is expected for single-layer liquid-phase clouds.

TI  - Exploitation of the Intermittent SBAS (ISBAS) algorithm with COSMO-SkyMed data for landslide inventory mapping in north-western Sicily, Italy
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A large scale study of landslide processes was undertaken by coupling conventional geomorphological field surveys with aerial photographs along with an advanced Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) analysis of ground instability in north-western Sicily. COSMO-SkyMed satellite-images for the period between 2008 and 2011 were processed using the Intermittent Small BAseline Subset (ISBAS) technique, recently developed at the Department of Civil Engineering of the University of Nottingham. The use of ISBAS allowed the derivation of ground surface displacements across non-urbanized areas, thus overcoming one of the main limitations of conventional interferometric techniques. ISBAS provides ground motion information not only for urban but also for rural, woodland, grassland and agricultural terrains, which cover >60% of north-western Sicily, thereby improving by 40 times in some cases, the slope instability investigation capabilities of InSAR methods.ISBAS ground motion data enabled the updating of the landslide inventory for the areas of Piana degli Albanesi and Marineo (over 130 km(2)), which encompass a number of active, dormant and inactive landslides according to the pre-existing landslide inventory maps produced through aerial photo-interpretation and local field checks. An average of similar to 7000 ISBAS pixels km(-2) allowed the detection of small displacements in regions difficult to access. In particular, 226 landslides - mainly slides, flows and creep and four badlands were identified, comprising a total area of 2.53 km(2). When compared to the previous landslide inventory maps, 84 phenomena were confirmed, 67 new events were detected and 79 previously mapped events were re-assessed, modifying their typology, boundary and/or state of activity. Because the InSAR method used here is designed to measure slow rates of velocity and therefore may not detect fast-moving, events such as falls and topples, the results for Piana degli Albanesi and Marineo demonstrate the validity of this method to support land management, underlying the time and cost benefits of a combined approach using traditional monitoring procedures and satellite InSAR methods especially if slow-moving slope movements prevail.

TI  - Surveillance Systems from Public Health Institutions and Scientific Societies for Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-Associated Infections in Europe (SUSPIRE): protocol for a systematic review
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The worldwide spread of antimicrobial resistance is now recognised as a global public health threat. Owing to the geographical heterogeneity, complexity and continuously evolving dynamics of resistant organisms and genes, surveillance is a key tool for understanding, measuring and informing actions in the fight against this problem. To date there is no harmonisation of key indicators or of methodologies used to obtain them.Methods and analysis: The main objective of this project is to systematically review and analyse the current publicly available surveillance activities on antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections in Europe. Eligible activities are those endorsed by regional, national or transnational health organisations and scientific societies providing data on a periodic basis. Grey and peer-reviewed literature will be searched with no language restrictions. Three independent reviewers will perform a two-step selection process using a previously piloted, tailored electronic data extraction form.

TI  - A Case of Adenomyoepithelioma of the Breast Showing Strong Uptake of <SUP>18</SUP>F-Fluorodeoxyglucose on a Positron Emission Tomography
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - An adenomyoepithelioma of the breast is a rare tumor characterized by biphasic proliferation of both epithelial and myoepithelial cells. This tumor is generally considered as a benign neoplasm, and there are few reports describing the imaging features of this tumor through (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Here, we report a case of an adenomyoepithelioma that showed strong uptake of FDG on PET similar to that observed with a malignant tumor. A 73-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a 3.5-cm, mobile, and elastic hard tumor in the upper area of the left breast. Although the findings of mammography, ultrasonography, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging suggested that the tumor was malignant, it was diagnosed as an adenomyoepithelioma by core needle biopsy. An invasive ductal carcinoma, 0.5-cm in size, was detected in the medial upper area of the ipsilateral breast during an examination. Although FDG-PET demonstrated no lymph node or distant metastases from the invasive ductal carcinoma, strong uptake of FDG was detected in the adenomyoepithelioma. Breast conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy for the invasive ductal carcinoma together with resection of the adenomyoepithelioma was performed. A diagnosis of adenomyoepithelioma was confirmed through histologic examination of the resected specimen. This case indicates that some adenomyoepitheliomas may show a strong uptake of FDG on PET, which resembles a malignant tumor.

TI  - No Ordinary Love: Literary Reconfigurations of the Antelope Woman's Tale in Two Novels by Daniel Olorunfemi Fagunwa
T2  - RESEARCH IN AFRICAN LITERATURES
M3  - Article
AB  - D. O. Fagunwa's literary works intertextually relate to diverse discourses and textualities, including both oral and written, Yoruba and Western, contemporary and more ancient ones. Employing aspects and elements of these discourses and textualities in the service of his Christian-shaped worldview and creatively transforming them in the process, Fagunwa aimed to provide answers to what he conceived as urgent social questions of the day. As a case in point, this article offers a close analysis of his reconfiguration of the Yoruba tale of the encounter and marriage of a hunter and an antelope woman in his earliest two novels. It explores the ways in which Fagunwa correlates this tale and, most specifically, the figure of the antelope woman with other discourses, textualities, and tropes so as to address the issue of finding a suitable marriage partner and to negotiate his ideal of female agency in a rapidly changing contemporary society.

AB  - Myth and beauty come together to transmit original stories. Music transmits emotion and is found worldwide; it has always been present. Performances of rhythm and dance unite the group and accompany ceremonies. Art also includes anatomy, enabling the body to be harmonised and integrated within social codes. Images use the play of morphemes (elements of the form) and they result from the combination of support and graphical illusion. The icon (representation) turns into schemas while preserving its original meaning. The secondary variations of the forms of images indicate the way in which the worldview is maintained in each community. Symbols have contingent meanings, but their regularity and permanence also demonstrate the universal force that they occupy in the human spirit. Signs and images maintain continuous structural components, such as the elements of a tale. In all of these forms, art participates in the realisation of rituals that punctuate religious life. The logical structure of the figured scenes shows that they illustrate mythical tales. (C) 2016 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Landsat 8-based inversion methods for aerosol optical depths in the Beijing area
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As an essential component of the Earth-atmosphere system, aerosols have important impacts on the atmospheric environment and human health. Based on the data sourced from Landsat 8 satellite images, the goal of this paper is to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the Beijing area by means of the MODIS Dark Target (DT) Method and the visible near-infrared (VNIR) atmospheric correction method (ACM), of which the accuracy is verified by observation data from AERONET. Furthermore, analysis was conducted to assess the effects of the two specific inversion methods on AOD values and AOD distribution characteristics in Beijing. The results indicate the following: 1) both the DT method and the VNIR method can be used successfully in the inversion of AOD in Beijing with Landsat 8 satellite data, while the DT method generates a slightly higher accuracy than that of the VNIR method, in which the root mean squared error (RMSE) values are 0.195 and 0.282, respectively; 2) AOD distribution in Beijing is presented with significant regional features, in which the areas with high AOD values were mainly concentrated in six districts (Dongcheng, Xicheng, Chaoyang, Fengtai, Haidian, and Shijingshan) and their surrounding areas. In addition, the AOD values are relatively low in the southwestern and northern regions of Beijing, which was mainly due to minor impacts of human activity and transportation.

TI  - Appearance learning for 3D pose detection of a satellite at close-range
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we present a learning-based 3D detection of a highly challenging specular object exposed to a direct sunlight at very close-range. An object detection is one of the most important areas of image processing, and can also be used for initialization of local visual tracking methods. While the object detection in 3D space is generally a difficult problem, it poses more difficulties when the object is specular and exposed to the direct sunlight as in a space environment. Our solution to a such problem relies on an appearance learning of a real satellite mock-up based on a vector quantization and the vocabulary tree. Our method, implemented on a standard computer (CPU), exploits a full perspective projection model and provides near real-time 3D pose detection of a satellite for close-range approach and manipulation. The time consuming part of the training (feature description, building the vocabulary tree and indexing, depth buffering and back-projection) are performed offline, while a fast image retrieval and 3D-2D registration are performed on-line. In contrast, the state of the art image-based 3D pose detection methods are slower on CPU or assume a weak perspective camera projection model. In our case the dimension of the satellite is larger than the distance to the camera, hence the assumption of the weak perspective model does not hold. To evaluate the proposed method, the appearance of a full scale mock-up of the rear part of the TerraSAR-X satellite is trained under various illumination and camera views. The training images are captured with a camera mounted on six degrees of freedom robot, which enables to position the camera in a desired view, sampled over a sphere. The views that are not within the workspace of the robot are interpolated using image-based rendering. Moreover, we generate ground truth poses to verify the accuracy of the detection algorithm. The achieved results are robust and accurate even under noise due to specular reflection, and able to initialize a local tracking method.

TI  - Landsat 8 remote sensing reflectance (R<sub>rs</sub>) products: Evaluations, intercomparisons, and enhancements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat-8 is generating high-quality aquatic science products, the most critical of which is the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), defined as the ratio of water-leaving radiance to the total downwelling irradiance just above water. The quality of the R-rs products has not, however, been extensively assessed. This manuscript provides a comprehensive evaluation of Level-1B, i.e., top of atmosphere reflectance, and R-rs products available from OLI imagery under near-ideal atmospheric conditions in moderately turbid waters. The procedure includes a) evaluations of the R-rs products at sites included in the Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC), b) intercomparisons and cross-calibrations against other ocean color products, and c) optimizations of vicarious calibration gains across the entire OLI observing swath. Results indicate that the near-infrared and shortwave infrared (NIR-SWIR) band combinations yield the most robust and stable R-rs retrievals in moderately turbid waters. Intercomparisons against products derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Aqua platform (MODISA) indicate slight across-track non-uniformities (<1%) associated with OLI scenes in the blue bands. In both product domains (TOA and R-rs), on average, the OLI products were found larger in radiometric responses in the blue channels. Following the implementation of updated vicarious calibration gains and accounting for across-track non-uniformities, matchup analyses using independent in-situ validation data confirmed improvements in R-rs products. These findings further support high-fidelity OLI-derived aquatic science products in terms of both demonstrating a robust atmospheric correction method and providing consistent products across OLI's imaging swath.

TI  - Mapping Palaeohydrography in Deserts: Contribution from Space-Borne Imaging Radar
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the capability to image subsurface features down to several meters in arid regions. A first demonstration of this capability was performed in the Egyptian desert during the early eighties, thanks to the first Shuttle Imaging Radar mission. Global coverage provided by recent SARs, such as the Japanese ALOS/PALSAR sensor, allowed the mapping of vast ancient hydrographic systems in Northern Africa. We present a summary of palaeohydrography results obtained using PALSAR data over large deserts such as the Sahara and the Gobi. An ancient river system was discovered in eastern Lybia, connecting in the past the Kufrah oasis to the Mediterranean Sea, and the terminal part of the Tamanrasett river was mapped in western Mauritania, ending with a large submarine canyon. In southern Mongolia, PALSAR images combined with topography analysis allowed the mapping of the ancient Ulaan Nuur lake. We finally show the potentials of future low frequency SAR sensors by comparing L-band (1.25 GHz) and P-band (435 MHz) airborne SAR acquisitions over a desert site in southern Tunisia.

TI  - Satellite-Based Probabilistic Assessment of Soil Moisture Using C-Band Quad-Polarized RISAT1 Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper attempts to probabilistically estimate the surface soil moisture content (SMC) by using the synthetic aperture radar data provided by radar imaging satellite1. The novelty of this paper lies in: 1) developing a combined index to understand the role of all the backscattering coefficients with different polarization and soil texture information in influencing the SMC; 2) using normalized incidence angles, which enables the model to be applicable for different incidence angles; and 3) determination of uncertainty range of the estimated SMC. The dimensionality problem, which is frequently observed in the multivariate analysis, is reduced in the development of the combined index by the use of supervised principal component analysis (SPCA). The SPCA also ensures the maximum attainable association between the developed combined index and surface SMC above wilting point (WP). The association between the combined index and the surface SMC above WP is modeled through joint probability distribution by using the Frank copula. The model is developed and validated with the field soil moisture values over 334 monitoring points within the study area. The outcomes obtained by applying the proposed model indicate an encouraging potential of the model to be applied for bareland and vegetated land (< 30 cm height).

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in patients with stage I endometrial carcinoma: a focus on bilateral mapping identification by comparing radiotracer Tc99<SUP>m</SUP> with blue dye versus indocyanine green fluorescent dye
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare technetium radiocolloid (Tc99(m)) + blue dye (BD) versus Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent dye in terms of the overall detection rate and bilateral sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in patients with endometrial carcinoma.Patients from five European centers with apparently confined clinical stage I endometrial cancer were reviewed. A comparison was made between women who received SLN mapping with pelvic and/or aortic lymphadenectomy (LND), and women who underwent SLN algorithm (SA), was also performed between the two groups.Three hundred and forty-two (342) women were involved (147 in the Tc99(m) + BD group and 195 in the ICG group). The overall detection rate of SLN biopsy was 97.3% (143/147) for women in the Tc99(m) + BD group and 96.9% (189/195) for women in the ICG group (p = 0.547). The bilateral mapping rate for ICG was 84.1%-significantly higher with respect to the 73.5% obtained with Tc99(m) + BD (p = 0.007). No differences in overall sensitivity (OS) and overall false negative rate (FNR) were seen between LND and SA (p value = 0.311), whereas the negative predictive value (NPV) was in favor of SA group (p value = 0.030).In this study, fluorescent mapping using ICG resulted equivalent to the standard combined radiocolloid and BD, but real-time SLN mapping achieves a higher bilateral detection rate. The added value that this fast emerging technology promises to give certainly warrants future studies to further consolidate the advantages there are over the standard technique.

TI  - FIGO stage IIIC endometrial cancer identification among patients with complex atypical hyperplasia, grade 1 and 2 endometrioid endometrial cancer: laparoscopic indocyanine green sentinel lymph node mapping versus frozen section of the uterus, why get around the problem?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To compare two surgical strategies used to identify lymph node metastases in patients with preoperative diagnosis of complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH), grade 1 and 2 endometrial cancer (EC).Data on patients with preoperative diagnosis of CAH, grade 1 and 2 EC undergoing laparoscopic indocyanine green (ICG) sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping followed by frozen section of the uterus were collected. When risk factors were identified at frozen section, patients were subjected to a systematic lymphadenectomy. False negative (FN) rates, negative predictive values (NPV), positive predictive values (PPV) and correlation with stage IIIC EC were calculated for the systematic lymphadenectomy based on frozen section of the uterus and for the SLN mapping.Six (9.5%) out of 63 patients had lymph nodal metastases. Based on frozen section of the uterus, 22 (34.9%) and 15 (22.2%) patients underwent a pelvic and a pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy, respectively. Five patients with stage IIIC disease were identified with a FN rate of 16.7% and a NPV and PPV of 97.6 and 27.3%, respectively. Overall and bilateral detection rates of ICG SLN mapping were 100 and 97.6%, respectively; no FN were recorded. The identification of patients with stage IIIC disease with ICG SLN mapping showed a NPV and PPV of 100%. Correlation between indication to lymphadenectomy and stage IIIC disease was poor (kappa = 0.244) when based on frozen section of the uterus and excellent (kappa = 1) when based on SLN mapping.ICG SLN mapping reduces the number of unnecessary systematic lymphadenectomies and the risk of underdiagnosing patients with metastatic lymph nodes.

TI  - Inverting Aboveground Biomass-Canopy Texture Relationships in a Landscape of Forest Mosaic in the Western Ghats of India Using Very High Resolution Cartosat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large scale assessment of aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests is often limited by the saturation of remote sensing signals at high AGB values. Fourier Transform Textural Ordination (FOTO) performs well in quantifying canopy texture from very high-resolution (VHR) imagery, from which stand structure parameters can be retrieved with no saturation effect for AGB values up to 650 Mgha(-1). The method is robust when tested on wet evergreen forests but is more demanding when applied across different forest types characterized by varying structures and allometries. The present study focuses on a gradient of forest types ranging from dry deciduous to wet evergreen forests in the Western Ghats (WG) of India, where we applied FOTO to Cartosat-1a images with 2.5 m resolution. Based on 21 1-ha ground control forest plots, we calibrated independent texture-AGB models for the dry and wet zone forests in the area, as delineated from the distribution of NDVI values computed from LISS-4 multispectral images. This stratification largely improved the relationship between texture-derived and field-derived AGB estimates, which exhibited a R-2 of 0.82 for a mean rRMSE of ca. 17%. By inverting the texture-AGB models, we finally mapped AGB predictions at 1.6-ha resolution over a heterogeneous landscape of ca. 1500 km(2) in the WG, with a mean relative per-pixel propagated error <20% for wet zone forests, i.e., below the recommended IPCC criteria for Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) methods. The method proved to perform well in predicting high-resolution AGB values over heterogeneous tropical landscape encompassing diversified forest types, and thus presents a promising option for affordable regional monitoring systems of greenhouse gas (GhG) emissions related to forest degradation.

TI  - Evaluation of recovery and monitoring methods for parasitoids released against emerald ash borer
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, EAB) is an invasive forest pest and the target of an extensive biological control program designed to mitigate EAB-caused ash (Fraxinus spp.) mortality. Since 2007, hymenopteran parasitoids of EAB from northeastern Asia have been released as biological control agents in North America, including Oobius agrili (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), an egg parasitoid; Tetrastichus planipennisi (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), a larval endoparasitoid; and Spathius agrili (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a larval ectoparasitoid. Following parasitoid releases in new locations, methods currently used to document presence and establishment and to monitor dispersal of parasitoids in the field were simultaneously evaluated, including destructive sampling of entire trees and deployment of egg sentinel logs (ESLs), egg sentinel cups (ESCs), larval sentinel logs (LSLs), and yellow pan traps (YPTs). All three parasitoids were recovered using YPTs and destructive sampling of trees. Spathius agrili was the only species to be recovered using LSLs, however, results indicate YPTs were as effective as LSLs. YPTs were also as effective as destructive sampling of entire trees for O. agrili and S. agrili detection. YPT trap catches were significantly associated with egg parasitism on sampled trees by O. agrili, but not for larval parasitoids. Additional research indicated YPTs are effective in recovering O. agrili and T. planipennisi at distances as great as 20 m from release points. It is therefore recommended that YPTs be used as the preferred method for parasitoid recovery as the other methods are much more labor intensive and prone to difficulties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - First Results from Sentinel-1A InSAR over Australia: Application to the Perth Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Past ground-based geodetic measurements in the Perth Basin, Australia, record small-magnitude subsidence (up to 7 mm/y), but are limited to discrete points or traverses across parts of the metropolitan area. Here, we investigate deformation over a much larger region by performing the first application of Sentinel-1A InSAR data to Australia. The duration of the study is short (0.7 y), as dictated by the availability of Sentinel-1A data. Despite this limited observation period, verification of Sentinel-1A with continuous GPS and independent TerraSAR-X provides new insights into the deformation field of the Perth Basin. The displacements recorded by each satellite are in agreement, identifying broad (>5 km wide) areas of subsidence at rates up to 15 mm/y. Subsidence at rates greater than 20 mm/y over smaller regions (approximate to 2 km wide) is coincident with wetland areas, where displacements are temporally correlated with changes in groundwater levels in the unconfined aquifer. Longer InSAR time series are required to determine whether these measured displacements are representative of long-term deformation or (more likely) seasonal variations. However, the agreement between datasets demonstrates the ability of Sentinel-1A to detect small-magnitude deformation over different spatial scales (from 2 km-10 s of km) in the Perth Basin. We suggest that, even over short time periods, these data are useful as a reconnaissance tool to identify regions for subsequent targeted studies, particularly given the large swath size of radar acquisitions, which facilitates analysis of a broader portion of the deformation field than ground-based methods or single scenes of TerraSAR-X.

TI  - Measuring the quality of melanoma surgery Highlighting issues with standardization and quality assurance of care in surgical oncology
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - In an attempt to ensure high standards of cancer care, there is increasing interest in determining and monitoring the quality of interventions in surgical oncology. In recent years, this has been particularly the case for melanoma surgery. The vast majority of patients with melanoma undergo surgery. Usually, this is with combinations of wide excision, sentinel lymph node biopsy and lymphadenectomy. The indications for these procedures evolved during a time when no effective systemic adjuvant therapy was available, and whilst the rationale has been sound, the justification for differences in extent and thoroughness has generally been supported by inadequate or low-level evidence. This has led to a substantial variation among melanoma centres or even among surgeons within a centre in how these procedures are done. With recent rapid progress in the efficacy of systemic treatments that are impacting on overall survival, the prospect of long-term survival in these previously high risk patients means that more than ever long-term locoregional control of melanoma is imperative. Furthermore, the understanding of effects of systemic therapy on locoregional disease will only be interpretable if surgeons use standardized, high quality techniques. This article focuses on standardization and evolution of quality indicators for melanoma surgery and how these might have a positive impact on patient care.

TI  - Adapting Nepal's polio eradication programme
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Problem Many countries have weak disease surveillance and immunization systems. The elimination of polio creates an opportunity to use staff and assets from the polio eradication programme to control other vaccine-preventable diseases and improve disease surveillance and immunization systems.Approach In 2003, the active surveillance system of Nepal's polio eradication programme began to report on measles and neonatal tetanus cases. Japanese encephalitis and rubella cases were added to the surveillance system in 2004. Staff from the programme aided the development and implementation of government immunization policies, helped launch vaccination campaigns, and trained government staff in reporting practices and vaccine management.Local setting Nepal eliminated indigenous polio in 2000, and controlled outbreaks caused by polio importations between 2005 and 2010.Relevant changes In 2014, the surveillance activities had expanded to 299 sites, with active surveillance for measles, rubella and neonatal tetanus, including weekly visits from 15 surveillance medical officers. Sentinel surveillance for Japanese encephalitis consisted of 132 sites. Since 2002, staff from the eradication programme have helped to introduce six new vaccines and helped to secure funding from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Staff have also assisted in responding to other health events in the country.Lesson learnt By expanding the activities,of its polio eradication programme, Nepal has improved its surveillance and immunization systems and increased vaccination coverage of other vaccine-preventable diseases. Continued donor support, a close collaboration with the Expanded Programme on Immunization, and the retention of the polio eradication programme's skilled workforce were important for this expansion.

TI  - Assessment of Canopy Chlorophyll Content Retrieval in Maize and Soybean: Implications of Hysteresis on the Development of Generic Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy chlorophyll content (Chl) closely relates to plant photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen status and productivity. The goal of this study is to develop remote sensing techniques for accurate estimation of canopy Chl during the entire growing season without re-parameterization of algorithms for two contrasting crop species, maize and soybean. These two crops represent different biochemical mechanisms of photosynthesis, leaf structure and canopy architecture. The relationships between canopy Chl and reflectance, collected at close range and resampled to bands of the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Sentinel-2, were analyzed in samples taken across the entirety of the growing seasons in three irrigated and rainfed sites located in eastern Nebraska between 2001 and 2005. Crop phenology was a factor strongly influencing the reflectance of both maize and soybean. Substantial hysteresis of the reflectance vs. canopy Chl relationship existed between the vegetative and reproductive stages. The effect of the hysteresis on vegetation indices (VI), applied for canopy Chl estimation, depended on the bands used and their formulation. The hysteresis greatly affected the accuracy of canopy Chl estimation by widely-used VIs with near infrared (NIR) and red reflectance (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and simple ratio (SR)). VIs that use red edge and NIR bands (e.g., red edge chlorophyll index (CIred edge), red edge NDVI and the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI)) were minimally affected by crop phenology (i.e., they exhibited little hysteresis) and were able to accurately estimate canopy Chl in two crops without algorithm re-parameterization and, thus, were found to be the best candidates for generic algorithms to estimate crop Chl using the surface reflectance products of MSI Sentinel-2.

TI  - Evidence for Wild Crocodiles as a Risk for Human Leptospirosis, Mexico
T2  - ECOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel species such as crocodilians are used to monitor the health of ecosystems. However, few studies have documented the presence of zoonotic diseases in wild populations of these reptiles. Herein we analyzed 48 serum samples from Crocodylus acutus (n = 34) and C. moreletii (n = 14) from different sites in the state of Quintana Roo (Mexico) to detect antibodies to Leptospira interrogans by means of a microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Crocodylus acutus and C. moreletii tested positive to 11 and 9 serovars, respectively, with Grippotyphosa being the serovar with the highest prevalence in Cozumel island (100%), Banco Chinchorro Biosphere Reserve (70.6%), and Rio Hondo (100%), while in Chichankanab Lake, it was Bratislava (75%). Titers ranged from 1: 50 to 1: 3200, and the most frequent was 1: 50 in all study sites. Leptospira is present in fresh and saltwater individuals due to the resistance of the bacterium in both environments. Cases of infected people involved with crocodile handling and egg collection suggest that these reptiles could play an important role in the transmission of leptospirosis. Preventive medicine programs should consider the monitoring of reptiles, and testing the soil and water, to prevent outbreaks of leptospirosis in facilities containing crocodiles.

TI  - High-Resolution Sea Ice Motion Estimation With Optical Flow Using Satellite Spectroradiometer Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is twofold: 1) to propose an approach based on optical flow for the estimation of sea ice motion as an accurate, dense, and computationally efficient alternative to state-of-the-art pattern matching approaches and 2) to investigate the potential of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) optical satellite data for combined daily and high-resolution motion estimation. A series of MODIS image pairs for a selected region in Arctic Ocean is employed, and sparse pairwise correspondences between nonrigid patches are calculated. An edge-preserving sparse-to-dense interpolation is applied followed by variational energy minimization to compute the final optical flow. A state-of-the-art multiresolution pattern matching method based on phase correlation and normalized cross correlation is also implemented and evaluated for comparison. Thorough experimentation with different settings of input data preprocessing as well as varying scales of motion is performed. The derived motion vectors are compared with coarser resolution operational sea ice motion vector products from combined buoy and microwave satellite data. The proposed optical flow approach clearly outperforms the pattern matching method in most cases, both in terms of accuracy and motion vector consistency. The estimated motion vectors from the MODIS images highly correlate with the operational vector products. In addition, MODIS provides a vector field with spatial resolution two orders of magnitude higher than the operational products that are able to detect significantly smaller sea ice drifts.

TI  - Pertussis incidence rates in Novi Sad (Serbia) before and during improved surveillance
T2  - SRPSKI ARHIV ZA CELOKUPNO LEKARSTVO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction/Objective The Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) proposed clinical case definitions for pertussis diagnosis in three different age cohorts in order to improve surveillance of pertussis especially in older children, adolescents, and adults.The main goal of this research was to compare the burden of pertussis in the city of Novi Sad before and after the introduction of improved surveillance using the GPI clinical case definitions of pertussis.Methods Baseline data on pertussis were obtained from routine (non-sentinel) reporting before improved surveillance was introduced. From September 16, 2012, clinical case definitions proposed by GPI were applied within improved (sentinel and hospital) surveillance, while surveillance clinical case definitions were not introduced within non-sentinel. To confirm the suspected diagnosis, sampling of nasopharyngeal swab and/or blood was obtained from all cases. The choice of laboratory method (PCR or ELISA) depended on the duration of coughing and the age of the patients. Data were statistically processed by SPSS Statistics, version 22.Results During the 12-year period before the introduction of improved surveillance, only two clinical pertussis cases were registered. In contrast, during the two-year period of improved surveillance, a total of 14 (season 2012/13) and 146 (season 2013/2014) confirmed pertussis cases were reported. Significant differences were determined in distribution of pertussis according to the type of surveillance and the level of health care.Conclusion Introduction of clinical case definitions proposed by GPI improved the quality of surveillance and enabled an insight in the distribution of pertussis in all age groups and at all levels of health care.

TI  - Trigeminal sensitivity in chronic rhinosinusitis: topographical differences and the effect of surgery
T2  - RHINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Little is known on endonasal trigeminal sensitivity in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).The aim of our study was to investigate changes in trigeminal sensitivity in patients with CRSwNP and the effect of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) on trigeminal perception.Methods: A prospective study was performed to investigate the trigeminal sensitivity at three different locations within the nose (anterior septum, anterior lateral wall, middle turbinate) using, electrical stimuli.Therefore 45 CRSwNP patients were compared to 30 healthy subjects. Further, the effect of FESS was investigated in 31 patients before and 3 months after surgery.Results: CRSwNP patients had a significantly higher trigeminal threshold at all tested locations than healthy subjects. The lowest trigeminal detection threshold could be shown at the"entrance"of the nose in healthy subjects and in patients with CRSwNP. Three months after FESS a significant improvement of trigeminal detection threshold was observed at the anterior nasal septum.Conclusion: Protective function of the trigeminal system is preserved in CRSwNP patients. FESS seems to show bene cial effects on restoring sentinel function at the"entrance" of the nose.

TI  - Size Distribution, Surface Coverage, Water, Carbon, and Metal Storage of Thermokarst Lakes in the Permafrost Zone of the Western Siberia Lowland
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the importance of thermokarst (thaw) lakes of the subarctic zone in regulating greenhouse gas exchange with the atmosphere and the flux of metal pollutants and micro-nutrients to the ocean, the inventory of lake distribution and stock of solutes for the permafrost-affected zone are not available. We quantified the abundance of thermokarst lakes in the continuous, discontinuous, and sporadic permafrost zones of the western Siberian Lowland (WSL) using Landsat-8 scenes collected over the summers of 2013 and 2014. In a territory of 105 million ha, the total number of lakes >0.5 ha is 727,700, with a total surface area of 5.97 million ha, yielding an average lake coverage of 5.69% of the territory. Small lakes (0.5-1.0 ha) constitute about one third of the total number of lakes in the permafrost-bearing zone of WSL, yet their surface area does not exceed 2.9% of the total area of lakes in WSL. The latitudinal pattern of lake number and surface coverage follows the local topography and dominant landscape zones. The role of thermokarst lakes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and most trace element storage in the territory of WSL is non-negligible compared to that of rivers. The annual lake storage across the WSL of DOC, Cd, Pb, Cr, and Al constitutes 16%, 34%, 37%, 57%, and 73%, respectively, of their annual delivery by WSL rivers to the Arctic Ocean from the same territory. However, given that the concentrations of DOC and metals in the smallest lakes (<0.5 ha) are much higher than those in the medium and large lakes, the contribution of small lakes to the overall carbon and metal budget may be comparable to, or greater than, their contribution to the water storage. As such, observations at high spatial resolution (<0.5 ha) are needed to constrain the reservoirs and the mobility of carbon and metals in aquatic systems. To upscale the DOC and metal storage in lakes of the whole subarctic, the remote sensing should be coupled with hydrochemical measurements in aquatic systems of boreal plains.

TI  - Implementation of Algorithm for Satellite-Derived Bathymetry Using Open Source GIS and Evaluation for Tsunami Simulation
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and high resolution bathymetric data is a necessity for a wide range of coastal oceanographic research topics. Active sensing methods, such as ship-based soundings and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), are expensive and time consuming solutions. Therefore, the significance of Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has increased in the last ten years due to the availability of multi-constellation, multi-temporal, and multi-resolution remote sensing data as Open Data. Effective SDB algorithms have been proposed by many authors, but there is no ready-to-use software module available in the Geographical Information System (GIS) environment as yet. Hence, this study implements a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) based SDB workflow as a Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS module (i.image.bathymetry). Several case studies were carried out to examine the performance of the module in multi-constellation and multi-resolution satellite imageries for different study areas. The results indicate a strong correlation between SDB and reference depth. For instance, case study 1 (Puerto Rico, Northeastern Caribbean Sea) has shown an coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.98 and an Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.61 m, case study 2 (Iwate, Japan) has shown an R-2 of 0.94 and an RMSE of 1.50 m, and case study 3 (Miyagi, Japan) has shown an R-2 of 0.93 and an RMSE of 1.65 m. The reference depths were acquired by using LiDAR for case study 1 and an echo-sounder for case studies 2 and 3. Further, the estimated SDB has been used as one of the inputs for the Australian National University and Geoscience Australia (ANUGA) tsunami simulation model. The tsunami simulation results also show close agreement with post-tsunami survey data. The i.mage.bathymetry module developed as a part of this study is made available as an extension for the Open Source GRASS GIS to facilitate wide use and future improvements.

TI  - Mosquito Traps: An Innovative, Environmentally Friendly Technique to Control Mosquitoes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We tested the use of mosquito traps as an alternative to spraying insecticide in Camargue (France) following the significant impacts observed on the non-target fauna through Bti persistence and trophic perturbations. In a village of 600 inhabitants, 16 Techno Bam traps emitting CO2 and using octenol lures were set from April to November 2016. Trap performance was estimated at 70% overall based on mosquitoes landing on human bait in areas with and without traps. The reduction of Ochlerotatus caspius and Oc. detritus, the two species targeted by Bti spraying, was, respectively, 74% and 98%. Traps were less efficient against Anopheles hyrcanus (46%), which was more attracted by lactic acid than octenol lures based on previous tests. Nearly 300,000 mosquitoes from nine species were captured, with large variations among traps, emphasizing that trap performance is also influenced by surrounding factors. Environmental impact, based on the proportion of non-target insects captured, was mostly limited to small chironomids attracted by street lights. The breeding success of a house martin colony was not significantly affected by trap use, in contrast to Bti spraying. Our experiment confirms that the deployment of mosquito traps can offer a cost-effective alternative to Bti spraying for protecting local populations from mosquito nuisance in sensitive natural areas.

TI  - STIRPICULTURE: SCIENCE-GUIDED HUMAN PROPAGATION AND THE ONEIDA COMMUNITY
T2  - ZYGON
M3  - Article
AB  - Between 1869 and 1879, the communal Christian group the Oneida Community undertook a pioneering eugenics experiment called "stirpiculture" in upstate New York. Stirpiculture resulted in the planned conception, birth, and communal rearing of fifty-eight children, bred from selected members of the Oneida Community. This article concerns how the Oneida Community's unique approach to religion and science provided the framework for the creation, process, and eventual dissolution of the stirpiculture experiment. The work seeks to expand current understanding of the early history of eugenics in the United States by placing its practice more than two decades earlier than is generally considered. Additionally, this article situates the Community's leader John Humphrey Noyes as an early eugenics and social scientific thinker. Finally, the treatment provides a case study for the transitional period in mid to late nineteenth century America whereby scientific modes of epistemology were accommodated within or supplanted by theological worldviews.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening is the process of transferring the spatial resolution of panchromatic (PAN) image to a multispectral (MS) image for producing a single image with high spatial detail and rich spectral information. In this study, PAN and MS imagery of Quickbird-2 and Landsat8 are fused separately, using ten different pan-sharpening methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), modified-intensity hue saturation (M-IHS), multiplicative, brovey transform (BT), wavelet-principal component analysis (W-PCA), hyperspectral color space (HCS), high-pass filter (HPF), Gram-Schmidt (GS), Fuze Go, and nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT). The effectiveness of these techniques is assessed and compared by qualitative analysis and 14 quantitative analysis methods including bias, correlation coefficient (CC), difference in variance (DIV), relative dimensionless global error in synthesis (ERGAS), universal image quality index (Q), relative average spectral error (RASE), root mean square error (RMSE), structural similarity index method (SSIM), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), peak SNR (PSNR), spatial correlation coefficient (SCC), image entropy (E), and gradient and quality with no reference image (QNR). The results of both analysis types show that the Fuze Go and NSCT produced the best fused image with high spatial detail and rich spectral information followed by the HPF and GS.

AB  - Ultra-wideband radar-based penetrating detection and recognition of human activities has become a focus on remote sensing in various military applications in recent years, such as urban warfare, hostage rescue, and earthquake post-disaster rescue. However, an excellent micro-Doppler signature (MDS) extracting method of human motion with high time-frequency resolution, outstanding anti-interference ability, and extensive adaptability, which aims to provide favorable and more detailed features for human activity recognition and classification, especially in the non-free space detection environment, is in great urgency. To cope with the issue, a multiple Hilbert-Huang transform (MHHT) method is proposed for high-resolution time-frequency analysis of finer-grained human activity MDS hidden in ultra-wideband (UWB) radar echoes during the through-wall detection environment. Based on the improved HHT with effective intrinsic mode function (IMF) selection according to the cosine similarity (CS) principle, the improved HHT is applied to each channel signal in the effective channel scope of the UWB radar signal and then integrated along the range direction. The activities of swinging one or two arms while standing at a spot 3 m from a wall were used to validate the abilities of the proposed method for extracting and separating the MDS of different moving body structures with a high time-frequency resolution. Simultaneously, the corresponding relationship between the frequency components in MHHT-based spectra and structures of the moving human body was demonstrated according to the radar Doppler principle combined with the principle of human body kinematics. Moreover, six common finer-grained human activities and a piaffe at different ranges under the through-wall detection environment were exploited to confirm the adaptability of the novel method for different activities and pre-eminent anti-interference ability under a low signal-noise-clutter ratio (SNCR) environment, which is critical for remote sensing in various military application, such as urban warfare, hostage rescue, earthquake post-disaster rescue.

TI  - Responses of Vegetation Growth to Climatic Factors in Shule River Basin in Northwest China: A Panel Analysis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation response to climatic factors is a hot topic in global change research. However, research on vegetation in Shule River Basin, which is a typical arid region in northwest China, is still limited, especially at micro scale. On the basis of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data and daily meteorological data, employing panel data models and other mathematical models, the aim of this paper is to reveal the interactive relationship between vegetation variation and climatic factors in Shule River Basin. Results show that there is a widespread greening trend in the whole basin during 2000-2015, and 80.28% of greening areas (areas with vegetation improvement) are distributed over upstream region, but the maximum vegetation variation appears in downstream area. The effects of climate change on NDVI lag about half to one month. The parameters estimated using panel data models indicate that precipitation and accumulated temperature have positive contribution to NDVI. With every 1-mm increase in rainfall, NDVI increases by around 0.223 parts per thousand in upstream area and 0.6 parts per thousand in downstream area. With every 1-degrees C increase in accumulated temperature, NDVI increases by around 0.241 parts per thousand in upstream area and 0.174 parts per thousand in downstream area. Responses of NDVI to climatic factors are more sensitive when these factors are limiting than when they are not limiting. NDVI variation has performance in two seasonal and inter-annual directions, and the range of seasonal change is far more than that of inter-annual change. The inverted U-shaped curve of the variable intercepts reflects the seasonal change. Our results might provide some scientific basis for the comprehensive basin management.

TI  - Requirement of minimal signal-to-noise ratios of ocean color sensors and uncertainties of ocean color products
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using simulations, error propagation theory, and measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), we determined the minimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required for ocean color measurements and product uncertainties at different spatial and temporal scales. First, based on typical top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance over the ocean, we evaluate the uncertainties in satellite-derived R-rs in the visible wavelengths (Delta R-rs(vis)) due to sensor noise in both the near-infrared (NIR) and the visible bands. While the former induces noise in R-rs(vis) through atmospheric correction, the latter has a direct impact on R-rs(vis). Such estimated uncertainties are compared with inherent Delta R-rs(vis) uncertainties from in situ measurements and from the operational atmosphere correction algorithm. The comparison leads to a conclusion that once SNR(NIR) is above 600: 1, an SNR(vis) better than 400: 1 will not make a significant reduction in product uncertainties at pixel level under typical conditions for a solar zenith angle of 458. Then, such uncertainties are found to decrease significantly in data products of oceanic waters when the 1 km pixels from individual images are binned to lower spatial resolution (e.g., 4 km) or temporal resolution (e.g., monthly). Although these findings do not suggest that passive ocean color sensors should have SNR(vis) around 400: 1, they do support the argument for more trade space in higher spatial and/or spectral resolutions once this minimal 400: 1 SNR(vis) requirement is met.

TI  - Burn severity mapping from Landsat MESMA fraction images and Land Surface Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are incidents of great importance in Mediterranean environments. Landsat data have proven to be suitable for evaluating post-fire vegetation damage and determining different levels of burn severity, which is crucial for planning post-fire rehabilitation. This study assessed the utility of combined Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) fraction images and Land Surface Temperature (LST) to accurately map burn severity. We studied a large convection-dominated wildfire, which occurred on 19-21 September 2012 in Spain, in a zone dominated by Pinus pinaster Ait. Burn severity degree (low, moderate, and high) was measured 2-3 months after fire in 111 field plots using the Composite Burn Index (CBI). Four fraction images were generated using MESMA from the reflective bands of a post-fire Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) image: 1.-char, 2.-green vegetation (GV), 3.-non-photosynthetic vegetation and soil (NPVS) and 4.-shade. The thermal band was converted to LST using a single channel algorithm. Next, Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) was used to obtain the probability of each burn severity level from MESMA fraction images and LST. Finally, a burn severity map was generated from the probability images and independently validated using an error matrix, producer and user accuracies per class, and kappa statistic. MLR identified the char fraction image and LST as the only significant explanatory variables when burn severity acted as the response variable. Two burn severity degrees (low-moderate and high) were finally considered to build the final burn severity map. In this way, we reached a higher accuracy (kappa = 0.79) than using the original three burn severity levels (kappa = 0.66). Our study demonstrates the validity of combining fraction images and LST from Landsat data to map burn severity accurately in Mediterranean countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Investigating the Potential Role of North American Animals as Hosts for Zika Virus
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - The recent emergence of the mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas has become a global public health concern. We describe a series of experimental infections designed to investigate whether animals within certain taxonomic groups in North America have the potential to serve as ZIKV amplifying or maintenance hosts. Species investigated included armadillos, cottontail rabbits, goats, mink, chickens, pigeons, ground hogs, deer mice, cattle, raccoons, ducks, Syrian Golden hamsters, garter snakes, leopard frogs, house sparrows, and pigs. Infectious virus was isolated from blood only in frogs and armadillos; however, the magnitude of viremia was low. In addition, neutralizing antibodies were detected after infection in goats, rabbits, ducks, frogs, and pigs. This study indicates that the animals tested to date are unlikely to act as animal reservoirs for ZIKV, but that rabbits and pigs could potentially serve as sentinel species. Understanding the transmission cycle and maintenance of ZIKV in animals will help in developing effective surveillance programs and preventative measures for future outbreaks.

TI  - The Role of Surgery for Melanoma in an Era of Effective Systemic Therapy
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review The recent discovery of effective systemic treatments for melanoma has dramatically improved the prognosis for patients with advanced disease. As a result, the multidisciplinary management of melanoma has evolved significantly. In the past decades surgery was reserved for symptomatic palliation in patients with metastatic melanoma. Today surgical treatment of patients responding to systemic therapies has become an integral part of disease control.Recent Findings Current efforts are focused on minimizing the morbidity of surgery (laparoscopic inguinal lymph node dissection, selective completion lymphadenectomy) as well as combining surgery with systemic therapy in novel ways (neoadjuvant targeted and/or immunotherapy, isolated limb infusion/perfusion with systemic immunotherapy).Summary This review examines the use of surgery for advanced melanoma in the era predating modern systemic therapy as well as potential applications moving forward.

TI  - A chemical perspective of day and night tropical (10°N-15°N) mesospheric inversion layers
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The various occurrence characteristics of day and night tropical (10 degrees N-15 degrees N, 60 degrees E-90 degrees E) mesospheric inversion layers (MILs) are studied by using TIMED Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry satellite data products of kinetic temperature; volume mixing ratios of O, H, and O-3; volume emission rates of O-2 ((1)) and OH (1.6 mu m channel), and chemical heating rates due to seven dominant exothermic reactions among H, O, O-2, O-3, OH, HO2, and CO2 cooling rates for the year 2011. Although both dynamics and chemistry play important roles, the present study mainly focuses on the chemical processes involved in the formation of day and night MILs. It is found that the upper level height of daytime (nighttime) MIL descends (ascends) from similar to 88km (similar to 80km) in winter to similar to 72km (similar to 90km) in summer. The day and night inversion amplitudes are correlated with total chemical heating rates and CO2 cooling rates, and they show semi annual variation with larger (smaller) values during equinoxes (solstices). The daytime (nighttime) inversion layers are predominantly due to the exothermic reaction, R-5: O+O+MO2+M and R-6: O+O-2+MO3+M (R-3: H+O3OH+O-2). In addition, the CO2 causes large cooling at the top and small heating at the bottom levels of both day and night MILs. In the absence of dynamical effects, the chemical heating and CO2 cooling jointly contribute for the occurrence of day and night MILs.

AB  - The municipality of Almaden, Ciudad Real, Spain, declared a World Heritage site on June, 2012, is a good example of mutual relationship of sustainability between the eco-design of its urban pattern and its historical and industrial heritage, giving rise to a very peculiar landscape evolution. This, linked to its cultural richness, has resulted in a strong tourist attraction. In this study, 30 Landsat satellite images from the US. Geological Services were analyzed for a period of 25 years (1991-2015). Each was examined and classified in a certain period of time in order to characterize the landscape integration of the different heritage assets both spatially and temporally. Results show how the environmental sustainability of the city allows recognizing and evaluating the different changes in land use in relation to the time at which restoration work was carried out in study area, before (1991-2005), during (2006-2008) and after (2009-2015) it, and its intrinsic relationship with mercury mining and eco-sustainable development of Almaden. The sustainability of Almaden is directly related to both the low levels of precipitation and relative humidity.

T2  - Water Conservation Science and Engineering
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, Soil Conservation Service -Curve Number (SCS-CN) method, Earth Observation (EO) data sets and Geographic Information System (GIS) have been used in order to estimate the surface runoff from Jhagrabaria an agricultural watershed of Allahabad district, Uttar Pradesh (India). LANDSAT-7ETM+, NOAA data and hydrologic soil groups have been used to prepare land use/land cover, rainfall and soil map. The traditional SCS-CN method for calculating the composite CN is very tedious and time demanding process of the hydrologic modeling. Therefore, GIS is now being used in combination with the SCS-CN method. The outcome of work showed 79.35 (CNII) of normal condition, of dry condition 61.76 (CNI) and of wet condition 89.84 (CNIII), respectively. This investigation outline that ungauged watershed exhibits an annual average of 14 years runoff volume as 3.58 x 10(6) m(3) from an average annual rainfall of 14 years 110.77 cm and the average annual surface runoff of 14 years was 23.83 cm and annual average runoff coefficient of 14 years was 0.22. The correlation analysis suggests that the strong correlation as R-2 (0.91) was observed between satellite drive rainfall and runoff from SCS-CN method. The developed rainfall-runoff model for the region will be useful to understand the watershed and its runoff flow characteristics.

TI  - Contemporary patterns of fire extent and severity in forests of the Pacific Northwest, USA (1985-2010)
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is an important disturbance in many forest landscapes, but there is heightened concern regarding recent wildfire activity in western North America. Several regional-scale studies focus on high-severity fire, but a comprehensive examination at all levels of bum severity (i.e., low, moderate, and high) is needed to inform our understanding of the ecological effects of contemporary fires and how they vary among vegetation zones at sub-regional scales. We integrate Landsat time series data with field measurements of tree mortality to map burn severity in forests of the Pacific Northwest, USA, from 1985 to 2010. We then examine temporal trends in fire extent and spatial patterns of burn severity in relation to drought and annual fire extent. Finally, we compare results among vegetation zones and with expectations based on studies of historical landscape dynamics and fire regimes. Small increases in fire extent over time were associated with drought in all vegetation zones, but fire cumulatively affected <3% of wet vegetation zones, and most dry vegetation zones experienced less fire than expectations from fire history studies. Although the proportion of fire at any level of severity did not increase over time, temporal trends toward larger patches of high-severity fire were related to drought and annual fire extent, depending on vegetation zone. In vegetation zones with historically high-severity regimes, high-severity fire accounted for a large proportion of recent fire extent (43-48%) and occurred primarily in patches >= 100 ha. In vegetation zones with historically low- and mixed-severity regimes, low (45-54%)- and moderate-severity (24-36%) fires were prevalent, but proportions of high-severity fire (23-26%), almost half of which occurred in patches >= 100 ha, were much greater than expectations from most fire history studies. Our results support concerns about large patches of high-severity fire in some dry forests but also suggest that spatial patterns of bum severity across much of the extent burned are generally consistent with current understanding of historical landscape dynamics in the region. This study highlights the importance of considering the ecological effects of fire at all levels of severity in management and policy initiatives intended to promote forest biodiversity and resilience to future fire activity.

TI  - Barren-ground caribou <i>(Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus</i>) behaviour after recent fire events; integrating caribou telemetry data with Landsat fire detection techniques
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire regimes are changing throughout the North American boreal forest in complex ways. Fire is also a major factor governing access to high-quality forage such as terricholous lichens for barren-ground caribou ( Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus). Additionally, fire alters forest structure which can affect barren-ground caribou's ability to navigate in a landscape. Here, we characterize how the size and severity of fires are changing across five barren-ground caribou herd ranges in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada. Additionally, we demonstrate how time since fire, fire severity, and season result in complex changes in caribou behavioural metrics estimated using telemetry data. Fire disturbances were identified using novel gap-free Landsat surface reflectance composites from 1985 to 2011 across all herd ranges. Burn severity was estimated using the differenced normalized burn ratio. Annual area burned and burn severity were assessed through time for each herd and related to two behavioural metrics: velocity and relative turning angle. Neither annual area burned nor burn severity displayed any temporal trend within the study period. However, certain herds, such as the Ahiak/Beverly, have more exposure to fire than other herds (i.e. Cape Bathurst had a maximum forested area burned of less than 4 km 2). Time since fire and burn severity both significantly affected velocity and relative turning angles. During fall, winter, and spring, fire virtually eliminated foraging-focused behaviour for all 26 years of analysis while more severe fires resulted in a marked increase in movement-focused behaviour compared to unburnt patches. Between seasons, caribou used burned areas as early as 1-year postfire, demonstrating complex, nonlinear reactions to time since fire, fire severity, and season. In all cases, increases in movement-focused behaviour were detected postfire. We conclude that changes in caribou behaviour immediately postfire are primarily driven by changes in forest structure rather than changes in terricholous lichen availability.

TI  - Stomatal response to humidity and CO<sub>2</sub> implicated in recent decline in US evaporation
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration, defined as the total flux of water from the land surface to the atmosphere, is a major component of the hydrologic cycle and surface energy balance. Although evapotranspiration is expected to intensify with increasing temperatures, long-term, regional trends in evapotranspiration remain uncertain due to spatially and temporally limited direct measurements. In this study, we utilize an emergent relation between the land surface and atmospheric boundary layer to infer daily evapotranspiration from historical meteorological data collected at 236 weather stations across the United States. Our results suggest a statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) decrease in evapotranspiration of approximately 6% from 1961 to 2014, with a significant (alpha = 0.05) sharp decline of 13% from 1998 to 2014. We attribute the decrease in evapotranspiration mostly to declines in surface conductance, but also to offsetting changes in longwave radiation, wind speed, and incoming solar radiation. Using an established stomatal conductance model, we explain the changes in inferred surface conductance as a response to increases in carbon dioxide and, more recently, to an abrupt decrease in atmospheric humidity.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of the atmospheric and surface urban heat islands of the Metropolitan Area of Toluca, Mexico
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic of consolidation of urban areas in Latin America has allowed that almost 80% of the population concentrates in cities; this has produced changes in land covers and modified regional climate, propitiating the appearance of urban heat islands. The Metropolitan Area of Toluca, State of Mexico, Mexico, holds the fifth national place in population size and experiences this process, because of this, the objective is to analyze and compare the spatiotemporal characteristics of the atmospheric urban heat island obtained from data gathered from 12 urban and rural weather stations with the surface urban heat island obtained from the digital processing of four Landsat 8 images. Results show the year-round presence of night-time atmospheric urban heat islands, which reach a peak in autumn (up to 6 degrees C). Daytime atmospheric urban heat islands occur in summer and autumn with a maximum intensity of 4 degrees C. For their part, surface urban heat islands occur in spring, summer and autumn and reach maximums of 19 degrees C in intensity. A strong correlation was found between wetness and surface temperature (coefficient of determination, 0.8) in spring and winter. Soil wetness directly impacts the formation of weak urban heat islands in dry season, and intense ones in wet season, while the green areas and the winds affect the spatial distribution of the same.

TI  - Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Epidemiology and Portuguese patients profile
T2  - REVISTA PORTUGUESA DE PNEUMOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent episodes of apnea and hypopnea, secondary to collapse of the upper airways during sleep. OSA is frequently associated to cardiovascular complications. In Portugal, its magnitude is unknown.Methods: In 2014 a cross-sectional study was performed using the Portuguese General Practitioner (GP) Sentinel Network (Rede Medicos Sentinela). Participants GP reported all OSA cases diagnosed and registered in their lists of users on the 31 December 2013.Frequency of OSA has been estimated by sex and age. OSA patients were also characterized by method of diagnosis, treatment, and underlying conditions.Association between risk factors and severe OSA (odds ratio) was calculated using a logistic regression model adjusting confounding.Results: Prevalence of OSA on the population aged 25 years or more was 0.89% (95 CI: 0.80-1.00%); it was higher in males 1.47% (95 CI: 1.30-1.67%) and in those aged between 65 and 74 (2.35%). Most had severe OSA (48.4%). Hypertension (75.9%), obesity (74.2%) and diabetes mellitus (34.1%) were the most frequent comorbidities. Being a male (OR: 2.6; 95 CI: 1.2-5.8) and having obesity (OR: 4.0; 95 CI: 1.8-8.6) were associated with an increased risk of severe OSA.Conclusion: Found frequency of OSA was lower than other countries estimates, which may be explained by differences on case definition but can also suggest underdiagnosis of this condition as reported by other authors.

TI  - Evaluation of Nautical Chart Adequacy in the Coastal Area around Incheon Bay using Satellite Imagery with AIS Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd International Water Safety Symposium (IWSS)
CL  - Incheon, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - The Nautical Chart (NC) is an essential tool for marine navigation that depicts the configuration of the shoreline and seafloor, such as bathymetry, locations of dangers to navigation, locations and characteristics of aids for navigation, anchorages, and other features. These features could be continuously changed according to the nature of a waterway and human activities. Hence, using the old or uncorrected NC for navigation is strongly prohibited. Moreover, the adequacy of NC is a must for the safety of the seaway before navigation. The general manner of ensuring the adequacy of NC is to access the change in bathymetry along with the vessel traffic information in seaway. The recent bathymetry update is commonly done by using hydrographic surveying techniques, such as Multi-Beam Echo Sounder (MBES) and Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry (ALB). These techniques provide both highly accurate and a dense coverage of depth measurements. However, high cost and logistic challenges are required. This study applied the satellite-derived bathymetry from Landsat imagery with Auto Identification System (AIS) data as vessel traffic information to evaluate the adequacy and completeness of NC information in the coastal area around Incheon Bay, Korea. Based on satellite data, submarine topography was derived and found to be very highly correlated up to 10m depth. The procedure can easily identify the changes of bathymetric information in NC and could be an effective and economic way of ensuring the NC adequacy without MBES or ALB surveying in the coastal area of Korea.

TI  - Assessing trace elements in striped dolphins from the Strait of Gibraltar: Clues to link the bioaccumulation in the westernmost Mediterranean Sea area and nearest Atlantic Ocean
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dolphins are considered sentinel species in the marine environment. The Strait of Gibraltar is the only passage between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, being the transitional region which connects these two basins and one of the most important routes of cetacean migration worldwide. In this work, eight trace elements (TE) were studied in 45 samples of liver, kidney and muscle, from 15 specimens stranded in this study area. The preliminary results show, among others, the patterns of distribution of the TE in the target organs studied, the influence of sex, length and developmental stage in these 'FE concentrations and the Se/Hg ratio. Subsequently, the results of TE concentrations in liver have being compared to previous data on S. coeruleoalba from the westernmost Mediterranean Sea and the nearest Atlantic Ocean. For some elements (e.g. for As), concentrations are similar to those obtained from Atlantic samples, despite in other cases (e.g. for Cd) results are lined up with those observed in Mediterranean studies. In addition, in the case of some TE (e.g. Se and Zn) the results are in the middle of those reported for both basins, reinforcing the idea of the Strait of Gibraltar being a transitional zone. Present study is the first research regarding this issue in this outstanding region, aiming to give insights of how this matchless area can help to link 'FE concentrations observed in these Atlantic and Mediterranean threatened species.

TI  - A comparison of sentinel lymph node biopsy to lymphadenectomy for endometrial cancer staging (FIRES trial): a multicentre, prospective, cohort study
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel-lymph-node mapping has been advocated as an alternative staging technique for endometrial cancer. The aim of this study was to measure the sensitivity and negative predictive value of sentinel-lymph-node mapping compared with the gold standard of complete lymphadenectomy in detecting metastatic disease for endometrial cancer.Methods In the FIRES multicentre, prospective, cohort study patients with clinical stage 1 endometrial cancer of all histologies and grades undergoing robotic staging were eligible for study inclusion. Patients received a standardised cervical injection of indocyanine green and sentinel-lymph-node mapping followed by pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy. 18 surgeons from ten centres (tertiary academic and community non-academic) in the USA participated in the trial. Negative sentinel lymph nodes (by haematoxylin and eosin staining on sections) were ultra-staged with immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin. The primary endpoint, sensitivity of the sentinel-lymph-node-based detection of metastatic disease, was defined as the proportion of patients with node-positive disease with successful sentinel-lymph-node mapping who had metastatic disease correctly identified in the sentinel lymph node. Patients who had mapping of at least one sentinel lymph node were included in the primary analysis (per protocol). All patients who received study intervention (injection of dye), regardless of mapping result, were included as part of the assessment of mapping and in the safety analysis in an intention-to-treat manner. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01673022 and is completed and closed.Findings Between Aug 1, 2012, and Oct 20, 2015, 385 patients were enrolled. Sentinel-lymph-node mapping with complete pelvic lymphadenectomy was done in 340 patients and para-aortic lymphadenectomy was done in 196 (58%) of these patients. 293 (86%) patients had successful mapping of at least one sentinel lymph node. 41 (12%) patients had positive nodes, 36 of whom had at least one mapped sentinel lymph node. Nodal metastases were identified in the sentinel lymph nodes of 35 (97%) of these 36 patients, yielding a sensitivity to detect node-positive disease of 97.2% (95% CI 85.0-100), and a negative predictive value of 99.6% (97.9-100). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events or serious adverse events were postoperative neurological disorders (4 patients) and postoperative respiratory distress or failure (4 patients). 22 patients had serious adverse events, with one related to the study intervention: a ureteral injury incurred during sentinel-lymph-node dissection.Interpretation Sentinel lymph nodes identified with indocyanine green have a high degree of diagnostic accuracy in detecting endometrial cancer metastases and can safely replace lymphadenectomy in the staging of endometrial cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy will not identify metastases in 3% of patients with node-positive disease, but has the potential to expose fewer patients to the morbidity of a complete lymphadenectomy.
