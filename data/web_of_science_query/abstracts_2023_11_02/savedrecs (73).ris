TI  - Convolutional Neural Network with Expert Knowledge for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery Classification
T2  - KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning has partly contributed to an interest in the use of such approaches for hyperspectral remote sensing (HRS) imagery classification, as evidenced by the increasing number of deep framework with deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) structures proposed in the literature. In these approaches, the assumption of obtaining high quality deep features by using CNN is not always easy and efficient because of the complex data distribution and the limited sample size. In this paper, conventional handcrafted learning-based multi features based on expert knowledge are introduced as the input of a special designed CNN to improve the pixel description and classification performance of HRS imagery. The introduction of these handcrafted features can reduce the complexity of the original HRS data and reduce the sample requirements by eliminating redundant information and improving the starting point of deep feature training It also provides some concise and effective features that are not readily available from direct training with CNN. Evaluations using three public HRS datasets demonstrate the utility of our proposed method in HRS classification.

TI  - Modeling risk of mangroves to tropical cyclones: A case study of Hurricane Irma
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are productive ecosystems but are vulnerable to tropical cyclones. In this study, we quantified the damage of mangroves from Hurricane Irma at a large-scale using Landsat data, and modeled the risk of mangroves to hurricanes using three internal/physical metrics (a vegetation index, canopy height, and distance to open ocean) and two external/hurricane-related metrics (hurricane track and storm surge inundation). Four machine learning techniques including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) were examined and compared with the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method to identify the best risk model for damage projection from future hurricanes. The models were calibrated and validated using data before and after Hurricane Irma. Machine learning algorithms had a better performance than the linear model, and RF achieved the best result with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.84 in predicting mangrove damages. The model also produced an encouraging result to hindcast mangrove damages from Hurricane Wilma. We applied object-based modeling and mapping techniques and produced mangrove damage maps from Irma and a worst-case scenario hurricane with an intensity of Category 5 and a track along the mangrove distribution. A total of 332 km(2) of mangroves were severely damaged from Irma, and 635 km(2) would be devastated from the modeled scenario. The techniques developed here can be used for other mangrove forests exposed to tropical cyclones.

TI  - Government Engagement with Commercial Remote Sensing Companies: A Framework for Evaluating Public Data Buys
T2  - NEW SPACE-THE JOURNAL OF SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As the commercial remote sensing industry continues to grow, government agencies are looking for opportunities to take advantage of the new and relatively inexpensive data provided by these entities through the development of public-private partnerships and data purchases. However, these arrangements typically require that governments accept some limitations on data sharing, contrasting with the existing norm of free and open access to government satellite data. Data access agreements can be complex, and their exact terms and conditions can significantly affect the overall benefits of the arrangement to the government and society more broadly. This article presents a framework for defining and evaluating these data access agreements, and demonstrates how the framework could be applied using case studies of previous public-private partnerships and data purchases.

TI  - Groundwater Storage Trends and Their Link to Farmer Suicides in Maharashtra State, India
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Threats posed by land degradation and desertification continue to destabilize India's agriculture productivity and food security. The enduring negative environmental consequences of the agricultural intensification that started during the 1960s have further contributed to the depletion of soil nutrients in farmlands through heavy input of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. More than half of India's population depends on farming. When crop productivity fails, the economically-depressed farmers are unfortunately pushed toward suicide. The news of farmers committing mass suicide in Maharashtra state of India has lately received world attention. Although suicide may involve various psychological, social and economic factors, access to irrigation water remains a contentious matter in the agriculture business. The groundwater (GW) data from government sources are limited and not displayed in the public domain for verification. Hence, this study used the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data to compare farmer suicide rate in Maharashtra with GW storage estimates at broad spatiotemporal scales. The results show significant correlations (r = -0.85, p < 0.005) between water storage and suicide rate when time lags of 2 years are introduced between them. Based on the new findings, this study recommends that the GW status needs to be monitored scientifically across India's suicide zone. By doing so, the worst case scenarios can be logically predicted well in advance. The government then may have the advantage to mobilize its resources on the ground to implement rapid emergency measures and farmer consultations to minimize future farmer suicide cases.

TI  - Validation, comparison, and integration of GOCI, AHI, MODIS, MISR, and VIIRS aerosol optical depth over East Asia during the 2016 KORUS-AQ campaign
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently launched multichannel geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellite sensors, such as the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) and the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), provide aerosol products over East Asia with high accuracy, which enables the monitoring of rapid diurnal variations and the transboundary transport of aerosols. Most aerosol studies to date have used low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite sensors, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), with a maximum of one or two overpass daylight times per day from midlatitudes to low latitudes. Thus, the demand for new GEO observations with high temporal resolution and improved accuracy has been significant. In this study the latest versions of aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from three LEO sensors - MODIS (Dark Target, Deep Blue, and MAIAC), MISR, and the Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), along with two GEO sensors (GOCI and AHI), are validated, compared, and integrated for a period during the Korea-United States Air Quality Study (KORUS-AQ) field campaign from 1 May to 12 June 2016 over East Asia. The AOD products analyzed here generally have high accuracy with high R (0.84-0.93) and low RMSE (0.12-0.17), but their error characteristics differ according to the use of several different surface-reflectance estimation methods. High-accuracy near-real-time GOCI and AHI measurements facilitate the detection of rapid AOD changes, such as smoke aerosol transport from Russia to Japan on 18-21 May 2016, heavy pollution transport from China to the Korean Peninsula on 25 May 2016, and local emission transport from the Seoul Metropolitan Area to the Yellow Sea in South Korea on 5 June 2016. These high-temporal-resolution GEO measurements result in more representative daily AOD values and make a greater contribution to a combined daily AOD product assembled by median value selection with a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees grid resolution. The combined AOD is spatially continuous and has a greater number of pixels with high accuracy (fraction within expected error range of 0.61) than individual products. This study characterizes aerosol measurements from LEO and GEO satellites currently in operation over East Asia, and the results presented here can be used to evaluate satellite measurement bias and air quality models.

TI  - Ultrasound-guided dual-localization for axillary nodes before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with clip and activated charcoal in breast cancer patients: a feasibility study
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We report on our experience of ultrasound (US)-guided dual-localization for axillary nodes before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with clip and activated charcoal to guide axillary surgery in breast cancer patients. Methods Between November 2017 and May 2018, a dual-localization procedure was performed under US guidance for the most suspicious axillary nodes noted at initial staging (before NAC, with clip) and restaging (after NAC, with activated charcoal) in 28 cytologically proven node-positive breast cancer patients. Patients underwent axillary sampling or dissection, which involved removing not only the sentinel nodes (SNs), but also clipped nodes (CNs) and tattooed nodes (TNs). Success (or failure) rates of biopsies of SNs, CNs, and TNs and inter-nodal concordance rates were determined. Sensitivities for the individual and combined biopsies were calculated. Results SN biopsy failed in four patients (14%), whereas the CN biopsy failed in one patient (4%). All TNs were identified in the surgical field. Concordance rates were 79% for CNs-TNs, 63% for CNs-SNs, and 58% for TNs-SNs. Sensitivity for SN, CN, and TN biopsy was 73%, 67%, and 67%, respectively. Sensitivity was 80% for any combination of biopsies (SN plus CN, SN plus TN, SN plus CN plus TN). Conclusions US-guided dual-localization of axillary nodes before and after NAC with clip and activated charcoal was a feasible approach that might facilitate more reliable nodal staging with less-invasive strategies in node-positive breast cancer patients.

TI  - Fractional vegetation coverage response to climatic factors based on grey relational analysis during the 2000-2017 growing season in Sichuan Province, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sichuan Province, China, is a typical ecologically fragile area that is sensitive to global climate change. Studies regarding the spatial-temporal variations and driving factors of FVC (Fractional Vegetation Coverage) in Sichuan Province's vegetation ecosystem are of important theoretical and practical significance for revealing the relationship between global climate change and vegetation ecosystems. These studies are also important theoretical and practical significance for the evaluation of environmental quality and service function adjustment of terrestrial ecosystems. In existing studies, there is a lack of detailed depictions of the FVC response to climatic factors in the context of different vegetation types and different landform features in Sichuan Province. In this study, the spatial-temporal patterns and change trends for the FVC of the growing seasons during the 2000-2017 period for Sichuan Province were analysed based on the FVCs that were inversely determined from MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) remote sensing data, and they were combined with air temperature, relative humidity and precipitation data. Moreover, the GRA (Grey Relational Analysis) method was used to study the response of the FVC to climate changes. Based on the results of the GRA, the zoning of climatic factors as driving forces for the FVC was performed, and the differences in the spatial-temporal characteristics of the FVC response to different climatic factors were presented in quantitative form. Here, we found that the vegetation coverage in Sichuan province showed a slight degradation trend, and that the medium to low altitude woody plants were significantly degraded. The proportion of regions in which relative humidity (17.3%) and precipitation (17.4) were strong drivers for FVC changes, was much greater than the regions in which air temperature (1.8%) and other co-drivers were the force.

TI  - Dietary administration of <i>Bacillus</i> and yeast probiotics improves the growth, survival, and microbial community of juvenile whiteleg shrimp, <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several microorganisms, including Bacillus and yeasts species, are widely used as aquaculture probiotics. In the present study, a mixed Bacillus sp. contained five species of B. thuringiensis BUU 001, B. megaterium BUU 002, B. polymyxa BUU 003, B. licheniformis BUU 004, and B. subtilis BUU 005, and a mixed yeast probiotics contained Debaryomyces hansenii BUU 01 and Rhodotorula sp. BUU 02. The effects of mixed microbial probiotics as a dietary supplement on growth, survival, and microbiological changes of juvenile whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) were investigated. Shrimp (similar to 5.7-5.8 g) were fed a commercial diet alone (control) or with one of three probiotic supplements-freeze-dried mixture of Bacillus (FB), freeze-dried mixture of Bacillus and yeast (FBY), and freeze-dried mixture of yeast (FY)-for 90 days in simulated earthen ponds. Growth of FB-fed shrimp was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those fed with FBY, FY, and control diets. However, survival was not significantly different (P > 0.05) among the three treated groups but was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the control. Numbers of culturable heterotrophic bacteria in intestine were not significantly different (P > 0.05) among the four groups. Bacillus numbers in FB- and FBY-fed shrimp increased significantly (P < 0.05) in intestine. Yeast numbers in intestine of FBY- and FY-treated shrimp were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of FB-treated and control shrimp and increased significantly (P < 0.05) during the rearing period, while no yeast was observed in FB-treated and control shrimp. Numbers of Vibrio in intestine were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the three treated groups than the control. Administration of mixed Bacillus, mixed yeasts, or Bacillus mixture in combination with mixed yeasts resulted in improved (P < 0.05) growth and survival and reduced Vibrio numbers along with an increase in beneficial probiotic abundance and a decrease in the number of potential pathogenic bacteria (V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae) in digestive tract of juvenile L. vannamei.

TI  - Approaching the religious psychiatric patient in a secular country: Does "subalternalizing" religious patients mean they do not exist?
T2  - ARCHIVE FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION-ARCHIV FUR RELIGIONSPSYCHOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the findings of an empirical research project on how psychiatrists in a secular country (Denmark) approach the religious patients, and how the individual worldview of the psychiatrist influences this approach. The study is based on 22 interviews with certified psychiatrists or physicians in psychiatric residency. The article presents the theoretical and methodical grounding and introduces the analytical construct "subalternalizing," derived from subaltern studies. "Subalternalizing" designates a process where a trait in one worldview (patient) is marginalized as a consequence of another worldview's (psychiatrist) "disinterest." The analysis located four categories: (a) religion as a negative part of the patient story, (b) religion as a positive part of the patient story, (c) religion in relation to radicalization, and (d) there are no religious patients. The discussion shows that the approach is influenced by the psychiatrist worldview. Examples of "subalternalizing" are given and how this excludes "positive religious coping" and "existential and spiritual care" from treatment.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use (LU) or land cover (LC) is a critical factor dictating the amount of available water in runoff and groundwater. LU/LC Land use (LU) or land cover (LC) is a critical factor which can determine amount of available water in runoff and groundwater. In this study future effect of LU/LC change on stream flow in Nekarood watershed is investigated by Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Land use maps (1986-2016) based on Landsat TM and ETM+ satellite imagery are used. Furthermore, land use projection is performed by CA-Markov for the future period of 2016-2030. According to the results, agriculture and residential land use are increased by 40%, 28%, 38% and 31% respectively, and forest area is reduced by 12% and 6% during 1986-2001 and 2001-2016, respectively. Moreover, land use projection results showed that from 2016 to 2030 forest area will decrease by 6%, residential areas and agricultural will increase by 34% and 19%, respectively.

TI  - Wind Intensity Is Key to Phytoplankton Spring Bloom Under Climate Change
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The onset of the spring bloom (OSB) occurs when phytoplankton growth exceeds losses and is promoted by a transition from deep convection to a shallow mixing layer concurrent with increasing light intensities in nutrient-enriched waters. We have combined remotely sensed chlorophyll-a data and high-resolution sea-surface winds to quantify and understand high-latitude spring-bloom dynamics and the effect of varying winds. Increasing winds strengthen turbulent mixing and may eventually cause the mixing depth to extend beyond the depth at which light is favorable for net growth and delay the OSB. We find that wind intensity accounts for up to 60% of the interannual variation in the OSB as revealed by remotely sensed chlorophyll-a values at the key spawning ground (62-63 degrees N) of one of the worlds' largest herring stocks. The OSB is, on average, 1 month later and with about half the variability farther north at the main spawning ground (67-68 degrees N) of one of the world's largest cod stocks. Since the atmospheric reanalysis considered here extends wind time series much further back in time (1958) than remote sensing (1998), the former may act as a good proxy for investigating OSB trends on the time scales of multi-decadal variability and climate change. We find a weak but non-significant signal of delay in the OSB across these extended time periods. More importantly, our results clearly show that predictions of future productivity and ecosystem dynamics under global warming based on earth system models require accurate representation of winds.

TI  - Towards Precision Medicine With Human iPSCs for Cardiac Channelopathies
T2  - CIRCULATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-QT syndrome, a frequently fatal inherited arrhythmia syndrome caused by genetic variants (congenital) or drugs (acquired), affects 1 in 2000 people worldwide. Its sentinel event is often sudden cardiac death, which makes preclinical diagnosis by genetic testing potentially life-saving. Unfortunately, clinical experience with genetic testing has shown that it is difficult to correctly identify genetic variants as disease causing. These current deficiencies in accurately assigning pathogenicity led to the discovery of increasing numbers of rare variants classified as variant of uncertain significance. To overcome these challenges, new technologies such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) genome editing can be combined with human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to provide a new approach to decipher pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance and to better predict arrhythmia risk. To that end, the overarching goal of our network is to establish the utility of induced pluripotent stem cell-based platforms to solve major clinical problems associated with long-QT syndrome by determining how to (1) differentiate pathogenic mutations from background genetic noise, (2) assess existing and novel variants associated with congenital and acquired long-QT syndrome, and (3) provide genotype- and phenotype- guided risk stratification and pharmacological management of long-QT syndrome. To achieve these goals and to further advance the use of induced pluripotent stem cells in disease modeling and drug discovery, our team of investigators for this Leducq Foundation Transatlantic Networks of Excellence proposal will work together to (1) improve differentiation efficiency, cellular maturation, and lineage specificity, (2) develop new assays for high throughput cellular phenotyping, and (3) train young investigators to clinically implement patient-specific genetic modeling.

TI  - Using historical fisheries data to predict tuna distribution within the British Indian Ocean Territory Marine Protected Area, and implications for its management
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, several large marine protected areas (MPAs) have been established globally, and it is hoped that they will aid the recovery of populations of highly mobile, large pelagic species. Understanding the distribution of these species within MPAs is key to delivering effective management, but monitoring can be challenging over such vast areas of open ocean. Historical fisheries data, collected prior to MPA establishment, can provide an insight into the past distributions of target species. We investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) tuna catch using logbook data from the purse seine fishery in the British Indian Ocean Territory from 1996 to 2010, before it was established as an MPA in April 2010. Generalized additive models were used to predict tuna presence and relative abundance from fishing records in relation to temporal and environmental variables. Significant variables included sea salinity, temperature, and water velocity. Predictions from the models identified a distinct hotspot for large yellowfin tuna within the MPA, and areas of high predicted relative abundance of skipjack tuna. We recommend that these areas are used as focal points from which populations can be monitored and investigations into tuna residency time can occur, so that the effectiveness of the MPA in conserving highly mobile pelagic fish can be determined.

TI  - Satellite Ocean Colour: Current Status and Future Perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Spectrally resolved water-leaving radiances (ocean colour) and inferred chlorophyll concentration are key to studying phytoplankton dynamics at seasonal and interannual scales, for a better understanding of the role of phytoplankton in marine biogeochemistry; the global carbon cycle; and the response of marine ecosystems to climate variability, change and feedback processes. Ocean colour data also have a critical role in operational observation systems monitoring coastal eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and sediment plumes. The contiguous ocean-colour record reached 21 years in 2018; however, it is comprised of a number of one-off missions such that creating a consistent time-series of ocean-colour data requires merging of the individual sensors (including MERIS, Aqua-MODIS, SeaWiFS, VIIRS, and OLCI) with differing sensor characteristics, without introducing artefacts. By contrast, the next decade will see consistent observations from operational ocean colour series with sensors of similar design and with a replacement strategy. Also, by 2029 the record will start to be of sufficient duration to discriminate climate change impacts from natural variability, at least in some regions. This paper describes the current status and future prospects in the field of ocean colour focusing on large to medium resolution observations of oceans and coastal seas. It reviews the user requirements in terms of products and uncertainty characteristics and then describes features of current and future satellite ocean-colour sensors, both operational and innovative. The key role of in situ validation and calibration is highlighted as are ground segments that process the data received from the ocean-colour sensors and deliver analysis-ready products to end-users. Example applications of the ocean-colour data are presented, focusing on the climate data record and operational applications including water quality and assimilation into numerical models. Current capacity building and training activities pertinent to ocean colour are described and finally a summary of future perspectives is provided.

TI  - Integration of soil moisture as an auxiliary parameter for the anchor pixel selection process in SEBAL using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1A images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sensible heat flux component calculation in the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) completely relies upon the anchor pixel locations. The fragmented agriculture regions with diverse crops make the selection process more challenging with less probability to correlate with ground realities. The conventional methods for anchor pixel selection have limitations in capturing the soil moisture variations beneath the canopy as they utilize only the thermal remote sensing images and ancillary datasets like land cover and crop type maps. The current research attempts to reduce the existing gap between the ground realities and simulated results by adding soil moisture as a supplementary parameter. The prospects of semi-empirical Water Cloud Model (WCM) to estimate the soil moisture content was tested in a fragmented agricultural region for different time periods. The concurrent satellite data obtained from Sentinel - 1A and Landsat 8 were utilized to supply the inputs for inversion modelling based on the Levenberg-Marquardt approach. The current research introduced 'virtual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index' concept to refine the WCM and yielded reliable soil moisture output for supplementing the anchor pixel selection process. The robustness of the approach was justified by considering the available energy at anchor pixel locations. The research outcomes revealed that the anchor pixel selection with and without soil moisture criterion has a significant impact on actual evapotranspiration estimation. The research also explores the scope of the synergetic use of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) inputs in SEBAL.

TI  - Monitoring vegetation recovery in the early stages of the Dirk Hartog Island Restoration Programme using high temporal frequency Landsat imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT & RESTORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Dirk Hartog Island is the largest island off the West Australian coast. From the 1860s to 2008, the island was managed as a pastoral lease. In 2009, the island was gazetted as a National Park and the process of removing introduced animals, to allow for the reintroduction of a suite of 12 native mammal species, began. With the removal of high numbers of goats and sheep concerns were raised regarding the proliferation of weed species (which would no longer be controlled through grazing) and the ability of the island's native vegetation to recover. A vegetation monitoring programme was developed which integrated detailed floristic surveys, repeated site photography and Landsat time series data to provide a comprehensive picture of how the island's vegetation cover had changed since destocking. The integration of these elements has allowed present-day observations to be put into context of longer term landscape dynamics. Through statistical analysis of temporal sequences of Landsat satellite imagery, the timing of changes to phenology and cover at monitoring sites was related directly to the management action of stock removal. With the use of field observations, the species responsible for the increase in cover were identified. These data sources, when analysed together, allowed management to have confidence that, following destocking, native vegetation cover is increasing.

TI  - Linking soil water balance with flood spatial arrangement in an extremely flat landscape
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - In areas with very mild relief, water drains in a disordered way due to the lack of a developed drainage network, as it occurs in extremely flat sedimentary regions like the Argentine Pampas. The study analysed the flood spatial arrangements in 2014 by calculating landscape metrics and relating them to soil water balance. The study area is located at Del Azul creek lower basin (Pampa Ecoregion, Argentina). Daily soil water balances were obtained, and seven landscape metrics were calculated in 15 windows in five LandSat images, all along 2014, to explore the relationship between hydrological scenarios and spatial pattern summarized with principal component analysis. Water excess concentrated in winter (June and August); deficits were in late spring and summer (January and November), whereas the beginning of autumn (March) was an intermediate situation. Principal component 1 (44.7%) reflected area and shape metrics and correlated positively with water table level; principal component 2 (32.3%) summarized aggregation ones and was negatively associated with accumulated water excesses or deficits in previous 30 days and useful reserve. Both exhibited possible threshold-driven behaviour. Internal heterogeneity between NW and SE zones within the study area coincided with the existence of ancient alluvial fans. The results highlight the peculiarities of the flood spatial patterns in regions with very mild relief, where landforms usually determine water flows.

TI  - Ultrabright gap-enhanced Raman tags for high-speed bioimaging
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is advantageous over fluorescence for bioimaging due to ultra-narrow linewidth of the fingerprint spectrum and weak photo-bleaching effect. However, the existing SERS imaging speed lags far behind practical needs, mainly limited by Raman signals of SERS nanoprobes. In this work, we report ultrabright gap-enhanced Raman tags (GERTs) with strong electromagnetic hot spots from interior sub-nanometer gaps and external petal-like shell structures, larger immobilization surface area, and Raman cross section of reporter molecules. These GERTs reach a Raman enhancement factor beyond 5 x 10(9) and a detection sensitivity down to a single-nanoparticle level. We use a 370 mu W laser to realize high-resolution cell imaging within 6 s and high-contrast (a signal-to-background ratio of 80) wide-area (3.2 x 2.8 cm(2)) sentinel lymph node imaging within 52 s. These nanoprobes offer a potential solution to overcome the current bottleneck in the field of SERS-based bioimaging.

TI  - Assessment of the LeadCare® Plus for Use on Scandinavian Brown Bears (<i>Ursus arctos</i>)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lead (Pb) exposure is associated with adverse health effects in both humans and wildlife. Blood lead levels (BLL) of sentinel wildlife species can be used to monitor environmental lead exposure and ecosystem health. BLL analyzers, such as the LeadCare (R), are validated for use in humans, assessed for use in some avian species and cattle, and are increasingly being used on wildlife to monitor lead exposure. The LeadCare (R) analyzers use a technique called anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). Species-specific conversion equations have been proposed to approximate the levels found with gold standard measuring methods such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) because the ASV method has been shown to underestimate BLL in some species. In this study we assessed the LeadCare (R) Plus (LCP) for use on Scandinavian brown bears (Ursus arctos). LCP measurements were correlated with ICP-MS with a Bland-Altman analyzed bias of 16.3-22.5%, showing a consistent overestimation of BLL analyzed with LCP. Based on this analysis we provide conversion equations for calculating ICP-MS BLL based on the LCP results in Scandinavian brown bears. Our study shows that the LeadCare (R) Plus can be used for monitoring of lead exposure by approximating gold standard levels using conversion equations. This enables comparison with other gold standard measured BLL within the observed range of this study (38.20-174.00 mu g/L). Our study also found that Scandinavian brown bears are highly exposed to environmental lead.

TI  - Reconciling at-a-Station and at-Many-Stations Hydraulic Geometry Through River-Wide Geomorphology
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - At-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG), while useful for estimating river discharge from satellite data, remains empirical and has yet to be reconciled with the at-a-station hydraulic geometry (AHG) from which it was originally derived. Here we present evidence, using United States Geological Survey field measurements of channel hydraulics for 155 rivers, that AMHG can be hydraulically and geomorphically reconciled with AHG. Our results indicate that AMHG is rightly understood as an expression of a river-wide model of hydraulics driven by changes in slope imposed upon AHG physics. The explanatory power of AHG and this river-wide model combine to determine whether AMHG exists: if both AHG and the river-wide model adequately describe hydraulics, then we show that AMHG is a necessary mathematical consequence of these two phenomena. We also orient these findings in the context of river discharge estimation and other applications.Plain Language Summary Hydraulic geometry (HG) is an empirical phenomenon that predicts river width, depth, and velocity given river discharge and is fundamental to our ability to predict floods, river habitats, and water availability for human and ecosystem use. Recently, a new form of HG was discovered (at-many-stations HG, or AMHG), and it has been successfully deployed in a range of applications and proven to exist in a wide variety of rivers. However, the novel phenomenon of AMHG remains empirical with puzzling and seemingly contradictory links to other, traditional forms of HG, which are well understood and have been studied since the 1950s. AMHG is also not manifested in all rivers, adding to confusion as to its origin. Here, we show for the first time that we can reconcile AMHG with all other traditional variants of HG and gain a complete understanding of how and when AMHG occurs in rivers. This puts the most puzzling aspects of AMHG-why is it observed in some rivers but not others, and what causes the phenomenon-to rest. We have fundamentally changed the conception of AMHG and suggest this work as a basis for all future AMHG research.

TI  - Axillary dissection in sentinel lymph node positive breast cancer: Is the staging information worthwhile for patients?
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims The Z0011 randomized trial demonstrated no significant difference in axillary recurrence rate or survival with or without axillary dissection in patients with a positive sentinel node biopsy. However, there is continuing controversy regarding the generalizability of its results, and axillary dissection provides additional pathologic staging information that may guide adjuvant therapy. Thus, axillary dissection after positive sentinel node biopsy is being further investigated in an actively recruiting randomized trial. We elicited patients' preferences for axillary dissection versus no axillary dissection after positive sentinel node biopsy for early breast cancer. Methods Patients who had undergone axillary dissection after positive sentinel node biopsy as part of breast conserving therapy were provided with a validated, self-rated questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised two trade-off questions to determine the maximum chance of developing arm side-effects from axillary dissection to justify the benefit of additional axillary staging information. Social, demographic, and clinical details were collected. Results Ninety-nine of the 126 eligible patients returned the questionnaire and 76 completed the trade-off assessment. The median age of participants was 62 years. The median numbers of sentinel and axillary nodes removed were 2 and 12, respectively. Forty-seven percent of participants had arm swelling or tenderness of any severity. Seventy-five percent of participants would have axillary dissection even if the chance of arm side-effects like they had experienced was 100%. Conclusion Most patients with early breast cancer preferred axillary dissection after positive sentinel node biopsy for the additional staging information even though there was no survival benefit from axillary dissection.

TI  - Biogeochemical Response of Apalachicola Bay and the Shelf Waters to Hurricane Michael Using Ocean Color Semi-Analytic/Inversion and Hydrodynamic Models
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hurricanes are increasingly being recognized as important episodic drivers in ocean biogeochemical cycling; however, spatiotemporal response of their impacts on coastal and estuarine ecosystems are limited. Hurricane Michael, which made landfall just west of Apalachicola Bay (ApB) on October 10, 2018 as a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 250 km h(-1), caused widespread damage to the northwest Florida coast, and adverse effects on oyster reefs and water quality in ApB due to winds and coastal flooding associated with a strong storm surge. The impact of wind forcing and retreating storm surges on coastal and shelf biogeochemical properties remains, however, largely unknown. In this study, we use a combination of pre-hurricane field observations, ocean-color satellite imagery and the outputs (salinity, currents, sea surface height, and temperature) of a nested high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (NCOM) to examine the biogeochemical response of ApB and the surrounding shelf waters to Hurricane Michael. MODIS-derived optical proxies (e.g., absorption of colored dissolved organic matter or CDOM and particle backscattering coefficients) of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) were derived for a series of clear-sky imagery (prior to and following the hurricane) using a combination of estuarine-tuned semi-analytic and empirical algorithms. Following the hurricane, spatiotemporal distribution of both DOC and POC in ApB and the nearshore coastal waters showed a strong response to storm surge, increasing river discharge, currents, and wind field. Average flux estimates of organic carbon exported from ApB between October 5-21, 2018 to the coastal ocean were much greater for DOC (0.86 x 10(6) kg C d(-1)) than POC (0.21 x 10(6) kg C d(-1)) and increased with increasing river discharge and the wind field. A bio-optical inversion algorithm applied to Sentinel-3A OLCI imagery of 13 October, 2018 immediately following the hurricane's passage, showed a strong, week-long biological response with spatially distinct phytoplankton blooms of Karenia brevis and Emiliania Huxleyi, as detected by satellite imagery of pigments, an approach that could revolutionize our understanding of environmental impacts on phytoplankton. This study revealed spatiotemporal changes in estuarine and coastal ocean biogeochemistry reflective of a systematic regional ecosystem response to Hurricane Michael.

TI  - Training for Interreligious Classroom Teaching: An Empirical Study
T2  - RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Interreligious education should support cultural and religious diversity in the classroom by inviting new perspectives. Four contexts are important in this regard, as follows: auto-interpretation of one's own religious tradition, auto-interpretation of foreign traditions, allo-interpretation of one's own religious tradition, and allo-interpretation of foreign traditions. Previous empirical research in the Netherlands has indicated that interreligious learning is not possible in the classroom. However, this study investigated interreligious education from the teaching perspective by conducting an exercise among twenty-four religious and worldview teachers. Specifically, a combination of student teachers, schoolteachers, and teacher trainers took part in a secondary school workshop before answering interview questions. Most participants discussed their own or foreign traditions using auto-interpretation. However, approximately half of all teacher trainers discussed their own traditions using allo-interpretation, although none discussed foreign traditions from the same perspective. In addition, student teachers reached the highest level of interreligious learning available in this study by using multiple perspectives to promote inquiry and engage in productive debate. Although interreligious education is problematic at multiple teaching levels, these results indicate that interreligious teaching practices may be improved through increased training.

TI  - Retrieval of Leaf area index and stress conditions for Sundarban mangroves using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of Sentinel-2 (S2) data in mapping Leaf area index (LAI) of mangroves having heterogeneous species composition, variable canopy density, and complex backgrounds was studied. Out of the three available near-infrared bands in S2, band-8 of 10 m spatial resolution was found to be the most suitable one for deriving the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for mangroves. The LAI-NDVI relation did not accord apparently with the earlier reports and the underlying complex background effect was validated with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) hyperspectral data. It simulated spectral and spatial conditions of S2 by linear mixing of canopy and background that confirmed the effect of background contributions to the canopy reflectance decorrelating the NDVI from LAI. The compensation for diverse backgrounds was accomplished with optimum-scaled NDVI (scNDVI(m)) obtained from the mean of scaled NDVIs derived with different backgrounds in the mangroves. LAI was well correlated with composite NDVI (NDVIcom), derived empirically from the most appropriate NDVI (NDVIS2) and scNDVI(m) where ground observation controlled the threshold arbitration in extracting the range of scNDVI(m). It was shown that an improved LAI estimate with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.69 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.02 could be obtained with NDVIcom. This method has the advantage of compensating the contaminations due to background reflectance. While the relation between LAI and NDVIcom was found to be consistent, the application of the same methodology in similar mangroves should be site-specific with ample ground observation. The fusion of NDVI and scNDVI obtained from S2 yields better LAI retrieval for mixed mangroves, such as that of Sundarban.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of urban heat island intensification in the city of Minneapolis-St. Paul and Chicago metropolitan areas using Landsat data from 1984 to 2016
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Most major cities worldwide are affected Urban Heat Islands - a condition of relatively higher temperatures being observed in one area compared to another that can be caused by a decrease in greenspace. One of the major reasons attributed to this increase in the warming of urban landscapes is the decrease in green space. This concept has received a lot of attention due to the destruction of vegetation for urban development and has prompted long-term spatial-temporal studies of Urban Heat Islands to understanding local climates. The objective of this study is to use Landsat data to examine the temporal intensification of UHIs and their variability from 1984-2016 for the cities of Chicago and Minneapolis-St. Paul. Landsat L4-5 TM), L7 ETM+), OLI and TIRS from 1984 to 2016 was used to examine land surface temperature (LST). Firstly, we converted the digital number (DN) to spectral radiance (L) and to temperature in Kelvin and from kelvin to Celsius and a conversion from Radiance to Top of the Atmosphere Reflectance and estimation of land surface emissivity. Finally, LST was estimated and Urban Heat Island retrieval and anomalies computed to help examine inconsistencies in our data. Our analysis showed year-to-year fluctuations in surface temperature, intensification of UHIs for both metro areas. Using a defined deductive index to identify environmentally critical areas, estimates of UHIs based on LST showed that both metropolitan areas are UHIs with LST > mu + 0.5 x delta. Higher intensification values were observed in 1988 and 2010 for Chicago and 1984, 1999 and 2016 for Minneapolis-St. Paul from analysis. While both areas have the similar climatic conditions, our analysis show differences in UHIs intensification as observed in their urban growth patterns. Chicago experiences a higher UHI intensity compared to Minneapolis-St. Paul and this could be explained by higher number of tall buildings than Minneapolis-St. Paul.

TI  - A case of extensive ductal carcinoma in situ and sclerosing adenosis with metastasis on sentinel lymph node
T2  - TUMORI JOURNAL
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Introduction: Sclerosing adenosis is a form of adenosis characterized by lobulocentric architecture, glandular and stromal proliferation in which the stromal component compresses and distorts the glandular structures. Atypical epithelial proliferations such as atypical lobular hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, and ductal carcinoma in situ may accompany areas of sclerosing adenosis. We present a case of ductal carcinoma in situ and sclerosing adenosis with metastatic carcinoma on sentinel lymph node. Case description: A 40-year-old woman presented with a palpable mass in her left breast. Radiologic studies showed a lesion suggesting malignancy in the left breast and atypical lymph node in the left axillary region. Left lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. Histopathologic examination revealed lobulocentric lesions with glandular proliferation and hyalinizing stroma in between. Foci of high-grade cribriform and solid type ductal carcinoma in situ were observed. Sentinel lymph node biopsy showed micrometastasis in one lymph node section. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ with sclerosing adenosis. However, the presence of micrometastasis in the lymph node suggested occult invasion that we were not able to detect. Conclusion: Ductal carcinoma in situ with sclerosing adenosis can mimic invasive carcinoma both radiologically and histologically. It should be kept in mind that there may be occult invasive carcinoma in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ whether the lesion is accompanied by sclerosing adenosis or not. Multiple sections and immunohistochemical studies can be of help.

TI  - The Spatial and Temporal Influence of Cloud Cover on Satellite-Based Emergency Mapping of Earthquake Disasters
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to rapidly access optical satellite imagery is now an intrinsic component of managing the disaster response that follows a major earthquake. These images provide synoptic data on the impacts, extent, and intensity of damage, which is essential for mitigating further losses by feeding into the response coordination. However, whilst the efficiency of the response can be hampered when cloud cover limits image availability, spatio-temporal variations in cloud cover have never been considered as part of the design of effective disaster mapping. Here we show how annual variations in cloud cover may affect our capacity to respond rapidly throughout the year and consequently contribute to overall earthquake risk. We find that on a global scale when accounting for cloud, the worst time of year for an earthquake disaster is between June and August. During these months, 40% of the global population at risk from earthquakes are obscured from optical satellite view for >3 consecutive days. Southeastern Asia is particularly strongly affected, accounting for the majority of the population at risk from earthquakes that could be obscured by cloud in every month. Our results demonstrate the importance of the timing of earthquakes in terms of our capacity to respond effectively, highlighting the need for more intelligent design of disaster response that is not overly reliant on optical satellite imagery.

TI  - Decoupled kinematics of two neighbouring permafrost creeping landforms in the Eastern Italian Alps
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - An overall acceleration of rock glacier displacement rates in the Alps has been observed in recent decades, with several cases of destabilization leading to potential geomorphological hazards. This behaviour has been attributed to the rising permafrost temperature, induced by atmospheric warming and regulated by thermo-hydrological processes. Landforms derived from the interaction of glacier remnants and permafrost are widespread in mountain areas, but are less studied and monitored than talus rock glaciers. This work presents a comparative study of a talus rock glacier and a glacial-permafrost composite landform (GPCL) in the Eastern Italian Alps. The two landforms are only 10 km apart, but have rather different elevation ranges and main slope aspects. The kinematics and ground thermal conditions were monitored from 2001 to 2015 along with geomorphological surveys, analyses of historical maps and remote sensing data. The dynamic behaviour of the rock glacier was similar to the majority of monitored rock glaciers in the Alps, with an acceleration after 2008 and a velocity peak in 2015. In contrast, the GPCL had a nearly unchanged displacement rate during the observation period. Statistical analyses of kinematic vs. nivo-meteorological variables revealed a dynamic decoupling of the two landforms after 2008 that corresponds with increased winter snow accumulation. Although the kinematics of both landforms respond to ground surface temperature variations, the collected evidence suggests a different reaction of ground surface temperature to variations in the precipitation regime. This different reaction is likely due to local topo-climatic conditions that affect snow redistribution by wind. The different reactions of the two systems to the same climatic forcing is likely a legacy of their different origins. GPCL dynamics result from interaction of permafrost and residual glacial dynamics that are associated with possible peculiarities in the internal/basal meltwater circulation, whose future response is uncertain and requires improved understanding.

TI  - Impact of Duffy polymorphisms on parasite density in Brazilian Amazonian patients infected by <i>Plasmodium vivax</i>
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe Duffy glycoprotein acts as the entry point for merozoites of Plasmodium vivax in the invasion of red blood cells. The host-parasite relationship has revealed new perspectives regarding the association between Duffy polymorphisms that can impact both the parasite density of this Plasmodium and the symptoms of this type of malaria. This study investigates the impact of Duffy polymorphisms on parasite density in patients infected with P. vivax in the Brazilian Amazon region.MethodsGenotypes and Duffy polymorphism allele frequencies were compared in 287 patients with malaria, presenting low, medium and high density of P. vivax. The diagnosis of malaria was performed using a specialized team with a standardized clinical-laboratory method, while the Duffy genotyping was performed through the Bead Chip BioArray system. Both teams are reference services in Brazil.ResultsThe FY*01 and FY*02 alleles were found in all three parasite density classes: low, medium and high, but when these alleles form genotypes with FY*02N.01 and FY*02W.01 alleles, they are found only in patients with low parasite density and low symptomatology. Another interesting finding found in this study is the presence of the genotype FY*02N.01/FY*02W.01 in one of the patients, presenting a very low parasite density and malaria considered subclinical, a genotype which had not been previously described in the literature.ConclusionThe presence of FY*02N.01 and FY*02W.01 alleles may have an impact on the reduction of clinical manifestations in malaria, leading to the development of subclinical malaria, making the infected individual an undetected natural reservoir, which may hinder the eradication of malaria in the Amazon.

TI  - Sensitivity of Coarse-Scale Snow-Free Land Surface Shortwave Albedo to Topography
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - As a widespread landscape, rugged terrain significantly distorts the land surface albedo. Simply neglecting the topographic effects in the land surface albedo modeling and retrievals can lead to large biases and uncertainties over rugged terrain. In spite of gradually increasing research about the topographic effects on the albedo, the albedo sensitivities over rugged terrain to different variables remain unclear. In this paper, the sensitivities of coarse-scale snow-free albedo to topography were quantitatively investigated using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface albedo data and the variance-based global sensitivity analysis based on a well-established mechanistically-based land surface albedo parameterized model over rugged terrain. The results based on the MODIS data revealed that MODIS land surface albedo over the Tibetan Plateau was highly sensitive to the topographic distribution, and the differences of the spatially averaged snow-free black-sky albedos over grasslands induced by different terrain could reach up to 0.10 in winter. The topographic effects on MODIS albedo are tightly relevant to the land cover type, solar illumination geometries, and vegetation characteristics. The global sensitivity analysis results underscored that topography was an important driving factor of the snow-free albedo, and it accounted for more than 30% of the total variance, respectively. These results highlight the necessities for the topographic consideration in the land surface albedo modeling and retrievals even though the terrain is gentle (10-20 degrees) and advance our understanding of the albedo sensitivities to different variables over rugged terrain, which will facilitate the improvement of land surface albedo parameterization in the land surface models.

TI  - Effect of Aerosols on the Ice Cloud Properties Over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - With the highlight of environmental problems over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), aerosol pollution and the influence of this pollution on cloud properties are becoming a new area of research. Based on the aerosol index and cloud property parameters derived from satellite observations, in this study, the inconsistent effects of aerosols on ice cloud properties between daytime and nighttime over the TP are investigated. The results indicate that ice clouds are mainly distributed over the TP margin area, especially over the north slope, during both daytime and nighttime. The occurrence frequency of ice cloud is higher during the daytime than during the nighttime over the margin areas of the TP. Similarly, aerosols are mainly concentrated over the northern margin of the TP. A potential relationship may exist between the aerosol index and ice cloud properties. When the aerosol index increases from 0.05 to 0.17, the ice cloud droplet radius (ICDR) during the daytime decreases from 32.1 to 27.9 mu m, while the ICDR during the nighttime remains almost constant (approximately 25 mu m); furthermore, the ice water path (IWP) during the daytime decreases slightly due to the saturation effect, while the nocturnal IWP increases significantly. The changes in ice cloud optical depth (ICOD) during daytime and nighttime show significant and completely opposite trends. The removal of the influence of meteorological factors showed that aerosols have a more dominant influence than meteorological conditions on ice cloud properties (except for the nocturnal ICDR and IWP during the daytime).

TI  - Evaluation of an ultraviolet LED trap for catching <i>Anopheles</i> and <i>Culex</i> mosquitoes in south-eastern Tanzania
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Improved surveillance techniques are required to accelerate efforts against major arthropod-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, filariasis, Zika and yellow-fever. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are increasingly used in mosquito traps because they improve energy efficiency and battery longevity relative to incandescent bulbs. This study evaluated the efficacy of a new ultraviolet LED trap (Mosclean) against standard mosquito collection methods. Methods The study was conducted in controlled semi-field settings and in field conditions in rural south-eastern Tanzania. The Mosclean trap was compared to commonly used techniques, namely CDC-light traps, human landing catches (HLCs), BG-Sentinel traps and Suna traps. Results When simultaneously placed inside the same semi-field chamber, the Mosclean trap caught twice as many Anopheles arabiensis as the CDC-light trap, and equal numbers to HLCs. Similar results were obtained when traps were tested individually in the chambers. Under field settings, Mosclean traps caught equal numbers of An. arabiensis and twice as many Culex mosquitoes as CDC-light traps. It was also better at trapping malaria vectors compared to both Suna and BG-Sentinel traps, and was more efficient in collecting mosquitoes indoors than outdoors. The majority of An. arabiensis females caught by Mosclean traps were parous (63.6%) and inseminated (89.8%). In comparison, the females caught by CDC-light traps were 43.9% parous and 92.8% inseminated. Conclusions The UV LED trap (Mosclean trap) was efficacious for sampling Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes. Its efficacy was comparable to and in some instances better than traps commonly used for vector surveillance. The Mosclean trap was more productive in sampling mosquitoes indoors compared to outdoors. The trap can be used indoors near human-occupied nets, or outdoors, in which case additional CO2 improves catches. We conclude that this trap may have potential for mosquito surveillance. However, we recommend additional field tests to validate these findings in multiple settings and to assess the potential of LEDs to attract non-target organisms, especially outdoors.

TI  - A cultural framework for Maori tourism: values and processes of a Whanau tourism business development
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The tourism industry has the potential to provide sustainable employment and empowerment for Maori. Whilst previous tourism research has identified the need for Maori control, ownership and authenticity in this regard, few studies have engaged an Indigenist paradigm to understand how this may be achieved. There remains an important need to consider how Maori values and principles can facilitate Kaupapa-driven Maori tourism business. Using a Kaupapa Maori methodology, a series of Hui examined a Whanau (Maori family) tourism business development targeting the cruise industry. The research fills an important gap in knowledge as the Whanau unit is argued to be the core of socio-economic development for Maori. The cultural analysis was completed through the process of Whakapapa (genealogical connectedness) and Whanaungatanga (cultural relationships) to analyse data from a Maori worldview, and the findings revealed a cultural framework: Te Poutama Tapoi Maori (the Poutama lattice of Maori tourism). The cultural framework demonstrates cultural levels of significance for the Whanau and offers an informed decision-making pathway for other Whanau. Using the framework, Whanau can consider cultural processes, practices, protocols, values and traditions in order to guide their authentic Maori tourism business development in a way that is by Maori about Maori.

TI  - Observationally constrained analysis of sea salt aerosol in the marine atmosphere
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric sea salt plays important roles in marine cloud formation and atmospheric chemistry. We performed an integrated analysis of NASA GEOS model simulations run with the GOCART aerosol module, in situ measurements from the PALMS and SAGA instruments obtained during the NASA ATom campaign, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from the AERONET Marine Aerosol Network (MAN) and from MODIS satellite observations to better constrain sea salt in the marine atmosphere. ATom measurements and GEOS model simulations both show that sea salt concentrations over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans have a strong vertical gradient, varying up to 4 orders of magnitude from the marine boundary layer to free troposphere. The modeled residence times suggest that the lifetime of sea salt particles with a dry diameter of less than 3 mu m is largely controlled by wet removal, followed by turbulent process. During both boreal summer and winter, the GEOS-simulated sea salt mass mixing ratios agree with SAGA measurements in the marine boundary layer (MBL) and with PALMS measurements above the MBL. However, comparison of AOD from GEOS with AERONET/MAN and MODIS aerosol retrievals indicated that the model underestimated AOD over the oceans where sea salt dominates. The apparent discrepancy of slightly overpredicted concentration and large underpredicted AOD could not be explained by biases in the model RH affecting the particle hygroscopic growth, as modeled RH was found to be comparable to or larger than the in situ measurements. This conundrum could at least partially be explained by the difference in sea salt size distribution; the GEOS simulation has much less sea salt percentage-wise in the smaller particle size range and thus less efficient light extinction than what was observed by PALMS.

TI  - Boreal forest vegetation and fuel conditions 12 years after the 2004 Taylor Complex fires in Alaska, USA
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Fire has historically been a primary control on succession and vegetation dynamics in boreal systems, although modern changing climate is potentially increasing fire size and frequency. Large, often remote fires necessitate large-scale estimates of fire effects and consequences, often using Landsat satellite-derived dNBR (differenced Normalized Burn Ratio) to estimate burn severity. However, few studies have examined long-term field measures of ecosystem condition in relation to dNBR severity classes in boreal Alaska, USA. The goals of this study were: 1) assess changes in dominant vegetation at plots resampled one and 12 years post fire; 2) use dNBR classes to characterize vegetation and downed woody fuels 12 years post fire; and 3) characterize the relationship between biophysical, topographic, and remotely sensed characteristics (e.g., moss and duff depth, canopy cover, elevation, aspect, dNBR) and understory species assemblages 12 years post fire. Results Understory species richness doubled (from 39 to 73) between 2005 and 2016; some common species increased in cover over time (e.g., Ledum groenlandicum Oeder) while others decreased (e.g., Hylocomium splendens [Hedw.] Schimp.). In 2016, live and dead tree densities, tall shrub cover, and 1- and 100-h woody fuels were significantly different among dNBR classes; moss and duff depth, canopy cover, and spruce seedling density were not. Elevation and aspect significantly influenced tall shrub cover, hardwood sapling density, and downed woody fuel loads. Understory plant communities differed between unburned and all burn classes, as well as between low and high dNBR severity. Ordination analysis showed that overstory (e.g., live tree density), understory (e.g., moss depth, woody fuel loading), and site (elevation, aspect, dNBR) significantly influences understory species assemblages. Conclusion Remeasured sites (sampled one and 12 years post fire) showed recruitment of new understory species and differing, diverse responses to burning by several common plant species. In 2016, low-severity burned sites had generally the highest woody fuel loading, which may increase risk of repeated surface burning, although the reduction in live tree density would still result in decreased fire risk and behavior. Understory community composition correlated with multiple biotic and abiotic factors, including moss depth, canopy cover, elevation, aspect, and dNBR. Overall, our findings can improve landscape-level predictions of ecosystem condition following fire based on dNBR.

TI  - Chlorine partitioning in the lowermost Arctic vortex during the cold winter 2015/2016
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Activated chlorine compounds in the polar winter stratosphere drive catalytic cycles that deplete ozone and methane, whose abundances are highly relevant to the evolution of global climate. The present work introduces a novel dataset of in situ measurements of relevant chlorine species in the lowermost Arctic stratosphere from the aircraft mission POLSTRACC-GW-LCYCLE-SALSA during winter 2015/2016. The major stages of chemical evolution of the lower polar vortex are presented in a consistent series of high-resolution mass spectrometric observations of HCl and ClONO2. Simultaneous measurements of CFC-12 are used to derive total inorganic chlorine (Cl-y) and active chlorine (ClOx). The new data highlight an altitude dependence of the pathway for chlorine deactivation in the lowermost vortex with HCl dominating below the 380K isentropic surface and ClONO2 prevailing above. Further, we show that the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) is generally able to reproduce the chemical evolution of the lower polar vortex chlorine budget, except for a bias in HCl concentrations. The model is used to relate local measurements to the vortex-wide evolution. The results are aimed at fostering our understanding of the climate impact of chlorine chemistry, providing new observational data to complement satellite data and assess model performance in the climate-sensitive upper troposphere and lower stratosphere region.

TI  - The association between evidence of a predator threat and responsiveness to alarm calls in Western Australian magpies (<i>Cracticus tibicen dorsalis</i>)
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Alarm calls are a widespread form of antipredator defence and being alerted to the presence of predators by the alarm calls of conspecifics is considered one of the benefits of group living. However, while social information can allow an individual to gain additional information, it can also at times be inaccurate or irrelevant. Such variation in the accuracy of social information is predicted to select for receivers to discriminate between sources of social information. In this study, we used playback experiments to determine whether Western Australian magpies (Cracticus tibicen dorsalis) respond to the predator information associated with alarm calls. Magpies were exposed to the alarm calls of two group members that differed in the threat associated with the alarm call: one call was played in the presence of a predator model while the other was not-in order to establish differences in the predator information provided by each caller. We then played back the alarm calls of the same group members in the absence of the predator model to determine whether magpies responded differently to signallers in response to the previous association between the alarm call and a predator threat. We found that receivers showed significantly greater levels of responsiveness to signallers that previously gave alarm calls in the appropriate context. Thus, the accuracy of threat-based information influenced subsequent receiver response.

TI  - Preoperative localization of sentinel lymph node in breast cancer patients by silver wire insertion or liquid charcoal injection guided by CT lymphography
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Dual localization of SLN in breast cancer patients using isotope & dye is the best-approved modality with limitations such as high cost of radioactive materials, complex logistic preparations & scheduling issues, especially in developing countries. We investigated the feasibility & accuracy of a novel technique for SLN localization using silver wire insertion or liquid charcoal injection guided by CT lymphography. 120 patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer were enrolled. In the test group, SLN was localized using preoperative CTLG guided injection of liquid charcoal or by placing a 3 cm silver wire. In addition, intraoperative SLN mapping was performed using methylene blue dye followed by searching for the SLN localized by both methods. In the control group, SLN was localized by the blue dye only. Feasibility, accuracy, detection rates, and number of SLNs retrieved were reported as well as matching between the LN detected with the CTLG and that detected with the dye technique. SLN could be detected in 59 out of 60 patients (98.3%) in the test group and in 54 out of 60 patients (90%) in the control group (P = .057). In self-controlled analysis of the test group comparing CTLG only to dye only was significant (P = .050). Comparing charcoal to silver wire in detection was statistically insignificant (P = .5). This novel method can offer advantages which are as follows: being more accurate than the dye alone, saving operative time, abandoning complex logistic preparations for the radioisotope, and solving the problem of timing.

TI  - Cloud Detection of RGB Color Remote Sensing Images Based on Improved M-Net
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is prone to error and considerable loss of details because clouds do not have obvious color distribution and texture pattern in RGB color images. Therefore, this study proposes an improved M-Net model called the RM-Net model to achieve end-to-end pixel-level semantic segmentation. An original dataset is enhanced and a corresponding pixel-level label is marked. Multi-scale image features are extracted without losing data via atrous spatial pyramid pooling, and residual units are combined to make the network resistant to degradation. Global context informations of the images are extracted using the encoder module and the left path. The spatial resolutions of the images are restored using the decoder module and the right path. Each pixel's category probability is determined based on fused features, and pixel-level cloud and non-cloud segmentation are performed using the input classifier. When training and testing Landsat8 and GaoFen-1 WFV RGB color images, experimental results show that the proposed method can well detect cloud edge details under various conditions and achieve high-precision cloud shadow detection, thus demonstrating that the proposed method has high generalization and robustness.

TI  - Axillary dissection in patients with preoperative positive nodal cytology: Genuine need or overtreatment?
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies demonstrated the possibility to avoid axillary dissection (ALND) in selected patients with one or two metastatic nodes. Otherwise, patients with positive nodal ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (US-FNAC) currently undergo ALDN. The aim of this study is to quantify the nodal burden in patients with positive US-FNAC treated with ALND and to evaluate if clinical or pathological characteristics associated with low nodal involvement can be identified. This is a multicentric retrospective study involving 297 patients who underwent ALND because of a positive preoperative US-FNAC. A total of 157 patients showed bulky axillary lymph nodes at diagnosis, and 70% of them had three or more metastatic nodes. One hundred and forty patients had a clinically negative axilla and in 50% of them, 4 or more metastatic nodes were found with axillary dissection. Overall, the median number of metastatic nodes was 5. Favorable pathological characteristics of tumors were found in patients with only one or two metastatic nodes: smaller primary tumor, a lower proportion of grade 3, invasive lobular carcinomas and a higher proportion of low-Ki67 tumors. In the group of patients with clinically negative axilla and potentially meeting ACOSOG Z0011 criteria, 22 (31%) showed less than three metastatic axillary nodes. A preoperative positive axillary FNAC is associated with a metastatic nodal burden significantly higher than in patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Nevertheless, about 30% of patients with cN0 axilla, positive axillary FNAC performed because of suspicious nodes on imaging, T1-2 primary tumor and breast-conserving surgery showed less than three metastatic axillary nodes, thus meeting ACOSOG Z0011 trial's criteria and therefore would be eligible for skipping ALND according to current guidelines.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Ship Detection Based on Improved R-FCN
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional ship detection algorithm is difficult to adapt in the complex and varied sea clutter environment, and intelligent ship detection is impossible to realize. This study proposes an improved region-based fully convolutional network (R-FCN) detection method. Aiming at the characteristics of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the feature extraction network ResNet in R-FCN uses a mixed-scale convolution kernel. The feature extraction network can suppress the influence of the speckle noise and effectively extract the ship features. High-resolution GF-3 and low-resolution Sentinel-1 satellite SAR images are selected for the test. Consequently, good results are obtained, proving the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

TI  - Combined Feature-Tracking and Pattern-Matching Algorithm for Sea-Ice Drift Detection
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduced an effective preprocessing method based on Sentinel-1 remote-sensing data to obtain a more accurate dataset and proposed a triangulation-based feature-tracking and pattern-matching algorithm. By establishing a triangular network, the advantages of the two algorithms were effectively combined, which not only improved the efficiency but also enhanced the spatial-distribution uniformity of the sea-ice drift vectors. Additionally, this study investigated the applicability of the algorithm for strong-noise areas of like-polarized (HH) and cross-polarized (HV) data. The experimental results show that sea-ice drift vectors obtained using this algorithm exhibit a high coverage and reduce the root mean square error by similar to 10%, thereby improving the detection accuracy and robustness against noise. Furthermore, the detection accuracy remains as high as 98%, even in the presence of interference by strip noise. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method for effectively monitoring sea-ice drift.

TI  - Benthic coverage and bottom topography of coral reef environment over Pirotan reef, Gulf of Kachchh region, India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing measurements in coral reef environments commonly confront the problem of overlying atmosphere and modification of spectral signal due to water column over the bottom substrates. In order to correct these problems, hyperspectral observations offer an advantage over multispectral observations. Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data from Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer- Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) sensor was acquired during low tidal condition on 14 February 2016 at Pirotan reef, Gulf of Kachchh region, India. The objective of this study is to map benthic coverage and bottom topography over Pirotan reef. The methodology involved atmospheric correction, simultaneous retrieval of water parameters, bathymetry, water column correction and mapping. Atmospheric correction was performed by removing path radiance and aerosol contribution and dividing by atmospheric transmittance and incoming solar irradiance to obtain remote sensing reflectance. Model derived error minimization technique was used for simultaneous retrieval of water parameters and bathymetry. Derived water parameters were used to account for water column attenuation and retrieve concomitant true bottom signature.

TI  - Leveraging the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System for global respiratory syncytial virus surveillance-opportunities and challenges
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated acute lower respiratory infection is a common cause for hospitalization and hospital deaths in young children globally. There is urgent need to generate evidence to inform immunization policies when RSV vaccines become available. The WHO piloted a RSV surveillance strategy that leverages the existing capacities of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) to better understand RSV seasonality, high-risk groups, validate case definitions, and develop laboratory and surveillance standards for RSV. Methods The RSV sentinel surveillance strategy was piloted in 14 countries. Patients across all age groups presenting to sentinel hospitals and clinics were screened all year-round using extended severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) case definitions for hospital and primary care settings, respectively. Respiratory specimens were tested for RSV at the National Influenza Centre (NIC) using standardized molecular diagnostics that had been validated by an External Quality Assurance program. The WHO FluMart data platform was adapted to receive case-based RSV data and visualize interactive visualization outputs. Results Laboratory standards for detecting RSV by RT-PCR were developed. A review assessed the feasibility and the low incremental costs for RSV surveillance. Several challenges were addressed related to case definitions, sampling strategies, the need to focus surveillance on young children, and the data required for burden estimation. Conclusions There was no evidence of any significant adverse impact on the functioning of GISRS which is primarily intended for virologic and epidemiological surveillance of influenza.

TI  - A remote sensing-based evaluation of an ungauged drainage basin in Southwestern Nigeria
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Paucity of scientific information about many river basins in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, has been linked to poor datasets and expensive monitoring technology. This study assessed the capability of freely available Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and Landsat imageries to provide management decision support on river basins in the region. Main objectives are to examine landuse/landcover change over the Opa river basin in Ife area in southwest Nigeria, characterize the basin morphometrically and compare the morphometric characteristics from different sensors and resolutions. Results showed that the ecosystem of the river basin is vulnerable to urban intrusion and disturbance from human activities as urban population increases. Also, analysis of the DEMs allowed the drainage basin to be delineated into relatively homogenous and manageable sizes that can ease management, organization and evaluation of their eco-hydrological systems. The study concluded that complementary use of SRTM and ASTER DEMs with Landsat imageries that are freely available spatial data for researchers, is capable of providing useful decision support system for management of river basins in the region, to a level of uncertainty occasioned by sensors' characteristics.

TI  - Evaluating the potential of the red edge channel for C3 (Festuca spp.) grass discrimination using Sentinel-2 and Rapid Eye satellite image data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating the Red Edge channel in satellite sensors is valuable for plant species discrimination. Sentinel-2 MSI and Rapid Eye are some of the new generation satellite sensors that are characterized by finer spatial and spectral resolution, including the red edge band. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of the red edge band of Sentinel-2 and Rapid Eye, for mapping festuca C3 grass using discriminant analysis and maximum likelihood classification algorithms. Spectral bands, vegetation indices and spectral bands plus vegetation indices were analysed. Results show that the integration of the red edge band improved the festuca C3 grass mapping accuracy by 5.95 and 4.76% for Sentinel-2 and Rapid Eye when the red edge bands were included and excluded in the analysis, respectively. The results demonstrate that the use of sensors with strategically positioned red edge bands, could offer information that is critical for the sustainable rangeland management.

TI  - Classification of glacial lakes using integrated approach of DFPS technique and gradient analysis using Sentinel 2A data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to identify and locate glacial lakes for assessing any potential hazard. This study presents a combination of semi-automatic method Double-Window Flexible Pace Search (DFPS) and edge detection technique to identify glacial lakes using Sentinel 2A satellite data. Initially, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) has been used to identify water and non-water areas, while DFPS and Edge detection technique has been used to identify an optimum threshold value to distinguish between water and shadow areas. The optimal threshold from DFPS process is 0.21, while threshold value of gradient magnitude using edge detection process is 0.318. The number of glacial lakes identified using the above algorithm is in close agreement with previously published results on glacial lakes in Gangotri glacier using different techniques. Thus, a combination of DFPS and edge detection process has successfully segregated glacial lakes from other features present in Gangotri glacier.

TI  - Method for delineating open water bodies based on the deeply clear waterbody delineation index
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface water is one of the most vital resources on Earth for human survival, and it is necessary to distinguish water bodies from nonwater features. Remote sensing techniques are among the most widely used approaches for monitoring water resources; many waterbody delineation methods have been proposed, and multiband spectral water indices are among the most popular. These methods utilize blue, green, near-infrared (NIR), middle-infrared, and shortwave infrared bands but do not involve the red band. A waterbody delineation index is introduced, i.e., the deeply clear waterbody delineation index (DCWDI), which is based on the reflectance of the red and NIR bands. In NIR-red spectral space, the distance between deeply clear water pixels and the coordinate origin, O, is less than that of other land cover types. This method can use the distance between any point E and the coordinate origin O to differentiate deeply clear water pixels from nonwater pixels, i.e., objects near point O are always deeply clear water bodies or extremely wet regions. The accuracy and robustness of the DCWDI are tested using Landsat 8 operational land imager images of Hongjiannao Lake, Qinghaihu Lake, and Lingao Reservoir. The performance of the DCWDI is compared with that of the normalized difference water index (NDWI), automated water extraction index (AWEI), and the modified NDWI (MNDWI). The net shoreline movement (NSM) and the area errors between delineated water areas and the "true" areas of water bodies are adopted to evaluate the accuracies of the four classifiers. The mean vertical bar NSM vertical bar values from the DCWDI of Hongjiannao Lake, Qinghaihu Lake, and Lingao Reservoir are 17.033, 75.108, and 11.021 m, respectively, which are smaller than those from the MNDWI (34.641, 149.308, and 19.647 m), NDWI (71.607, 164.503, and 22.151 m), and AWEInsh (19.957, 113.119, and 11.126 m). The average of vertical bar NSM vertical bar and area error from the DCWDI are smaller than those from the other three classifiers. These results show that the lake boundaries derived from the DCWDI are spatially similar to the "true" lake boundaries, and the DCWDI, which is obtained from NIR-red spectral space, can be applied to delineate and detect the changes in information on deeply clear water. The spatial location information contained within NSM can validate the accuracy of a classifiers' ability to extract water bodies. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Combining spatiotemporal fusion and object-based image analysis for improving wetland mapping in complex and heterogeneous urban landscapes
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been proven promising in wetland mapping. However, conventional methods in a complex and heterogeneous urban landscape usually use mono temporal Landsat TM/ETM + images, which have great uncertainty due to the spectral similarity of different land covers, and pixel-based classifications may not meet the accuracy requirement. This paper proposes an approach that combines spatiotemporal fusion and object-based image analysis, using the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model to generate a time series of Landsat 8 OLI images on critical dates of sedge swamp and paddy rice, and the time series of MODIS NDVI to calculate phenological parameters for identifying wetlands with an object-based method. The results of a case study indicate that different types of wetlands can be successfully identified, with 92.38%. The overall accuracy and 0.85 Kappa coefficient, and 85% and 90% for the user's accuracies of sedge swamp and paddy respectively.

TI  - Land cover and land use classification performance of machine learning algorithms in a boreal landscape using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the data science and remote sensing communities have started to align due to user-friendly programming tools, access to high-end consumer computing power, and the availability of free satellite data. In particular, publicly available data from the European Space Agency's Sentinel missions have been used in various remote sensing applications. However, there is a lack of studies that utilize these data to assess the performance of machine learning algorithms in complex boreal landscapes. In this article, I compare the classification performance of four non-parametric algorithms: support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), and deep learning (DL). The study area chosen is a complex mixed-use landscape in south-central Sweden with eight land-cover and land-use (LCLU) classes. The satellite imagery used for the classification were multi-temporal scenes from Sentinel-2 covering spring, summer, autumn and winter conditions. Using stratified random sampling, each LCLU class was allocated 1477 samples, which were divided into training (70%) and evaluation (30%) subsets. Accuracy was assessed through metrics derived from an error matrix, but primarily overall accuracy was used in allocating algorithm hierarchy. A two-proportion Z-test was used to compare the proportions of correctly classified pixels of the algorithms and a McNemar's chi-square test was used to compare class-wise predictions. The results show that the highest overall accuracy was produced by support vector machines (0.758 +/- 0.017), closely followed by extreme gradient boosting (0.751 +/- 0.017), random forests (0.739 +/- 0.018), and finally deep learning (0.733 +/- 0.0023). The Z-test comparison of classifiers showed that a third of algorithm pairings were statistically different. On a class-wise basis, McNemar's test results showed that 62% of class-wise predictions were significant from one another at the 5% level or less. Variable importance metrics show that nearly half of the top twenty Sentinel-2 bands belonged to the red edge (25%) and shortwave infrared (23%) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and were dominated by scenes from spring (38%) and summer (40%). The results are discussed within the scope of recent studies involving machine learning and Sentinel-2 data and key knowledge gaps identified. The article concludes with recommendations for future research.

TI  - Theoretical uncertainties for global satellite-derived burned area estimates
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative information on the error properties of global satellite-derived burned area (BA) products is essential for evaluating the quality of these products, e.g. against modelled BA estimates. We estimate theoretical uncertainties for three widely used global satellite-derived BA products using a multiplicative triple collocation error model. The approach provides spatially unique uncertainties at 1 degrees for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 burned area product (MCD64), the MODIS Collection 5.1 (MCD45) product, and the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Fire product version 5.0 (FireCCI50) for 2001-2013. The uncertainties on mean global burned area for three products are 3.76 +/- 0.15 x 10(6) km(2) for MCD64, 3.70 +/- 0.17 x 10(6) km(2) for FireCCI50, and 3.31 +/- 0.18 x 10(6) km(2) for MCD45. These correspond to relative uncertainties of 4 %-5.5% and also indicate previous uncertainty estimates to be underestimated. Relative uncertainties are 8 %-10% in Africa and Australia, for example, and larger in regions with less annual burned area. The method provides uncertainties that are likely to be more consistent with modelling and data analysis studies due to their spatially explicit properties. These properties are also intended to allow spatially explicit validation of current burned area products.

TI  - Cranial nerve outcomes in regionally recurrent head & neck melanoma after sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Characterize long-term cranial nerve (CN) outcomes following sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) based management for head and neck cutaneous melanoma (HNCM). Methods Longitudinal review of HNCM patients undergoing SLNB from 1997-2007. Results Three hundred fifty-six patients were identified, with mean age 53.5 +/- 19.0 years, mean Breslow depth 2.52 +/- 1.87 mm, and 4.9 years median follow-up. One hundred five (29.4%) patients had SLNB mapping to the parotid basin. Eighteen patients had positive parotid SLNs and underwent immediate parotidectomy / immediate completion lymph node dissection (iCLND), with six possessing positive parotid non-sentinel lymph nodes (NSLNs). Fifty-two of 356 (14.6%) patients developed delayed regional recurrences, including 20 total intraparotid recurrences: five following false negative (FN) parotid SLNB, three following prior immediate superficial parotidectomy, two following iCLND without parotidectomy, and the remaining 12 parotid recurrences had negative extraparotid SLNBs. Parotid recurrences were multiple (4.9 mean recurrent nodes) and advanced (n = 4 extracapsular extension), and all required salvage dissection including parotidectomy. Immediate parotidectomy/iCLND led to no permanent CN injuries. Delayed regional HNCM macrometastasis precipitated 16 total permanent CN injuries in 13 patients: 10 CN VII, five CN XI, and one CN XII deficits. Fifty percent (n = 10) of parotid recurrences caused >= 1 permanent CN deficits. Conclusions Regional HNCM macrometastases and salvage dissection confer marked CN injury risk, whereas early surgical intervention via SLNB +/- iCLND +/- immediate parotidectomy yielded no CN injuries. Further, superficial parotidectomy performed in parotid-mapping HNCM does not obviate delayed intraparotid recurrences, which increase risk of CN VII injury. Despite lack of a published disease-specific survival advantage in melanoma, early disease control in cervical and parotid basins is paramount to minimize CN complications.

TI  - Seroprevalence of spotted fever group rickettsiae in canines along the United States-Mexico border
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Portions of northern Mexico are experiencing a re-emergence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), a tickborne disease caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, a member of the spotted fever group of rickettsiae (SFGR). Infection with R. rickettsii can result in serious and life-threatening illness in people and dogs. Canine seroprevalence has been used as a sentinel for human RMSF in previous studies. This study aims to quantify SFGR seroprevalence in canines in three northern Mexican states and identify risk factors associated with seropositivity. A total of 1,136 serum samples and 942 ticks were obtained from dogs participating in government sterilization campaigns and from animal control facilities in 14 Mexican cities in three states. SFGR antibodies were detected using indirect immunofluorescence antibody assays at titre values >= 1/64. Six per cent (69 dogs) showed antibodies to SFGR, with the highest seroprevalence reported in Baja California (12%), Coahuila (4%) and Sonora (4%). Dogs from Baja California had three times higher odds of having SFGR antibodies compared to dogs from Sonora (OR = 3.38, 95% CI, 1.81-6.37). Roughly one quarter (25%) of surveyed dogs were parasitized by ticks (Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato) at the time of sample collection. A portion of collected ticks were tested for rickettsial DNA using polymerase chain reaction. Positive samples were then sequenced, showing evidence of SFGR including R. massiliae, R. parkeri and R. rickettsii. Dogs that spent the majority of time on the street, such as free-roaming or community-owned dogs, showed a greater risk of tick infestation, seropositivity, bearing seropositive ticks, and may play a pivotal role in the spread of SFGR among communities. Estimating the seroprevalence of SFGR in the canine population can help public health campaigns target high-risk communities for interventions to reduce human RMSF cases.

T2  - Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - With the extensive use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), some breast cancer patients could avoid axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and its complications. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy plays an important role in the multimodality therapies of breast cancer. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, some patients with breast cancer were down-staged from positive axillary lymph node (cN+ ) to clinically negative (cN0). For these patients, the feasibility and safety of sentinel lymph node biopsy remains controversial. However, with the application of new technologies, SLNB is expected to become the main treatment for breast cancer patients with stage cN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
AB  - 随着前哨淋巴结活检术(SLNB)的广泛应用，部分乳腺癌患者避免了腋窝淋巴结清扫术(ALND)及其带来的并发症。在乳腺癌的治疗中，新辅助化疗占有重要地位。临床诊断腋窝淋巴结阳性的乳腺癌患者，经过新辅助化疗后，有些能够达到临床阴性(cN0)。对于这部分患者，实施SLNB的可能性和安全性还存在较多争议。但从相关研究进展来看，随着越来越多相关新技术的应用，SLNB将有望成为新辅助化疗后cN0期乳腺癌患者主要的治疗选择。.

TI  - Improving the reproducibility of geospatial scientific workflows: the use of geosocial media in facilitating disaster response
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reproducibility is widely regarded as crucial for scientific studies, yet there is still a lack of reproducibility in geospatial research. New sources of crowdsourced geoinformation provide new opportunities, but also complicate the reproducibility situation. Consequently, there is untapped potential in the domain of disaster response to reuse scientific methodology. Shared, executable scientific workflows can help in improving reproducibility. In this paper, we created reproducible scientific workflows for disaster response from three published studies using geosocial media sources. They have been adapted to a scientific workflow management system to investigate and evaluate their suitability for the creation of geospatial footprints of wildfire events from Twitter data. We investigated how scientific workflows adapt to various analytical processes and compared their performance using MODIS active fires data as ground truth. A systematic qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrated that scientific workflows can help increase the reproducibility of geospatial analytics.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL PATHOLOGY & MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common non-cutaneous head and neck (H&N) malignancy. Referrals for suspected SCC are seen by oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) surgeons and represent the bulk of 2-week wait referrals. The diagnosis and treatment of SCC is heavily influenced by national and international guidelines. The majority of research and funding is directed towards this condition. This has led to continuous changes to update these guidelines. However, there remain areas of controversy and conflicting evidence. This article summarises articles pertinent to pathologists between 2016 and 2018 published in the leading British OMFS journal. A total of 22 published articles relating to the histopathology of non-cutaneous H&N SCC were selected.

TI  - Indigenous sovereignties: relational ontologies and environmental management
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous nations have always and continue to assert their sovereignties to resist colonialism. This paper makes explicit the ways in which environmental management has been and continues to act as a tool of colonialism, particularly by privileging Western science, institutions, and administrative procedures. We argue that to decolonise environmental management, it is crucial to understand and challenge the power relations that underlie it-asking who makes decisions and on what worldview those decisions are based. Indigenous ways of being deeply challenge the foundations of environmental management and the colonising power structures that underlie it, and invite further thought about posthuman and relational ontologies. We provide a range of case studies that showcase the role of Indigenous nations in redefining and reimagining environmental management based on Indigenous sovereignties, knowledges, and ways of being. The case studies emphasise the crucial connection between Indigenous decision-making authority and self-governance for the enhanced protection and health of the environment. We argue that Indigenous agency, grounded in Indigenous governance and sovereignties, is driving innovation and decolonising environmental management by making space for new ways of thinking and being "in place".

TI  - Epidemiology and prognostic factors of nosocomial candidemia in Northeast Brazil: A six-year retrospective study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Candidemia has been considered a persistent public health problem with great impact on hospital costs and high mortality. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiology and prognostic factors of candidemia in a tertiary hospital in Northeast Brazil from January 2011 to December 2016. Demographic and clinical data of patients were retrospectively obtained from medical records and antifungal susceptibility profiling was performed using the broth micro dilution method. A total of 68 episodes of candidemia were evaluated. We found an average incidence of 2.23 episodes/1000 admissions and a 30-day mortality rate of 55.9%. The most prevalent species were Candida albicans (35.3%), Candida tropicalis (27.4%), Candida parapsilosis (21.6%) and Candida glabrata (11.8%). Higher mortality rates were observed in cases of candidemia due to C. albicans (61.1%) and C. glabrata (100%), especially when compared to C. parapsilosis (27.3%). Univariate analysis revealed some variables which significantly increased the probability of death: older age (P = 0.022; odds ratio [OR] = 1.041), severe sepsis (P < 0.001; OR = 8.571), septic shock (P = 0.035; OR = 3.792), hypotension (P = 0.003; OR = 9.120), neutrophilia (P = 0.046; OR = 3.080), thrombocytopenia (P = 0.002; OR = 6.800), mechanical ventilation (P = 0.009; OR = 8.167) and greater number of surgeries (P = 0.037; OR = 1.920). Multivariate analysis showed that older age (P = 0.040; OR = 1.055), severe sepsis (P = 0.009; OR = 9.872) and hypotension (P = 0.031; OR = 21.042) were independently associated with worse prognosis. There was no resistance to amphotericin B, micafungin or itraconazole and a low rate of resistance to fluconazole (5.1%). However, 20.5% of the Candida isolates were susceptible dose-dependent (SDD) to fluconazole and 7.7% to itraconazole. In conclusion, our results could assist in the adoption of strategies to stratify patients at higher risk for developing candidemia and worse prognosis, in addition to improve antifungal management.

AB  - Consumer complaints provide a signal of the problems that different American communities face. I use a large database of millions of complaints to examine how per capita complaint rates vary across communities, as well as heterogeneity in who complains to different agencies and about different consumer protection issues. I find higher complaint rates in more heavily Black, more educated, higher income, older, and more urban communities and lower complaint rates in more heavily Hispanic and higher household size communities. The demographics of complaints are quite different for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with much higher rates of complaints from Black and college educated areas compared to the Federal Trade Commission or Better Business Bureaus. I also find much higher rates of finance related complaints from Black communities across all reporting agencies. (JEL D18, H50, J10)

TI  - Relationships of West Greenland supraglacial melt-lakes with local climate and regional atmospheric circulation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Along the west-central Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) ablation zone, the time of annual maximum occurrence of surface melt-lakes, or peak lake period (PLP) averages June 18-July 3. This study combines atmospheric reanalysis and automatic weather station data from the Greenland Climate Network to assess the roles of synoptic circulation patterns and local climate variables, respectively, in the total melt-lake area and count in the Sermeq Kujalleq ablation region (SKAR) for the PLPs of 2000-2016. Melt-lake information is obtained from analysis of Landsat-7 images. Two surface climate parameters (e.g., temperature, incoming shortwave radiation) having a strong combined effect on melt-lake area in the SKAR are the June mean temperature, and May mean incoming solar radiation (r = .96). Incorporating the May insolation into a regression equation permits predictability of total melt-lake area for the study area into late June. June months classified as high melt correlate regionally with mid-tropospheric ridging, warm air advection, and reduced cloud cover, while low melt June months are associated with a trough, cold advection, and greater cloud amount. A localized feature that we found to be prevalent during the high-melt years are piteraq, or downsloping winds, which provide additional warming to the SKAR from adiabatic compression. Atmospheric circulation indices comprising the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAOI) teleconnection and Greenland blocking index (GBI) pattern augment the reanalysis gridded data. We find statistically significant correlations of the NAOI and GBI with melt-lake area (r = -.62 and r = .77, respectively). The correlations with melt-lake count however, are not significant; greater combined lake area and count tend to accompany the meridional mode of high amplitude Rossby waves and/or anti-cyclonic blocking in the Greenland sector. Determining the local and synoptic-scale atmospheric controls on supraglacial lake variability helps clarify the role of climate in the surface hydrology of the GrIS.

TI  - A novel voting ensemble model for spatial prediction of landslides using GIS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inherent complex topography and drastic weather patterns together have concocted various natural disasters worldwide. In difficult terrains such as those prevalent in the North-Eastern regions of India, coupled with the factors such as population explosion and improper land use, lead them to witness some of the world's most drastic landslides with an astonishing frequency, reckoning landslide susceptibility assessment crucial in such regions. This paper focuses on exploring a promising machine learning ensemble technique of Majority-based voting which has seldom been employed for landslide susceptibility assessment. The ensemble comprises Logistic Regression (LR), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) and Voting Feature Interval (VFI) to prepare landslide susceptibility zonation maps for the Brahmaputra valley region (Assam & Nagaland) and its close vicinity. In the first stage of the study, a landslide inventory for the area comprising 436 landslide locations was prepared in geographic information system (GIS), substantiated by news reports and remote sensing data. In the second stage, 16 landslide causative thematic maps including Elevation, Slope, Slope Aspect, General Curvature, Plan Curvature, Profile Curvature, Surface Roughness, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), Slope Length, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), Distance from Roads, Rivers, Faults and Railways were prepared. In the third stage, the landslide inventory was annexed with the causative factor maps to obtain a dataset comprising coordinates of the locations and the values of aforementioned causative factors on the corresponding coordinates. The proposed model was then trained and tested on the prepared dataset (70%:30% split). Finally, the efficiency of the new model was tested using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC). The validation results demonstrate the mettle of the proposed majority-based voting ensemble LR-GBDT-VFI (AUC: 0.98) against the conventional techniques such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, etc. Altogether, the study offers an approach with wide scope across the field of landslide hazard assessment.

In this paper, land use changes in Tianjin were studied using Thematic Mapper (TM) remote sensing images in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and Operational Land Imager (OLI) remote sensing image in 2015. Land use information was extracted using decision tree classification method based on CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm. This paper introduced land use intensity analysis to analyze its change intensity and stationarity, respectively at interval, category and transition levels. Based on the theory, new models were developed in the transition level to analyze land use change pattern. The analysis quantifies the contribution of a certain land categories to land use change during a specific time interval. The change of land use during 1995-2015 indicated that Tianjin experienced rapid urban development with the area of urban land increased by about 7.5%. This study provided a reference for the sustainable development of land use in Tianjin.

TI  - Evaluating the relative importance of northern African mineral dust sources using remote sensing
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern African mineral dust provides the Amazon Basin with essential nutrients during the boreal winter months, when the trajectory of the Saharan dust plume is towards South America. This process, however, is still poorly understood. There is little knowledge of where the dust is coming from, and, thus, little information regarding the concentration of nutrients in the dust. This information is vital to assess the impact it will have on the Amazon. In order to further our understanding of the problem, this study analyses northern African dust sources of the boreal winter dust seasons between the years 2015 and 2017. It utilises high spatio-temporal resolution remote sensing data from SEVIRI, MODIS, VIIRS, and Sentinel-2 to identify dust sources, classify them according to a geomorphic dust source scheme, and quantify the relative importance of source regions by calculating the total dust mass they produce. Results indicate that palaeolakes emit the most dust, with the Bodele Depression as the single largest dust source region. However, alluvial deposits also produce a substantial amount of dust. During the boreal winter dust seasons of 2015-2017, similar to 36 % of the total dust mass emitted from northern Africa was associated with alluvial deposits, yet this geomorphic category has been relatively understudied to date. Furthermore, sand deposits were found to produce relatively little dust, in contrast to the results of other recent studies.

TI  - Large contribution of meteorological factors to inter-decadal changes in regional aerosol optical depth
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) has become a crucial metric for assessing global climate change. Although global and regional AOD trends have been studied extensively, it remains unclear what factors are driving the inter-decadal variations in regional AOD and how to quantify the relative contribution of each dominant factor. This study used a long-term (1980-2016) aerosol dataset from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis, along with two satellite-based AOD datasets (MODIS/Terra and MISR) from 2001 to 2016, to investigate the long-term trends in global and regional aerosol loading. Statistical models based on emission factors and meteorological parameters were developed to identify the main factors driving the inter-decadal changes of regional AOD and to quantify their contribution. Evaluation of the MERRA-2 AOD with the ground-based measurements of AERONET indicated significant spatial agreement on the global scale (r = 0.85, root-mean-square error = 0.12, mean fractional error = 38.7 %, fractional gross error = 9.86 % and index of agreement = 0.94). However, when AOD observations from the China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network (CARSNET) were employed for independent verification, the results showed that MERRA-2 AODs generally underestimated CARSNET AODs in China (relative mean bias = 0.72 and fractional gross error = -34.3 %). In general, MERRA-2 was able to quantitatively reproduce the annual and seasonal AOD trends on both regional and global scales, as observed by MODIS/Terra, although some differences were found when compared to MISR. Over the 37-year period in this study, significant decreasing trends were observed over Europe and the eastern United States. In contrast, eastern China and southern Asia showed AOD increases, but the increasing trend of the former reversed sharply in the most recent decade. The statistical analyses suggested that the meteorological parameters explained a larger proportion of the AOD variability (20.4 %-72.8 %) over almost all regions of interest (ROIs) during 1980-2014 when compared with emission factors (0 %-56 %). Further analysis also showed that SO2 was the dominant emission factor, explaining 12.7 %-32.6 % of the variation in AOD over anthropogenic-aerosol-dominant regions, while black carbon or organic carbon was the leading factor over the biomass-burning-dominant (BBD) regions, contributing 24.0 %-27.7 % of the variation. Additionally, wind speed was found to be the leading meteorological parameter, explaining 11.8 %-30.3 % of the variance over the mineral-dust-dominant regions, while ambient humidity (including soil moisture and relative humidity) was the top meteorological parameter over the BBD regions, accounting for 11.7 %-35.5 % of the variation. The results of this study indicate that the variation in meteorological parameters is a key factor in determining the inter-decadal change in regional AOD.

TI  - Does use of axillary ultrasound in clinically node-negative patients receiving neo-adjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer lead to surgical overtreatment?
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for breast cancer has raised uncertainty regarding staging of the axilla, particularly for patients with a clinically negative axillary physical examination (PE). We sought to determine whether axillary ultrasound (AUS) prior to NAC to identify occult nodal disease is beneficial in patients with a clinically negative examination by evaluating the difference in nodal burden on final pathology in those with abnormal vs normal AUS. A retrospective review of an institutional cancer registry identified patients who underwent NAC for breast cancer and had a pretreatment AUS. Differences in the number of positive lymph nodes (PLN) in patients with a normal axillary PE and abnormal vs normal AUS prior to NAC were determined. A total of 120 patients who received NAC had a negative axillary PE prior to treatment. Fifty-three had an abnormal AUS and biopsy-proven lymph node (LN) involvement. In patients with an abnormal AUS, median number of PLNs at surgery was 1 vs 0 for those with a normal AUS (mean difference of 2.12, P < .0001). Of those patients with an abnormal AUS and biopsy-proven LN involvement, 87% underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and nearly half had no PLN on final pathology (N = 23, 43%). Patients with a clinically negative axilla and an abnormal AUS were more likely to have PLN at the time of surgery. However, almost half of those patients had no residual LN involvement. Routine AUS prior to NAC may lead to more extensive surgical management of the axilla.

TI  - The global aerosol-climate model ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3-Part 2: Cloud evaluation, aerosol radiative forcing, and climate sensitivity
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The global aerosol-climate model ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3 (E63H23) as well as the previous model versions ECHAM5.5-HAM2.0 (E55H20) and ECHAM6.1-HAM2.2 (E61H22) are evaluated using global observational datasets for clouds and precipitation. In E63H23, the amount of low clouds, the liquid and ice water path, and cloud radiative effects are more realistic than in previous model versions. E63H23 has a more physically based aerosol activation scheme, improvements in the cloud cover scheme, changes in the detrainment of convective clouds, changes in the sticking efficiency for the accretion of ice crystals by snow, consistent ice crystal shapes throughout the model, and changes in mixed-phase freezing; an inconsistency in ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) in cirrus clouds was also removed. Common biases in ECHAM and in E63H23 (and in previous ECHAM-HAM versions) are a cloud amount in stratocumulus regions that is too low and deep convective clouds over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that form too close to the continents (while tropical land precipitation is underestimated). There are indications that ICNCs are overestimated in E63H23.Since clouds are important for effective radiative forcing due to aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions (ERFari+aci) and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), differences in ERFari+aci and ECS between the model versions were also analyzed. ERFari+aci is weaker in E63H23 (-1.0 W m(-2)) than in E61H22 (-1.2 W m(-2)) (or E55H20; -1.1 W m(-2)). This is caused by the weaker shortwave ERFari+aci (a new aerosol activation scheme and sea salt emission parameterization in E63H23, more realistic simulation of cloud water) overcompensating for the weaker longwave ERFari+aci (removal of an inconsistency in ICNC in cirrus clouds in E61H22).The decrease in ECS in E63H23 (2.5 K) compared to E61H22 (2.8 K) is due to changes in the entrainment rate for shallow convection (affecting the cloud amount feedback) and a stronger cloud phase feedback.Experiments with minimum cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCmin) of 40 cm(-3) or 10 cm(-3) show that a higher value of CDNCmin reduces ERFari+aci as well as ECS in E63H23.

TI  - From Bastions to Models: <i>Deutsche Schulen in Den Niederlanden</i> as Tools of German Cultural Policy
T2  - DUTCH CROSSING-JOURNAL OF LOW COUNTRIES STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Successive German governments in the twentieth century used the system of German International Schools to achieve their cultural policy goals in the Netherlands. Prior to the Nazi assumption of power, the Weimar government and local German community leaders in the Netherlands saw the schools as bastions of German culture and as tools to prevent the 'Dutchification' of Germans living abroad. With Hitler's accession to the Chancellorship, the purpose of these schools changed to include the inculcation of a National Socialist and Germanic worldview among the students. Finally, with the German occupation during the Second World War, these schools, which the Nazi occupiers significantly expanded, were seen as models for the future development of Dutch education. Although the ultimate Nazi defeat limited the effect of these German International Schools upon the larger Dutch educational establishment, the changes the German Schools underwent in the 1930s were largely mirrored by Dutch institutions during the occupation. The German International Schools therefore stand as further evidence of the Nazis' larger designs for the Netherlands after the hoped-for German victory.

TI  - Exponentiation of conditional expectations under stochastic volatility
T2  - QUANTITATIVE FINANCE

AB  - We use the Ito Decomposition Formula (see Alos [A decomposition formula for option prices in the Heston model and applications to option pricing approximation. Finance Stoch., 2012, 16(3), 403-422]) to express certain conditional expectations as exponentials of iterated integrals. As one application, we compute an exact formal expression for the leverage swap for any stochastic volatility model expressed in forward variance form. As another, we show how to derive a smile expansion analogous to that of Bergomi and Guyon to all orders. Finally, we compute exact expressions under rough volatility, obtaining in particular the fractional Riccati equation for the rough Heston characteristic function. As a corollary, we compute a closed-form expression for the leverage swap in the rough Heston model which can be used for fast calibration.

TI  - Urban socio-ecological dynamics: applying the urban-rural gradient approach in a high Andean city
T2  - LANDSCAPE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban-rural dichotomy and the simple cause-effect relationship do not allow establishing specific criteria for territorial management from a socio-ecological perspective. The gradient approach could be a powerful tool to understand urban socio-ecological dynamics. This research applied a methodological protocol to obtain urban-rural gradients while considering the specific characteristics of a mid-size Andean city. To achieve this goal, a mixed classification process was applied to a Landsat 8 image. Subsequently, a factor analysis (FA) grouped 25 urbanisation variables. Finally, we applied agglomerative hierarchical clustering. FA established four factors that explained (72%) of the urbanisation metrics' variation. From this information, we obtained factor maps and a gradient map. The resulting map differentiated six gradients that contrast with the city's territorial planning based on the urban-rural dichotomy. This study is a starting point to apply the gradient approach in land-use management and urban ecology planning for Andean cities.

TI  - Snow Albedo Seasonality and Trend from MODIS Sensor and Ground Data at Johnsons Glacier, Livingston Island, Maritime Antarctica
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to investigate whether snow albedo seasonality and trend under all sky conditions at Johnsons Glacier (Livingston Island, Antarctica) can be tracked using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow albedo daily product MOD10A1. The time span is from December 2006 to February 2015. As the MOD10A1 snow albedo product has never been used in Antarctica before, we also assess the performance for the MOD10A1 cloud mask. The motivation for this work is the need for a description of snow albedo under all sky conditions (including overcast days) using satellite data with mid-spatial resolution. In-situ albedo was filtered with a 5-day windowed moving average, while the MOD10A1 data were filtered using a maximum filter. Both in-situ and MOD10A1 data follow an exponential decay during the melting season, with a maximum decay of 0.049/0.094 day(-1) (in-situ/MOD10A1) for the 2006-2007 season and a minimum of 0.016/0.016 day(-1) for the 2009-2010 season. The duration of the decay varies from 85 days (2007-2008) to 167 days (2013-2014). Regarding the albedo trend, both data sets exhibit a slight increase of albedo, which may be explained by an increase of snowfall along with a decrease of snowmelt in the study area. Annual albedo increases of 0.2% and 0.7% are obtained for in-situ and MOD10A1 data, respectively, which amount to respective increases of 2% and 6% in the period 2006-2015. We conclude that MOD10A1 can be used to characterize snow albedo seasonality and trend on Livingston Island when filtered with a maximum filter.

TI  - Assessment of CNN-Based Methods for Individual Tree Detection on Images Captured by RGB Cameras Attached to UAVs
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection and classification of tree species from remote sensing data were performed using mainly multispectral and hyperspectral images and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data. Despite the comparatively lower cost and higher spatial resolution, few studies focused on images captured by Red-Green-Blue (RGB) sensors. Besides, the recent years have witnessed an impressive progress of deep learning methods for object detection. Motivated by this scenario, we proposed and evaluated the usage of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods combined with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) high spatial resolution RGB imagery for the detection of law protected tree species. Three state-of-the-art object detection methods were evaluated: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), YOLOv3 and RetinaNet. A dataset was built to assess the selected methods, comprising 392 RBG images captured from August 2018 to February 2019, over a forested urban area in midwest Brazil. The target object is an important tree species threatened by extinction known as Dipteryx alata Vogel (Fabaceae). The experimental analysis delivered average precision around 92% with an associated processing times below 30 miliseconds.

TI  - Integrating Surface-Based Temperature and Vegetation Abundance Estimates into Land Cover Classifications for Conservation Efforts in Savanna Landscapes
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern African savannas are an important dryland ecosystem, as they account for up to 54% of the landscape, support a rich variety of biodiversity, and are areas of key landscape change. This paper aims to address the challenges of studying this highly gradient landscape with a grass-shrub-tree continuum. This study takes place in South Luangwa National Park (SLNP) in eastern Zambia. Discretely classifying land cover in savannas is notoriously difficult because vegetation species and structural groups may be very similar, giving off nearly indistinguishable spectral signatures. A support vector machine classification was tested and it produced an accuracy of only 34.48%. Therefore, we took a novel continuous approach in evaluating this change by coupling in situ data with Landsat-level normalized difference vegetation index data (NDVI, as a proxy for vegetation abundance) and blackbody surface temperature (BBST) data into a rule-based classification for November 2015 (wet season) that was 79.31% accurate. The resultant rule-based classification was used to extract mean Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI values by season over time from 2000 to 2016. This showed a distinct separation between each of the classes consistently over time, with woodland having the highest NDVI, followed by shrubland and then grassland, but an overall decrease in NDVI over time in all three classes. These changes may be due to a combination of precipitation, herbivory, fire, and humans. This study highlights the usefulness of a continuous time-series-based approach, which specifically integrates surface temperature and vegetation abundance-based NDVI data into a study of land cover and vegetation health for savanna landscapes, which will be useful for park managers and conservationists globally.

TI  - Mapping of spatial and temporal variation of water characteristics through satellite remote sensing in Lake Panguipulli, Chile
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Central-southern Chile is characterized by a series of large lakes that originate in the Andes Mountains. This region is facing increasing anthropogenic impact, which threatens the oligotrophic status of these lakes. While monitoring programs are often based on a limited spatial and temporal coverage, remote sensing offers promising tools for large-scale observations improving our capacity to study comprehensively indicators of lake properties. Seasonal trends (long-term means) and intra-lake variation of surface water temperature (SWF), turbidity and chlorophyll a in Lake Panguipulli were studied through satellite imagery from Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI (1998-2018: SWT, turbidity), and Sentinel-2A/B MSI (2016-2017; chlorophyll). Remotely sensed data were validated against in situ data from monitoring database. Satellite-derived SWT (representing the surface skin layer of water, socalled skin temperature) showed good similarity with in situ (bulk) temperature (RRMSD 0.17. R-2 = 0.86), although was somewhat lower (RMSD of 2.77 degrees C ; MBD of -2.10 degrees C . Seasonal long-term means of turbidity from satellite imagery corresponded to those from in situ data, while satellite-derived predictions (based on OC2v2 algorithm) overestimated chlorophyll a levels slightly in summer-spring. SWT ranged from 8.0 degrees C in winter to 17.5 degrees C in summer. Mean turbidity (1.6 FNU) and chlorophyll a (1.1 mu g L-1) levels were at their lowest in summer. Spatial and seasonal patterns reflected the bathymetry and previously described mixing patterns of this monomictic lake: warming of shallow bays in spring extended to wider area along with summer stratification period, while mixing of the water column was reflected in spatially more homogenous SWT in fall-winter. Spatial heterogeneity in summer was confirmed by a clear separation of different lake areas based on SWT, turbidity and chlorophyll a using 3-D plot. Mapping of spatial and seasonal variation using satellite imagery allowed identifying lake areas with different characteristics, improving strategies for water resource management.

AB  - Making the inevitability of mortality salient makes people more defensive about their self-esteem and worldviews. Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence point to a mediating role of arousal in this defensive process, but evidence from physiological measurement studies is scarce and inconclusive. The present study seeks to draw a comprehensive picture of how physiological arousal develops over time in the mortality salience (MS) paradigm, and whether contemplating one's mortality actually elicits more physiological arousal than reflecting on a death-unrelated aversive control topic. In a between-subjects design, participants were asked two open questions about their mortality or about dental pain. Cardiac, respiratory, and electrodermal indicators of arousal were measured both as participants provided written answers to the questions, and during a series of resting intervals surrounding the questions. A Bayes factor analysis indicated support for the hypothesis that the MS paradigm increases physiological arousal, both while answering the two open-ended questions and afterward. Regarding the MS versus dental pain comparison, the null hypothesis of no difference was supported for most analysis segments and signals. The results indicate that the arousal elicited by MS is not different from that elicited by dental pain salience. This speaks against the idea that worldview defense following MS occurs because MS produces higher physiological arousal. Of course, this finding does not rule the importance of other forms of arousal (i.e., subjective arousal) for MS effects.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-3A OLCI Products Derived Using the Case-2 Regional CoastColour Processor over the Baltic Sea
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the Level-2 products of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) data on Sentinel-3A are derived using the Case-2 Regional CoastColour (C2RCC) processor for the SentiNel Application Platform (SNAP) whilst adjusting the specific scatter of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) for the Baltic Sea in order to improve TSM retrieval. The remote sensing product kd_z90max (i.e., the depth of the water column from which 90% of the water-leaving irradiance are derived) from C2RCC-SNAP showed a good correlation with in situ Secchi depth (SD). Additionally, a regional in-water algorithm was applied to derive SD from the attenuation coefficient K-d(489) using a local algorithm. Furthermore, a regional in-water relationship between particle scatter and bench turbidity was applied to generate turbidity from the remote sensing product iop_bpart (i.e., the scattering coefficient of marine particles at 443 nm). The spectral shape of the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) data extracted from match-up stations was evaluated against reflectance data measured in situ by a tethered Attenuation Coefficient Sensor (TACCS) radiometer. The L2 products were evaluated against in situ data from several dedicated validation campaigns (2016-2018) in the NW Baltic proper. All derived L2 in-water products were statistically compared to in situ data and the results were also compared to results for MERIS validation from the literature and the current S3 Level-2 Water (L2W) standard processor from EUMETSAT. The Chl-a product showed a substantial improvement (MNB 21%, RMSE 88%, APD 96%, n = 27) compared to concentrations derived from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), with a strong underestimation of higher values. TSM performed within an error comparable to MERIS data with a mean normalized bias (MNB) 25%, root-mean square error (RMSE) 73%, average absolute percentage difference (APD) 63% n = 23). Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) absorption retrieval has also improved substantially when using the product iop_adg (i.e., the sum of organic detritus and Gelbstoff absorption at 443 nm) as a proxy (MNB 8%, RMSE 56%, APD 54%, n = 18). The local SD (MNB 6%, RMSE 62%, APD 60%, n = 35) and turbidity (MNB 3%, RMSE 35%, APD 34%, n = 29) algorithms showed very good agreement with in situ data. We recommend the use of the SNAP C2RCC with regionally adjusted TSM-specific scatter for water product retrieval as well as the regional turbidity algorithm for Baltic Sea monitoring. Besides documenting the evaluation of the C2RCC processor, this paper may also act as a handbook on the validation of Ocean Colour data.

TI  - Optical design of X-ray focusing telescope
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - X-ray focusing telescope is one of the most important equipment for X-ray space observation, which is designed based on the grazing incidence principle. The purpose of x-ray observation is to detect the black holes of various sizes in outer space, and the data obtained by X-ray telescope conduces to investigating the basic physical law under the condition of extreme gravity and magnetic field, In this article, multi-layer telescope is designed to satisfy the demand for enhanced X-ray timing and polarimetry mission. in which the telescope is designed based on Wolter-I telescope. The Monte Carlo method and power spectral density are used when the relationship between mirror profile and roughness with angular resolution is investigated. We analyze the relationship between angular resolution and mirror profile, and the result shows that the higher mirror profile possesses higher angular resolution. When the root mean square(RMS) of mirror profile is 0.04 mu m, PV is 0.2 mu m and roughness is 0.4 nm, the mirror angular resolution is 6.3 '' and it will change to 30.6 '' when the RMS of mirror profile is 0.2 mu m, PV is 1 mu m and roughness is 0.4 nm. The angular resolution out of focus is also investigated in this article, and the more defocusing amount gives rise to the worse angular resolution because defocusing spot will be larger than that of focal plane. So the maximum defocusing amount of 5 mm is required when the focal plane detector is installed. The relationship between effective area with film structure and layers number is also investigated. The film with Au mixed with C has a higher reflectivity than the film with only Au, because the mixed film will generate an interference effect and enhance the intensity of reflecting X-ray. When the telescope layers increase, the effective area and telescope weight are both improved, the requirement for effective area of satellite can be satisfied when the number of nesting layers is 45. However, when the number of nesting layers further increase, the effective area will be improved with a low speed, but the weight of telescope will increase with a high speed. The field of view of this telescope is 16', which is more than the required value of 12'. Finally, the X-ray focusing telescope with 5.25 m focal length, 45 nesting layers, effective area 842 cm(2) at 2 keV, 563 cm(2) at 6 keV is obtained.

TI  - Validation of the cotton crop coefficient estimation model based on Sentinel-2 imagery and eddy covariance measurements
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - New technologies are needed in order to improve water use efficiency and aid irrigation management. To meet this challenge, crop coefficient (K-c) estimation models based on remotely sensed crop reflectance were developed using new public domain satellite imagery. Spectral modeling of K-c is possible due to the high correlations between K-c and the crop phenologic development and spectral reflectance. In this study, cotton evapotranspiration was measured in the field during two seasons using the eddy covariance method. K-c was estimated as the ratio between reference evapotranspiration and the measured cotton evapotranspiration. In addition, a time series of Sentinel-2 imagery was processed to produce 21 vegetation indices based on the sensor's unique spectral bands. Empirical K-c - vegetation index models were derived and ranked according to their prediction error. This was performed for each season separately and in addition cross-validation between the seasons was performed. In accordance with previous findings, we found strong correlations between K-c and indices that are based on the red and red-edge bands (MTCI, REP, and S2REP). In addition, other spectral indices that are strongly correlated to Kc were identified. The Merris Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) had the closest relation to K-c (R-2 > 0.91). It was also demonstrated that the model developed for the first season can be successfully applied to the second season data to predict K-c, and vice-versa with RMSE < 0.1. Therefore this study cross-validates the models for estimating cotton water consumption using satellite imagery that is available at no cost at a temporal resolution of five days and a spatial resolution of 10-20 m. The confidence inspired by this validation sets the scene for near-real-time irrigation decision support systems.

TI  - Urban Design Factors Influencing Surface Urban Heat Island in the High-Density City of Guangzhou Based on the Local Climate Zone
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface urban heat island (SUHI) depicts the deteriorating thermal environment in high-density cities and local climate zone (LCZ) classification provides a universal protocol for SUHI identification. In this study, taking the central urbanized area of Guangzhou in the humid subtropical region of China as the study area, the maps or images of LCZ, land surface temperature, SUHI, and urban design factors were achieved using Landsat satellite data, GIS database, and a series of retrieval and classification algorithms, and the urban design factors influencing SUHI were investigated based on 625 samples of LCZs. The results show that on the 18 September 2016 at the local time of 10:51 a.m., the land surface temperature (LST) varied greatly from 26 degrees C to 40 degrees C and the SUHI changed with a wide range of -6 degrees C to 8 degrees C in the LCZs of the study area. Seven and five urban design factors influencing the summer daytime SUHI were identified for the two dominant LCZs of LCZs 1-5 (LCZ 1 to LCZ 5) and the mixed LCZ (containing at least three types of LCZs), respectively, in which vegetation cover ratio, floor area ratio, ground emissivity, and complete surface area ratio showed negative correlations and building density showed positive correlations. The summer daytime SUHI prediction models were obtained by using the step-wise multiple linear regression, with the performance of R-2 of 0.774, RMSE of 0.95 degrees C, and the d value of 0.91 for the model of LCZs 1-5, and the values of 0.819, 0.81 degrees C, and 0.94 for the model of the mixed LCZ, indicating that the models can effectively predict the changes of SUHI with LCZs. This study presents a methodology to efficiently achieve a large sample of SUHI and urban design factors of LCZs, and provides information beneficial to the urban designs and regenerations in high-density cities.

TI  - Determinants of long-lasting insecticidal net ownership and utilization in malaria transmission regions: evidence from Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Surveys
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) were first introduced in 2010 as a vector control intervention, to complement indoor residual spraying, to reduce malaria transmission in Zimbabwe. The objective of this study was to investigate factors that were associated with LLIN ownership and utilization among households in malaria transmission regions of Zimbabwe. Methods A secondary analysis of cross sectional data from the Zimbabwe demographic and health survey (ZDHS) conducted in 2010 and 2015 surveys round was conducted. The analysis used household-level datasets from across the country to generate evidence for the study. Univariate analysis was used to yield descriptive statistics. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to calculate wealth quintiles. Binary logistic regression approach was used to identify determinants of LLIN ownership and utilization after controlling for other factors. Data analyses were conducted using STATA version 14 software. Results There were no major changes in demographic characteristics of households sampled between 2010 and 2015 survey cycles. LLIN ownership increased significantly by 42 percentage points from 2010 to 2015. There was a tremendous increase in universal coverage of LLINs between 2010 and 2015. The overall utilization levels of LLINs among children under-5 years decreased by 11 percentage points between 2010 and 2015. LLIN usage amongst households followed the same trend with that of the under-fives. Using logistic regression model for 2015 data, region/province, type of place of residence, availability of electricity, radio, roof type, gender of head of household, having telephone, type of cooking fuel, presence of mobile phone, owning a bank account, IRS spraying in the previous 12 months, wealth index, and satellite television decorder were independently associated with net ownership among households. Type of place of residence, age of household head, type of cooking fuel, IRS in previous 12 months, and pregnancy were associated with LLIN utilization. Conclusion This study revealed increasing LLIN coverage and low usage in malaria-transmission regions of Zimbabwe. Strengthening of LLIN campaigns, social behaviour change communication (SBCC) interventions and programme routine monitoring are recommended.

TI  - Identifying change agent types and its implications for corporate sustainability integration based on worldviews and contextual factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Change agents for Corporate Sustainability (CS) play an important role for companies when integrating CS into their business activities. While change agents can be differentiated by their worldviews, little is known about the contextual factors influencing their success in supporting CS integration. By proposing and illustrating an analytical model based on contextual factors of CS integration and change agents' worldviews, this paper contributes to the understanding of their influence on CS integration. Through a case study we find that change agents show a worldview profile rather than a specific worldview and that whether a worldview is supportive for CS integration depends on the specific context. We conclude that the analytical model contributes to the understanding of the individual and group level of CS integration. When discussed with company representatives, the outcomes of the application of the model could contribute to improve the identification of key individuals to support CS integration activities.

TI  - Dynamics of evapotranspiration over a non-irrigated alfalfa field in the Southern Great Plains of the United States
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately quantifying the dynamics of evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial for efficient water management and improved water use efficiency. However, details on the magnitudes and annual dynamics of ET with respect to environmental/biophysical factors and harvesting of hay in non-irrigated alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) are lacking. Using the eddy covariance (EC) technique, daily magnitudes and seasonal/annual dynamics and budgets of ET were quantified from April 2016 to May 2018 over a non-irrigated alfalfa field in central Oklahoma, USA. The field was harvested periodically for hay, and cumulative dry forage yield was approximately 7.5 and 10 t ha(-1) in 2016 (dry year) and 2017 (wet year), respectively. Daily ET reached up to 6.9mm d(-1) and 8-day average ET reached up to 5.64mm d(-1). Cumulative seasonal (April-October) ET was 652mm (similar to 1.3 times of precipitation) in 2016 and 734mm (similar to 0.8 times of precipitation) in 2017. Annual ET in 2017 was similar to 900mm (similar to 0.8 times of annual precipitation). Optimum air temperature (T-a) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) for ET were approximately 30 degrees C and 3 kPa, respectively. Higher forage production was associated with a greater increase (similar to 22%) in carbon uptake (gross primary production, GPP) than ET (similar to 13%) in 2017 compared to 2016. Consequently, ecosystem water use efficiency (EWUE) at the seasonal scale (seasonal sums of GPP to ET) was 2.38 and 2.57 g C mm(-1) ET in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Despite strong correspondence (R-2 = 0.73) between EC-measured ET and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived ET (ETMOD16), the standard ETMOD16 product underestimated ET by 36% compared to EC-measured ET. The MODIS-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) explained 83% of variations in alfalfa ET, indicating the potential of integrating remote sensing observations and climate data to extrapolate site-level alfalfa ET at larger areas.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite launched by the China Academy of Space Technology is under continuous operating mode at C-band since September 2016. The main objective of this study was to present a preliminary evaluation of GF-3 quad-polarized SAR imagery for protected wetland classification. Four scenes of GF-3 quad-polarized SAR imageries were collected in this study and analyzed systematically. Besides, the GF-2 optical imagery and in situ survey results were also collocated as reference data. It was verified that the polarized features including double bounce scattering component P-dbl, odd bounce scattering component P-odd, and volume scattering component P-vol from Freeman decomposition algorithm were well applied in distinguishing typical coverage of Longbao protected plateau wetland. In consideration of robustness of classifier, the method of Maximum Likelihood Classification was investigated for classification based on selected polarized features. The Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy of classification mapping are 0.75 and 82.16%, respectively, which revealed that the GF-3 quad-polarized SAR can provide a satisfying mapping for classification of Longbao protected plateau wetland.

T2  - Ugeskrift for laeger
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - This review summarises the current guidelines for vulva cancer in Denmark. Vulva cancer is a rare disease. The diagnosis is often delayed, which results in large tumours and regional spread. The most important prognostic factor is inguinal lymph node metastases. Staging and treatment is centralised to two hospitals. Primary treatment is wide local excision combined with removal of either inguinal sentinel nodes or lymphadenectomy. Treatment is associated with considerable morbidity, and supportive care is often necessary. Local curable recurrences are common. Relapses in the groin are associated with a poor prognosis. Thus, long term follow-up is essential. *) On behalf of Dansk Gynakologisk Cancer Gruppe for vulvacancer.

TI  - Gender differences among Veterans with alcohol use disorder nationally in the Veterans Health Administration
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Alcohol use among women is increasing relative to men but no study has compared rates and characteristics of women with alcohol use disorder (AUD) to men among Veterans Health Administration (VHA) service users. To compare male and female VHA service users on rates of AUD, and among those with AUD, on sociodemographic characteristics, medical and physical comorbidities, and service and medication use national VHA data from fiscal year (FY) 2012 were used to identify Veterans diagnosed with AUD. Bivariate analyses evaluate gender differences in: sociodemographic characteristics; comorbid medical and psychiatric diagnoses; service use and psychotropic prescription fills. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression was used to identify a parsimonious set of differences. About 13,797 of all 349,430 women served by VHA in FY 2012 (3.94%) were diagnosed with AUD as compared to 331,407 of 5,102,877 men (6.50%) for a risk ratio of 0.608 for AUD among women. Women were younger, more likely to have served in recent Middle East conflicts and had more comorbid psychiatric and substance use diagnoses than men. They filled fewer psychotropic prescriptions (after taking greater number of psychiatric diagnoses in to account), but were more likely to fill a prescription for naltrexone than men. Women had fewer comorbid medical diagnoses than men. Women Veterans with an AUD have higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities than men, highlighting the need for better integration of treatment for AUD and comorbid psychiatric conditions, and suggesting different pathways and potential interventions for AUD in women.

TI  - Monitoring and analysis of the expansion of the Ajmr Port, Davao City, Philippines using multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Ports have been built or expanded in a number of countries to cater to increasing maritime trade in the 21st century. Port expansion is associated with economic and environmental impacts on the local and regional scales, and these impacts can be studied using remote sensing. The present study presents new results from multi-source remote sensing monitoring of the Ajmr Port expansion. An analysis of land use and vegetation coverage at the port is used to monitor the impact of port construction on the local ecology, while changes in roads, buildings, and lights are used to monitor the economic impact. The results show that: (1) After nine years of expansion, the port area has gradually expanded from the central to the southern coastal area, with an increase of 21.68 hectares during the expansion period. After the expansion, the area of builidings and construction in the study area increased significantly, while the area of water and green areas decreased significantly, indicating that the port construction changed the land use structure of the area. (2) From the perspective of vegetation coverage, the vegetation coverage within 5 km from the port is in good condition. After 9 years, the vegetation coverage in the region between 0.6 and 1 increased from 43.71% to 44.25%, reflecting the higher overall greening level in the region. (3) By analyzing the increase in roads and buildings, it can be seen that the port's comprehensive transportation capacity has improved, the population of the region has increased significantly. As the scale of construction has been continuously expanded, the prosperity as increased. (4) By analyzing the changes in the light index, the light data from the northeast to the southwest in the region is very obvious, and it is clearly located along the coast, indicating that the economic development of the coastal zone is faster than other regions, and the coastal region has promoted the development of the inland region.

TI  - Comparative analysis of four semi-analytical models for estimating chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration in case-2 waters using field hyperspectral reflectance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing can capture the complicated and variable characteristics of inland waters; thus, it is suited for the water quality assessment of Case-2 waters, and it has the potential to attain high estimation accuracy. In the present study, four improved models adapted from published approaches (three-band index, Delta phi, BNDBI and TCARI) were investigated to estimate chlorophyll-a (chl-a) for the case of Dianshan Lake, China. Calibration and validation were provided from in situ measured chl-a and field hyperspectral measurements. The improved three-band (ITB) model, Delta phi model, and BNDBI model yielded satisfactory results and enabled the estimation of chl-a for inland Case-2 waters with coefficients of determination (R-2) reaching 0.75, 0.76, and 0.86, respectively. In particular, the TCARI/OSAVI model presented the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.94) compared to the other models. All of the results provide strong evidence that the hyperspectral models presented in this paper are promising and applicable to estimate chl-a in eutrophic inland Case-2 waters.

TI  - Estimating daily streamflow in the Congo Basin using satellite-derived data and a semi-distributed hydrological model
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of remotely-sensed data for hydrological modeling of the Congo Basin is presented. Satellite-derived data, including TRMM precipitation, are used as inputs to drive the USGS Geospatial Streamflow Model (GeoSFM) to estimate daily river discharge over the basin from 1998 to 2012. Physically-based parameterization was augmented with a spatially-distributed calibration that enables GeoSFM to simulate hydrological processes such as the slowing effect of the Cuvette Centrale. The resulting simulated long-term mean of daily flows and the observed flow at the Kinshasa gauge were comparable (40 631 and 40 638 m(3)/s respectively), in the 7-year validation period (2004-2010), with no significant bias and a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient of 0.70. Modeled daily flows and aggregated monthly river outflows (compared to historical averages) for additional sites confirm the model reliability in capturing flow timing and seasonality across the basin, but sometimes fails to accurately predict flow magnitude. The results of this model can be useful in research and decision-making contexts and validate the application of satellite-based hydrological models driven for large, data-scarce river systems such as the Congo.

TI  - Hope, political imagination, and agency in Marxism and beyond: Explicating the transformative worldview and ethico-ontoepistemology
T2  - EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the sociopolitical crisis and turmoil in the world today, there is a great need for philosophical and sociocultural critiques that are not only concerned with deconstructing the present and the past but also with offering forward-looking, radical solutions to the problems and challenges we face. Drastic times call for drastic measures, including in exploring and advancing a flagrantly partisan scholarship with explicitly transformative activist agendas of strengthening the public and personal agency needed to constrain capital for the sake of social and economic justice. The argument advanced in this article is that Marxism - reinvigorated, re-envisioned and infused with insights from recent scholarship in feminism, critical pedagogy, cultural-historical and critical race theories, and new materialism, among others - can offer a new worldview in which political imagination and other phenomena of human subjectivity find their due, that is, central and formative place to thus allow for the advancement of research with activist agendas as a form of resistance. In utilizing such a worldview, research and theoretical constructions can break away from the ethos of adaptation and instead to actively strive for social transformation based in a radical reworking of the status and role of political imagination and associated notions of agency, hope, and commitment.

TI  - Hospital and economic burden of influenza-like illness and lower respiratory tract infection in adults ≥50 years-old
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. The study assessed the health and economic burden of ILI and LRTI according to age and comorbidities, since available evidence is limited and heterogeneous. Method The prevalence of comorbidities, the seasonal incidence rates and the mean and per capita direct costs of ED accesses for ILI/LRTI, whether followed by hospitalization or not, recorded in adults aged >= 50 years over the last 6 years, in the referral hospitals located in the Genoese metropolitan area (Liguria, Italy) where the syndromic surveillance system is active, were evaluated through a retrospective observational study. Comorbidities were estimated through the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse that integrates multiple Medicare data sources. A comparison with the administrative healthcare International Classification of Diseases-9th revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)-based data was also conducted. Results The prevalence of subjects with >= 1 comorbidity ranged from 23.49 to 59.92%. The most prevalent all-age comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The overall ILI/LRTI incidence rate was 6.73/1000 person-years, almost double the value derived from routine data, and increased with age. The highest rates were observed in patients with renal failure and bronchopneumopathies. The mean cost of ED accesses/hospitalization for ILI/LRTI was euro3353 and was almost twice as high in the >= 85 years as in the youngest age-group. The highest mean costs were observed in patients with renal failure and cancer. The per capita costs increased from euro4 to euro71 with age, and were highest in patients with renal failure and bronchopneumopathy. Conclusion The burden of ILIs/LRTIs in terms of ED accesses and hospitalizations in adults aged >= 50 years is heavy, and is related to increasing age and, especially, to specific comorbidities. These results could contribute to revising age- and risk-based anti-influenza and -pneumococcus immunization strategies.

TI  - Dynamic changes and driving factors of wetlands in Inner Mongolia Plateau, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are one of the most critical resources in Inner Mongolia Plateau. However, the region has experienced severe wetland loss in the context of global change. To quantify the dynamic change and the related driving forces, we extracted wetland information using multi-temporal Landsat images between 1993 and 2013 using ArcGIS platform and man machine interactive interpretation. Dynamically changing characteristics for the past 20 years were analyzed, including wetland types and spatial distribution patterns of the wetlands in Inner Mongolia. We also performed correlation analysis and generalized linear models to quantify the contribution of natural and human factors to the changes in natural wetland area. Our results indicated that the total area of wetlands was 42421.2 km(2) in 1993, and decreased to 38912.4 km(2) in 2013, a decline ratio of 8.3%. Meanwhile, all types of wetlands showed a trend of transformation into non-wetlands. Anthropogenic factors led to the loss of natural wetlands in Inner Mongolia. In grasslands, mining coal was the dominant driver for natural wetland loss, while in arable lands, agricultural encroachment and irrigation were the primary driving forces. These findings can provide meaningful information for improving sustainable wetlands management strategies according to local conditions in different sub-regions.

TI  - Entangled Animisms Whakaaro and dialogue in the artwork of Shannon Te Ao
T2  - PERFORMANCE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Inspired by the artworks of Shannon Te Ao to think through the problematic term 'animism', this article explores a Maori cosmological worldview (Te Ao Maori) especially with regard to the Maori faculty of whakaaro (thought or thinking) as well as exploring language and its utterance (korero). Shannon Te Ao recites on a cosmic level with ancestors, animals, plants and us, revealing non-anthropocentric rights and agency. Writing about animism from the shores of Aotearoa New Zealand creates compelling critique of historical ethnographic animism with its racist and scientifically driven evolutionist roots. From this vantage point, the work of quantum physicist David Bohm on quantum discontinuity and entanglement leads to a form of dialogue that resonates with Maori cosmologies and ontologies. Significantly, the nature of these 'entangled animisms' means resisting hierarchies and power dynamics at work between indigenous Maori worldviews and Euro-American concepts.

TI  - Jitter compensation of ZiYuan-3 satellite imagery based on object point coincidence
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite jitter is a very important factor that affects the sensor orientation of ZiYuan-3 imagery based on a rational function model (RFM). The conventional affine transformation model is unable to compensate such periodic jitters. The sensor orientation accuracy is thereby worse than expected. To eliminate the influence of jitters and improve the orientation accuracy, a feasible jitter compensation method for ZiYuan-3 imagery based on object point coincidence is presented in this study. In this method, no actual ground control points (AGCPs) are required to estimate the jitter compensation parameters. First, numerous virtual object points are projected onto the image by using the RFM. Then, the residual errors between the image-space coordinates of the projected and corresponding points are used to detect the satellite jitters. Finally, two sinusoidal functions are used to model and compensate the jitters. Experimental results of the three ZiYuan-3 satellite images show that before the jitter compensation, the residual errors of the independent check points obviously show a sinusoidal pattern. These periodic errors cannot be effectively compensated by the affine transformation model even if the number of AGCPs is increased from 4 to 16. After the jitters are compensated with the estimated sinusoidal coefficients, the influence of jitters can be eliminated. The sensor orientation accuracies of the three images reach 0.852 pixels, 0.798 pixels, and 0.921 pixels, which are respectively 49.7%, 55.1%, 65.7% better than those achieved before the jitter compensation.

TI  - Modeling the emergence of migratory corridors and foraging hot spots of the green sea turtle
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental factors shape the spatial distribution and dynamics of populations. Understanding how these factors interact with movement behavior is critical for efficient conservation, in particular for migratory species. Adult female green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas, migrate between foraging and nesting sites that are generally separated by thousands of kilometers. As an emblematic endangered species, green turtles have been intensively studied, with a focus on nesting, migration, and foraging. Nevertheless, few attempts integrated these behaviors and their trade-offs by considering the spatial configurations of foraging and nesting grounds as well as environmental heterogeneity like oceanic currents and food distribution. We developed an individual-based model to investigate the impact of local environmental conditions on emerging migratory corridors and reproductive output and to thereby identify conservation priority sites. The model integrates movement, nesting, and foraging behavior. Despite being largely conceptual, the model captured realistic movement patterns which confirm field studies. The spatial distribution of migratory corridors and foraging hot spots was mostly constrained by features of the regional landscape, such as nesting site locations, distribution of feeding patches, and oceanic currents. These constraints also explained the mixing patterns in regional forager communities. By implementing alternative decision strategies of the turtles, we found that foraging site fidelity and nesting investment, two characteristics of green turtles' biology, are favorable strategies under unpredictable environmental conditions affecting their habitats. Based on our results, we propose specific guidelines for the regional conservation of green turtles as well as future research suggestions advancing spatial ecology of sea turtles. Being implemented in an easy to learn open-source software, our model can coevolve with the collection and analysis of new data on energy budget and movement into a generic tool for sea turtle research and conservation. Our modeling approach could also be useful for supporting the conservation of other migratory marine animals.

TI  - Comparing Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI in soil salinity detection: a case study of agricultural lands in coastal North Carolina
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the first comparison of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) in identifying soil salinity using soil physiochemical, spectral, statistical, and image analysis techniques. By the end of the century, intermediate sea level rise scenarios project approximately 1.3 meters of sea level rise along the coast of the southeastern United States. One of the most vulnerable areas is Hyde County, North Carolina, where 1140 km(2) of agricultural lands are being salinized, endangering 4,200 people and $40 million USD of property. To determine the best multispectral sensor to map the extent of salinization, this study compared the feasibility of OLI and MSI to estimate electrical conductivity (EC). The EC of field samples were correlated with handheld spectrometer spectra resampled into multispectral sensor bands. Using an iterative ordinary least squares regression, it was found that EC was sensitive to OLI bands 2 (452nm - 512nm) and 4 (636nm - 673nm) and MSI bands 2 (457.5nm - 522.5nm) and 4 (650nm - 680nm). Respectively, the R-Adj(2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.04-0.54 and 1.15 for OLI, and 0.05-0.67 and 1.17 for MSI, suggests that the two sensors have similar salinity modelling skill. The extracted saline soils make up approximately 1,703hectares for OLI and 118hectares for MSI, indicating overestimation from the OLI image due to its coarser spatial resolution. Additionally, field samples indicate that nearby vegetated land is saline, indicating an underestimation of total impacted land. As sea levels rise, accurately monitoring soil salinization will be critical to protecting coastal agricultural lands. MSI's spatial and temporal resolution makes it superior to OLI for salinity tracking though they have roughly equivalent spectral resolutions. This study demonstrates that visible spectral bands are sensitive to soil salinity with the Blue and Red spectral ranges producing the highest model accuracy; however, the low accuracies for both sensors indicate the need of narrowband sensors. The HyspIRI to be launched in the early 2020s by NASA may provide ideal data source in soil salinity studies.

TI  - Becoming Doll Radical objectification in the performance of Freddie Mercado
T2  - PERFORMANCE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article looks at how Puerto Rican visual artist Freddie Mercado, in his performances, uses dolls as an agentic catalyst for contesting otherness. Influenced by an Afro-Caribbean worldview, his methods for treating and relating to dolls are grounded in decolonial relations and spiritual beliefs that have survived past and current colonization processes in Puerto Rico. Mercado mirrors himself in the so-called inanimate, rendering it alive as a possibility of constant metamorphosis as well as using it as a tactics for survival. The identification process in Mercado is both a creative act and a transformative path. Mercado's dolls allow for a fluidity of identity to emerge through a performative repertoire. By 'becoming doll' Mercado addresses, directly, the violence inflicted on Puerto Rican bodies by colonial objectification strategies, while, at the same time, refocusing the fixity of the Western subject--object relation.

TI  - 'African dances are valid knowledge': Dance teachers' de/construction of meanings from cultural heritage dances in Uganda
T2  - RESEARCH IN DANCE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - What constitutes African dances as valid knowledge? Do the learning processes of African dances in local communities entail rational consciousness and epistemological interpretations of the learner? How do the processes of dance practice double as frameworks of construction of meanings? The foregoing questions provided parameters for critical examination of pedagogy of cultural heritage dances as epistemological domains. Drawing on the stories, reflections, and practices of teachers of cultural heritage dances in nonacademic settings in central Uganda, the article reveals the different mechanisms through which these dance teachers acquired competences in content knowledge of the dances. The theory of constructivism is engaged to illuminate the content knowledge of the dances as a constructed reality that is anchored in the Afrocentric worldview. The individual learners claim agency in embodied, reflective, participatory, and communalized learning processes as knowers, thinkers, doers, and collaborators. Immersion into pedagogic processes cultivates interface with dance as an object and subject of knowledge. The article offers insights into the complexities entailed in pedagogic processes of African dances as epistemological and ontological foundation of human life and experience. This analysis critiques reductionist notions that objectify, fetishize and exoticize the learning processes of African dances as just instinctive, innate, and imitative.

TI  - Unsupervised evaluation-based region merging for high resolution remote sensing image segmentation
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image segmentation has a remarkable influence on the classification accuracy of object-based image analysis. Accordingly, how to raise the performance of remote sensing image segmentation is a key issue. However, this is challenging, primarily because it is difficult to avoid over-segmentation errors (OSE) and under-segmentation errors (USE). To solve this problem, this article presents a new segmentation technique by fusing a region merging method with an unsupervised segmentation evaluation technique called under- and over-segmentation aware (UOA), which is improved by using edge information. Edge information is also used to construct the merging criterion of the proposed approach. To validate the new segmentation scheme, five scenes of high resolution images acquired by Gaofen-2 and Ziyuan-3 multispectral sensors are chosen for the experiment. Quantitative evaluation metrics are employed in the experiment. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm obtains the lowest total error (TE) values for all test images (0.3791, 0.1434, 0.7601, 0.7569, 0.3169 for the first, second, third, fourth, fifth image, respectively; these values are averagely 0.1139 lower than the counterparts of the other methods), as compared to six state-of-the-art region merging-based segmentation approaches, including hybrid region merging, hierarchical segmentation, scale-variable region merging, size-constrained region merging with edge penalty, region merging guided by priority, and region merging combined with the original UOA. Moreover, the performance of the proposed method is better for artificial-object-dominant scenes than the ones mainly covering natural geo-objects.

TI  - Global Britain and the Narrative of Empire
T2  - POLITICAL QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2016, the UK government has outlined plans for 'Global Britain' as a framework for post-Brexit foreign policy. Some criticise the idea as a vision of 'Empire 2.0', but it is rarely made clear exactly what form it takes or what its wider political implications are. This article argues that Global Britain constitutes not just an idea or a slogan, but a foreign policy narrative and, more specifically, the narrative of empire. Indeed, to appear reasonable its grand ambitions require pre-existing knowledges of past imperial 'successes' and accepting images of empire among the British public. Yet Global Britain lacks efficacy: as a domestic rather than an international narrative, by being inherently regressive in its worldview, and for contradicting the preferences of international partners on which the UK heavily relies. These narrative flaws, it is argued, make Global Britain an actively problematic, rather than merely ineffective, component of UK foreign policy.

TI  - Potential of the remotely-derived products in monitoring ecosystem water use efficiency across grasslands in Northern China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) has been recognized as a crucial parameter to describe the interrelationship between carbon and water cycling. Quantitative assessment to spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystem WUE in grasslands is of vital importance, given the large proportion of grasslands on the Earth's land surface. Through continuous eddy covariance (EC) measurements at seven grassland sites in Northern China, this study examined the seasonal and interannual variations of gross primary production (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET) and WUE across four typical grassland ecosystems along a water availability gradient. The highest WUE occurred at the alpine meadow ecosystem with 1.45g C kg(-1) H2O, followed by the temperate meadow steppe and the typical steppe. The desert steppe had the lowest WUE with 0.53g C kg(-1) H2O. In addition, the remotely-derived WUE estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS) GPP and ET products, were used to characterize the variability in tower-based WUE over these grassland ecosystems. Generally, WUEBESS had more consistent seasonal trajectories with WUEEC at most grassland sites compared to the variability of WUEMOD. The highest square of Pearson correlation coefficient (R-2) values of WUEBESS were achieved in the alpine meadow sites (approximately 0.83), as well as the lowest root mean square error (RMSE), which ranged from 0.21 to 0.37g C kg(-1) H2O. However, the performances of both WUEBESS and WUEMOD lacked skills at the desert steppe sites which had low vegetation productivity. These remotely-derived WUE products, particularly the WUEMOD, tended to overestimate the annual mean WUEEC across these grassland types, with exception of the alpine meadow sites, where exhibited good performance. The underlying reasons for the biases of the MODIS- and BESS-based products in capturing the seasonal dynamics of grassland WUE were also examined. In general, GPP(MOD) performed better than GPP(BESS) over an 8-day period, whereas ETBESS had a higher accuracy compared to ETMOD across the different grassland ecosystems. Our analyses may be useful for improving the remote sensing-based GPP and ET products to accurately monitor the ecosystem WUE patterns of grasslands over large areas.

TI  - Comparisons of three recent moderate resolution African land cover datasets: CGLS-LC100, ESA-S2-LC20, and FROM-GLC-Africa30
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and up-to-date land use land cover (LULC) mapping has long been a challenge in Africa. Recently, three LULC maps with moderate spatial resolution (20 m to 100 m) have been developed using multiple Earth observation datasets for 2015-2016 for the whole continent, which provide unprecedented spatial detail of the land surface for Africa. This study aimed to compare these three recent African LULC maps (i.e. the Copernicus Global Land Service Land Cover (CGLS-LC100, 100 m), European Space Agency Sentinel-2A Land Cover (ESA-S2-LC20, 20 m) and Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover for Africa version 2 (FROM-GLC-Africa30, 30 m)) using a validation sample set and statistics from the FAO. The results indicated that the accuracy of the three datasets was unevenly distributed in spatial extent and area estimation. All the three datasets achieve an accuracy of above 60% and the fraction layer of CGLS-LC100 showed the best consistency with FAO statistics in the area. However, great disagreement in spatial details was found among three products, with 43.12% of the total area in Africa was in low agreement. The LULC mapping regions with the highest uncertainty were southeast Africa, the Sahel region and the Eastern Africa Plateau. Uncertainty was most closely related to elevation and precipitation changes along latitude/longitude.

TI  - Estimation of Level and Deformed First-Year Sea Ice Surface Roughness in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago from C- and L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Utilizing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to understand and map sea ice roughness is an active area of research. An object-based image analysis is here used to quantitatively link the winter first-year sea ice surface roughness to C-band RADARSAT-2 and L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 SAR backscatter measured in the Canadian Arctic. Results indicate: (1) C-band HH-polarization backscatter is correlated with roughness (r = 0.86) at a shallow incidence angle; and (2) L-band HH- and VV-polarization backscatter is correlated with roughness (r = 0.82) at a shallow incidence angle. Retrieval models for surface roughness are developed and applied to the imagery to demonstrate the potential of SAR for mapping deformation with a best case RMSE of 5 mm. Additionally, strong correlations between C- and L-band SAR backscatter acquired during the advanced melt period, and the winter measured surface roughness, are observed. These results are discussed in the context of SAR potentially providing significant sea ice structural information despite the occurrence of melt and presence of surface melt ponds.

TI  - A meta-analysis of global crop water productivity of three leading world crops (wheat, corn, and rice) in the irrigated areas over three decades
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The overarching goal of this study was to perform a comprehensive meta-analysis of irrigated agricultural Crop Water Productivity (CWP) of the world's three leading crops: wheat, corn, and rice based on three decades of remote sensing and non-remote sensing-based studies. Overall, CWP data from 148 crop growing study sites (60 wheat, 43 corn, and 45 rice) spread across the world were gathered from published articles spanning 31 different countries. There was overwhelming evidence of a significant increase in CWP with an increase in latitude for predominately northern hemisphere datasets. For example, corn grown in latitude 40-50 degrees had much higher mean CWP (2.45 kg/m(3)) compared to mean CWP of corn grown in other latitudes such as 30-40 degrees (1.67 kg/m(3)) or 20-30 degrees (0.94 kg/m(3)). The same trend existed for wheat and rice as well. For soils, none of the CWP values, for any of the three crops, were statistically different. However, mean CWP in higher latitudes for the same soil was significantly higher than the mean CWP for the same soil in lower latitudes. This applied for all three crops studied. For wheat, the global CWP categories were low (<= 0.75 kg/m(3)), medium (>0.75 to <1.10 kg/m(3)), and high CWP (>= 1.10 kg/m(3)). For corn the global CWP categories were low (<= 1.25 kg/m(3)), medium (>1.25 to <= 1.75 kg/m(3)), and high (>1.75 kg/m(3)). For rice the global CWP categories were low (<= 0.70 kg/m(3)), medium (>0.70 to <= 1.25 kg/m(3)), and high (>1.25 kg/m(3)). USA and China are the only two countries that have consistently high CWP for wheat, corn, and rice. Australia and India have medium CWP for wheat and rice. India's corn, however, has low CWP. Egypt, Turkey, Netherlands, Mexico, and Israel have high CWP for wheat. Romania, Argentina, and Hungary have high CWP for corn, and Philippines has high CWP for rice. All other countries have either low or medium CWP for all three crops. Based on data in this study, the highest consumers of water for crop production also have the most potential for water savings. These countries are USA, India, and China for wheat; USA, China, and Brazil for corn; India, China, and Pakistan for rice. For example, even just a 10% increase in CWP of wheat grown in India can save 6974 billion liters of water. This is equivalent to creating 6974 lakes each of 100 m(3) in volume that leads to many benefits such as acting as 'water banks' for lean season, recreation, and numerous ecological services. This study establishes the volume of water that can be saved for each crop in each country when there is an increase in CWP by 10%, 20%, and 30%.

TI  - Teacher pilgrims at World Youth Day: a preliminary examination
T2  - JOURNAL OF BELIEFS & VALUES-STUDIES IN RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the experiences of six teachers from a regional, Australian diocese who attended World Youth Day (WYD). It also reports on aspects of their worldview and their experience working in Catholic schools. Overall participants were very positive about working in Catholic schools, and though not connected in an ongoing way with parish communities, they were happy to support the religious dimension of Catholic schools and were often involved in parish-based programmes when there was a connection with school activities. Their worldview could be characterised as having much in common with dominant cultural paradigms that sees religion in moral terms along with a deistic sense of God. Established social networks supported them in these views. Teacher pilgrims reported that WYD gave them the opportunity to experience a broader, more diverse Catholicism as well as the experience of going overseas and being part of a large gathering. Participation in WYD may open up opportunities for reflective discernment on the part of teacher pilgrims and a result has implications for the formation of teachers working in Catholic schools.

TI  - Monitoring the VIIRS Sensor Data Records Reflective Solar Band Calibrations Using DCC With Collocated CrIS Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - As uniform and stable objects, deep convective clouds (DCCs) are often used to monitor the calibration stabilities of the reflective solar bands (RSBs) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership. Traditionally, DCCs are identified by the legacy 11-mu m brightness temperature (BT11) threshold method. With the collocated Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), a method of combining the BT difference between a water vapor absorption channel and a window channel to its measurement noise ratio (BNR) is adopted and applied to DCC identification. The BNR method improves the DCC detections over the legacy method because it is less contaminated with high clouds not thick and bright enough. Using observations from 2017 to 2018, the results show BNR has better performances than BT11 for identifying DCCs and monitoring RSBs. When comparing to BT11, BNR has more robust and invariant time series of monthly reflectance for all RSBs; that is, the standard deviation and total variation range (maximum-minimum) are up to 47% smaller. Because BNR affects more on the left tails (less reflective) than the modes of the histograms of reflectance, the improvement is more significant on the mean reflectance than the mode. BNR detects fewer DCCs than BT11, but with more confidence. This allows the weekly and daily time series for monitoring RSBs in higher temporal frequencies. This method can be applied to other imagers with collocated advanced infrared sounders for detecting DCCs and monitoring the calibration stabilities of RSBs.

TI  - Revisiting Recent Elevation-Dependent Warming on the Tibetan Plateau Using Satellite-Based Data Sets
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data, characterized by extensive regional coverage and relatively high spatial resolution, have a distinct advantage for examining elevation-dependent warming (EDW) across rugged topography in mountain regions where there are sparse in situ observations. Based on recent (2001-2015) comprehensive satellite-based data sets (2 mair temperature, land surface temperature, snow cover, and daytime and nighttime cloud), this study finds that annual mean 2 m air temperature warming rates show rapid decrease above 4,500 m despite increasing from 2,000 to 4,500 m. This indicates a reversal in EDW at the highest elevations on the Tibetan Plateau, which is somehow different from the EDW derived from short-term land surface temperature presented in earlier research. The decrease of warming rate above 4,500 m coincides with the elevation at which most of the current solid water resources reside. Thus, their decline may be less rapid than previously thought. Trends in nighttime cloud and snow cover are both correlated with patterns of EDW on the Tibetan Plateau, but the leading factor varies on an annual and seasonal basis. These results provide important evidence for understanding EDW and its controlling mechanisms in an extreme high-elevation context.

TI  - Relationship between seasonal influenza rates and hospitalization and mortality rates due to acute cardiovascular diseases in a Spanish region
T2  - MEDICINA CLINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and objective: Influenza virus infection can contribute to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study is to confirm if the increase in seasonal influenza rates is associated with a growth in hospitalisation and mortality rates for acute cardiovascular diseases (ACVD).Methods: Retrospective cohort study of hospital discharges due to ACVD (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure and ischemic stroke) in the Castilla y Leon (Spain) hospital system between 2001 and 2015. Hospitalisation and hospital mortality rates due to ACVD, and influenza rates in Castilla y Leon between 2001 and 2015 were studied. To calculate hospitalisation and mortality rates, the hospital discharges database was used; for influenza rates, the weekly reports of the Sentinel System for the surveillance of influenza in Spain (Carlos III Health Institute) were used. A statistical analysis of linear and multivariate logistic regressions was performed.Results: 239,586 ACVD (myocardial infarction: 55,004; unstable angina: 15,406; heart failure: 11,1647; ischemic stroke: 57,529) were studied. Increasing rates of influenza were associated with increased mortality due to ACVD and all the diseases studied, except unstable angina. A linear correlation was observed between influenza rates and hospitalisation (r(2)=0.03; p=0.02) and mortality (r(2)=0.14; p<0.001) rates by ACVD. Virtually all influenza rates were associated, as independent variables, to an increase in mortality due to ACVD, being higher in rates>139/100,000 inhabitants (OR: 1.25; p<0.001).Conclusions: The rates of hospitalisation and in-hospital mortality due to ACVD in the period 2001-2015 increased in relation to infection rates due to the influenza virus.

TI  - Seasonal Variations in Iceberg Freshwater Flux in Sermilik Fjord, Southeast Greenland From Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Iceberg discharge is estimated to account for up to 50% of the freshwater flux delivered to glacial fiords. The amount, timing, and location of iceberg melting impacts fiord-water circulation and heat budget, with implications for glacier dynamics, nutrient cycling, and fiord productivity. We use Sentinel-2 imagery to examine seasonal variations in freshwater flux from open-water icebergs in Sermilik Fjord, Greenland during summer and fall of 2017-2018. Using iceberg velocities derived from visual-tracking and changes in total iceberg volume with distance down-fjord from Helheim Glacier, we estimate maximum average two-month full-fjord iceberg-derived freshwater fluxes of similar to 1,060 +/- 615, 1,270 +/- 735, 1,200 +/- 700, 3,410 +/- 1,975, and 1,150 +/- 670 m(3)/s for May-June, June-July, July-August, August-September, and September-November, respectively. Fluxes decrease with distance down-fiord, and on average, 86-91% of iceberg volume is lost before reaching the fiord mouth. This method provides a simple, invaluable tool for monitoring seasonal and interannual iceberg freshwater fluxes across a range of Greenlandic fiords.Plain Language Summary Recent studies have shown that the freshwater produced via the melting of icebergs can dominate the freshwater budget in glacial fjords surrounding the Greenland Ice Sheet, which has important implications for fiord circulation and heat budget, nutrient availability, and primary productivity. Here we use satellite imagery to estimate both iceberg velocity and the seasonal changes in iceberg volume in Sermilik Fjord in southeast Greenland in 2017-2018, from which meltwater fluxes are derived. Iceberg meltwater fluxes are highest in the late summer and fall, when fiord water temperatures are warmer than in the spring and early summer, and when more icebergs have been calved into the fjord. Throughout the year, the volume of freshwater generated from the melting of icebergs is greater than the freshwater entering the fjord at the base of the glacier and sourced from melting at the ice sheet surface. As such, the melting of icebergs provides a significant volume of freshwater to the fjord system, with important implications for fiord-scale circulation and heat budget, nutrient cycling, and primary productivity. The methodology presented here is effective, simple and inexpensive, and can be applied to a variety of glacial fiord systems, particularly those that are remote and inaccessible.

TI  - An Intracerebral Hemorrhage Care Bundle Is Associated with Lower Case Fatality
T2  - ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Anticoagulation reversal, intensive blood pressure lowering, neurosurgery, and access to critical care might all be beneficial in acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We combined and implemented these as the "ABC" hyperacute care bundle and sought to determine whether the implementation was associated with lower case fatality. Methods The ABC bundle was implemented from June 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016. Key process targets were set, and a registry captured consecutive patients. We compared 30-day case fatality before, during, and after bundle implementation with multivariate logistic regression and used mediation analysis to determine which care process measures mediated any association. Difference-in-difference analysis compared 30-day case fatality with 32,295 patients with ICH from 214 other hospitals in England and Wales using Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme data. Results A total of 973 ICH patients were admitted in the study period. Compared to before implementation, the adjusted odds of death by 30 days were lower in the implementation period (odds ratio [OR] = 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38-0.97, p = 0.03), and this was sustained after implementation (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.24-0.61, p < 0.0001). Implementation of the bundle was associated with a 10.8 percentage point (95% CI = -17.9 to -3.7, p = 0.003) reduction in 30-day case fatality in difference-in-difference analysis. The total effect of the care bundle was mediated by a reduction in do-not-resuscitate orders within 24 hours (52.8%) and increased admission to critical care (11.1%). Interpretation Implementation of the ABC care bundle was significantly associated with lower 30-day case fatality after ICH. ANN NEUROL 2019

TI  - Allometric Models to Estimate Leaf Area for Tropical African Broadleaved Forests
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct and semidirect estimations of leaf area (LA) and leaf area index (LAI) are scarce in dense tropical forests despite their importance in calibrating remote sensing products, forest dynamics, and biogeochemical models. We destructively sampled 61 trees belonging to 13 most abundant species in a semideciduous forest in southeastern Cameroon. For each tree, all leaves were weighed, and for a subsample of branches, leaves were counted and the LA measured. Allometric models were calibrated to allow semidirect estimation of LAI at tree and stand levels based on forest inventory data (R-2 = 0.7, bias = 21.2%, error = 39.5%) and on predictors that could be extracted from very high resolution remote sensing data (R-2 = 0.63, bias = 35.1%, error = 58.73). Using twenty-one 1-ha forest plots, stand level estimations of LAI ranged from 4.42-13.99. These values are higher than previous estimates generally obtained using indirect methods. These results may have important consequences on ecosystem exchanges and the role of tropical forest in global cycles.Plain Language Summary Leaf area (LA) and leaf area index (LAI) are useful parameters characterizing the plant-atmosphere interface where matter and energy are exchanged. However, direct or semidirect estimations are not common in dense tropical forests. In this study, we used a destructive data set of trees of varied species and sizes from the semideciduous forest of southeastern Cameroon to predict total tree LA. Based on this data, we developed operational allometric models to allow for semidirect estimation of LA and LAI at tree and stand levels. These models would be of considerable use for climate-vegetation modeling and remote sensing communities.

TI  - The Response of Tropical Organized Convection to El Nino Warming
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Convective organization has a large impact on precipitation and feeds back on larger-scale circulations in the tropics. The degree of this convective organization changes with modes of climate variability like the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), but because organization is not represented in current climate models, a quantitative assessment of these shifts has not been possible. Here, we construct multidecade satellite climatologies of occurrence of tropical convective organization and its properties and assess changes with ENSO phase. The occurrence of organized deep convection becomes more concentrated, increasing threefold in the eastern and central Pacific during El Nino and decreasing twofold outside of these regions. Both horizontal extent of the cold cloud shield and convective depth increase in regions of positive sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTa); however, the regions of greatest convective deepening are those of large-scale ascent, rather than those of warmest SSTa. Extent decreases with SSTa at a rate of about 20 km/K, while the SSTa dependence of depth is only about 0.2 K/K. We introduce two values to describe convective changes with ENSO more succinctly: (1) an information entropy metric to quantify the clustering of convective system occurrences and (2) a growth metric to quantify deepening relative to spreading over the system lifetime. Finally, with collocated precipitation data, we see that rainfall attributable to convective organization jumps up to 5% with warming. Rain intensity and amount increase for a given system size during El Nino, but a given rain amount may actually fall with higher intensity during La Nina.Plain Language Summary Tropical storms at an intermediate scale between individual thunderstorms and cyclones or hurricanes are not represented by climate models. As the satellite data record now spans several decades, we can use these observations to understand how large storms change during El Nino periods. Here, we find that warmer waters in the central and eastern Pacific during El Nino cause a dramatic increase in storm occurrence. Storms are more likely to occur near to other storms and to become larger in both the vertical and horizontal. Changes to large-scale winds are more influential on these structural factors than locally warmer ocean water. The hydrological impact of these storms is also important because they bring the majority of precipitation in some regions. We see that a storm of a certain extent brings larger volume and intensity of rain during El Nino. But a certain rain volume may actually fall with greater intensity during La Nino.

TI  - Estimation of the Dust Aerosol Shortwave Direct Forcing Over Land Based on an Equi-albedo Method From Satellite Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important but difficult to measure the shortwave radiative forcing of the dust aerosols over land from satellite-observed radiance because the inhomogeneous surface albedo varies in a large dynamic range. In this study, we proposed a satellite-based equi-albedo method to derive the dust aerosol shortwave direct forcing over land. In the method, an equal radiance at the top of atmosphere was assumed for the region with the similar surface albedo and the similar solar zenith angle. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and the shortwave radiance product from Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System were used to derive the dust aerosol radiative forcing. The dust storm events outbroken on 9 and 24 April 2010 in Taklimakan desert were selected as study cases. The mean dust shortwave direct forcing efficiency is -35.08 W/m(2) per unit of dust AOD during the dust storm events. The results were validated with the calculated radiative forcing from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer AOD product by the radiative transfer model. It shows that the derived radiative forcing is well correlated with the simulated one. The mean difference is 10.57 and the standard deviation is 1.35. Moreover, uncertainty has been estimated. The regional mean-directed radiative forcing due to dust are -28.98 +/- 7.99 and -35.76 +/- 10.61 W/m(2) of these two cases directly from satellite observations. This research indicates that the proposed method is reliable and effective, which can be used to estimate the shortwave direct radiative forcing of the dust storm event.

TI  - Cloud Edge Properties Measured by the ARM Shortwave Spectrometer Over Ocean and Land
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We use the spectrally invariant method to study the variability of cloud optical thickness (tau) and droplet effective radius (r(eff)) in transition zones between the cloudy and clear-sky columns observed by Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Zenith at the Southern Great Plains Central Facility site (SGP C1) and during the Marine ARM GPCI Investigation of Clouds (MAGIC) field campaign. The spectrally invariant method approximates the spectra in the transition zone as a linear combination of definitely clear and definitely cloudy spectra. The slope and intercept of the linear relations characterize tau and r(eff) in the transition region, respectively. The radiative transfer model simulations show that that (i) the slope of the visible band is positively correlated with tau, while (ii) the intercept of the near-infrared band has a high negative correlation with r(eff). We have analyzed 22 cloud edge cases from the SGP and MAGIC and found that from cloud to clear in the transitions, (a) the slopes of the visible band decrease, indicating the decrease of tau toward cloud edges, and (b) the intercepts of the near-infrared band show a much more significant increase at the SGP than from the MAGIC. The results from observed cases suggest that while tau decreases for all cases, the decrease in r(eff) is much more significant for cloud over land at the SGP site compared to the ocean counterpart during the MAGIC campaign.

TI  - Characterization of Combined Effects of Urban Built-Up and Vegetated Areas on Long-Term Urban Heat Islands in Beijing
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of urbanization and industrialization, megacities have experienced more severe surface urban heat island (SUHI) effects. Land surface temperatures (LSTs) are retrieved; spatial distribution of temperature is characterized, and the relationship among temperatures or SUHIs and land-use and land cover (LULC) in Beijing City are discussed. The changing LSTs in Beijing, from 1990 to 2017, were calculated by a radiative transfer equation and mono-window algorithm. To estimate the effect of SUHI, Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TRIS) and Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data were selected. There is an increasing trend toward high LSTs for different LULC types. The connection with building and vegetation density is analyzed. Results indicate that for every 1% increase in the density of buildings, the increase in amplitude of temperature in 2017 was twice as large as it was in 1995 for the study area. In terms of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values, the decrease in amplitude of LST was 10 times that of the year 1995, where there is only a slight increase in the NDVI values of the area.

TI  - Investigating an Unusually Large 28-Day Oscillation in Mesospheric Temperature Over Antarctica Using Ground-Based and Satellite Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Utah State University Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper was deployed at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in 2010 to measure OH temperature at similar to 87 km as part of an international network to study the mesospheric dynamics over Antarctica. During the austral winter of 2014, an unusually large amplitude similar to 28-day oscillation in mesospheric temperature was observed for similar to 100 days from the South Pole Station. This study investigates the characteristics and global structure of this exceptional planetary-scale wave event utilizing ground-based mesospheric OH temperature measurements from two Antarctic stations (South Pole and Rothera) together with satellite temperature measurements from the Microwave Limb Sounder on the Aura satellite and the Solar Occultation For Ice Experiment on the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere satellite. Our analyses have revealed that this large oscillation is a wintertime, high-latitude phenomenon, exhibiting a coherent zonal wave #1 structure below 80-km altitude. At higher altitudes, the wave was confined in longitude between 180 degrees E and 360 degrees E. The amplitude of this oscillation reached similar to 15 K at 85 km, and it was observed to grow with altitude as it extended from the stratosphere into the lower thermosphere in the Southern Hemisphere. The satellite data further established the existence of this oscillation in the Northern Hemisphere during the boreal wintertime. The main characteristics and global structure of this event as observed in temperature are consistent with the predicted 28-day Rossby Wave (1,4) mode.

TI  - Intense interseasonal influenza outbreaks, Australia, 2018/19
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Interseasonal influenza outbreaks are not unusual in countries with temperate climates and well-defined influenza seasons. Usually, these are small and diminish before the main influenza season begins. However, the 2018/19 summer-autumn interseasonal influenza period in Australia saw unprecedented large and widespread influenza outbreaks. Aim: Our objective was to determine the extent of the intense 2018/19 interseasonal influenza outbreaks in Australia epidemiologically and examine the genetic, antigenic and structural properties of the viruses responsible for these outbreaks. Methods: This observational study combined the epidemiological and virological surveillance data obtained from the Australian Government Department of Health, the New South Wales Ministry of Health, sentinel outpatient surveillance, public health laboratories and data generated by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne and the Singapore Agency for Science, Technology and Research. Results: There was a record number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases during the interseasonal period November 2018 to May 2019 (n= 85,286; 5 times the previous 3-year average) and also more institutional outbreaks, hospitalisations and deaths, than what is normally seen. Conclusions: The unusually large interseasonal influenza outbreaks in 2018/19 followed a mild 2018 influenza season and resulted in a very early start to the 2019 influenza season across Australia. The reasons for this unusual event have yet to be fully elucidated but are likely to be a complex mix of climatic, virological and host immunity-related factors. These outbreaks reinforce the need for year-round surveillance of influenza, even in temperate climates with strong seasonality patterns.

TI  - Integrating satellite and climate data to predict wheat yield in Australia using machine learning approaches
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat is the most important staple crop grown in Australia, and Australia is one of the top wheat exporting countries globally. Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction in Australia is important for regional and global food security. Prior studies use either climate data, or satellite data, or a combination of these two to build empirical models to predict crop yield. However, though the performance of yield prediction using empirical methods is improved by combining the use of climate and satellite data, the contributions from different data sources are still not clear. In addition, how the regression-based methods compare with various machine learning based methods in their performance in yield prediction is also not well understood and needs in-depth investigation. This work integrated various sources of data to predict wheat yield across Australia from 2000 to 2014 at the statistical division (SD) level. We adopted a well-known regression method (LASSO, as a benchmark) and three mainstream machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and neural network) to build various empirical models for yield prediction. For satellite data, we used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from MODIS and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY as metrics to approximate crop productivity. The machine-learning based methods outperform the regression method in modeling crop yield. Our results confirm that combining climate and satellite data can achieve high performance of yield prediction at the SD level (R-2 similar to 0.75). The satellite data track crop growth condition and gradually capture the variability of yield evolving with the growing season, and their contributions to yield prediction usually saturate at the peak of the growing season. Climate data provide extra and unique information beyond what the satellite data have offered for yield prediction, and our empirical modeling work shows the added values of climate variables exist across the whole season, not only at some certain stages. We also find that using EVI as an input can achieve better performance in yield prediction than SIF, primarily due to the large noise in the satellite-based SIF data (i.e. coarse resolution in both space and time). In addition, we also explored the potential for timely wheat yield prediction in Australia, and we can achieve the optimal prediction performance with approximately two-month lead time before wheat maturity. The proposed methodology in this paper can be extended to different crops and different regions for crop yield prediction.

TI  - Suitability analysis of ski areas in China: an integrated study based on natural and socioeconomic conditions
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The successful bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics (Beijing 2022, officially known as the XXIV Olympic Winter Games) has greatly stimulated Chinese enthusiasm towards winter sports participation. Consequently, the Chinese ski industry is rapidly booming due to enormous market demand and government support. However, investing in ski areas in unreasonable locations will cause problems from an economic perspective (in terms of operation and management) as well as geographical concerns (such as environmental degradation). Therefore, evaluating the suitability of a ski area based on scientific metrics has become a prerequisite for the sustainable development of the ski industry. In this study, we evaluate the locational suitability of ski areas in China by integrating their natural and socioeconomic conditions using a linearly weighted method based on geographic information system (GIS) spatial analysis combined with remote sensing, online, and field survey data. The key indexes for evaluating natural suitability include snow cover, air temperature, topographic conditions, water resources, and vegetation, whereas socioeconomic suitability is evaluated based on economic conditions, accessibility of transportation, distance to a tourist attraction, and distance to a city. As such, metrics ranging from 0 to 1 considering both natural and socioeconomic conditions are used to define a suitability threshold for each candidate region for ski area development. A ski area is considered to be a dismal prospect when the locational integrated index is less than 0.5. The results show that 84% of existing ski areas are located in areas with an integrated index greater than 0.5. Finally, corresponding development strategies for decision-makers are proposed based on the multicriteria metrics, which will be extended to incorporate potential influences from future climate change and socioeconomic development. However, the snowmaking model with local data should to be used to further analyze the suitability for a specific ski area.

TI  - Developmental exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) selectively decreases brain dopamine levels in Northern leopard frogs
T2  - TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic compounds that are a major public health concern due to widespread use, long environmental and biological half-lives, detection in most human plasma samples, and links to multiple adverse health outcomes. The literature suggests that some PFAS may be neurotoxic. However, there are major gaps in the literature with respect to how environmentally-relevant doses during development may influence the nervous system. To address this gap, we utilized a sentinel species, Northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens) to determine the effects of developmental exposure to environmentally relevant perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on major neurotransmitter systems. Frog larvae at Gosner stage 25 were exposed to 10, 100, or 1000 ppb PFOS or PFOA for 30 days before neurochemical analysis. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection or fluorescent detection assays was used to measure neurotransmitter levels, which were normalized to protein levels in each sample. Dopamine (DA) decreased significantly in the brains of frogs treated with PFOA (1000 ppb) and PFOS (100 and 1000 ppb). Significant increases in DA turnover also resulted from PFOA and PFOS treatment. Neither PFOS, nor PFOA produced detectable alterations in serotonin (nor its metabolite), norepinephrine, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), glutamate, or acetylcholine. PFAS body burdens showed that PFOS accumulated relative to dose, while PFOA did not. These data suggest that DArgic neurotransmission is selectively affected in developmentally exposed amphibians and that PFAS should be evaluated for a potential role in diseases that target the DA system.

TI  - Pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of lymphotropic nanoparticle enhanced MRI for diagnosis of metastatic disease in canine head and neck tumours
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This pilot study is designed to determine if lymphotropic nanoparticle enhanced MRI (LNMRI) is a viable technique for staging of naturally occurring canine malignant head and neck tumours. Previous imaging studies in veterinary medicine have shown variable sensitivity and specificity for determining metastasis for local lymph nodes in head and neck tumours. LNMRI utilizes ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIOs) to help in the detection of metastatic disease in lymph nodes. USPIOs are phagocytized and localized to normal lymph nodes where they assist in evaluation for regions of effacement by cancerous cells. Six dogs underwent LNMRI for the diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes. A truncated MRI consisting of transverse images of T2, T1 pre- and post-contrast and T2* sequences were evaluated for presence of metastasis. Sentinel lymph nodes and lymph nodes with possible metastatic lesions were surgically excised for histological evaluation. In the initial phase of this study, 24 lymph nodes were included in analysis. Subjective observation by the primary investigator had a calculated sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 88% based on histological results. There were no negative side effects to the USPIOs noted in the limited number of patients in this study. Percentage signal intensity loss was calculated and found to be significantly different between metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes (P-value = .038). In conclusion, this pilot study shows that LNMRI has the potential to be a sensitive and specific method of diagnosing lymph node metastasis. Further research is warranted to determine if this method is clinically applicable and accurate.

TI  - A new method to estimate cloud effective radius using Meteosat Second Generation SEVIRI over Middle East
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud particle size distribution varies with height and the phase may change from water to mixed phase to ice through the vertical profile of the cloud, giving rise to different radiative characteristics. Researchers suggested an empirical equation for an approximation of the relation between cloud-particle effective radius and reflectance of channel IR3.7 for Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Multi-Functional Transport Satellite (MTSAT)-1R satellites. However, when we examined this empirical equation for MSG satellites, there was no correlation between the cloud particle effective radius and those from the Terra and Aqua/MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometers) products. Given the fact that this relationship is empirical and not applicable for Meteosat satellites with 3.9 mu m wavelength cloud properties, we need to introduce a new nonlinear equation that is independent from other cloud properties, to retrieve the cloud effective radius from MSG satellite over Middle East. Thus, in this study, a development of the mentioned method, based on a nonlinear regression model, was introduced to estimate the water/ice-cloud particle effective radius from the 3.9 mu m wavelength reflectivity of the Meteosat Second Generation Indian Ocean Data Coverage (MSG-1(IODC)) satellite over the Middle East region. For this purpose, the LibRadTran radiative transfer model was used. This approach is almost independent from other cloud properties, which makes this relationship more efficient for retrieving a cloud's effective radius. To evaluate this approach, the results have been compared to the effective-radius product of the MODIS on board the Terra and Aqua satellites, and cloud effective radius parameter from the MSG-1 satellite's optimal cloud analysis (OCA) data. The average of correlation coefficient, standard deviation, and RMSE (root mean square error) of this retrieved algorithm method for 29 randomly selected case studies, in comparison to the corresponding MODIS product, are 0.93, 3.093, and 3.639, and compared with OCA product, 0.88, 4.015, and 4.51, respectively. Therefore, the results of analysis in the Middle East region show that the retrieved effective particle radius from Meteosat satellites corresponds strongly with MODIS data from the Terra and Aqua satellites, and also with the OCA products of the MSG-1. Furthermore, using the algorithm that is presented in this paper, a nonlinear regression relationship can be made for retrieving cloud effective radius in the intended place. (C) 2019 COSPAR.

TI  - A promising new approach to estimate drought indices for fire danger assessment using remotely sensed data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the crucial input variables in fire danger rating systems is the water content of the soil, as well as of the living and dead fuels. This study concentrates on the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) and the Drought Code (DC), which are both used to estimate the soil moisture deficit (SMD) and are inherent parts of well-established fire danger rating systems.These indices assume a simple water balance equation where effective rainfall is the only input and evapotranspiration is the only loss term, retrieved from empirical equations. We propose a method to increase spatial resolution of estimated SMD from KBDI and DC by replacing the empirical estimation of evapotranspiration with the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimated by the remote-sensing based Simplified Two-Source Energy Balance model (STSEB). For the days with no satellite observations, the basal crop coefficient (K-cb) and the adjusted crop coefficient (K-c,K-adj) approach for water stress conditions were applied to obtain continuous daily estimates for fire danger rating. A new approach was suggested to find a threshold dividing areas into fire-prone and fire-safe, regardless of the status of the drought indices.Both drought indices (KBDI and DC) benefited from the estimated ETa of the existing STSEB model obtaining SMD maps with higher spatial resolution (compared to conventional methods and products using interpolation techniques). Areas with higher proneness to drought and therefore to occurrence to fire were identified in the north-central part of Portugal, where e.g. on 16 July 2015, in the case of KBDI 47% of a specific area was classified as fire-prone and about 67% of the fires occurred within the identified area of this year.This new approach generated information on the water status of the soil at a spatial resolution of 500 m, which can be useful for forest management to identify endangered areas, as the danger of fire increases with increasing drought conditions.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Antibiotic resistance, either intrinsic or acquired, is a major obstacle for treating bacterial infections. Aim: Our objective was to compare the country-specific species distribution of the four Gram-negative species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species and the proportions of selected acquired resistance traits within these species. Method: We used data reported for 2016 to the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) by 30 countries in the European Union and European Economic Area. Results: The country-specific species distribution varied considerably. While E. coli accounted for 31.9% to 81.0% (median: 69.0%) of all reported isolates, the two most common intrinsically resistant species P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacterspp. combined (PSEACI) accounted for 5.5% to 39.2% of isolates (median: 10.1%). Similarly, large national differences were noted for the percentages of acquired non-susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones. There was a strong positive rank correlation between the country-specific percentages of PSEACI and the percentages of non-susceptibility to the above antibiotics in all four species (rho > 0.75 for 10 of the 11 pairs of variables tested). Conclusion: Countries with the highest proportion of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. were also those where the rates of acquired non-susceptibility in all four studied species were highest. The differences are probably related to national differences in antibiotic consumption and infection prevention and control routines.

TI  - Estimation of biomass-burning emissions by fusing the fire radiative power retrievals from polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites across the conterminous United States
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning is an important source of atmospheric greenhouse gases and aerosols, and its emissions can be estimated using Fire Radiative Power (FRP) retrievals from polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites. Accurate and timely estimation of biomass-burning emissions (BBE) requires high-spatiotemporal-resolution FRP that is characterized by accurate diurnal FRP cycle. This study is to estimate hourly reliable BBE in a 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees grid across the conterminous United States (CONUS) to be used in chemical transport models for air quality forecast. To do this, this study for the first time fused FRP retrievals from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) with those from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 after GOES FRP was angularly adjusted and was further calibrated against MODIS FRP. The FRP data was obtained from Terra and Aqua MODIS 1 km active fire products with fire observations of four times a day and from 4 km GOES WF_ABBA (WildFire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm) fire products for GOES-W (GOES-11 and 15) and GOES-E (GOES-13) with observations every 5-15 min across the CONUS from 2011 to 2015. The diurnal FRP cycles at an interval of 15 min for a grid were reconstructed using the ecosystem-specific diurnal FRP climatology and actually available MODIS-GOES fused FRP, which were applied to estimate hourly BBE across the CONUS. The results indicate that the reconstructed diurnal FRP cycle varied significantly in magnitude and shape among 45 CONUS ecosystems. The biomass burning released 717 Gg particulate matter smaller than 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5) in the CONUS each year; however, it presented significant temporal (diurnal, seasonal, and interannual) and spatial variations. Finally, the BBE estimates were evaluated using available data sources and compared well (a difference of similar to 4%) with emissions derived from Landsat burned areas in the western CONUS and with hourly carbon monoxide emissions simulated using a biogeochemical model over the Rim Fire in California (difference < 1%). The BBE estimates showed similar seasonal variation to six available BBE inventories but with variable magnitude.

TI  - Modeling <i>Pinus pinaster</i> forest structure after a large wildfire using remote sensing data at high spatial resolution
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Mediterranean Basin, wildland fires are major drivers of forest ecosystem dynamics. In the current context of global change, these fires are becoming more severe and recurrent because of climatic conditions, land use changes and invasive species. In areas affected by mega-fires (burned area > 10,000 ha), the patterns of regeneration may be heterogeneous due to local variations in fire regime, community composition and environmental features. The goal of this study was to analyze the post-fire structure of both Pinus pinaster Aiton. seedlings population and understory community in a Mediterranean fire-prone ecosystem at short-term by means of high spatial resolution satellite imagery within the perimeter of a full stand replacing mega-fire that burned around 12,000 ha of a Pinus pinaster forest in NW Spain. We established 234 field plots of 2 x 2 meters to cover four recurrence-severity scenarios. In each plot, we sampled 15 vegetation structural variables at both pine seedlings population and understory community levels. From the WorldView-2 satellite imagery, we obtained three sets of spectral variables (reflectance, spectral indices and image textures) that were used as predictors of vegetation recovery in generalized linear models. At population level, the number and cover of pine seedlings were successfully modeled with spectral indices and textural information (normalized root mean square error of 16% and 17%, respectively). At understory community level, woody species cover was correlated with first order textures (normalized root mean square error of 9%). Other understory structure variables (height and richness of woody species, percentage of bare soil, necromass and leaves) were predicted with an error lower than 20%. The predictive capacity of the models was similar for all recurrence-severity scenarios. Our results highlight the usefulness of spectral indices and textural data at high spatial resolution in the analysis of post-fire recovery in large and heterogeneous burnt areas. Given the accuracy and predictive capacity of the models obtained in this study, high spatial resolution satellite imagery together with field data provide useful information in post-fire decision making in fire prone ecosystems.

TI  - Morphological abnormalities in natural populations of the common South American toad <i>Rhinella arenarum</i> inhabiting fluoride-rich environments
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Morphological abnormalities in amphibians may be attributed to contaminants, ultraviolet radiation and trematode parasites, or a synergistic effect between them. In the present study, morphological abnormalities in Rhinella arenarum adults from natural and artificial fluoride-rich environments were identified and evaluated. Three sites were sampled in central Argentina: Los Vallecitos stream (LF-LV), Los Cerros Negros stream (MF-CN), and Decantation ponds (HF-DP), with low (0.33 mg/L), middle (2.03 mg/L) and high (14.0 mg/L) fluoride levels respectively; the latter site is associated with a fluoride mine. Abnormal individuals were photographed and then standard radiographs were taken. Abnormality frequencies and relative percentage of abnormal individuals were calculated for each site. In addition, skeletochronology was used to estimate toad's age. Five abnormality types were identified: syndactyly, ectrodactyly, polydactyly, microphthalmia and ectromelia. Percentages of abnormal individuals per site were: LF-LV = 4%, MF-CN = 21.2% and HF-DP = 6.4%. The MF-CN and HF-DP populations had morphological abnormality frequencies that exceeded the reference value (5%) reported in the literature. The average age did not differ between sites. The results of this study indicate that there is an association between frequency of morphological abnormalities and high fluoride levels.

TI  - Pedology and soil class mapping from proximal and remote sensed data
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Pedological assessment and mapping by hyperspectral proximal and multispectral remote sensing comes up as an important alternative for large extent areas with high soil variability. Strategies indicating how to integrate these multi-source data for digital soil mapping are emerging. In this paper, we used proximal and remote sensed data to perform pedological assessments and to support a detailed soil class mapping by MESMA. The study area is located in Southeast of Federal District, Brazil. Six toposequences were defined according to pedomorpho-geological assessments and 34 sites were collected for laboratory analysis (texture and chemical) and VIS-NIR-SWIR (350-2500 mu) spectroscopy reflectance analysis. We assessed soil mineralogy based on derivative analysis of topsoil reflectance and we grouped observations to recognize topsoil spectral patterns by clustering method. Topsoil patterns (mean spectral curve for each cluster) were convolved using a Gaussian function of Landsat 5-TM spectral bands to obtain endmembers. Then, we used a Landsat 5 TM time series to produce a bare soil composite denominated Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI). Endmembers and SYSI were used as input data for Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to map the soil classes. Topsoil spectra clustered soil samples that were similar in texture, mineralogy and color, and identified 13 topsoil patterns (endmembers). SYSI retrieved 74% of bare soil area coverage and presented very similar spectral patterns to endmembers. The RGB 543 composite highlighted the mineralogy (i.g. sesquioxides, kaolinite and quartz), texture and color of the soils. MESMA modeled almost 100% of SYSI from endmembers, with low global RMSE of 0.86% and high global fraction of 62%. Soil classes were mapped using topsoil reflectance patterns and satellite images by MESMA method. We validated the digital soil map by using independent field-visited sites, which reached a Kappa coefficient of 0.73. We efficiently assessed soil mineralogy and recognized patterns from laboratory topsoil spectra. We successfully mapped soil classes using topsoil reflectance patterns and a bare soil composite image by MESMA method.

TI  - Impact of biomass burning on regional aerosol optical properties: A case study over northern India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study examines the spatial, seasonal and inter annual variation of biomass burning and its impact on regional aerosol optical properties over Northern India using multi-satellite aerosol observations: Active fire points, AOD (550 run) and AE (550 860 nm) from MODIS retrievals during January 2003-December 2017 and AAOD (388 rim), SSA (388 nm) and AI from OMI UV retrievals during January 2005-December 2017. Results from MODIS active fire count statistics indicate an increase in the number of fire occurrences (average 1477 fires per year) over India in a period of 15 years (2003-2017). The dominant fire seasons are (i) Pre-monsoon (March to May) accounting to more than 45% and (ii) Post-Monsoon having 24% of total annual fires counts. However, the crop residue burning hotspot region located in Punjab and Haryana, constitutes 26% of the total fires in India. At an average, 15456 (77.08%) fire counts were reported during the paddy season, whereas 3296 (16.44%) fire counts during wheat season respectively. The crop residue burning over the northwest IGP (Punjab) significantly affect the aerosol optical properties locally as well in the downwind regions during post-monsoon season i.e., crop residue fires increased by 4% (170 fires per year) with corresponding AOD, AAOD & AI increased by 8%, 9% & 11% respectively. The satellite observation shows large gradient of aerosol parameters from north-west to south-east along the Himalayan foot-hills which indicates the regional transport of smoke aerosols over the region. This is also supported by ground based AOD observations at four locations (Patiala, Delhi, Dehradun and Kanpur) and Black Carbon measurements at two locations (Patiala and Dehradun). The climatological averaged values of ground based AOD(550) for Patiala, Delhi, Dehradun and Kanpur are 0.52 +/- 0.26, 0.75 +/- 0.40, 0.45 +/- 0.24 and 0.57 +/- 0.29 respectively whereas BC concentrations are 8.43 +/- 3.14 mu g m(-3) & 3.36 +/- 1.26 mu g m(-3) for Patiala & Dehradun respectively. Comparison of MODIS derived AOD agrees well with ground based AODs (overall R = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.14). In addition, CALIPSO shows the maximum amount of biomass burning smoke aerosols present within the atmospheric boundary layer and some cases it extending up to 2-3 km altitudes. The smoke aerosol transport pathways originated from crop residue burning were analyzed using Hysplit forward trajectories. The results reveal that majority of smoke aerosols are transported to eastern IGP, central India and adjacent oceanic regions during post-monsoon season.

T2  - Revista do Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the long-term results of the correction of chronic anal fissures (CAF) in patients without anal hypertonia using the technique of anoplasty with skin tag flap.METHODS: we conducted a prospective study of CAF patients refractory to conservative treatment without anal hypertonia, subjected to anoplasty with the use of anal plicoma to cover the bloody area. We confirmed the absence of anal hypertonia through rectal exam and electromanometry. We applied a visual pain questionnaire and the Cleveland Clinic fecal incontinence score before and after surgery.RESULTS: we followed 15 patients with chronic anal fissure for a mean period of 29 months (12-56). The mean age was 41 years (29-69) and the duration of symptoms ranged from six months to five years. Healing occurred between three and six weeks for 13 patients (86.7%). The other two patients underwent debridement and new anoplasty successfully. No plicoma necrosis or anal stenosis occurred in any patient. The anal incontinence score did not change after the procedure, and all patients reported reduced pain. After 12 months of follow-up, none of the patients presented recurrence or anal incontinence, and 93.3% (14/15) of the patients were very satisfied.CONCLUSION: fissurectomy and anoplasty with the use of sentinel plie is a safe technique that results in improvement in pain without change of fecal continence and with high satisfaction rates.

TI  - Meteorological parameters and gaseous pollutant concentrations as predictors of daily continuous PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations using deep neural network in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The deep learning model can simulate the complex nonlinear relationship between PM2.5 and aerosol optical depth (AOD), and has great application potentiality in PM2.5 inversion. However, the underestimation of high PM2.5 concentrations problem is still exist in heavily polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (JingJinJi) region due to AOD cannot adequately represent the correlation between high PM2.5 concentrations and independent variables and neglected the effects of missing AOD. Thus, the long- and short-term PM2.5 exposure risk estimate was reduced. This work introduces gaseous pollutant data (NO2, SO2, CO, and O-3) related to primary emission and secondary transformation of pollutants as predictors into a deep neural network model to improve the underestimation of high PM2.5 concentrations based on AOD and meteorological factors. We predicted the PM2.5 concentration in the missing AOD areas, generated a daily continuous PM2.5 spatial distribution, and reduced estimated bias due to AOD deficiency. Grid-based 10-fold cross-validation (CV) was used to test the model performance. Results show that daily PM2.5 concentration CV R-2 is 0.87 and the root-mean-square prediction error (RMSE) is 27.11 mu g/m(3). The CV R-2 and RMSE are higher by 0.12 and lower by 9.72 mu g/m(3) than the model without gaseous pollutants (GAS(s)) as predictors. In including the missing AOD, the average concentration of PM2.5 CV R-2 is 0.86 and the RMSE is 16.95 mu g/m(3) in heavy polluted winter; the CV R-2 and RMSE are higher by 0.07 and lower by 3.95 mu g/m(3), respectively, than when the missing AOD was excluded. Prediction results of PM2.5 spatial distribution show that the model has high prediction accuracy and provides a complete and highly accurate spatiotemporal distribution characteristics for long- and short-term PM2.5 exposure studies, and reduces exposure misclassification of PM2.5 in heavily polluted areas.

TI  - African dryland ecosystem changes controlled by soil water
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring long-term vegetation dynamics in African drylands is of great importance for both ecosystem degradation studies and carbon-cycle modelling. Here, we exploited the complementary use of optical and passive microwave satellite data- normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and vegetation optical depth (VOD)-to provide new insights of ecosystem changes in African drylands. During 1993-2012, 54% of African drylands experienced a significant increase of VOD, mainly located in southern Africa and west and central Africa, with an average rate of increase of (1.2 +/- 2.7) x 10(-3) yr(-1). However, a significant decreasing NDVI was observed over 43% of the African drylands, in particular in western Niger and eastern Africa, with an average browning rate of (-0.13 +/- 1.5) x 10(-3) yr(-1). The contrasting vegetation trends (increasing VOD and decreasing NDVI) were largely caused by an increase in the relative proportion of the woody component of the vegetation, as a result of the prevailing woody encroachment in African drylands during the study period. Soil water emerges as the dominant driver of ecosystem changes in African drylands, in particular in arid and semiarid areas. This is evidenced by a strong spatio-temporal correlation between soil water and vegetation, where soil water changes explain about 48% of vegetation variations. This study emphasizes the potential of utilizing multiple satellite products with different strengths in monitoring different characteristics of ecosystems to evaluate ecosystem changes and reveal the underlying mechanisms of the observed changes.

TI  - New paradigm for stage III melanoma: from surgery to adjuvant treatment
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Recently the 8th version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification has been introduced, and has attempted to define a more accurate and precise definition of prognosis in line with the major progresses in understanding the biology and pathogenesis of melanoma. This new staging system introduces major changes in the stage III staging system. Indeed, surgical practice is changing in stage III patients, since, according to recent evidence, there is no survival benefit in radical lymph node dissection following a positive sentinel lymph node dissection. Therefore, some patients currently staged IIIB-C after dissection could be downgraded to IIIA (as in the case of patients with metastatic non-sentinel lymph nodes) since many completion lymph node dissections will no longer be performed. Moreover, new and effective targeted and immune strategies are being introduced in the pharmacological armamentarium in the adjuvant setting, showing major efficacy. Conclusions This article provides the authors' personal view on the above-mentioned topics.

TI  - Bayesian Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Modeling of Precipitation in the Indus Watershed
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indus watershed is a highly populated region that contains parts of India, Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan. Changes in precipitation patterns and rates of glacial melt have significantly impacted the region in recent years, and climate change is projected to result in further serious human and environmental consequences. To understand the climate dynamics of the Indus watershed and surrounding regions, reanalysis and satellite data from products such as APHRODITE-2, TRMM, ERAS, and MERRA-2 are often used, yet these products are not always in agreement regarding critical variables such as precipitation. Here we objectively evaluate the level of agreement between precipitation from these four products. Because these data are on different spatial scales, we propose a low-rank spatio-temporal dynamic linear model for precipitation that integrates information from each of the above climate products. Specifically, we model each data source as the combination of a modified shared process, a discrepancy process, and Gaussian noise. We define the shared process at a high spatial resolution that can be upscaled according to the resolution of the observed data. Our proposed model's shared process provides a cohesive picture of monthly precipitation in the Indus watershed from 2000 to 2009, while the product-specific discrepancies provide insight into how and where the products differ from one another.

TI  - Landslide recognition and mapping in a mixed forest environment from airborne LiDAR data
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A precise, accurate and complete landslide inventory is indispensable for the establishment of reliable landslide susceptibility and hazard maps. In the preparation of landslide inventories, dense vegetation cover is the major obstacle that confounds the topographic signature of landslides. Today, the growing usage of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology in the field of geoscience illuminates the mystery of the landscapes cloaked in dense vegetation by providing a new visual acuity to researchers. Turkey, similar to many mid-latitude mountainous countries suffering from landslides, is still continuing landslide inventory mapping with conventional methods such as aerial photo interpretations (API), although 68% of landslide events occurred under dense forest cover in the north of the country. Despite the country-wide medium-scaled landslide catalogs, the number and the abundance of landslides covered by forests remain largely unknown regardless of the increasing availability of high-resolution remote-sensing data. From these motivating insights and drawbacks, the study's focus is to evaluate the capability of mapping landslides by visually analyzing airborne LiDAR DTM derivatives and compare the results with the 1:25,000 scaled API-based inventory to understand the potential contribution of LiDAR technology in Europe's deadliest country (Turkey) in terms of landslides. The landslide mapping results for a test area located in the densely forested Ulus Basin, Western Black Sea region, reveal that the extent and the number of the mapped landslides (n = 902) from the airborne LiDAR data are much higher than those of the available API-based landslide inventory, which includes 67 landslides. Comparative analysis on topographic signatures of landslides is also underpinned on a distinct discrepancy of slope failure diagnostic indicators captured by the two available DEMs derived from LiDAR and 1:25,000 scaled topographic maps, emphasizing the success rate of LiDAR-derived DEM in recognition and mapping landslides with higher precision and accuracy. Together with all analysis results, the landslide recognizability degree assessment based on the forest cover percentage and slope height differences of landslides highlights that the MAR data enable landslides to be defined up to 100 m(2), while this value is 20 times lower than that of estimated values from API-based landslides. In addition to underlining the contribution of LiDAR technology to the recognition of landslides hidden under dense vegetation, these findings stress the importance of LiDAR data on complete and accurate landslide inventories for production of reliable susceptibility and hazard maps and further a better understanding of the landslide processes and reducing related losses.

TI  - Biodiversity and Species Change in the Arctic Ocean: A View Through the Lens of Nares Strait
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nares Strait is the northern most outflow gateway of the Arctic Ocean, with a direct connection to the remaining multi-year ice covered central Arctic Ocean. Nares Strait itself flows into the historically highly productive North Water Polynya (Pikialasorsuaq). Satellite data show that Nares Strait ice is retreating earlier in the season. The early season surface chlorophyll signal, which was a characteristic of the North Water, has also moved north into Nares Strait. However, given the vast differences in the hydrography and physical oceanographic structure of the North Water and Nares Strait there is no a priori reason to assume that the species assemblages and overall productivity of this region between Greenland and Canada will be maintained in the face of ongoing sea ice decline. The North Water's high marine mammal and bird populations are dependent on seasonally persistent diatom dominated phytoplankton productivity, and although there have been several studies on North Water phytoplankton, virtually nothing is known about the communities in Nares Strait. Here we investigated the microbial eukaryotes, including phytoplankton in Nares Strait using high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Samples were collected from Kennedy Channel below the northern ice edge of Nares Strait through the Kane Basin and into the northern limit of the North Water. The physical oceanographic structure and initial community rapidly changed between the faster flowing Kennedy Channel and the comparatively wider shallower Kane Basin. The community changes were evident in both the upper euphotic zone and the deeper aphotic zone. Heterotrophic taxa were found in the deeper waters along with ice algae that would have originated further to the north following release from the ice. Although there was a high proportion of pan-Arctic species throughout, the Nares Strait system showed little in common with the Northern North Water station, suggesting a lack of connectivity. We surmise that a direct displacement of the rich North Water ecosystem is not likely to occur. Overall our study supported the notion that the microbial eukaryotic community, which supports ecosystem function and secondary productivity is shaped by a balance of historic and current processes, which differed by seascape.

TI  - Long-duration fully autonomous operation of rotorcraft unmanned aerial systems for remote-sensing data acquisition
T2  - JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent applications of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to precision agriculture have shown increased ease and efficiency in data collection at precise remote locations. However, further enhancement of the field requires operation over long periods of time, for example, days or weeks. This has so far been impractical due to the limited flight times of such platforms and the requirement of humans in the loop for operation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fully autonomous rotorcraft UAS that is capable of performing repeated flights for long-term observation missions without any human intervention. We address two key technologies that are critical for such a system: full platform autonomy to enable mission execution independently from human operators and the ability of vision-based precision landing on a recharging station for automated energy replenishment. High-level autonomous decision making is implemented as a hierarchy of master and slave state machines. Vision-based precision landing is enabled by estimating the landing pad's pose using a bundle of AprilTag fiducials configured for detection from a wide range of altitudes. We provide an extensive evaluation of the landing pad pose estimation accuracy as a function of the bundle's geometry. The functionality of the complete system is demonstrated through two indoor experiments with duration of 11 and 10.6 hr, and one outdoor experiment with a duration of 4 hr. The UAS executed 16, 48, and 22 flights, respectively, during these experiments. In the outdoor experiment, the ratio between flying to collect data and charging was 1-10, which is similar to past work in this domain. All flights were fully autonomous with no human in the loop. To our best knowledge, this is the first research publication about the long-term outdoor operation of a quadrotor system with no human interaction.

TI  - Recent Incidence of Human Malaria Caused by <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> in the Villages in Kudat Peninsula, Sabah, Malaysia: Mapping of The Infection Risk Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Plasmodium knowlesi (Pk) is a malaria parasite that naturally infects macaque monkeys in Southeast Asia. Pk malaria, the zoonosis transmitted from the infected monkeys to the humans by Anopheles mosquito vectors, is now a serious health problem in Malaysian Borneo. To create a strategic plan to control Pk malaria, it is important to estimate the occurrence of the disease correctly. The rise of Pk malaria has been explained as being due to ecological changes, especially deforestation. In this research, we analysed the time-series satellite images of MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) of the Kudat Peninsula in Sabah and created the "Pk risk map" on which the Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) information was visualised. The case number of Pk malaria of a village appeared to have a correlation with the quantity of two specific LULC classes, the mosaic landscape of oil palm groves and the nearby land-use patches of dense forest, surrounding the village. Applying a Poisson multivariate regression with a generalised linear mixture model (GLMM), the occurrence of Pk malaria cases was estimated from the population and the quantified LULC distribution on the map. The obtained estimations explained the real case numbers well, when the contribution of another risk factor, possibly the occupation of the villagers, is considered. This implies that the occurrence of the Pk malaria cases of a village can be predictable from the population of the village and the LULC distribution shown around it on the map. The Pk risk map will help to assess the Pk malaria risk distributions quantitatively and to discover the hidden key factors behind the spread of this zoonosis.

TI  - Snow climatology for the mountains in the Iberian Peninsula using satellite imagery and simulations with dynamically downscaled reanalysis data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of a seasonal snowpack determines the hydrology, geomorphology and ecology of wide parts of the Iberian Peninsula, with strong implications for the economy, transport and risk management. Thus, reliable information on snow is necessary from a scientific and operational point of view. This is the case of the Iberian Peninsula where, lack of observation has impeded proper analysis of snowpack duration, magnitude and interannual variability. In this study, we present the first snow climatology of the entire Iberian Peninsula. The scarcity of in situ observations has been overcome, using a newly developed remote sensing snow database from MODIS satellite sensors for the period 2000-2014 and a physically based snow model (Factorial Snow Model-FSM), driven by a regional atmospheric model (Weather Research and Forecast model-WRF) over the Iberian Peninsula for the period 1980-2014. The snowpack of the main mountain areas (Pyrenees, Cantabrian, Central, Iberian range and Sierra Nevada) are described, estimated from the generated databases. The information has been processed using a k-means cluster algorithm, looking for similarities in snow indices at different elevation bands. Results show four different types of snowpack in terms of depth, duration and interannual variability, lying over different elevation bands in the different ranges, proving the variability of the snowpack over Iberia. Analyses reveal areas characterized by ephemeral snowpacks, while in some sectors snowpack lasts, on average, 198 days per year with 3.02 m of peak snow depth. The coefficient of variation of interannual peak snow depth oscillated between 35.2 and 162.4%. All the analysed indices show that at common elevations the Cantabrian range and the Pyrenees host the deepest and longest lasting snowpacks, followed by the Central and Iberian ranges. The Sierra Nevada exhibits the shortest, shallowest snowpack and more year-to-year variability.

TI  - <i>Leptospira</i> Seroprevalence Detection and Rabies Virus Absence in an Urban Raccoon (<i>Procyon lotor</i>) Population in a Highly Populated Area, Costa Rica
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Leptospirosis and rabies are zoonotic diseases of public health importance and endemic diseases in tropical countries such as Costa Rica. Peridomestic wild animals such as raccoons (Procyon lotor) have been implicated as competent hosts of Leptospira spirochetes and rabies virus. This study focused on understanding the role of urban raccoons in the dynamics of leptospirosis and rabies in a tropical environment. A total of 97 specimens of the common raccoon were captured within the Greater Metropolitan Area of Costa Rica; 32.6% (31/95) of raccoons presented evidence of antibodies (> 1: 100) against Leptospira sp. Attempts to cultivate Leptospira failed, but 19 serovars were identified, which are also responsible for causing disease in humans in Costa Rica. Detected titers ranged from 1: 100 to 1: 6400. Lymphoid hyperplasia in kidneys and spirochetes were demonstrated in 3 of 20 necropsied cases (15%). Twenty brain samples were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin stain for evidence of encephalitis and Negri body detection and simultaneously frozen brain material was employed to perform a rapid immunoassay test for rabies antigen. All tested samples were negative. This study is the first report of Leptospira seroprevalence in raccoons that cohabit urban areas in Costa Rica. We also highlight the importance of the raccoon as one of their natural competent host and sentinel animals within highly populated urban environments in tropical cities.

TI  - Development of an algorithm to detect methotrexate wrong frequency error using computerized health care data
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose We validated an algorithm to detect frequency errors in computerized healthcare data and estimated the incidence of these errors in an integrated healthcare system. Methods We applied Sentinel System analytic tools on the electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente, Northern California, January 1, 2010, through May 30, 2015,to identify rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with new use of methotrexate (365-day baseline period). We identified potential methotrexate frequency errors using ICD-9 code 995.20 (adverse drug event), Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 96409 for injection of leucovorin and prescription refill patterns. We performed chart review to confirm the frequency errors, assessed performance for detecting frequency errors, and estimated the incidence of chart-confirmed errors. Results The study included 24,529 methotrexate dispensings among 3,668 RA patients. Among these, 722 (3%) had one dispensing and 23,807 (97.1%) had >= 2 dispensings during 1-year follow-up period. We flagged 653 (2.7%) with a potential medication error (46 with one dispensing and 607 with >= 2 dispensings). We sampled 94 for chart review, and confirmed three methotrexate errors. All three confirmed frequency errors involved a first methotrexate dispensing followed by injected rescue therapy, leucovorin, (positive predictive value, 60%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15-95%). No potential errors were found among patients with >= 2 dispensings. We estimated the frequency error incidence among one methotrexate dispensing to be 0.4% (95%CI, 0.1% to 1.2%). Conclusion Rescue therapy is a specific indicator of methotrexate overdose among first methotrexate dispensings. This method is generalizable to other medications with serious adverse events treated with antidotes.

TI  - Comparing cultural theory and cultural cognition theory survey measures to each other and as explanations for judged risk
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Different approaches to operationalizing the cultural theory (CT) developed by Douglas, Thompson, Wildavsky, and others in survey research on risk perceptions are rarely compared, never for the same people outside of China. We compare for US respondents the construct validity of cultural worldview measures developed by Jenkins-Smith and colleagues-including both indices of items refining the Wildavsky and Dake approach, and short paragraphs (cultural 'statements')-to those developed by Kahan and colleagues based on cultural cognition theory (CCT). Correlational analyses reveal moderate convergent and discriminant validity among these measures, and along with regression analyses controlling for demographic variables similarly moderate predictive validity across measures for judgments of personal risk for 10 hazards. CT statements better discriminate between individualists and hierarchists, and CT indices explain more variance in judged risk (predictive validity) when controlling for demographic variables in regression analyses, but no cultural measure was consistently more predictive for the expected sign of regression coefficients. We discuss theoretical and methodological implications of our findings to foster further scholarly comparisons and improvements in these survey-based cultural approaches to explaining risk judgments.

TI  - Detection of Murine Astrovirus and <i>Myocoptes musculinus</i> in individually ventilated caging systems: Investigations to expose suitable detection methods for routine hygienic monitoring
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Murine Astrovirus is one of the most prevalent viral agents in laboratory rodent facilities worldwide, but its influence on biomedical research results is poorly examined. Due to possible influence on research results and high seroprevalence rates in mice, it appears useful to include this virus into routine health monitoring programs. In order to establish exhaust air particle PCR as a reliable detection method for Murine Astrovirus infections in mice kept in individually ventilated cages (IVC) and compare the method to sentinel mice monitoring regarding reproducibility and detection limit, we conducted a study with defined Murine Astrovirus cage prevalence. In parallel, the efficacy of both detection strategies (soiled-bedding sentinel (SBS) and exhaust air dust (EAD) analysis) was tested for Myocoptes musculinus. The fur mite was used as a reference organism during the whole study period to ensure the validity of this method. Because some publications already demonstrated successful detection of several pathogens, including murine fur mite species, via EAP-PCR. Detection of Murine Astrovirus infections at low prevalence is possible with both methods tested. Detection by exhaust air particles (EAP) is faster, more sensitive and more reliable compared to soiled bedding sentinels (SBS). Exhaust air particle PCR also detected the reference organism Myocoptes musculinus, which was not detected at all by sentinel mice, not even by high sensitivity fur swab qPCR. In conclusion, Murine Astrovirus can be detected by both exhaust air particle PCR and soiled bedding sentinels. We recommend exhaust air particle PCR as the better detection technique for Murine Astrovirus, because it is more reliable. Environmental samples are the method of choice for detection of Myocoptes musculinus because relying on soiled bedding sentinels harbors a big risk of missing existing infestations.

TI  - How China views North Korea's readiness to reform and its influence on China's North Korea policy in the post-Cold War era
T2  - PACIFIC REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - China's policy of restraint (avoidance of crippling economic sanctions) towards North Korean provocation is typically explained in terms of geopolitical concern with North Korean regime stability. The strategic and diplomatic costs of restraint would suggest the presence of non-geopolitical influences behind China's approach. Ideational explanations emphasise the persistence of shared socialist identity as well as the traditional Sino-centric worldview as shaping influences. There is much less detailed analysis of how China views North Korea's political economic evolution and how this view has changed over time to produce fluctuations in the bilateral relationship. In order to capture China's motivations more fully, I introduce two additional variables, namely China's view of the state of its own reform path (which provides the domestic context shaping policy towards North Korea), and the extent of North Korea's readiness to prioritise economic reform. I will then use these variables to explain two contrasting phases which represented the worst (1992-1999) and best (2009-2012) of times in the bilateral relationship in the post-Cold War era. These variables also help us to understand the potentials and limitations of the upturn in bilateral relations which has occurred since 2018.

TI  - [Construction and application of the surveillance system for schistosomiasis transmission risk in Sichuan Province].
T2  - Zhongguo xue xi chong bing fang zhi za zhi = Chinese journal of schistosomiasis control
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To build a schistosomiasis transmission risk surveillance system in Sichuan Province, so as to provide technical support for facilitating the progress towards schistosomiasis elimination in the province.METHODS: The surveillance sites for schistosomiasis transmission risk were assigned in 63 endemic counties (districts) of 11 cities (prefectures) in Sichuan Province. During the period from 2015 through 2018, wild feces contamination, the sources of Schistosoma japonicum infections (fever patients, livestock and wild animals), water infectivity in key settings, snail distribution in key settings, and snail breeding risk (snail importation and spread, floating debris carrying snails and snail breeding in ecological wetlands) were monitored in the surveillance sites.RESULTS: From 2015 to 2018, a total of 1 636 wild faces were detected in Sichuan Province, and 3 faces were positive for S. japonicum, with a 0.18% positive rate; among 3 995 livestock and 59 wild mice monitored, no S. japonicum infection was detected. A total of 49 414 fever patients were monitored in 2018, and 493 were seropositive for S. japonicum infection; then, 445 seropositives were subjected to stool examinations, and no egg-positives were found. From 2010 to 2018, a total of 93 sentinel sites were assigned, and 3 994 sentinel mice were placed for monitoring the water infectivity, with one S. japonicum-infected mouse detected. Between 2015 and 2018, a total of 4 156 key settings were investigated covering an area of 1 998.46 hm2, and 668 settings were detected with snails (16.07%), covering an area of 193.26 hm2; 497 suspected settings with a likelihood of snail importation with plant introduction were monitored from 2017 to 2018, and 65 settings with snails were found with 2 673 snails captured; 593 sites were assigned to collect the floating debris from 2017 to 2018, and 9 191.39 kg floating debris were collected with 186 snails captured; 4 wetlands were monitored for the risk of schistosomiasis transmission from 2013 to 2015, and snail breeding was found in 2 wetlands. No S. japonicum infection was identified in snails captured from all surveillance sites.CONCLUSIONS: A sensitive and effective schistosomiasis transmission risk surveillance system has been successfully established in Sichuan Province. There is still a risk of schistosomiasis transmission risk in local areas of Sichuan Province. Therefore, the integrated schistosomiasis control measures with emphasis on the control of the source of S. japonicum infections should be further intensified, and snail monitoring and control and monitoring and control of schistosomiasis in wetlands should be also intensified.

TI  - Net carbon emissions from African biosphere dominate pan-tropical atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> signal
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical ecosystems are large carbon stores that are vulnerable to climate change. The sparseness of ground-based measurements has precluded verification of these ecosystems being a net annual source (+ve) or sink (-ve) of atmospheric carbon. We show that two independent satellite data sets of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), interpreted using independent models, are consistent with the land tropics being a net annual carbon emission of (median(minimum)(maximum)) 1.03(-0.20)(+1.73) and 1.60(+1.39)(+2.11) petagrams (PgC) in 2015 and 2016, respectively. These pan-tropical estimates reflect unexpectedly large net emissions from tropical Africa of 1.48(+0.80)(+1.95) PgC in 2015 and 1.65(+1.14)(+2.42) PgC in 2016. The largest carbon uptake is over the Congo basin, and the two loci of carbon emissions are over western Ethiopia and western tropical Africa, where there are large soil organic carbon stores and where there has been substantial land use change. These signals are present in the space-borne CO2 record from 2009 onwards.

A1  - Working Grp PIDIRAC Sentinel Surve
TI  - Assessment of two complementary influenza surveillance systems: sentinel primary care influenza-like illness versus severe hospitalized laboratory-confirmed influenza using the moving epidemic method
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Monitoring seasonal influenza epidemics is the corner stone to epidemiological surveillance of acute respiratory virus infections worldwide. This work aims to compare two sentinel surveillance systems within the Daily Acute Respiratory Infection Information System of Catalonia (PIDIRAC), the primary care ILI and Influenza confirmed samples from primary care (PIDIRAC-ILI and PIDIRAC-FLU) and the severe hospitalized laboratory confirmed influenza system (SHLCI), in regard to how they behave in the forecasting of epidemic onset and severity allowing for healthcare preparedness. Methods Epidemiological study carried out during seven influenza seasons (2010-2017) in Catalonia, with data from influenza sentinel surveillance of primary care physicians reporting ILI along with laboratory confirmation of influenza from systematic sampling of ILI cases and 12 hospitals that provided data on severe hospitalized cases with laboratory-confirmed influenza (SHLCI-FLU). Epidemic thresholds for ILI and SHLCI-FLU (overall) as well as influenza A (SHLCI-FLUA) and influenza B (SHLCI-FLUB) incidence rates were assessed by the Moving Epidemics Method. Results Epidemic thresholds for primary care sentinel surveillance influenza-like illness (PIDIRAC-ILI) incidence rates ranged from 83.65 to 503.92 per 100.000 h. Paired incidence rate curves for SHLCI -FLU / PIDIRAC-ILI and SHLCI-FLUA/ PIDIRAC-FLUA showed best correlation index' (0.805 and 0.724 respectively). Assessing delay in reaching epidemic level, PIDIRAC-ILI source forecasts an average of 1.6 weeks before the rest of sources paired. Differences are higher when SHLCI cases are paired to PIDIRAC-ILI and PIDIRAC-FLUB although statistical significance was observed only for SHLCI-FLU/PIDIRAC-ILI (p-value Wilcoxon test = 0.039). Conclusions The combined ILI and confirmed influenza from primary care along with the severe hospitalized laboratory confirmed influenza data from PIDIRAC sentinel surveillance system provides timely and accurate syndromic and virological surveillance of influenza from the community level to hospitalization of severe cases.

TI  - Clear-sky ultraviolet radiation modelling using output from the Chemistry Climate Model Initiative
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We have derived values of the ultraviolet index (UVI) at solar noon using the Tropospheric Ultraviolet Model (TUV) driven by ozone, temperature and aerosol fields from climate simulations of the first phase of the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI-1). Since clouds remain one of the largest uncertainties in climate projections, we simulated only the clear-sky UVI. We compared the modelled UVI climatologies against present-day climatological values of UVI derived from both satellite data (the OMI-Aura OMUVBd product) and ground-based measurements (from the NDACC network). Depending on the region, relative differences between the UVI obtained from CCMI/TUV calculations and the ground-based measurements ranged between - 5.9 % and 10.6 %.We then calculated the UVI evolution throughout the 21st century for the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5). Compared to 1960s values, we found an average increase in the UVI in 2100 (of 2 %-4 %) in the tropical belt (30 degrees N-30 degrees S). For the mid-latitudes, we observed a 1.8 % to 3.4 % increase in the Southern Hemisphere for RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 6.0 and found a 2.3 % decrease in RCP 8.5. Higher increases in UVI are projected in the Northern Hemisphere except for RCP 8.5. At high latitudes, ozone recovery is well identified and induces a complete return of mean UVI levels to 1960 values for RCP 8.5 in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, UVI levels in 2100 are higher by 0.5 % to 5.5 % for RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 6.0 and they are lower by 7.9 % for RCP 8.5.We analysed the impacts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) on UVI from 1960 by comparing CCMI sensitivity simulations (1960-2100) with fixed GHGs or ODSs at their respective 1960 levels. As expected with ODS fixed at their 1960 levels, there is no large decrease in ozone levels and consequently no sudden increase in UVI levels. With fixed GHG, we observed a delayed return of ozone to 1960 values, with a corresponding pattern of change observed on UVI, and looking at the UVI difference between 2090s values and 1960s values, we found an 8 % increase in the tropical belt during the summer of each hemisphere.Finally we show that, while in the Southern Hemisphere the UVI is mainly driven by total ozone column, in the Northern Hemisphere both total ozone column and aerosol optical depth drive UVI levels, with aerosol optical depth having twice as much influence on the UVI as total ozone column does.

TI  - Embodied Reasons in the Public Sphere: The Example of the Hijab
T2  - STUDIES IN CHRISTIAN ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In public debates on moral or political issues between participants from different religious backgrounds, liberal and secular thinkers like John Rawls and Jurgen Habermas recommend to restrict oneself to free-standing reasons that are independent of their religious, social or cultural origin. Following German philosopher Matthias Jung, however, I argue that such reasons fall short of describing the relevance of the issue in question for the adherents of a specific religion or worldview. Referring to the debates in several European countries about the hijab, I am showing how a deeper understanding of reasons as embodied in social practices and as embodied in individual biographies can help to disentangle such debates and to facilitate a dialogue on these issues.

TI  - Semiaquatic mammals might be intermediate hosts to spread avian influenza viruses from avian to human
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Avian influenza A viruses (ATVs) can occasionally transmit to mammals and lead to the development of human pandemic. A species of mammal is considered as a mixing vessel in the process of host adaptation. So far, pigs are considered as a plausible intermediate host for the generation of human pandemic strains, and are labelled 'mixing vessels'. In this study, through the analysis of two professional databases, the Influenza Virus Resource of NCBI and the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID), we found that the species of mink (Neovison vison) can be infected by more subtypes of influenza A viruses with considerably higher alpha-diversity related indices. It suggested that the semiaquatic mammals (riverside mammals), rather than pigs, might be the intermediate host to spread ATVs and serve as a potential mixing vessel for the interspecies transmission among birds, mammals and human. In epidemic areas, minks, possibly some other semiaquatic mammals as well, could be an important sentinel species for influenza surveillance and early warning.

TI  - Unsupervised classification of lava flows in Harrat Lunayyir using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Mapping of lava flows based on remote sensing data of high accuracy has become a common tool for exploring volcanic eruptions in greater detail. Mapping data based on remote sensing data provides information on the location and flow direction of lava flows as well as their areas and enables the localisation of volcanic vents-valuable knowledge for pre- and post-eruption volcanic activity and behaviour estimations. The current research seeks to expand the understanding of the volcanic and tectonic processes in Harrat Lunayyir, Saudi Arabia. In view of this, remote sensing data was classified using iterative self-organising data analysis technique (ISODATA) algorithms. The aim of the classification is to identify spectral top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance values to distinguish layers of old and recent lava flows based on differences. As a result, three distinct basaltic units were identified to have the following ages: 15.1 +/- 6.1 ka (4%), 15.0 +/- 8.4 ka (6%), and 14.6 +/- 23.1 ka (10%). The differences in the calculated areas of the lava flows as mapped based on the remote sensing data and earlier modelling are captured and identified in relation to the local geomorphologic and geologic structures. The differences can be partly explained as being related to a considerable weathering of the observed geological formations at 800-1600 nm, with reflectance of 12%. The limitation of the methodology relates to the lack of accurate geochronological timeline, that is, an inability to identify accurate age of the samples.

TI  - Involuntary Hero: Otakar Ostrcil and his Biographer Zdenek Nejedly
T2  - JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The principal biographer of the Czech composer and conductor Otakar Ostrcil (1879-1935) was Zdenek Nejedly (1878-1962), an influential musicologist and a politician who held many state offices after World War II, including serving as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party in the position of Minister of Culture and Education. Two trends in Nejedly's writing about Ostrcil can be observed. The first one, summarized in Nejedly's book on Ostrcil, focused on the composer's place in the development of Czech music as an heir of Smetana. The second, formulated in numerous articles and gaining strength after Ostrcil's death, pointed out connections between the composer's work and a communist or socialist worldview. In both cases, Nejedly was creating links between purely musical aspects of Ostrcil's music and more general issues: for example, Nejedly saw Ostrcil's last opera, Johnny's Kingdom (1934), as a model for the future structure of society. The relation between these two viewpoints presents a striking case of a biographer using his subject as a vehicle for his own ideas.

TI  - A change detection method using spatial-temporal-spectral information from Landsat images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data and techniques are reliable tools for monitoring land cover and land-use change. For time-series change detection algorithms, detecting the breakpoints accurately is the key element. However, the current state-of-art algorithms are vulnerable to cloud/cloud shadow or noises in the time-series imagery. The objective of this study is to develop a new method to detect land cover change using Landsat imagery by integrating temporal, spectral and spatial information to increase the accuracy of breakpoints detection. In the temporal dimension, the time-series model is decomposed into seasonality and trend. Due to different land cover types corresponding to different seasonal characteristics, breakpoints exist only in the seasonal component. In the spectral dimension, two-step judgement is applied. The first judgement detects a change when the seasonal breakpoint positions are the same in different spectral bands. The second judgement involves detecting a changed pixel when the classification result indicates different types on either side of the breakpoint. In the spatial dimension, neighbour information is utilized to control the false-positive rate. Experimental results using all available Landsat images acquired between 2001 and 2006 in Kansas City, US, illustrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed approach. All pixels were used for assessing the classification and change detection accuracy compared with National Land Cover Database products. The overall accuracy of classification into eight categories was about 81% and the accuracy of change detection was 88%. Maps of timing of breaks and change times are also provided in this article.

TI  - Mapping of lineaments for groundwater assessment in the Desert Fringes East El-Minia, Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eocene aquifer system in Egypt is an important source of water to meet the increasing necessities of the agricultural, drinking, and domestic purposes. This study aimed to assess the impact of the hydro-structural features identified as lineaments on the groundwater occurrence, assess the water quality status for various purposes, and provide useful information for future management. To achieve this, Landsat images have been used in conjunction with the chemical data (major, trace ions, and physicochemical parameters) and statistical analysis. The hydrochemical facies showed that the water samples belong to (1) Ca-HCO3; (2) mixed facies CaMgHCO3 and mixed CaNaHCO3, and (3) Na-Cl hydrochemical facies. The water chemistry is controlled by the carbonate weathering, ion exchange, and evaporite dissolution. The groundwater analysis has indicated that the water is suitable for drinking purposes when compared with the drinking water standards. Furthermore, salinity, electric conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and sodium percentage (%Na) assessment show that majority of the groundwater samples are appropriate for irrigation. The satellite imagery of the area has been analyzed to determine the orientation, density, and intersection. The orientation of the lineaments is well-confirmed with regional structural setting; in addition, density maps show that the density is high throughout the study area. The results reflect a correlation between the lineaments and the hydrologic phenomena. The statistical analysis with the one-way ANOVA confirmed the importance of lineaments as explanatory variable for the observed variation in water quality. This in turn supported that the fracture is structurally controlled and mostly influences both the occurrence and quality

TI  - Gramsci's critique of Croce on the Catholic Church
T2  - HISTORY OF EUROPEAN IDEAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Antonio Gramsci rigorously analysed the modern transformation of the Catholic Church and its strategy to spread its worldview to the Italian masses through secular means. His critique of the Church largely drew on his examination of the grounds that ensured Croce's critique was doomed to failure. Despite its harshness, Croce's critique failed because he did not grasp that the main target of the Church's strategy was the common sense of the masses, while Croce pursued his critique in a highly idealist manner, appealing only to his fellow intellectuals. He thereby, according to Gramsci, helped to reinforce the Church's strategy by endorsing the rigid separation between the intellectuals and the masses. In contrast, unlike Croce and orthodox Marxism, Gramsci did not dismiss religion as a mere absurdity, recognising it as a source of people's common sense that, albeit confusing in nature, informed their worldview. Gramsci considered that even the common sense of the masses constituted an appropriate grasp of the world, or 'good sense'. In this sense, Gramsci's critique of religion echoed his preoccupation with the longstanding division of Italian society between the intellectuals and the masses, which prevented mass participation in politics.

TI  - SPECT/CT and fusion ultrasound to target the efferent groin lymph node for lymphatic surgery
T2  - MICROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Pelvic lymphadenectomy (PL) causes changes to the inguinal lymph nodes with progressive loss of immune and lymphatic pump function. Efferent lymphatic vessel-to-venous anastomosis (ELVA) has been reported to address this problem. The aim of this report was to describe the feasibility of the SPECT/CT combined with ultrasound fusion imaging (UFI) to target the groin efferent lymph node (GELN) for ELVA. Patients and Methods Twelve patients with lower limb lymphedema after PL were scheduled for peripheric lymphaticovenular anastomosis (LVA) combined with ELVA. All-patients were clinically ISL-stage1, with good visualization of the inguinal lymph nodes at preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. The mean patient age was 55.4 years and the mean BMI was 25.5.The mean limb circumference (MLC) was calculated before surgery and 1 year after surgery. The LymQoL-Leg questionnaire was administered before surgery and 6 months after surgery. Before surgery, the GELN was identified by SPECT/CT and its location was marked on the skin by UFI virtual navigation. Peripheric LVA sites were planned by ultrasound and indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography. Pre and postoperative MLC and LymQoL-Leg scores were compared. Results In all-patients, the SPECT/CT succeeded at detecting and targeting the GELN. In all-patients, real-time anatomical coregistration with US was feasible, and it was possible to mark on the groin skin the depth and position of the GELN on the skin at the groin. During surgery, in every patient, we found the GELN marked before surgery and performed ELVA. We also performed two or three peripheric LVAs in every patient. The mean value of MLC decreased (38.2 +/- 2.13 cm vs. 36.33 +/- 2.14 cm; p = .04) and the mean score of the LymQoL-Leg questionnaire improved (9.3 +/- 1.7 vs. 7.7 +/- 1.1; p = .02). Conclusion SPECT/CT combined with UFI is feasible for the preoperative identification of GELN for ELVA.

T2  - Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To understand the seasonality and etiological characteristics of infectious diarrhea in adults from Shanghai. Methods: Adult patients with diarrhea who had visited the enteric disease clinics in 22 hospitals that carrying on the Diarrhea Comprehensive Surveillance sentinel programs in Shanghai during 2014-2017, were surveyed. Stool specimens were collected according to the different intervals of sampling and detected for 12 bacteria and 5 viruses. Concentration ratio and circular distribution method were used for data analysis. Results: From 2014 to 2017, a total of 9 573 stool specimens were collected from the targeted diarrhea patients ≥18 years old (n=96 067), through the Shanghai Diarrhea Comprehensive Surveillance program. The positive rate of detection was 46.44%. Seasonal peaks of infectious diarrhea were both seen in summer (bacteria peak, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, etc.) and in winter (virus peak, Norovirus, etc.). Both bacterial and viral infections presented seasonal concentration (Raleigh's test P<0.001) but more obvious with bacterial infection. Viral infection accounted for 60.19% of the cause of infectious diarrhea. The top five predominant pathogens appeared as Norovirus, Rotavirus, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Salmonella spp.. Conclusions: Among the adult outpatients with infectious diarrhea in Shanghai, obvious seasonality was seen, with peaks in both summer and winter. Viral infection with Norovirus in particular, appeared as the predominant source of infection. Active, continuous and comprehensive diarrhea-related surveillance programs would be able to monitor the changing dynamic of pathogen spectrum, and lead to the adoption of targeted preventive measures.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to examine the demographic characteristics, HIV related knowledge and behavior, correlates of bisexual behavior and status of HIV infection among men who have sex with men only (MSMO) and men who have sex with both men and women (MSMW) in Shandong province. Methods: According to the requirements from "National HIV/AIDS sentinel surveillance program" , a cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect information on demographics, sexual and drug use behaviors, and HIV-related services among MSM in nine sentinel surveillance sites from April to July in 2018. Blood samples were drawn for serological tests on both HIV and syphilis antibodies. Results: A total of 3 474 participants were included in this study. Related information on these participants would include: average age as (31.66±9.01) years; 35.06% (1 218) married or cohabiting with a woman, 50.52% (1 755) had college or higher education, 80.11% (2 783) self-identified as gays and 14.22% (494) self-identified as bisexual men,16.87% (586) ever having sex with woman in the past 6 months, 10.51% (365) ever using drugs. HIV and syphilis prevalence rates were 2.99% (104/3 474) and 2.76%(96/3 474). Through multivariable logistic models, MSMW were more likely to be ≥35 years of age, local residents, self-identified as heterosexual/bisexual/uncertain, ever having commercial sex with man but less likely to consistently use condoms in the past 6 months, less using internet/dating software to find male sex partners and less using drugs. There was no significant differences noticed in the following areas: number of sexual partners in the last week, condom use in the last six months with commercial sex partners, with HIV or syphilis infection and self-reported history of STD in the past year between MSMO and MSMW (P>0.05). HIV-infected MSM were more likely to have the following features, ≥45 years of age, non-local residents, finding male sex partners from the bothhouses, park/toilets or from the internet/dating software, also less likely to consistently use condoms in the past 6 months, using drugs or with syphilis infection. Conclusions: High prevalence of bisexual behavior as well as higher risk of HIV infection were noticed among MSM in Shandong province. It is important to strengthen related surveillance and effective intervention programs for MSM with different characteristics in Shandong province.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the epidemiologic characteristics of Norovirus among adult patients suffering from infectious diarrhea in Shanghai, so as to provide evidence for developing related strategies on prevention and control of the disease. Methods: Diarrheal outpatients were monitored at the 'Intestinal clinic' from 22 hospitals involved in the sentinel surveillance program in Shanghai. Information on demographic and epidemiologic features of the patients was collected while data and clinical, fecal specimens were collected and sent to the district CDC for Norovirus detection. Positive rates of Norovirus were also compared in various populations and seasons during 2013-2018. Multivariate logistic regression model was adopted to fit into the comparisons between non-Norovirus and Norovirus groups. Results: 19.28% of the 12 083 diarrheal cases were found to have carried the Norovirus, with GⅡgroup the most commonly identified genotype. Rates of detection was seen higher in males (20.78%) than in females (17.73%). 30-44 year-old were found having the highest positive rate (21.51%). The positive rates were found the highest (23.60%) in the year of 2015. All the above shown differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). Diarrheal patients affected with Norovirus would present watery stool (75.94%) and vomiting (35.84%). Data from the multivariate logistic analysis showed that factors as: being males, 30-44 years old, officials/clerks, in winter season and with histories of travelling etc., were related to higher risks on Norovirus infection. Conclusions: Infectious diarrhea caused by Norovirus occurred all year round, with seasonal peaks seen in winter and spring, in Shanghai. Specific prevention and control measures should be taken on Norovirus- caused infectious diarrhea, according to the difference on age, gender and season.

TI  - Improving LEO precise orbit determination with BDS PCV calibration
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the new members of the Chinese Fengyun-3 meteorological satellites series, the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) and Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellites were launched in 2013 and 2017, respectively. For the first time, both FY-3C and FY-3D satellites carry a high-precision BDS and GPS dual-system space-borne receiver to fulfill their stringent requirement of precise orbit determination (POD). The fusion of BDS and GPS onboard observations can significantly improve the spatial geometry, robustness and reliability of low earth orbit (LEO) POD. In order to achieve high-quality orbit recovery from the onboard GNSS observations, the in-flight calibration of phase center variation (PCV) is a prerequisite. In this contribution, we calibrate the BDS PCV for improving the orbit precision of both FY-3C and FY-3D satellites for the first time. The results show that with the GPS PCV corrections, the residuals of GPS carrier phase observations present a reduction of about 17.6% and 21.9% for FY-3C and FY-3D satellites, respectively, and overlap differences of the GPS-only orbit are reduced on average by 3 and 5 mm. After correcting for BDS PCV, the GPS and BDS combined (GC) POD achieves a better orbit precision for both FY-3C and FY-3D satellites. The application of BDS PCV corrections can contribute to a reduction of up to 12% in BDS phase residuals and a decrease of up to 3 mm in orbit overlap differences in 1-dimension. It indicates that the introduction of the BDS PCV model can significantly improve the orbit precision. Similar orbit precision can be achieved when using the GPS PCV model to replace the BDS PCV model in the GC POD. It demonstrates that for onboard receivers, the GPS PCV model can be used to correct PCV errors of BDS signals, which is commonly used in precise point positioning of ground stations when the BDS PCV is not available. Furthermore, we find that it is feasible to generate an integrated PCV model from both onboard BDS and GPS observations. After application of the integrated PCV model, the FY-3C and FY-3D orbits of GC POD present a better precision than the solution using the single-system PCV model and the largest precision improvement of about 1 mm can be recognized in the radial component. With such a high-quality orbit, FY-3C and FY-3D satellites can be expected to make more contributions to meteorological studies and applications.

AB  - Objective: To understand the epidemiological characteristics and antibiotic resistance profiles of Campylobacter spp. in Shanghai from 2013 to 2016. Methods: Stool samples collected from diarrhea outpatients were cultured for Campylobacter spp., using the membrane filter method in 23 hospitals under the sentinel programs, from 2013 to 2016. All the strains were identified by biochemical tests and PCR. Broth microdilution method was used to investigate the antibiotic resistance of 179 Campylobacter spp. strains that including azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, telycin, klinthromycin and flurbenicol. Results: A total of 179 Campylobacter spp. strains were isolated from 10 444 stool samples (1.7%). Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli appeared as the predominant ones (94.4% and 5.6%). The incidence rate was higher in children than that in adults, with peaks of infections mainly from April to June and October to December. Campylobacter jejuni strains seemed highly resistant to ciprofloxacin (96.4%), tetracycline (83.4%) and nalidixic acid (81.7%). The resistant rates appeared higher on Campylobacter coli strains that isolated from patients. Some strains were resistant to multi-drugs. Conclusions: Campylobacter spp. seemed one of the important pathogens that isolated from outpatients with diarrhea, in Shanghai. Both age and season related characteristics of Campylobacter spp. were seen. Campylobacter spp. isolated from patients was highly resistant to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and nalidixic acid.

TI  - Detecting global irrigated areas by using satellite and reanalysis products
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the importance of irrigation in meeting the world's food demand and as an essential human modification to water and energy cycles, the reliable extent and distribution of the global irrigated areas remain undefined. In this study, an intuitive method is proposed, based on the aftereffects of irrigation, to detect global irrigated areas by combining satellite and reanalysis datasets. The proposed methodology assumes that irrigation is an unmodeled land surface process, while satellite observations can effectively detect irrigation signals in near real-time. The spatial extents of irrigation were derived by calculating the difference between the remotely sensed and reanalysis datasets. To detect the irrigated areas, three irrigation-dependent variables, soil moisture (SM), land surface temperature (LST), and surface albedo (A(L)), were used. In the absence of reliable ground truths, the proposed irrigation map was compared to the commonly used global irrigation maps, namely Global Map of Irrigated areas, Global Irrigated Area Map, and recently developed Global Irrigated Areas by Meier et al. (2018). Individual detection by SM, LST, and A(L) has disarpandes in detecting irrigation signals in highly irrigated, urbanized, and semi-arid regions. However, by combining the individual detection maps, the proposed method showed reasonable agreement with the reference irrigated maps overlapping with approximately 70% of the irrigated areas. We believe that the proposed method, as stand-alone or in combination with the existing irrigation maps, will benefit the studies regarding water and energy balance closure in near-real time for large-scale land surface models by minimizing the uncertainties in model parameterization.

TI  - Consistent temperature dependence of functional response parameters and their use in predicting population abundance
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is one of the greatest threats to the persistence of populations: increased metabolic demands should strengthen pairwise species interactions, which could destabilize food webs at the higher organizational levels. Quantifying the temperature dependence of consumer-resource interactions is thus essential for predicting ecological responses to warming. We explored feeding interactions between different predator-prey pairs in controlled-temperature chambers and in a system of naturally heated streams. We found consistent temperature dependence of attack rates across experimental settings, though the magnitude and activation energy of attack rate were specific to each predator, which varied in mobility and foraging mode. We used these parameters along with metabolic rate measurements to estimate energetic efficiency and population abundance with warming. Energetic efficiency accurately estimated field abundance of a mobile predator that struggled to meet its metabolic demands, but was a poor predictor for a sedentary predator that operated well below its energetic limits. Temperature effects on population abundance may thus be strongly dependent on whether organisms are regulated by their own energy intake or interspecific interactions. Given the widespread use of functional response parameters in ecological modelling, reconciling outcomes from laboratory and field studies increases the confidence and precision with which we can predict warming impacts on natural systems.

TI  - Shadow detection using object area-based and morphological filtering for very high-resolution satellite imagery of urban areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of shadows in remote sensing images leads to misinterpretation of objects and a wrong discrimination of the targets of interest, therefore, limiting the use of several imaging applications. An automatic area-based approach for shadow detection is proposed, which combines spatial and spectral features into a unified and flexible approach. Potential shadow-pixels candidates are identified using morphological-based operators, in particular, black-top-hat transformations as well as area injunction strategies as computed by the well-established normalized saturation-value difference index. The obtained output is a shadow mask, refined in the last step of our method in order to reduce misclassified pixels. Experiments over a large dataset formed by more than 200 scenes of very high-resolution images covering the metropolitan urban area of Sao Paulo city are performed, where the images are collected from the WorldView-2 (WV-2) and Pleiades-1B (PL-1B) sensors. As verified by an extensive battery of tests, the proposed method provides a good level of discrimination between shadow and non-shadow pixels, with an overall accuracy up to 94.2%, for WV-2, and 90.84%, for PL-1B. Comparative results also attested that the designed approach is very competitive against representative state-of-the-art methods and it can be used for further shadow removal-dependent applications.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Earth systems models require gridded land surface properties to compute fluxes of water, energy, and carbon within the landscape and to the atmosphere. However, most parameter sets contain time-invariant properties despite their known variability. Here we present new MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based land surface parameters (MOD-LSP) formatted for the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model that account for seasonal and interannual variability and longer-term change over the continental United States, Mexico, and southern Canada at 0.0625 degrees spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution. MOD-LSP improves over previously-available parameter sets via: (1) land cover maps of higher native spatial resolution; (2) multiple versions corresponding to the land cover of years 1992, 2001, and 2011; (3) spatially-explicit mean annual cycles of land surface properties, including leaf area index, canopy fraction, and albedo, derived from 17 years of observations; and (4) additional 17-year time series of these properties. The MOD-LSP parameters are useful as inputs to the VIC model, as an example land surface scheme, to assess the hydrologic impacts of land cover change from interannual to decadal scales; and as stand-alone datasets characterizing the temporal variability of these properties as a function of land cover class.

TI  - Changing pattern of urban landscape and its effect on land surface temperature in and around Delhi
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The last couple of decades have seen remarkable spatial growth in the urban areas of developing countries. The process of urbanization is directly linked with land transformation which can be an effective way to monitor the spatio-temporal pattern of urban growth. New Delhi, the capital city of India has experienced a large-scale urban growth during the last decade. In order to identify the pattern of urban expansion in and around Delhi, the present study aims to assess the process of land transformation using multi-temporal Landsat datasets (1977-2014). The areas under various land use and land cover (LULC) extracted by support vector machine (SVM) hybrid classifier reveal asignificant change in the LULC pattern of the area. A good agreement was found between field-based information and maps generated using satellite images (kappa >= 0.84). Land transformation maps indicate rapid growth of few urban centres located outside Delhi National Capital Territory (NCT), like Gurgaon, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Faridabad and Ghaziabad. These centres have been remarkably expanded because of transformation of agricultural and vegetated lands. However, green patches within the city have not been affected by the consequences of urbanization. In tune with the rapid urbanization in the periurban centres of Delhi, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS)-derived land surface temperature (LST) images revealed significant change in the level of LST. The inter-relationship of impervious surface fraction (ISF) and LST proves a good agreement between them. The increasing trend observed in the long-term (1987-2011) summer temperature data obtained from India Meteorological Department (IMD) indicates the rise of mean summer temperature in the last few decades. Land transformation along with rapid urbanization especially in the periurban areas of Delhi NCT played a key role in the increasing trend of surface temperature.

TI  - The Utility of Near-Infrared Fluorescence and Indocyanine Green During Robotic Pulmonary Resection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - During minimally invasive pulmonary resection, it is often difficult to localize pulmonary nodules that are small (<2 cm), low-density/subsolid on imaging, or deep to the visceral pleura. The use of near-infrared fluorescence (NIF) imaging for localizing pulmonary nodules using indocyanine green (ICG) contrast is an emerging technology that is increasingly utilized during pulmonary resection. When administered via electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB), ICG can accurately localize pulmonary nodules. When injected intravenously (IV), ICG can also help delineate the intersegmental plane. Research is ongoing regarding the utility of ICG for identification of the sentinel lymph node in lung cancer.

TI  - Size distributions of slums across the globe using different data and classification methods
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 900 million people worldwide live in slums. These slums mainly can be found in cities of the global south and are characterized by poor living conditions and usually insufficient access to basic infrastructure such as water or energy. In order to improve the living conditions of slum inhabitants, information about the number, location and size of the slums is required to plan supply infrastructure. We therefore identify morphological slums in eight different cities in Africa, South America and Asia, using remote sensing data and analyse their size distributions. We show that 84.6% of all observed morphological slums have a size between 0.001 and 0.1 km(2). These results rely on a consistent approach using a clear ontology and conceptual frame for classification. However, classification methods for these underserved areas differ. We show slum classifications based on different methods reveal a strong dependency between the particular method and the resulting size distribution. The study shows the relevance of remote sensing for the investigation of slums and the results can be used for infrastructure planning, as infrastructure improvement projects are often limited to the large known slums. Whereas, the large number of small slums distributed across the city is often neglected.

TI  - Forest management and sustainable urban development in the Curonian Spit
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - A major challenge in forest management is to balance the competing interests of different users. The conservation of biological diversity is an important goal when managing forests in an ecologically sustainable way, but this overlooks aspects of sustainability in terms of urban development and other land use. This research examines physical and biological processes leading to changes in the spatial and temporal land cover on the Curonian Spit, in Lithuania, pre- and post-1990 when the political situation changed heralding new practices. Specifically, the levels of cover categorised as vegetation, sand, forest, urban and grassland are determined using remote sensing images over the period 1989-2017. An assessment of the accuracy of the analysis, when compared with Google Earth, other images and in situ data, produces a high level of confidence in the results. The analysis indicates that the overall forest cover initially decreased until 2009, but since then it has increased by over 1% per year. No urban growth is observed. These and other results are displayed graphically. The forestation of moving dunes, the human impact on the area and changes in the environment are all discussed. The results demonstrate how remote sensing and GIS methods can be used as an important tool for planners, dispensing with the need for costly field trips.

TI  - Accuracy assessment of MODIS land aerosol optical thickness algorithms using AERONET measurements over North America
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The planned simultaneous availability of visible and near-IR observations from the geostationary platforms of Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) 16/17 Advanced Base Imager (ABI) will present the opportunity of deriving an accurate aerosol product taking advantage of both ABI's high spatial resolution in the visible range and TEMPO's sensitivity to aerosol absorption in the near-UV range. Because the wavelengths of ABI are similar to those of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), existing aerosol algorithms of MODIS can be applied to ABI observations. In this work, we evaluate three distinct aerosol algorithms of MODIS deriving aerosol optical thickness (AOT) over land surfaces using visible and near-IR observations. The Dark Target (DT), Deep Blue (DB), and Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithms are all applied to the radiance measurements of MODIS on board the Aqua satellite. We have evaluated each algorithm by comparing the satellite-retrieved AOT to space-time collocated ground-based sun photometer measurements of the same parameter at 171 sites of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) over North America (NA). A spatiotemporal scheme collocating the satellite retrievals with the ground-based measurements was applied consistently to all three retrieval datasets. We find that the statistical performance of all three algorithms is comparable over darker surfaces over eastern NA with the MAIAC algorithm providing relatively better comparison over western NA sites characterized by inhomogeneous elevation and bright surfaces. The higher spatial resolution of the MAIAC product (1 km) allows a substantially larger number of matchups than DB 10 km and DT 10 km (DT 3 km) products by 115% and 120% (86 %), respectively, over eastern NA and by 150% and 220%(197 %) over western NA. The characterization of the error in AOT for the three aerosol products as a function of bidirectional surface reflectance derived from both MAIAC and an independent MOD09 atmospheric correction shows a systematic positive bias in DT retrievals over brighter surfaces, whereas DB and MAIAC retrievals show no such bias throughout the wide range of surface brightness, with MAIAC offering the lowest spread in errors. The results reported here represent an objective, unbiased evaluation of existing over-land aerosol retrieval algorithms of MODIS. The detailed statistical evaluation of the performance of each of these three algorithms may be used as guidance in the development of inversion schemes to derive aerosol properties from ABI or other MODIS-like sensors.

TI  - SUSM: a scenario-based urban growth simulation model using remote sensing data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The introduction of the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy in 1991 made India one of the fastest growing economies in the world. This has had a profound effect on India's urbanization. The rapid urbanization of Indian cities poses a threat to natural and social environments, as expansion of the cities often outpaces the urban planning process. Thus, smart and strategic planning processes that use current and easily available datasets in combination with future urbanization scenarios are needed. To this end, we developed the scenario-based urban growth simulation model (SUSM), which can be used for impact analysis of different planning measures in both spatial and temporal contexts. SUSM uses remote sensing derived inputs, such as land use maps, slope, roads and centres of urban areas along with urban development scenarios. It uses logistic regression for calibration and a constrained stochastic cellular automaton for simulation of urban growth. SUSM is tested in one of the fastest growing urban agglomerations of India: The Pune metropolis, which covers an area of 1642 km(2). SUSM is calibrated using urban growth maps derived from LANDSAT satellite images from 1992 to 2001. Subsequently, SUSM was used to simulate urban growth of Pune for 2013. A comparison of the SUSM simulation result with the actually measured urban growth derived from a LANDSAT 8 scene from 2013 is used to validate SUSM and to assess the effect of urban plans upon the growth of Pune. Our results show that: (i) SUSM is capable of predicting the location of future urbanization with an accuracy of 79% and a fuzzy kappa index of agreement 0.81; (ii) inclusion of official urban development plans as input for SUSM did not provide a better agreement with the observed growth; (iii) SUSM, parameterized with remote sensing data, can be used effectively to understand urban growth and assess the effects of alternative urban development plans in terms of the spatial expansion of cities.

TI  - Comparison of equatorial wave activity in the tropical tropopause layer and stratosphere represented in reanalyses
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Equatorial Kelvin and mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG) waves in the tropical tropopause layer and stratosphere represented in recent reanalyses for the period of 1981-2010 are compared in terms of spectral characteristics, spatial structures, long-term variations, and their forcing of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). For both wave types, the spectral distributions are broadly similar among most of the reanalyses, while the peak amplitudes exhibit considerable spread. The longitudinal distributions and spatial patterns of wave perturbations show reasonable agreement between the reanalyses. A few exceptions to the similarity of the spectral shapes and spatial structures among them are also noted. While the interannual variations of wave activity appear to be coherent for both the Kelvin and MRG waves, there is substantial variability in long-term trends among the reanalyses. Most of the reanalyses which assimilate satellite data exhibit large increasing trends in wave variance (similar to 15 %-50% increase in 30 years at 100-10 hPa), whereas one reanalysis (Japanese 55-year Reanalysis assimilating conventional observations only; JRA-55C) produced without satellite data does not. Several discontinuities are found around 1998 in the time series of the Kelvin and MRG wave variances, which manifest in different ways depending on the reanalysis, and are indicative of impacts of the transition of satellite measurements during that year. The equatorial wave forcing of the QBO, estimated by the Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux divergence, occurs in similar phase-speed ranges in the lower stratosphere among the reanalyses. However, the EP flux and its divergence are found to be dependent on the zonal-mean winds represented in reanalyses, exhibiting different magnitudes, altitudes, and phase-speed ranges of the Kelvin wave forcing between the reanalyses, especially at 20-10 hPa. In addition, at around 20 hPa, a wave signal which appears only in easterly mean winds with west-ward phase speeds is found and discussed.

TI  - Fusing MODIS and OLI images: evaluating applications to winterwheat mapping
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) series products are widely used to observe Earth's surface, but the coarse resolution of MODIS images may negatively affect the monitoring accuracy. In this paper, MODIS vegetation index data (NDVI, normalized difference vegetation index; EVI, enhanced vegetation index) were fused with operational land imager (OLI) data (Landsat 8 OLI: pan band) using two image transform methods (WT, wavelet transform; GST, Gram-Schmidt transform) to improve the accuracy of winter wheat mapping. The findings showed that image fusion resulted in increased information entropy for image interpretation; however, the mapping accuracy was improved based on the fused OLI and MODIS images for only the OLI pan image acquired during the winter wheat growing season. Winter wheat was more often misclassified as urban green spaces in the summer than in the spring. For the entire study area, the overestimation of winter wheat based on the fused EVI and OLI data and the WT algorithm reached 5.98%. The time-series curves of the fused images were similar to those of the MODIS images, suggesting that time-series MODIS images might have expanded application in phenology-based wheat mapping.

CP  - 6th Small Unmanned Aerial Systems for Environmental Research (UAS4Enviro)
CL  - Univ Split, Fac Elect Engn Mech Engn & Naval Architecture, Split, CROATIA
AB  - Flammable spinifex grasslands of arid Western Australia cover about 98 million hectares of the state, and large wildfires in this environment threaten biodiversity, life, property and cultural values. Understanding fire behaviour in spinifex grasslands informs prescribed burning and wildfire suppression activities. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are aiding in improving fire behaviour prediction by providing comprehensive and accurate measurements of vegetation cover, volume and height, the fuel characteristics of vegetation that influence fire behaviour. Classification of spinifex cover derived from UAS image capture has been compared to field transects. Data from UAS align better with Landsat satellite imagery than fuel cover measures from field transects. A good correlation was found between UAS-derived vegetation cover and Landsat imagery, which means satellite imagery can be used with confidence to estimate and map fuel cover at a range of temporal and spatial scales. UAS have also proven useful in the development of a spectral index describing spinifex cover. The rapid development of affordable UAS instruments and software has enabled the production of point clouds, which provide further vegetation structure information not available from previous image captures. These developments in UAS application together with satellite imagery will enable fire managers to more efficiently and accurately map fuel characteristics at a range of scales, greatly enhancing their ability to forecast fire danger and to predict fire behaviour without having to carry out costly ground-based field measurements.

T2  - CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ataturk Dam Lake is one of the important freshwater ecosystems in the world in terms of the size of the surface area and the biodiversity. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of metal pollution in the Ataturk Dam Lake on some biochemical markers in the gills and digestive glands of mussels (Unio mancus). Mussel samples were collected in July-2018 from four stations. The metal residues (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, and Ni) in the tissues were determined by ICP-MS. The MT, reduced GSH, and MDA levels were analysed using the proposed spectrophotometric methods. According to the results, toxic metals such as Cd and Pb in both tissues were determined mostly in mussels collected from St1. The highest MT and MDA levels in the gills were determined in St3 and St2 respectively, while the highest MT and MDA levels in the digestive glands were determined in St1. Although there was no significant difference in the reduced GSH level in the gills among the stations, the highest reduced GSH level in the digestive glands was determined in St4. These results indicated that mussels are appropriate sentinel organisms for metal contamination with effects on oxidative stress and metal exposure biomarkers.

For this example, a pilot inventory of cultural resources is illustrated for the United States National Park Service lands that protect the Appalachian Trail in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, the trail stretches 145.2 kilometers (90.2 miles) and is protected by nearly 2052 hectares (5070 acres) of land. To aid in the resource monitoring, these remote sensing data are corroborated with historic records to identify the historical archaeological resources in the corridor. The inventory are then added to existing management plans to help protect the national park with a more complete understanding of the historical human impacts in the backcountry of New England.

TI  - Tagged Core-Satellite Nanoassemblies: Role of Assembling Sequence on Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) Performance
T2  - APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plasmonic nanoassemblies with amplified optical responses are attractive as chemo/bio sensors and diagnostic tracking agents. For real-life implementation, such nanostructures require a well-designed and controlled formation for maximizing the optical amplification. Forming these nanoassemblies typically requires numerous steps; however, the importance of the sequence of the steps is typically not discussed. Thus, here we have investigated the role of the sequence of tagging (or labeling, barcoding) of such plasmonic nanoassemblies with Raman active molecules in a quest to maximize the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement that could be achieved from the nanoassemblies. We have chosen the core-satellite nanoassembly arrangement to study the role of tagging sequence because it allows us to keep structural parameters constant that would otherwise influence the SERS amplification. We demonstrate that incorporating the tag molecule at an assembly point before formation of the nanojunctions leads to more tag molecules being positioned at the core-satellite nanojunctions, thereby resulting in higher SERS signal enhancement. This will thus prove to be a useful tool in fully utilizing the nanoassembly morphology generated hot-spot and maximizing its SERS performance.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Baseline variations in trout-perch energy use (growth, gonad size) and energy storage (condition, liver size) were characterized between 2009 and 2015 in 8 reaches of the Athabasca River (AB, Canada), including 2 reaches upstream of the city of Fort McMurray (AB, Canada) and 6 reaches downstream of Fort McMurray among existing oil sands operations. Generalized linear models, used to account for background variation, indicated that fork length, gonad size, and liver size decreased, whereas body weight increased, in relation to river discharge, for both male and female trout-perch. Air temperature was positively correlated with liver size and negatively correlated with gonad size and body weight for females, but only positively correlated with gonad weight for males. These linear models explained approximately 20 to 25% of the variation in adjusted body size, and upward of 80% of the variation in adjusted body weight, liver weight, and gonad weight. Residuals from linear models were used to estimate normal ranges of variation for each of the fish population performance measures. Combined, the models and normal ranges can be used to assess subsequent monitoring data, providing potential triggers for follow-up monitoring activities. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-12.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) is a quantitative and reliable indicator of the nitrogen nutrition distribution or status of crops. The timely and accurate estimation of the NNI is crucial in agriculture management. In this study, the quantitative analysis and hyperspectral remote sensing modelling of the NNI were conducted, in which the hyperspectral remote sensing data and NNI data at different growth stages of winter wheat were measured using ground and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) carrying high spectrometer equipment. First, the NNIs of the four growth stages of winter wheat were calculated and statistically analyzed. Then, the hyperspectral characteristics at different growth stages and various NNIs were examined. Second, the representation wavebands of the hyperspectral data, which were sensitive to the NNI of winter wheat, were acquired and evaluated. In addition, hyperspectral models were established and comparatively assessed for the NNI estimation. Finally, the hyperspectral characteristics and the remote sensing estimation of the NNIs were determined on the basis of UAV-based hyperspectral data. The results are as follows. (1) As the NNIs of winter wheat changed, the characteristic of the red shift, the variations in the red edge position, and the near-infrared waveband range of the hyperspectral data became apparent. (2) The green band, red edge, and near-infrared were sensitive to the NNIs of winter wheat, and they could be effectively used for estimating the NNI. Moreover, the multiple statistical regression models, which were based on representative wavebands, performed well in estimating the NNI results for the different growth stages of winter wheat.

Although testing in quarantine facilities as a candidate for classical biological control is ongoing, adventive populations have appeared in multiple sites in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Extensive laboratory testing of T. japonicus against other North American pentatomids and H. halys has revealed a higher rate of parasitism of H. halys, but not complete host specificity. However, laboratory tests are necessarily artificial, in which many host finding and acceptance cues may be circumvented. We offered sentinel egg masses of three native pentatomid (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) pest species (Chinavia hilaris (Say), Euschistus conspersus Uhler, and Chlorochroa ligata (Say)) in a field paired-host assay in an area with a well-established adventive population of T. japonicus near Vancouver, WA. Overall, 67% of the H. halys egg masses were parasitized by T. japonicus during the 2-yr study. Despite the 'worst case' scenario for a field test (close proximity of the paired egg masses), the rate of parasitism (% eggs producing adult wasps) on all three native species was significantly less (0.4-8%) than that on H. halys eggs (77%). The levels of successful parasitism of T. japonicus of the three species are C. hilaris > E. conspersus > C. ligata. The potential impact of T. japonicus on these pentatomids is probably minimal.

TI  - The remote sensing of radiative forcing by light-absorbing particles (LAPs) in seasonal snow over northeastern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Light-absorbing particles (LAPs) deposited on snow can decrease snow albedo and affect climate through snow-albedo radiative forcing. In this study, we use MODIS observations combined with a snow-albedo model (SNICAR - Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiative) and a radiative transfer model (SBDART - Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer) to retrieve the instantaneous spectrally integrated radiative forcing at the surface by LAPs in snow (RFMODISLAPs) under clear-sky conditions at the time of MODIS Aqua overpass across northeastern China (NEC) in JanuaryFebruary from 2003 to 2017. RFMODISLAPs presents distinct spatial variability, with the minimum (22.3 W m(-2)) in western NEC and the maximum (64.6 W m(-2)) near industrial areas in central NEC. The regional mean RFMODISLAPs is similar to 45.1 +/- 6.8 W m(-2) in NEC. The positive (negative) uncertainties of retrieved RFMODISLAPs due to atmospheric correction range from 14% to 57% (14% to 47 %), and the uncertainty value basically decreases with the increased RFMODISLAPs. We attribute the variations of radiative forcing based on remote sensing and find that the spatial variance of RFMODISLAPs in NEC is 74.6% due to LAPs and 21.2% and 4.2% due to snow grain size and solar zenith angle. Furthermore, based on multiple linear regression, the BC dry and wet deposition and snowfall could explain 84% of the spatial variance of LAP contents, which confirms the reasonability of the spatial patterns of retrieved RFMODISLAPs in NEC. We validate RFMODISLAPs using in situ radiative forcing estimates. We find that the biases in RFMODISLAPs are negatively correlated with LAP concentrations and range from similar to 5% to similar to 350% in NEC.

TI  - Interconnections among Homelessness, Family Separation, and Mental Health: Implications for Multi-Sectoral Social Services
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SERVICE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This qualitative study explored the interconnections among the phenomena of homelessness, family separation, and mental health and substance abuse issues within the social services, geographic, and infrastructure context of northern Ontario. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirteen participants. Findings revealed the effects of colonization in the form of poor and overcrowded housing conditions in the northern First Nations, difficulties in obtaining affordable and suitable housing in northern towns and cities, reliance on the scarce social services for survival, and valiant attempts to cope with the cold climate of northern Ontario. All participants reported multiple and intergenerational experiences of separation from family due to involvement of child welfare system, placement in residential schools, death of family member(s), flooding, and epidemics. Participants described their lifelong struggles with mental health and substance abuse issues. All three phenomena were tied together in various configurations of causes and consequences. The implications include the need for critical examination of the historical policies and practices, early intervention for mental health and substance abuse issues, greater support for youth transitioning out of care, creation of a continuum of housing options, collaboration across multiple social services sectors, and incorporation of Indigenous worldview and practices in the mainstream services.

TI  - Glacier elevation change in the Western Qilian mountains as observed by TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The glaciers in the Qilian mountains are a major water resource for the arid Hexi corridor and Qaidam basin. With the climate becoming warmer and wetter, it is essential to study the glacier elevation changes in this region. We used TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X images, SRTM DEM data and differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) technology to analyse the glacier elevation change. Results show that the glacier elevation is changing at the rate of -0.35 m yr(-1) in the western Qilian mountains between 2000 and 2014. The glacier elevation thinning at -0.40 m yr(-1) in the southern part of this region is more severe than that in the northern part (-0.29 m yr(-1)). The long-term equilibrium line altitude, calculated from glacier elevation change in each elevation bin, was at 5150 m, which is equal to that inferred from glacial area distribution in each elevation bin. Glacier shrinkage is related to air temperature increasing.

TI  - The Emergence of Spindles and K-Complexes and the Role of the Dorsal Caudal Part of the Anterior Cingulate as the Generator of K-Complexes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The large multicomponent K-complex (KC) and the rhythmic spindle are the hallmarks of non-rapid eye movement (NREM)-2 sleep stage. We studied with magnetoencephalography (MEG) the progress of light sleep (NREM-1 and NREM-2) and emergence of KCs and spindles. Seven periods of interest (POI) were analyzed: wakefulness, the two quiet "core" periods of light sleep (periods free from any prominent phasic or oscillatory events) and four periods before and during spindles and KCs. For each POI, eight 2-s (1250 time slices) segments were used. We employed magnetic field tomography (MFT) to extract an independent tomographic estimate of brain activity from each MEG data sample. The spectral power was then computed for each voxel in the brain for each segment of each POI. The sets of eight maps from two POIs were contrasted using a voxel-by-voxel t-test. Only increased spectral power was identified in the four key contrasts between POIs before and during spindles and KCs versus the NREM2 core. Common increases were identified for all four subjects, especially within and close to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These common increases were widespread for low frequencies, while for higher frequencies they were focal, confined to specific brain areas. For the pre-KC POI, only one prominent increase was identified, confined to the theta/alpha bands in a small area in the dorsal caudal part of ACC (dcACC). During KCs, the activity in this area grows in intensity and extent (in space and frequency), filling the space between the areas that expanded their low frequency activity (in the delta band) during NREM2 compared to NREM1. Our main finding is that prominent spectral power increases before NREM2 graphoelements are confined to the dcACC, and only for KCs, sharing common features with changes of activity in dcACC of the well-studied error related negativity (ERN). ERN is seen in awake state, in perceptual conflict and situations where there is a difference between expected and actual environmental or internal events. These results suggest that a KC is the sleep side of the awake state ERN, both serving their putative sentinel roles in the frame of the saliency network.

TI  - Statistical analysis for satellite-index-based insurance to define damaged pasture thresholds
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices based on satellite images, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), have been used in countries like the USA, Canada and Spain for damaged pasture and forage insurance over the last few years. This type of agricultural insurance is called satellite-index-based insurance (SIBI). In SIBI, the occurrence of damage is defined as normal distributions. In this work a pasture area at the north of the Community of Madrid (Spain) has been delimited by means of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. A statistical analysis of NDVI histograms was applied to seek for alternative distributions using the maximum likelihood method and chi(2) test. The results show that the normal distribution is not the optimal representation and the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution presents a better fit through the year based on a quality estimator. A comparison between normal and GEV is shown with respect to the probability under a NDVI threshold value throughout the year. This suggests that an a priori distribution should not be selected and a percentile methodology should be used to define a NDVI damage threshold rather than the average and standard deviation, typically of normal distributions.

TI  - Temporal patterns of active fire density and its relationship with a satellite fuel greenness index by vegetation type and region in Mexico during 2003-2014
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Understanding the temporal patterns of fire occurrence and their relationships with fuel dryness is key to sound fire management, especially under increasing global warming. At present, no system for prediction of fire occurrence risk based on fuel dryness conditions is available in Mexico. As part of an ongoing national-scale project, we developed an operational fire risk mapping tool based on satellite and weather information. Results We demonstrated how differing monthly temporal trends in a fuel greenness index, dead ratio (DR), and fire density (FDI) can be clearly differentiated by vegetation type and region for the whole country, using MODIS satellite observations for the period 2003 to 2014. We tested linear and non-linear models, including temporal autocorrelation terms, for prediction of FDI from DR for a total of 28 combinations of vegetation types and regions. In addition, we developed seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for forecasting DR values based on the last observed values. Most ARIMA models showed values of the adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2 adj) above 0.7 to 0.8, suggesting potential to forecast fuel dryness and fire occurrence risk conditions. The best fitted models explained more than 70% of the observed FDI variation in the relation between monthly DR and fire density. Conclusion These results suggest that there is potential for the DR index to be incorporated in future fire risk operational tools. However, some vegetation types and regions show lower correlations between DR and observed fire density, suggesting that other variables, such as distance and timing of agricultural burn, deserve attention in future studies.

TI  - Biomechanical Effects of Different Auxiliary-Aligner Designs for the Extrusion of an Upper Central Incisor: A Finite Element Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. To evaluate the biomechanical effects of four different auxiliary-aligner combinations for the extrusion of a maxillary central incisor and to define the most effective design through finite element analysis (FEA). Materials and Methods. A full maxillary arch (14 teeth) was modelled by combining two different imaging techniques: cone beam computed tomography and surface-structured light scan. The appliance and auxiliary element geometries were created by exploiting computer-aided design (CAD) procedures. The reconstructed digital models were imported within the finite element solver (Ansys (R) 17). For the extrusion movement, the authors compared the aligner without an attachment with three auxiliary-aligner designs: a rectangular palatal attachment, a rectangular buccal attachment, and an ellipsoid buccal attachment. The resulting force-moment (MF) system delivered by the aligner to the target tooth and the tooth displacement were calculated for each scenario. Results. The maximum tooth displacement along the z-axis (0.07mm) was obtained with the rectangular palatal attachment, while the minimum (0.02mm) was obtained without any attachments. With the ellipsoid attachment, the highest undesired moments M-x and M-y were found. The rectangular palatal attachment showed the highest F-z (2.0N) with the lowest undesired forces (F-x=0.4N; F-y=-0.2N). Conclusions. FEA demonstrated that the rectangular palatal attachment can improve the effectiveness of the appliance for the extrusion of an upper central incisor.

TI  - Daily solar radiation from NASA-POWER product: assessing its accuracy considering atmospheric transparency
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing in estimating solar energy budget components at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) level and at the terrestrial level plays a very important role in various types of applications. Solar radiation data are especially problematic because of a quite generalized lack of sufficient data in quantity and quality. Satellite images allow solving the problem of continuity or lack of solar radiation data. The objective of this work was to fit daily solar radiation from NASA-POWER (National Aeronautics and Space Administration - Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources), considering different intervals of atmospheric transparency index. The accuracy was assessed from the analysis of voluminous data-sets registered by meteorological ground stations, 31 in number, located in whole Spain, during the period from 2000 to 2017. Clearness index (K-T) was calculated to define nine classes of cloud cover conditions. The study reveals that the degree of correlation between the satellite data and observatory data depends upon atmospheric conditions and the correlation accuracy improves for higher values of K-T. The coefficients of determination (R-2), considering all K-T values, were between 0.85 and 0.96; particularly for clear days R-2 = 0.96 and root-mean-square error equal to 1.78 MJ m(-2) d(-1) were obtained. Geographically, the better statistic values were located in the central region of the country. NASA-POWER shows potential to estimate solar radiation and that it is an important information resource for different applications.

TI  - Identifying terraces in the hilly and gully regions of the Loess Plateau in China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrace identification is the basis for understanding quantity, quality, and land covers of terraces and their effects on agriculture production and various surface processes, for example, hydrological and ecological processes. However, there are some drawbacks and limitations in the automatic extraction of terraces, such as difficulty of outlining the overall boundary for individual terrace and the limitation of applying methods and parameters. In this study, we used machine learning methods on the basis of Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis using K-nearest neighbours and spectral angle mapper algorithms to extract terraces in the hilly and gully regions on the Loess Plateau, China. This study relied on medium-resolution image Landsat-8 combined with Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model to extract the overall boundary of terraces and relies on high-resolution images GaoFen-1 to extract the terraced edges of terraces. It used the methods of principal component analysis and Laplacian convolution filter to enhance and extract terraced edges inside of the boundary of terraces. Our estimates are with overall accuracy of 62.2% in K-nearest neighbours and 74.8% in spectral angle mapper methods, indicating the advantages of the proposed method despite the use of much lower resolution data than previous studies that used both high-resolution terrain and remote sensing imageries data. This study highlights the importance of using appropriate methods plus reasonable spatial resolution of remote sensing data for outlining the overall boundary of terraces in the hilly and gully regions.

TI  - Influence of debris cover on glacier response to climate change: insights from Koxkar glacier using dynamic simulation
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of debris-covered glaciers to climate change is more heterogeneous and complex than that of debris-free glaciers. The debris has a significant effect on glacier dynamic characteristics, which causes uneven mass balance changes, and then affects the change of glacier geometry evolves in response to climate. In our study, both energy balance and a two-dimensional mass and momentum conservation equation were used to simulate the ice temperature and velocity respectively at the main stream line of Koxkar glacier. The influence of the debris on ice temperature was described in the model. The ice velocity simulation was coupled with a description of ice viscosity under the influence of ice temperature. Our simulation results showed that the debris could increase the ice velocity and ablation in the middle of the glacier. Especially in the surface from 3200 to 3400 m.a.s.l, where the debris had great influence for ice velocity and temperature. From simulation results, we inferred that the ice thickness in this region would change obviously. Comparing with the measured thickness changes by ground-penetrating radar (GPR) between 1981 and 2008, the simulation result is consistent with measured results. Therefore, supraglacial lakes are easily developed in this region because of the high ice temperature and uneven ice surface. And the Landsat 8 remote-sensing image had verified this conclusion.

TI  - Impact of atmospheric conditions and levels of urbanization on the relationship between nocturnal surface and urban canopy heat islands
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous investigations of urban heat islands (UHI) are primarily focused either on the canopy heat island intensity (aUHII) derived from weather stations, or on the surface urban heat island intensity (sUHII) derived from satellite instruments. Research of the relationship between sUHII and aUHII (the sUHII-aUHII relationship) is limited and this study attempts to further progress this possibility by examining the night-time sUHII-aUHII relationship for three factors: season, wind speed (WS), and basic land-use categories modified from local climate zones (urban/suburban), in Birmingham, United Kingdom. Using high-resolution datasets of canopy air temperature from Birmingham Urban Climate Laboratory and land surface temperature from the MODIS instrument aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites, with a unique methodology of regression analysis, confidence ellipse analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and 2-D Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests, statistical evidence is provided to present the varying patterns and magnitudes between sUHII and aUHII. The significance of the impact of the three considered factors is clearly supported by the statistical tests. The results indicate that satellite data can be used to infer aUHII with a higher confidence for low WS conditions. Results also demonstrate better confidence in the approach for summer and spring seasons, and for more urbanized sites. Indeed, the analysis potentially indicates that wind advection is a key factor for the investigation of the sUHII-aUHII relationship. Overall, the methods used here are transferable to other cities and/or can be used to guide further research to explore the sUHII-aUHII relationship under other environmental conditions.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study describes the application of satellite images of SPOT 7, acquired on 10 October 2014 for producing the high spatial resolution digital elevation models of five glaciers in the Indian Himalaya. For data processing, we applied a Semi-Global Matching algorithm deployed in LPS- ERDAS. Ground control points were also used for validation, which were obtained during the autumn of 2014. Then, precise estimate are derived for the glacier area, the terminus elevation, the areas of supraglacial debris and the areas of proglacial lakes. Further, the ASTER (obtained in 2011) and SRTM V3 (of 2000) elevation models were used in conjunction with the generated SPOT-7 DEM to estimate the glaciers mass balance between 2000, 2011 and 2014. Mass balance was observed negative for all five glaciers, but the mass loss decreased from the mean of -0.99 +/- 0.27 m.w.e.a(-1) in 2000-2011 to -0.61 +/- 0.31 m.w.e.a(-1) from 2011 to 2014.

TI  - Field testing of a lightweight, inexpensive, and customisable 3D-printed mosquito light trap in the UK
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquito surveillance is a fundamental component of planning and evaluating vector control programmes. However, logistical and cost barriers can hinder the implementation of surveillance, particularly in vector-borne disease-endemic areas and in outbreak scenarios in remote areas where the need is often most urgent. The increasing availability and reduced cost of 3D printing technology offers an innovative approach to overcoming these challenges. In this study, we assessed the field performance of a novel, lightweight 3D-printed mosquito light trap baited with carbon dioxide (CO2) in comparison with two gold-standard traps, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light trap baited with CO2, and the BG Sentinel 2 trap with BG-Lure and CO2. Traps were run for 12 nights in a Latin square design at Rainham Marshes, Essex, UK in September 2018. The 3D-printed trap showed equivalent catch rates to the two commercially available traps. The 3D-printed trap designs are distributed free of charge in this article with the aim of assisting entomological field studies across the world.

TI  - Variability in phytoplankton biomass and effects of sea surface temperature based on satellite data from the Yellow Sea, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - A time series of satellite data on Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) that used ocean color was studied to determine mechanisms of phytoplankton variation in recent decade in the Yellow Sea, China during 2003-2015. The variability patterns on seasonal and inter-annual oscillation periods were confirmed using the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF), and Morlet wavelet transform analyses, respectively. The first EOF mode for Chl-a was dominated by obvious spring and fall blooms in a spatial pattern that was related to the strong mixing of the water masses from the Yellow Sea Cold Warm Mass (YSCWM) and the Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC) in winter. The second EOF mode for Chl-a showed an opposite spatial pattern between the northern and southern regions. The temporal coefficient showed differences in the timing of blooms. On an inter-annual scale, Chl-a indicated variation at periods of 2-4 years during 2003-2015. Chl-a showed a significantly negative correlation with the sea surface temperature (r = -0.21, p<0.01), with time lags of 4 months (Chl-a ahead). Chl-a was coupled with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, with a positive correlation (r = 0.46, p<0.01) at a lag of 3-5 months (ENSO ahead). The present study demonstrated that the variation in phytoplankton biomass was controlled primarily by water mass seasonally, and it was influenced by ENSO events on an inter-annual scale.

TI  - Anomalous variations of air temperature prior to earthquakes
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquakes occur because of increase of stress and rock fracture. Prior to impending earthquake, physical and chemical interactions in the earth's crust lead to anomalous variations of air temperature (AT). Satellite based remote sensing method allows to determine earthquake precursors over a large tectonic area. Buildup of stresses in a seismically active area manifests as thermal anomaly. In the present study, variations in AT prior to eastern Turkey, Bella Bella (Canada) and Pocito (Argentina) earthquakes were studied by utilizing multi-year background data. The analysis shows strong anomalous variations of AT prior to the seismic events with the highest AT values recorded before the earthquakes. Anomaly plots show that the release of energy was concentrated in the region along epicenter. Descriptive statistics of AT for the earthquakes show significant changes prior to the seismic event. Degassing of gases occur during rock micro-fracturing, which results in air ionization, thereby resulting in AT precursory anomalies.

TI  - Exploring the advantages and limitations of sampling methods commonly used in research facilities for zebrafish health inspections
T2  - LABORATORY ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Examining zebrafish populations for the presence of disease is an integral component of managing fish health in research facilities. Currently, many different strategies are used for zebrafish fish health inspections, which is a scenario that may result in subjective and biased diagnostic evaluations. The goal of this study was to compare the success of pathogen detection between a sample size of randomly selected fish (n = 60) that provides 95% confidence in pathogen detection based on a presumed pathogen prevalence level >= 5%, and other subpopulations and sample numbers commonly submitted for diagnostic testing within a 1000 tank, 30,000 fish, recirculating research system. This included fish collected from a sump tank (n = 53), sentinel fish (n = 11), and fish that were found moribund or freshly dead (n = 18). Additionally, five fish from each subpopulation were collected for histopathologic examination. A second study used retrospective data to examine pathogen distribution between systems (n = 2-5) in multi-system facilities (n = 5) using a sample size of 60 fish per system. For the pathogens detected, results supported the use of representative sample numbers rather than smaller numbers of populations considered more at risk. The exception to this is for the moribund/mortality group, which may be a resource for targeted surveillance of select pathogens. Each system within multi-system facilities should be considered separate units in terms of fish health inspections and biosecurity. Development of these evidence-based standards for fish health inspections in zebrafish systems enhances fish welfare, provides identification of potentially zoonotic pathogens, and ensures scientific integrity and reproducibility of research results.

TI  - Luminescence Chronology of Terrace Development in the Upper Parana River, Southeast Brazil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Parana River has been extensively studied in terms of hydrological and sedimentological characterization. However, the geological history of its fluvial plain is poorly understood due the lack of geochronological data. Most of the studies are focused in the low and middle reaches, whereas the region upstream of the Porto Primavera dam is an almost unknown area in terms of geomorphic evolution. Thus, the main aim of this study was to investigate the succession of geological events responsible for the evolution and current configuration of the fluvial system of the Upper Parana River, between the Jupia and Porto Primavera Hydroelectric Power Plants (Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul states). In order to achieve this goal, we used an integrated approach including remote sensing data, geomorphology, sedimentology, geochronology and bathymetric profiles. Four geomorphological compartments were identified and three of these compartments were dated by Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL): Unit 1, raised terrace with circular and semicircular ponds (similar to 150 ka); Unit 2, intermediate terrace with small ponds and waterlogged areas (similar to 60 ka); Unit 3, low terrace with preserved paleochannels (similar to 39-35 ka); and Unit 4, current river plain (> 9 ka). The geomorphological units were correlated with previous studies downstream of the studied area and their sedimentary characteristics and depositional ages suggest that their genesis is linked to changes in climatic and hydrological conditions during the Late Quatemary. Units 1, 3 and 4 are considered extensions of the geomorphological units Taquarucu, Fazenda Boa Vista and Rio Parana, respectively. Unit 2 is a compartment with unique morphological characteristics, therefore not correlated with units presented in previous works. Further, two main knickpoints were identified, suggesting an important control in the sedimentation and development of the terrace levels. Therefore, this work brings new data about the fluvial plain of the upper reach of the Parana River, that allows to interpret that the development of terrace levels and floodplain are strongly controlled by climate changes occurred during the Late Quaternary.

TI  - Anthromes displaying evidence of weekly cycles in active fire data cover 70% of the global land surface
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Across the globe, human activities have been gaining importance relatively to climate and ecology as the main controls on fire regimes and consequently human activity became an important driver of the frequency, extent and intensity of vegetation burning worldwide. Our objective in the present study is to look for weekly cycles in vegetation fire activity at global scale as evidence of human agency, relying on the original MODIS active fire detections at 1 km spatial resolution (MCD14ML) and using novel statistical methodologies to detect significant periodicities in time series data. We tested the hypotheses that global fire activity displays weekly cycles and that the weekday with the fewest fires is Sunday. We also assessed the effect of land use and land cover on weekly fire cycle significance by testing those hypotheses separately for the Villages, Settlements, Croplands, Rangelands, Seminatural, and Wildlands anthromes. Based on a preliminary data analysis of the daily global active fire counts periodogram, we developed an harmonic regression model for the mean function of daily fire activity and assumed a linear model for the de-seasonalized time series. For inference purposes, we used a Bayesian methodology and constructed a simultaneous 95% credible band for the mean function. The hypothesis of a Sunday weekly minimum was directly investigated by computing the probabilities that the mean functions of every weekday (Monday to Saturday) are inside the credible band corresponding to mean Sunday fire activity. Since these probabilities are small, there is statistical evidence of significantly fewer fires on Sunday than on the other days of the week. Cropland, rangeland, and seminatural anthromes, which cover 70% of the global land area and account for 94% of the active fires analysed, display weekly cycles in fire activity. Due to lower land management intensity and less strict control over fire size and duration, weekly cycles in Rangelands and Seminatural anthromes, which jointly account for 53.46% of all fires, although statistically significant are weaker than those detected in Croplands.

TI  - Declining responsiveness of childhood Plasmodium falciparum infections to artemisinin-based combination treatments ten years following deployment as first-line antimalarials in Nigeria
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The development and spread of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Greater Mekong Subregion has created impetus for continuing global monitoring of efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). This post analyses is aimed to evaluate changes in early treatment response markers 10 years after the adoption of ACTs as first-line treatments of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Nigeria. Methods At 14 sentinel sites in six geographical areas of Nigeria, we evaluated treatment responses in 1341 children under 5 years and in additional 360 children under 16 years with uncomplicated malaria enrolled in randomized trials of artemether-lumefantrine versus artesunate-amodiaquine at 5-year interval in 2009-2010 and 2014-2015 and at 2-year interval in 2009-2010 and 2012-2015, respectively after deployment in 2005. Results Asexual parasite positivity 1 day after treatment initiation (APPD1) rose from 54 to 62% and 2 days after treatment initiation from 5 to 26% in 2009-2010 to 2014-2015 (P = 0.002 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Parasite clearance time increased significantly from 1.6 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55-1.64) to 1.9 days (95% CI, 1.9-2.0) and geometric mean parasite reduction ratio 2 days after treatment initiation decreased significantly from 11 000 to 4700 within the same time period (P < 0.0001 for each). Enrolment parasitaemia > 75 000 mu l(- 1), haematocrit > 27% 1 day post-treatment initiation, treatment with artemether-lumefantrine and enrolment in 2014-2015 independently predicted APPD1. In parallel, Kaplan-Meier estimated risk of recurrent infections by day 28 rose from 8 to 14% (P = 0.005) and from 9 to 15% (P = 0.02) with artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine, respectively. Mean asexual parasitaemia half-life increased significantly from 1.1 h to 1.3 h within 2 years (P < 0.0001). Conclusions These data indicate declining parasitological responses through time to the two ACTs may be due to emergence of parasites with reduced susceptibility or decrease in immunity to the infections in these children.

TI  - GIS-Supported Airfield Selection near Zhongshan Station, East Antarctica, based on Multi-Mission Remote Sensing Data
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - As Antarctica attracts increasing attention in global climate change studies, the demand for field expeditions has increased in recent decades. Aircraft has become the most efficient mode of transportation because of the advantages of short travel times over long distances, access to unreachable locations and capability to carry different types of sensors to obtain large areal coverages. However, few studies have been published regarding Antarctic airfield site selection for heavy-wheeled aircraft. In this paper, we present methods and results of blue-ice airfield preliminary selection near Zhongshan station, East Antarctica. The geographic information system (GIS)-based method is supported by multi-mission high-resolution images from the ZY-3, WorldView-2 and Landsat-8 satellites along with existing remote sensing products. Ground truth observations were integrated with satellite panchromatic and spectral information to identify runway candidate areas. The information inferred by remote sensing data, including firn type, ice movement, surface slope and ice fracture, is used for evaluation of the airfield selection rules. Finally, the rankings and recommendations of runway candidates were performed in a GIS analysis environment. The site selection approach developed in this paper can be applied in preconstruction studies of other similar cryosphere environments to provide appropriate candidates for a final stage field investigation.

TI  - Should internal mammary lymph node sentinel biopsy be performed in breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose Results from studies of internal mammary lymph node sentinel biopsy are inconsistent. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Clinical Trials. Studies reporting the rate of internal mammary lymph node sentinel biopsy (IMN-SLNB) positivity were identified. We performed pooled proportion meta-analysis using random-effects meta-analyses. The correlation of IMN and axillary lymph node (AXN) metastasis was also investigated. Results After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 18 articles (total number of patients = 2427) were included. The pooled estimate for IMN-SLNB positivity rate was 15% (95% confidence interval (CI) 12-17%). Significant between-study heterogeneity was observed. Our results indicate that axillary lymph node metastasis is a strong predictor of IMN involvement (OR 6.01, 95% CI, 3.49, 10.34). Conclusion Internal mammary lymph nodes metastasis might be underestimated. Patients with positive axillary lymph nodes have a higher risk of internal lymph nodes metastasis. As a result, IMN-SLNB might be considered in these patients. Future work needs to be done to assess whether pathological confirmed IMN metastasis can affect patients' survival.

TI  - Intramonth oscillations of Atlantic ITCZ observed in SMAP satellite salinity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The time variability of wind and rainfall in the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) has a wide oscillation spectrum that includes strong intra-month periodicities. These latter short-period oscillations span from individual convection lifecycle events of a few hours to longer pentad and multi-week convective cluster periods. This study reports on measured ITCZ rain variability at periods of a few weeks and its imprint on sea surface salinity (SSS) observed using satellite remote sensing. Despite small amplitude of variations of only psu, these changes are shown to be detectable in radiometer SSS estimates collected by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite. They are shown to develop in the mid-Atlantic ITCZ latitude band and to follow its seasonal meridional progression. These rain-correlated sea surface signatures appear quasi-synchronously across a wide range of longitude. Both the ITCZ-related seasonal migration and high zonal propagation speeds distinguish these intra-month SSS oscillations from that of tropical instability waves (TIW), with TIWs having periods greater than month and slower westward propagation. While detection of tropical Atlantic TIW salinity signatures using satellite data has received significant attention, it appears that atmospheric freshwater forcing impacts on the upper ocean at these shorter periods represents an additional process resolvable from space using SMAP. Correlation analyses of precipitation and winds indicate that low latitude convection clusters are accompanied by an upward Ekman pumping anomaly, which uplifts saltier water to surface layers diluted by enhanced precipitation. These vertical processes modify the salt balance and change the phase relationship between the oceanic SSS response and the atmospheric freshwater forcing.

TI  - On-orbit cross-calibration and assimilation for relativistic electron observations from FengYun 4A and GOES-13
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Magnetospheric relativistic electrons can destroy on-orbit spacecrafts completely by internal charging and discharging effects. As the characteristics and physical mechanism of this space particle are still unclear, magnetospheric relativistic electrons have always been an important object of space environment exploration and space science research. For studying the physical mechanisms and developing models relating to magnetospheric relativistic electrons, it is necessary to use the observations from different satellites and detectors at the same time. Eliminating the systematic deviation between different detection systems to assimilate the observations from different sources is essentially required by such researches. In this work, the on-orbit cross-calibration and assimilation for relativistic electron (> 2 MeV) observations from FengYun 4A and GOES-13 are performed. In this work, only the observations obtained under very quiet geomagnetic conditions (Kp < 2) are adopted to ensure that the objects of study are the radiation belt particles, which are stably captured by the geomagnetic field. According to the physical characteristics of the radiation belt particles, that is, the three adiabatic invariants, and based on the Lionville theorem, the phase space density of the stably captured particles is unchanged. In this paper, the relativistic electron flux data of energy > 2 MeV and instrument pitch angle are in the east and west direction respectively. If the particles' energy is the same, then their corresponding mu values are the same, and their particles' directions are the same, then their corresponding J values are the same, and the Lionville theorem can be simplified as the drift shell L-m is the same, the fluxes are the same, and the electron fluxes observed by the two satellites are compared in the drift shell L-m coordinate. The systematic deviation between the two satellites' relativistic electronic observations can be obtained. According to this result, the data assimilation is carried out, and the results show that the system deviation can be removed well. By this research work, the systematic deviation between two important relativistic electron detection systems in geosynchronous orbit is obtained. Based on the obtained systematic deviations, the assimilations for observations from the two detection systems are achieved. This work lays a solid foundation for the follow-up theoretical and applied researches, and also provides the methods for on-orbit cross-calibration and observation assimilation which could be referred to when other electronic observations on geosynchronous orbit are dealt with.

TI  - Conceptual blending of meanings in business marketing relationships
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to explore the topic of embodiment as a gap in meaning-making within the literature on business relationships in IMP and business marketing academic discourse. Referring to the theories of embodiment, the authors question the dominant worldview of Cartesian dualism which marginalizes the influence of the body in meaning-making and explore relevant implications of an embodiment agenda for research and practice. The aim is to demonstrate that embodiment has a vitally important influence in the construction of meanings. Design/methodology/approach The paper provides a review of theoretical and empirical literature on embodied cognition and theories of embodiment to construct a cooking metaphor as an analogical vehicle for exploring meanings within business relationships. Findings The authors use a cooking metaphor to explore how meaning is created in human interaction. Body and mind blended together produce meaning through the catalyst of discourse and semiotics. Cognition is described as a mixture of rational and non-rational processes involving blended elements of embodied perceptions and psychological ideas stirred and heated in a semiotic "sauce" of discourse (language, communication, information, power/knowledge). Originality/value The contribution of the paper is in proposing that both body and mind influence the creation of meanings in business relationships blended through the mediation of language and discourse. The authors aim to advance a "practice" and "linguistic" turn in the business marketing discourse by proposing that embodied, discursive and cognitive processes are more effectively conceived as blended influences.

TI  - Predicting suitable nesting sites for the Black caiman (<i>Melanosuchus</i> <i>niger</i> Spix 1825) in the Central Amazon basin
T2  - NEOTROPICAL BIODIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - After many years of illegal hunting and commercialization, the populations of the Black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) have been recovering during the last four decades due to the enforcement of a legislation that inhibits their international commercialization. Protecting nesting sites, in which vulnerable life forms (as reproductive females, eggs, and neonates) spend considerable time, is one of the most appropriate conservation actions aimed at preserving caiman populations. Thus, identifying priority areas for this activity should be the primary concern of conservationists. As caiman nesting sites are often found across the areas with difficult access, collecting nest information requires extensive and costly fieldwork efforts. In this context, species distribution modeling can be a valuable tool for predicting the locations of caiman nests in the Amazon basin. In this work, the maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) was applied to model the M. niger nest occurrence in the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve (MSDR) using remotely sensed data. By taking into account the M. niger nesting habitat, the following predictor variables were considered: conditional distance to open water, distance to bare soil, expanded contributing area from drainage, flood duration, and vegetation type. The threshold-independent prediction performance and binary prediction based on the threshold value of 0.9 were evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) and performing a binomial test, respectively. The obtained results (AUC = 0.967 +/- 0.006 and a highly significant binomial test P< 0.01) indicated excellent performance of the proposed model in predicting the M. niger nesting occurrence in the MSDR. The variables related to hydrological regimes (conditional distance to open water, expanded contributing area from drainage, and flood duration) most strongly affected the model performance. MaxEnt can be used for developing community-based sustainable management programs to provide socioeconomic benefits to local communities and promote species conservation in a much larger area within the Amazon basin.

TI  - UV-NIR approach with non-zero water-leaving radiance approximation for atmospheric correction of satellite imagery in inland and coastal zones
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the atmospheric correction process of the satellite ocean color data, the removal of the aerosol scattering contribution over the coastal and inland water bodies has been a major challenge with the standard algorithms. In this work, a practical method is proposed based on a combination of NIR and ultraviolet (UV) bands (named as UVNIR-ex) for the succeeding generation of space borne multispectral and hyperspectral sensors. This scheme replaces the black-ocean assumption and accounts for non-zero water-leaving radiance contributions in the NIR and UV bands. The aerosol contributions are thus deduced for these two bands and used to select the appropriate aerosol models to retrieve aerosol optical properties and hence, water-leaving radiances in the UV, Visible and NIR bands. The performance of the UVNIR-ex algorithm was tested and evaluated based on match-ups between HICO and in-situ observations in optically complex coastal and inland waters and by comparison with three alternative aerosol correction methods based on UV-NIR, Spectral Shape Parameter (SSP) and iterative NIR (INIR) approaches. A preliminary comparison with in-situ aerosol optical thickness (AOT) measurements from AERONET-OC sites revealed that the UVNIR-ex algorithm significantly improved the AOT retrievals with a mean relative error (MRE) around 25%, while the UVNIR, SSP and INIR algorithms showed performance degradation with a MRE of 27%, 34%, and 42%, respectively. The comparison with AERONET-OC and regional in-situ measurements from turbid and productive waters further showed that the INIR algorithm underestimated the nL(w) retrievals in blue bands in turbid waters (MRE > 100%) and negligible nL(w) in red-NIR bands and high anomalous radiances in UV-Blue bands in productive waters (MRE 53%). The SSP and UVNIR algorithms performed better in retrieving the nL(w) in green-NIR bands but showed significant errors in UV-blue bands in both turbid and productive waters. Based on these match-up analyses, the UVNIR-ex algorithm yielded best nL(w) retrievals across all the UV-NIR bands in terms of accuracy and performance. The highest accuracy and consistency of the UVNIR-ex algorithm indicates that it is more suited for estimating the aerosol optical properties and water-leaving radiance and has a significant advantage over the requirement of shortwave infrared bands for turbid and productive waters.

TI  - From "Incel" to "Saint": Analyzing the violent worldview behind the 2018 Toronto attack
T2  - TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper combines qualitative and quantitative content analysis to map and analyze the "Incel" worldview shared by members of a misogynistic online community ideologically linked to several recent acts of politically motivated violence, including Alek Minassian's van attack in Toronto (2018) and Elliot Rodger's school shooting in Isla Vista (2014). Specifically, the paper analyses how support and motivation for violence results from the particular structure this worldview presents in terms of social categories and causal narratives.

TI  - Spotting the pests of tomorrow-Sampling designs for detection of species associations with woody plants
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Early warning against potentially harmful organisms of woody plant species can be achieved by sampling sentinel plants in exporting countries. However, it is unclear where sentinel plants can best be located, and how many samples are required and when and how often sampling optimally should take place for the adequate assessment of the biodiversity associated with the target plant species. We aimed to review spatial and temporal factors affecting associate biodiversity of single woody plant species and to develop guidance for the design of global biodiversity sampling studies. Location Worldwide. Taxon Insects and Fungi. Methods Literature about factors affecting the diversity of insects and fungi in association with single plant species on global, regional, local and different temporal scales was reviewed. Case studies of insect and fungal diversity, primarily collected on single plant species, and the cost of collecting and analysing samples from locations around the world were analysed. Results The review of the literature illustrated various factors affecting diversity, and the case studies allowed quantification of the relative impact of some spatial, temporal and financial aspects on captured biodiversity and, thus, illustrate the need to consider all possible factors that may affect the result of the sampling when deciding on a sampling design. Main conclusions Our study illustrates the factors that should be considered when deciding on the location and timing of sampling for sentinel plants, which is important because of the trade-off between the number of samples and sampling locations needed to detect many of the species which may be potential pests, and the cost of (repeated) sampling in many locations. Decisions about the sampling design must be based on the objective of the sampling, but our recommendations apply irrespective of the targeted plant species or country.

TI  - Atmospheric Sounding from Fengyun-3C GPS Radio Occultation Observations: First Results and Validation
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carrying global positioning system (GPS) radio occultation (RO) receiver, Chinese meteorological satellite Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) was launched on September 23, 2013, which provides new observation data for observations and studies of weather and climate change. In this paper, the results of FY-3C GPS RO atmospheric sounding are presented for the first time, including high-order ionospheric correction, atmospheric parameters estimation, and evaluation by COSMIC and radiosonde observations as well as applications in estimating gravity wave activities. It is found that the effect of the ionospheric correction residual on the phase delay is below 20 mm, which has minimal impact on bending angle estimation and generates differences of about 1K in the average temperature profile. The difference between FY-3C and COSMIC temperatures at all heights is within 1 degrees C, and the tropopause temperature and height have a good consistency. Deviations from Radiosonde measurements are within 2 degrees C, and the tropopause temperature and height results also have a strong consistency. Furthermore, global gravity wave potential energy is estimated from FY-3C GPS RO, exhibiting similar behavior to results derived from COSMIC radio occultation measurements. The mean value of the gravity wave potential energy near the equator is 10 J/kg and decreases toward the two poles while in the northern hemisphere, it is stronger than that in the southern hemisphere.

TI  - Utilization of Advanced Slope-based Indexing Technique (ASIT) for the extraction of built-up land
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, there are numerous remote-sensing indices that are used in the classification of built-up land in order to monitor population and urbanization growth. As urbanization is the cause of Urban Heat Island (UHI) as well as a major contributor to climate warming, therefore, automatic mapping of built-up areas is considered an important tool to monitor the effects of urbanization on the climate change. The current research study proposed a new built-up indexing technique, i.e. Advanced Slope-based Indexing Technique (ASIT) for separating land features having similar spectral pattern and explores its potential for mapping built-up area in comparison to other available spectral indices for the study area comprises of Karachi region of Pakistan. The Otsu thresholding method is utilized on ASIT built-up index as well as on four of the available built-up indices for the separation of built-up areas from non-built-up areas. To analyse the success rate of the ASIT built-up index, 850 reference points are taken from high-resolution pan-chromatic satellite data. The implementation of the proposed index to a portion of Landsat 8 image consisting of study area results in an overall accuracy (OA) of 89.566% with a Kappa coefficient (K) of 0.779. The comparative analysis inferred that the proposed ASIT built-up index improves the OA of 2.931% and K of 0.053 when compared with the VbSWIR1-BI index which is the supposed to be the most effective index among all the available indices.

TI  - Measurement of the three-dimensional surface deformation of the Jiaju landslide using a surface-parallel flow model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR Interferometry (InSAR) is a powerful technique for mapping land surface deformation, but single one-dimensional (1D) InSAR line-of-sight (LOS) measurement limits its application in three-dimensional (3D) displacement retrieval. Traditional methods were developed for measuring large-scale deformation. In this paper, to retrieve the slow 3D deformation process in the Jiaju landslide, a surface-parallel flow model is applied, according to the existing geological data gained from this landslide. Nine ENVISAT ASAR images and 19 ALOS PALSAR images were collected to reconstruct the 3D deformation field. An iterative method for correcting the characteristic value (IMCCV) with maximum likelihood estimation (M-estimation) adaptively generates an accurate stochastic model. The 3D deformation measurements show that the northern part of the Jiaju landslide clearly had horizontal deformation with the largest deformation velocity exceeding 15 cm year(-1), while the southern part was relatively stable. Similarly, large vertical deformation appeared in the northern part (-2 cm year(-1)) and little deformation occurred in the southern part (-0.5 cm year(-1)). Compared with GPS measurements, the standard deviation is 1.4 cm year(-1) and 0.7 cm year(-1) in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. Therefore, the Jiaju landslide exhibited movements in the horizontal direction accompanied by slight settlement in the vertical direction.

TI  - Aboveground forest biomass based on OLSR and an ANN model integrating LiDAR and optical data in a mountainous region of China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground forest biomass (B-agf) and height of forest canopy (H-fc) are of great significance for the determination of carbon sources and sinks, carbon cycling and global change research. In this paper, B-agf of coniferous and broadleaf forest in the Chinese Three Gorges region is estimated by integrating light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and Landsat derived data. For a better B-agf estimation, a synergetic extrapolation method for regional H-fc is explored based on a specific relationship between LiDAR footprint H-fc and optical data such as vegetation index (VI), leaf area index (LAI) and forest vegetation cover (FVC). Then, an ordinary least squares regression (OLSR) and a back propagation neural network (BP-NN) model for regional B-agf estimation from synergetic LiDAR and optical data are developed and compared. Validation results show that the OLSR can achieve higher accuracy of H-fc estimation for all forest types (R-2 = 0.751, Root mean square error (RMSE) = 5.74 m). The OLSR estimated B-agf shows a good agreement with field measurements. The accuracy of regional B-agf estimated by the BP-NN model (RMSE = 12.23 t ha(-1)) is superior to that estimated by the OLSR method (RMSE = 17.77 t ha(-1)) especially in areas with complex topography.

TI  - A model for the rapid monitoring of soil salinization in the Yellow River Delta using Landsat 8 OLI imagery based on VI-SI feature space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional monitoring methods often ignore the vegetation information, which has significantly indirect influence on the process of soil salinization. In this study, the vegetation indices-salinity indices (VI-SI) feature space was utilized to improve the inversion accuracy of soil salinity, while considering the bare soil and vegetation information. By fully considering the surface vegetation landscape in the Yellow River Delta, twelve VI-SI feature spaces were constructed, and two categories of soil salinization monitoring index were established. The experiment results showed that remote sensing monitoring index based on MSAVI-SI1 had the highest inversion accuracy (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.912), while that based on the ENDVI-SI4 feature space had the lowest (R-2 = 0.664). Therefore, the remote sensing monitoring index derived from MSAVI-SI can greatly improve the dynamic and periodical monitoring of soil salinity in the Yellow River Delta.

TI  - Analysing the consistency between built-up areas and human activities and the impacts on the urbanization process: a case study of Zhengzhou, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation is accompanied by drastic urban sprawl and populations gathering in cities. The new urban districts in China have gradually become the most effective form of built-up area expansion, but the corresponding human activities within these built-up areas have not increased at the same rate, which has led to the emergence of urbanisation-related problems, such as ghost cities. However, few studies have focused on the evolution of this inconsistency within a city, especially at multiple scales. Based on Landsat images and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Programme-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) data, our study calculated the barycentre, the agglomeration degree and the consistency index to quantitatively analyse the spatio-temporal consistency between built-up areas and human activities within a city from 1993 to 2013. A mainstream urban example in China, Zhengzhou, which accepted financial and policy support from the government and underwent rapid urbanisation, was chosen as a case study. The results of this study showed that (1) the consistency between built-up areas and human activities was characterised by an approximately S-shaped curve that divided the city's development into three stages, namely, relative stability (1993-1998), rapid development exhibiting inconsistency (1998-2008) and the optimisation and matching of spatial factors (2008-2013); (2) the inconsistency stage had two diametrically opposed patterns: the increase in human activities lagged behind the expansion of built-up areas, and the opposite occurred in older areas, which resulted in the emergence of ghost cities in new districts and crowded populations in the old cities; and (3) the inconsistency stage occurs easily; thus attention should be paid during the promotion of urbanisation processes in rapidly developing cities such as Zhengzhou; however, as the urban population increases, under economic development and a policy of unceasing expansion, the area of inconsistency was mitigated after 2010. Our findings illustrated the influence of consistency on built-up areas and human activities in terms of coordinated development within cities and provided a better understanding of the urbanisation process in Chinese cities.

TI  - Unidirectional variation and deep CNN denoiser priors for simultaneously destriping and denoising optical remote sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stripe and random noise are two different degradation phenomena commonly co-existing in optical remote sensing images, which are often modelled as inverse problems, respectively. When solving those inverse problems, model-based optimization and discriminative learning methods are fashionably employed but have their respective merits and drawbacks, e.g., model-based optimization methods are flexible but usually time-consuming while discriminative learning methods have fast testing speed but are limited by the specialized task. To improve testing speed and obtain good performance, this paper integrates deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) denoiser prior into unidirectional variation (UV) model, named as UV-DCNN, to simultaneously destripe and denoise optical remote sensing images. The proposed UV-DCNN method can be efficiently solved by the alternating minimization optimization method. Both quantitative and qualitative experiment results validate that the proposed method is effective and even better than the state-of-the-arts, its satisfactory computation time makes it suitable for extensive application.

TI  - Comparative tests on methods for automatic mapping of land cover dynamics from multi-year images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most land use/land cover (LULC) mapping methods require us to collect ground reference data at the time when the remotely sensed data are acquired. However, the high cost of the data collection limits the production of annual LULC maps in a short time span. In this study, in order to reduce the mapping cost and improve the timeliness of the map products, several simple and effective methods were tested and compared with same-year mapping (SY), including cross-year mapping (CY), multiple-indices automatic classification (MI), and spectral transfer (ST) and index transfer (IT). For the study years of 2001-2016, SY yields accuracies higher than 93%, the mean CY accuracy is about 83%, and the MI accuracy reaches 88%. Both the overall accuracies (above 90%) and the detailed accuracy indicators of the ST and IT are higher than those of CY and MI, and very close to the SY accuracy. It can, therefore, be stated that the methods are able to map urban LULC variations automatically, withsatisfactory performance.

TI  - Differences in monitoring vegetation dynamics between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Collection 5 and Collection 6 vegetation index products on the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately monitoring vegetation dynamics on the Loess Plateau (LP) is critical for evaluating the benefits of ecological restoration projects. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index (VI) product has been a primary data source for monitoring vegetation dynamics. However, MODIS Collection 5 (C5) VI products are known to be affected by sensor degradation, which has been addressed in the newly released MODIS Collection 6 (C6) VI products. Herein, we compared the spatiotemporal differences in vegetation dynamics between the Terra MODIS C5 and C6 data products and among different annual value retrieval methods for the LP during 2001-2016. Our results indicated a lower magnitude but a greener trend in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and areas with significant greening (p <0.050) were found to increase by about 13%-16% from C5 to C6, depending on the retrieval method. Regions with either no particular trend or a downward trend in vegetation derived from the Terra-C5 NDVI mostly showed significant increasing trends based on the Terra-C6 NDVI. Moreover, the different retrieval methods also exhibited differences in the evaluation of vegetation dynamics, with the largest differences in terms of both magnitude and trend being identified with the annual maximum value method. This highlighted a compelling need to choose suitable methods in different regions for the retrieval of annual VI values, in order to facilitate more robust and comparable conclusions. Additionally, discrepancies also existed in the response of vegetation to climate variations between the Terra-C5 and C6 products for all three annual VI retrieval methods. Our findings, based on multiple products and analysis methods, may lead to improved understanding of both vegetation dynamics and their linkage to climate variables. The results suggest that caution be utilized when using only MODIS Terra-C5 products to evaluate vegetation dynamics and calibrate ecosystem models.

TI  - Optimization of PSInSAR networks with application to TomoSAR for full detection of single and double persistent scatterers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we develop an optimized network to achieve the full detection of single and double persistent scatterers (PSs) in SAR tomography (TomoSAR). The two-tier network used in persistent scatterer interferometry (PSInSAR) is applied to TomoSAR. Adaptive network densification is constructed to improve global connectivity in the first-tier network. This optimization contributes to improving the connectivity of different clusters by sacrificing computational efficiency slightly. In the second-tier network, we develop an omnidirectional point extension method by progressively constructing local networks and multi-directional extension. This contributes to identifying scatterers that are far away from the reference points in the first-tier network. This improved point extension method can achieve the full extraction of single and double PSs, which is especially applicable in areas with unevenly and sparsely distributed PSs. To validate these improvements, we applied the method to the western reclaimed area of Shenzhen, China with offshore islands and facilities using 30 COSMO-SkyMed images.

TI  - Integrating geostatistics and remote sensing for mapping the spatial distribution of cattle hoofprints in relation to malaria vector control
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, malaria is still a persistent health problem affecting more than 200 million people. With about 90% of malaria cases occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa, it becomes imperative to understand the environmental factors contributing to malaria vector proliferation. The cattle hoofprints are known to be some of the productive breeding sites for Anopheles (An.) arabiensis and An. fenestus in Southern and East African countries. Therefore, this study aimed at testing the potential of integrating field data and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for mapping cattle hoofprint distribution in the Vhembe District, South Africa. The purpose was to improve the predictability of mosquito breeding sites in the study area by using field point dataset and Sentinel-2 data. Due to the difficulty of sampling all locations in the study area, the spatial interpolation was employed to create continuous surfaces of cattle hoofprints, using limited sampled point observations. The sampled point observations were then correlated with Sentinel-derived variables for predicting cattle hoofprints at unsampled locations. The ordinary Kriging (OK), co-Kriging (CK) and step-wise multiple linear regression (SMLR) were used due to their ability to incorporate both field point data and ancillary datasets. The CK was the best performing interpolation method, with R-2 = 0.69 for validation dataset (n = 33), compared to OK (R-2 = 0.57) and SMLR (R-2 = 0.25). The resulting co-Kriging semivariogram shows that the combination of field data and remote sensing dataset improves the prediction accuracy of cattle hoofprint distribution. Findings from this study demonstrated that the interpolation error for estimating cattle hoofprints/100 m(2) can be minimized greatly by using CK (RMSE = 0.2; MAD = 0.04) than with both OK (RMSE = 2.39; MAD = 2.11) and SMLR (RMSE = 5.20; MAD = 4.55) methods. Furthermore, the results from this study indicate that there is a high number of cattle hoofprints in malaria-prone areas at the study site than in the malaria-free areas. Studies such as this provide the platform for developing an operational platform for long-term monitoring of areas susceptible to malaria, risks, and control management.

TI  - Histopathological lesions, pathogens and parasites as health indicators of an edible clam (Protothaca thaca) inhabiting a bay exposed to anthropogenic activities in Northern Chile
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - San Jorge Bay (23 degrees S) is characterised by a permanent coastal upwelling front and a thermal front that influence water circulation into the bay. This bay constantly receives effluents from different mining activities. Several studies have demonstrated different levels of heavy metals in waters and sediments within the bay. The clam Protothaca thaca is a bivalve with sedentary habits, which is distributed along the Peruvian and Chilean coasts and is exploited commercially. During 2010, clams were collected inside the bay: north (La Chimba), centre (Paraiso) and south (Llacolen), as well as from a site outside the bay (Bolsico). Haematological parameters, condition factor index, lesions, parasites and pathogens and heavy metal concentrations in clam tissues were determined. The health indicators of clams inhabiting the bay varied between sites. Clams inside the bay showed higher prevalence and intensity of parasites and lesions than those clams inhabiting the site outside the bay, which could be indicating the presence of some environmental stressor (e.g. heavy metals). This study is the first to evaluate the health status of organisms from San Jorge Bay, and our results support the hypothesis that clams P. thaca can be used to evaluate environmental quality.

TI  - The spatiotemporal patterns of sea ice in the Bohai Sea during the winter seasons of 2000-2016
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, sea ice thickness (SIT) and sea ice extent (SIE) in the Bohai Sea from 2000 to 2016 were investigated. A surface heat balance equation was applied to calculate SIT using ice surface temperatures estimated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with input from air temperature and wind speed from reanalyzing weather data. No trend was found in SIT during 2000-2016. The mean SIT and SIE during this period were 5.58 +/- 0.86 cm and 23x10(3)+/- 8x10(3) km(2), respectively. The largest SIT and SIE periods were observed during the second half of January and the first half of February, respectively. The Spearman correlation coefficient between mean ice thickness and average air temperature from 21 automatic weather stations around the Bohai Sea was -0.94 (P < .005), and the coefficient between median ice extent and negative accumulated temperature was -0.503 (P < .001). The rate of increase in air temperature around the Bohai Sea is 0.271 degrees C per decade in winter for 1979-2016 (P < .05), which is much lower than that in northern polar area (0.648 degrees C per decade). This rate has not resulted in a decreasing trend in SIT and SIE for the past 16 years in the Bohai Sea.

TI  - Mapping a keystone shrub species, huckleberry (<i>Vaccinium membranaceum</i>), using seasonal colour change in the Rocky Mountains
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Black huckleberries (Vaccinium membranaceum) provide a critical food resource to many wildlife species, including apex omnivores such as the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), and play an important socioeconomic role for many communities in western North America, especially indigenous peoples. Remote sensing imagery offers the potential for accurate landscape-level mapping of huckleberries because the shrub changes colour seasonally. We developed two methods, for local and regional scales, to map a shrub species using leaf seasonal colour change from remote sensing imagery. We assessed accuracy with ground-based vegetation surveys. The high-resolution supervised random forest classification from one-meter resolution National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery achieved an overall accuracy of 75.31% (kappa=0.26). The approach using multi-temporal 30-meter Landsat imagery similarly had an overall accuracy of 79.19% (kappa=.31). We found underprediction error was related to higher forest cover and a lack of visible colour change on the ground in some plots. Where forest cover was low, both models performed better. In areas with <10% forest cover, the high-resolution classification achieved an accuracy of 80.73% (kappa=0.48), while the Landsat model had an accuracy of 82.55% (kappa=0.47). Based on the fine-scale predictions, we found that 94% of huckleberry shrubs identified in our study area of Glacier National Park, Montana, USA are over 100 meters from human recreation trails. This information could be combined with productivity and phenology information to estimate the timing and availability of food resources for wildlife and to provide managers with a tool to identify and manage huckleberries. The development of the multi-temporal Landsat models sets the stage for assessment of impacts of disturbance at regional scales on this ecologically, culturally, and economically important shrub species. Our approach to map huckleberries is straightforward, efficient and accessible to wildlife and environmental managers and researchers in diverse fields.

TI  - Integrating spectral and textural attributes to measure magnitude in object-based change vector analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing accessibility of high or very high spatial resolution remote sensing images, more and more change detection works are conducted on the unit of image object, i.e. the object-based change detection (OBCD). Change vector analysis (CVA) is a promising tool for unsupervised OBCD because it can provide reasonable interpretation of the change and an insight into the type of change. However, various features and attributes of image object produce complex high dimensional feature space that poses new challenges to measure the overall change magnitude and direction in CVA. This paper presents a new approach to measure the overall change magnitude of an image object by integrating its spectral and textural attributes, self-adaptively. The new approach was compared with the standard CVA magnitude, Mahalanobis distance, and a recent Self-Adaptive Weight CVA (SAW-CVA) magnitude for unsupervised OBCD with the same OTSU auto-thresholding method. Two cases were investigated where Case I used bi-temporal WorldView multispectral images (4-band) and Case II employed bi-temporal three-band images obtained from Google Earth. Results in the two cases both demonstrated that the new approach outperforms the others for unsupervised OBCD. The percentage correct classification of the new approach, SAW-CVA, standard CVA, and Mahalanobis are 80.28%, 77.93%, 72.77%, and 61.50% in Case I, and 91.80%, 90.16%, 88.52%, and 90.16% in Case II. Further analysis indicated that the new approach gives more reasonable self-adaptive weights and it does not require the empirical self-adaptive index as compared with the recent SAW-CVA method.

TI  - Simulation of snowmelt-runoff under climate change scenarios in a data-scarce mountain environment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Pakistan is an agriculture-based economy and major proportion of irrigation water for its cultivated lands is abstracted from the Upper Indus Basin (UIB). UIB water supplies are mostly contributed from the high-altitude snow and glacier fields situated in the Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalayan ranges. Any change in the flows of these river catchments due to climate variability may result in the form of catastrophic events like floods and droughts and hence will adversely affect the economy of Pakistan. This study aims to simulate snowmelt runoff in a mountainous sub-catchment (Shyok River basin) of the UIB under climate change scenarios. Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) coupled with remotely sensed snow cover product (MOD10A2) is used to simulate the snowmelt runoff under current and future climate scenarios in the study area. The results indicate that (a) SRM has efficiently simulated the flow in Shyok River with average Nash-Sutcliff coefficient value (R-2) of 0.8 (0.63-0.93) for all six years (2000-2006) of basin-wide and zone-wise simulations, (b) an increase of 10% (by 2050) and 20% (by 2075) in SCA will result in a flow rise of similar to 11% and similar to 20%, respectively, and (c) an increase of 1 degrees C (by 2025), 2 degrees C (by 2050), 3 degrees C (by 2075) and 4 degrees C (by 2100) in mean temperature will result in a flow rise of similar to 26%, similar to 54%, similar to 81% and similar to 118%, respectively. This study suggests that SRM equipped with remotely sensed snow cover data is an effective tool to estimate snowmelt runoff in high mountain data-scarce environments.

TI  - Determination of selected dichloroanilines and phthalates in lyophilised mussels samples with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after QuEChERS clean-up
T2  - FOOD ADDITIVES AND CONTAMINANTS PART A-CHEMISTRY ANALYSIS CONTROL EXPOSURE & RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mussels, a marine filter organism, constitute a food product and an established sentinel organism for marine pollution. An analytical method following a QuEChERS extraction and clean-up protocol has been developed for the determination of phthalic acid esters (PAE), including di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP), di-(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), di-methyl phthalate (DMP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), as well as 3,4-dichloroaniline and 3,5-dichloroaniline in lyophilised mussels samples. A gradient elution program starting from 40% A (methanol-0.1% formic acid) - 60% B (H2O-0.1% formic acid) up to 100% A was applied, with a total duration of 15 min, at a flow rate of 200 mu L min(-1) using a 1.8 mu m particle size C18 analytical column. All target analytes were detected with a triple quadrupole MS, using electrospray ionisation (ESI) in positive ionisation mode, in SRM mode under optimised conditions. Sample preparation consisted of lyophilisation of the mussels sample and grinding, followed by a QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, Safe) protocol. Among the different dispersants evaluated for sample clean-up effectiveness, primary secondary amine (PSA) was found to be the most efficient. Results indicated good chromatographic separation, fast sample preparation procedure, low LODs and LOQs, good trueness expressed as recovery and good precision as evaluated by RSD. In the mussels samples examined DEHP was the most abundant PAE, reaching a maximal concentration of 280 mu g/kg of lyophilised weight whereas the levels of DnBP were at approximately 36% of the legal migration limit in foods determined by the EU.

TI  - The potential role of very high-resolution imagery to characterise lake, wetland and stream systems across the Prairie Pothole Region, United States
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic features critical to watershed hydrology range widely in size from narrow, shallow streams to large, deep lakes. In this study we evaluated wetland, lake, and river systems across the Prairie Pothole Region to explore where pan-sharpened high-resolution (PSHR) imagery, relative to Landsat imagery, could provide additional data on surface water distribution and movement, missed by Landsat. We used the monthly Global Surface Water (GSW) Landsat product as well as surface water derived from Landsat imagery using a matched filtering algorithm (MF Landsat) to help consider how including partially inundated Landsat pixels as water influenced our findings. The PSHR outputs (and MF Landsat) were able to identify similar to 60-90% more surface water interactions between waterbodies, relative to the GSW Landsat product. However, regardless of Landsat source, by documenting many smaller (<0.2ha), inundated wetlands, the PSHR outputs modified our interpretation of wetland size distribution across the Prairie Pothole Region.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we have presented surface velocity estimation of Chhota Shigri (CS) and Bara Shigri (BS) glaciers in the Himalaya using C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 (S-1). Repeat-pass SAR image subpixel offset tracking has been used to generate velocity vectors from yearly and seasonal S-1 data sets. SAR offset tracking on the basis of maximum intensity correlation provided the two-dimensional (2-D) movement of the both CS and BS glaciers of Chandra valley in western Himalaya. Movement of the glacier has been observed in the terminus to ablation zone during 2014-2018. S-1-derived movement is compared with in-situ measurement over CS glacier, and it has shown approximately 25% deviation during 2015-2016 with respect to field measurements from 2009 to 2010. Similar to previous decade observations, S-1 offset tracking movement results of recent three years have shown a decreasing trend.

TI  - Water Surface Temperature and Suspended Sediment Concentration (SSC) Retrieval from Landsat Imagery, Northwest Territories, Canada
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents water surface temperature retrieval using Landsat thermal band and meteorological ancillary data. The algorithms were tested using Landsat-5/7/8 imagery acquired at different study sites along the Slave River and Mackenzie River of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. By comparing the retrieved temperatures with in situ water temperatures, in-depth validation of one reliable retrieved technique was successfully demonstrated. The method yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) in the range of 1.00-1.38 degrees C, over 7 validation locations in a 2-year observation period. This paper also presents a method to estimate suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the Slave River region using Landsat-8 imagery. The numerical relationships between in situ SSC measurements and water-leaving reflectance in visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands were investigated through regression fitting. The SSC estimation results using the retrieved models were analyzed and validated, the NIR model was found to generate the smallest estimation errors with a MAE of 7.98 mg/L using leave-one-out (LOO) uncertainty assessment. An operational web-based tool for water surface temperature and SSC mapping based on the algorithms validated during this study has been developed to address additional monitoring requirements of the NWT communities. The design and implementation of this tool is also described.

TI  - Estimating deciduous broadleaf forest gross primary productivity by remote sensing data using a random forest regression model
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) is a significant indicator of terrestrial system carbon cycle and is one of the most important parameters of global climate change. Accurate modeling of GPP is important for understanding the changes of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Although many studies have been conducted to explore methods for estimating GPP, large uncertainties still exist among different models. The combination of remote sensing data with flux data is a feasible approach to determine site-based GPP. Using multisource remote sensing data, meteorological data obtained from Google Earth Engine, and GPP estimates from eddy covariance measurement, we present a model, based on the random forest regression (RFR) algorithm, to predict site-scale GPP. First, we train and tune the RFR model for 16 global deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) flux sites by remote sensing-based drivers. Then we evaluate the RFR model's performance by predicting GPP for the other eight DBF sites. Our results show that, compared with the MOD17A2H GPP product, this GPP prediction method improves modeling of GPP, with an R-2 of 0.82 and an RMSE of 1.93 gC m(-2) d(-1). Contribution analysis shows that the enhanced vegetation index is the most important driver among input variables. Our study may provide a reliable method to predict GPP in global DBF, which is promising for different-scale evaluations of carbon sequestration.

TI  - The cultural, family and community factors for resilience in southeast asian indigenous communities: A systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Although faced with historical and ongoing hardships, many indigenous communities in Southeast Asia have managed to survive and thrive. The identification of factors that assist these communities in coping with the challenges experienced would help enhance their overall psychological well-being and resilience. The current review outlines types of protective factors for the indigenous communities in Southeast Asia focusing on the cultural, family and community elements linked to their psychological well-being. Four themes of protective factors were identified strong connection to the land and the environment, embracing cultural norms and traditions, passing down and keeping indigenous knowledge across generations, and emphasis on community and social cohesion. Findings suggest that the value of interconnectedness serves as an overarching theme that forms the worldview of the indigenous communities in Southeast Asia. Interconnectedness was important to the indigenous peoples as they considered themselves to be extensions of their family, community, ancestors, future descendants, the land and to all living things and creations that reside on their lands. Future intervention attempts to promote resilience among these communities should take these factors into account, and pay closer attention to community-level factors that seem to have a profound impact on the indigenous construction of resilience.

TI  - Mine tailing extraction indexes and model using remote-sensing images in southeast Hubei Province
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Southeast Hubei province is an important iron-copper production base in China, which has produced a large number of mine tailings from mining activities. Although they contain a certain amount of iron or copper as secondary mineral resources, the mine tailings and related acid wastewater can lead to environmental pollution through sand blowing or seepage. For effective resource utilization and environmentally conscious development, rapid evaluations of the spatial distribution, type, and age of mine tailings are of national importance. Using spectral features, which are determined by the structure and composition of tailings, we develop an all-band tailing index, a modified normalized difference tailing index (MNTI), and a normalized difference tailings index for Fe-bearing minerals (NDTIFe). The all-band tailings index reflect the micro-structure and overall high reflectivity of mine tailings by comprehensively utilizing information from each band of Landsat 8 data. The MNTI and NDTIFe provide enhanced tailings composition information from the perspective of anion (carbanion and hydroxy) and cation (mainly ferric ion) contents, respectively. A tailing extraction model (TEM) is built using these three indexes to extract mine tailing information in Huangshi city. The TEM proposed in this paper can successfully and rapidly extract mine tailings information with an extraction precision of 84% in the research area.

AB  - This curriculum studies article uncovers how ideological commitments often, without acknowledgment, determine instruction. Through a comparison of two popular Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) curricula, both focused on the same subject, one emerging out of a fundamentalist religious worldview and the other a progressive, modernist religious worldview, curricular nuances are explored and theorized. Ultimately, this article argues that small differences in instruction serve to shape radically different conceptions of religious activity.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Reconstruction of MODIS NDVI by Regional Land Surface Phenology and Harmonic Analysis of Time-Series
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is frequently obstructed by adverse atmospheric components resulting in data gaps in time series. The harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) algorithm is a widely used technique to reconstruct missing NDVI time series. However, due to restriction of HANTS to act within temporal dimension, its direct application is bound to endure practical problems in spatiotemporal reconstruction due to large data gaps. This study proposes Moving Offset Method (MOM), a novel prefilling method applied on NDVI time series prior to application of HANTS. MOM restores the missing NDVI time series by assuming that it tends to follow a reference pattern of land surface phenology (NDVIref). The NDVIref is prepared by using a recursive search and fill algorithm (SFA) for data availability without null values. It restores null values in NDVIref at a pixel by using coefficients of linear regression with NDVIref at another pixel having identical conditions. Finally, the prefilling is prior to application of HANTS. The proposed approach is demonstrated by using MODIS 16-daily time series data for Northeast India and Bhutan region which is covered with frequent seasonal clouds. Besides direct application of HANTS, it is also compared with similar approaches which includes prefilling by inverse distance weighted (IDW) and cubic spline, prior to application of HANTS. The fitting indicators, overall reconstruction error (ORE) and normalized noise related error (NNRE) are found to be best for proposed approach in spatiotemporal comparison. Also, restoration of seasonality trait the NDVI time series better in the proposed approach. This approach is concluded to be an enhancement for HANTS that could be helpful in improving quality of NDVI reconstruction for regions with frequent seasonal obstructions around the globe.

TI  - Characterising spatio-temporal variability in seasonal snow cover at a regional scale from MODIS data: the Clutha Catchment, New Zealand
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A 16-year series of daily snow-covered area (SCA) for 2000-2016 is derived from MODIS imagery to produce a regional-scale snow cover climatology for New Zealand's largest catchment, the Clutha Catchment. Filling a geographic gap in observations of seasonal snow, this record provides a basis for understanding spatio-temporal variability in seasonal snow cover and, combined with climatic data, provides insight into controls on variability. Seasonal snow cover metrics including daily SCA, mean snow cover duration (SCD), annual SCD anomaly and daily snow-line elevation (SLE) were derived and assessed for temporal trends. Modes of spatial variability were characterised, whilst also preserving temporal signals by applying raster principal component analysis (rPCA) to maps of annual SCD anomaly. Sensitivity of SCD to temperature and precipitation variability was assessed in a semi-distributed way for mountain ranges across the catchment. The influence of anomalous winter air flow, as characterised by HYSPLIT back-trajectories, on SCD variability was also assessed. On average, SCA peaks in late June, at around 30 % of the catchment area, with 10 % of the catchment area sustaining snow cover for > 120 d yr(-1). A persistent mid-winter reduction in SCA, prior to a second peak in August, is attributed to the prevalence of winter blocking highs in the New Zealand region. In contrast to other regions globally, no significant decrease in SCD was observed, but substantial spatial and temporal variability was present. rPCA identified six distinct modes of spatial variability, characterising 77 % of the observed variability in SCD. This analysis of SCD anomalies revealed strong spatio-temporal variability beyond that associated with topographic controls, which can result in snow cover conditions being out of phase across the catchment. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the sensitivity of SCD to temperature and precipitation variability varies significantly across the catchment. While two large-scale climate modes, the SOI and SAM, fail to explain observed variability, specific spatial modes of SCD are favoured by anomalous airflow from the NE, E and SE. These findings illustrate the complexity of atmospheric controls on SCD within the catchment and support the need to incorporate atmospheric processes that govern variability of the energy balance, as well as the re-distribution of snow by wind in order to improve the modelling of future changes in seasonal snow.

AB  - An automatic object-detection method is necessary to facilitate the efficient analysis of satellite images consisting of multispectral images. Considering that the relationship between spectrums is important for discriminating objects in multispectral images. This paper proposes a feature extraction method that can capture both spatial and spectral relationships of the multispectral images. Moreover, image preprocessing and dimensionality reduction procedures are introduced for stable feature extraction. In this study, we conducted experiments for detecting two types of objects by using Landsat 8 images. The proposed method improved the detection performance relative to other image features.

TI  - Sub-kilometer Precipitation Datasets for Snowpack and Glacier Modeling in Alpine Terrain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Capturing the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation at fine scale is necessary for high-resolution modeling of snowpack and glacier mass balance in alpine terrain. In this study, we assess the impact of three sub-kilometer precipitation datasets on distributed simulations of snowpack and glacier mass balance with the detailed snowpack model Crocus for winter 2011-2012. The different precipitation datasets at 500-m grid spacing over the northern and central French Alps are coming from (i) the SAFRAN reanalysis specially developed for alpine terrain interpolated at 500-m grid spacing, (ii) the numerical weather prediction (NWP) system AROME at 2.5-km resolution downscaled with a precipitation-elevation adjustment factor, and (iii) a version of AROME at 500-m grid spacing. The spatial patterns of seasonal snowfall are first analyzed for the different precipitation datasets. Large differences between SAFRAN and the two versions of AROME are found at high-altitude and in regions of strong orographic precipitation enhancement. Results of Crocus snowpack simulations are then evaluated against (i) point measurements of snow depth, (ii) maps of snow covered areas retrieved from optical satellite data (MODIS) and (iii) field measurements of winter accumulation of six glaciers. The two versions of AROME lead to an overestimation of snow depth and snow-covered area, which are substantially improved by SAFRAN. However, all the precipitation datasets lead to an underestimation of snow depth increase at the daily scale and cumulated over the season, with AROME 500 m providing the best performances at the seasonal scale. The low correlation found between the biases in snow depth and in cumulated snow depth increase illustrates that total snow depth has a limited significance for the evaluation of precipitation datasets. Measurements of glacier winter mass balance showed a systematic underestimation of high-elevation snow accumulation with SAFRAN. The two versions of AROME overestimate the winter mass balance at four glaciers and produce nearly unbiased estimations for two of them. Our study illustrates the need for improvements in the precipitation field from high-resolution NWP systems for snow and glacier modeling in alpine terrain.

TI  - Redesigning a Sentinel Surveillance System for Collecting and Disseminating Near Real-Time Agricultural Injury Reports: System Usability Study.
T2  - JMIR formative research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Injury data and reports provide valuable information for both public and private organizations to guide programming, policy, and prevention, but in the increasingly complex and dangerous industry of US agriculture, the injury surveillance needed to produce this data is lacking. To address the gap, AgInjuryNews was established in 2015. The system includes fatal and nonfatal injury cases derived from publicly available reports, including occupational and nonoccupational injuries, occurring in the agricultural, forestry, and fishing (AFF) industry.OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to develop a stakeholder-engaged redesign of the interactive, up-to-date, and publicly available dataset of US AFF injury and fatality reports.METHODS: Instructor-led heuristic evaluations within a 15-student undergraduate course, data from 8 student participants of laboratory-based usability testing and 2016 and 2017 AgInjuryNews-registered user surveys, coupled with input from the National Steering Committee informed the development priorities for 2018. An interdisciplinary team employed an agile methodology of 2-week sprints developing in ASP.NET and Structured Query Language to deliver an intuitive frontend and a flexible, yet structured, backend, including a case report input form for capturing more than 50 data points on each injury report.RESULTS: AgInjuryNews produced 17,714 page views from 43 countries in 2018 captured via Google Analytics, whereas 623 injury reports were coded and loaded, totaling more than 31,000 data points. Newly designed features include customizable email alerts, an interactive map, and expanded search and filter options. User groups such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Agricultural Safety and Health Council of America have endorsed the system within their networks. News media have cited or referenced the system in national outlets such as the New York Times, Politico, and the Washington Post.CONCLUSIONS: The new system's features, functions, and improved data granularity have sparked innovative lines of research and increased collaborative interest domestically and abroad. It is anticipated that this nontraditional sentinel surveillance system and its dataset will continue to serve many purposes for public and private agricultural safety and health stakeholders in the years to come..

TI  - Unsupervised remote sensing image segmentation based on a dual autoencoder
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aimed at solving the limitation of the traditional unsupervised segmentation method of remote sensing images that rely more on features and prior knowledge, an unsupervised remote sensing image segmentation method combined with the atrous convolution autoencoder and the bidirectional long- and short-time memory autoencoder autoencoder (BiLSTM) network is proposed. The multispectral remote senses images using the dimensional reduction capacity of the autoencoder to obtain the transverse low-dimensional spatial features of the image through the atrous convolution autoencoder, and they use the BiLSTM autoencoder to learn the longitudinal low-dimensional spectral features of the multiband sequence of the remote sensing image. The batch normalization layer is added to optimize the whole network, and the visualization method is used to dynamically train and adjust the model. The data clustering of two kinds of low-dimensional features is obtained by the softmax algorithm, and unsupervised image segmentation of the multispectral data is finally realized by fusing the clustering results. In the experiment, the original data of Landsat8 remote sensing images were clustered and segmented directly. The results show that the accuracy is up to 83.25% through the clustering of dual autoencoder network in the water information extraction, which is obviously better than the common clustering algorithm and can get better image segmentation results.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 data have been used in various fields of human activity. In cultural heritage, their potential is still to be fully explored. This paper aims to illustrate how remote sensing and open source tools are useful for archaeological investigations. The whole issue revolves around the application of satellite (Sentinel-2) and accessory tools for the identification, knowledge and protection of the cultural heritage of two areas of southern Italy: Sant'Arsenio (SA) and Foggia (FG). Both study cases were selected for a specific reason: to demonstrate the usefulness of open data and software for research and preservation of cultural heritage, as in the case of urban sprawl, development of public works (gas- and oil-pipelines, etc.) or intensive use of land for agricultural purposes. The results obtained are relevant for the knowledge improvement and very useful to operate in the field of preventive archaeology, for the evaluation and management of risk, the planning of city-expansion or infrastructures that could damage the buried heritage.

TI  - Satellite Estimation of Chlorophyll-a Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Sensor in Shallow Coastal Water Bodies: Validation and Improvement
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The size and distribution of Phytoplankton populations are indicators of the ecological status of a water body. The chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is estimated as a proxy for the distribution of phytoplankton biomass. Remote sensing is the only practical method for the synoptic assessment of Chl-a at large spatial and temporal scales. Long-term records of ocean color data from the MODIS Aqua Sensor have proven inadequate to assess Chl-a due to the lack of a robust ocean color algorithm. Chl-a estimation in shallow and coastal water bodies has been a challenge and existing operational algorithms are only suitable for deeper water bodies. In this study, the Ocean Color 3M (OC3M) derived Chl-a concentrations were compared with observed data to assess the performance of the OC3M algorithm. Subsequently, a regression analysis between in situ Chl-a and remote sensing reflectance was performed to obtain a green-red band algorithm for coastal (case 2) water. The OC3M algorithm yielded an accurate estimate of Chl-a for deep ocean (case 1) water (RMSE = 0.007, r(2) = 0.518, p < 0.001), but failed to perform well in the coastal (case 2) water of Chesapeake Bay (RMSE = 23.217, r(2) = 0.009, p = 0.356). The algorithm developed in this study predicted Chl-a more accurately in Chesapeake Bay (RMSE = 4.924, r(2) = 0.444, p < 0.001) than the OC3M algorithm. The study indicates a maximum band ratio formulation using green and red bands could improve the satellite estimation of Chl-a in coastal waters.

TI  - Improving the Persian Gulf sea surface temperature simulation by assimilating the satellite data via the ensemble Kalman
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the indicators representing the permissible performance of a marine model is the capability of model in providing an accurate spatiotemporal distribution of the thermal structure of domain. Data assimilation is taken into account as an expedient platform in order to achieve this goal. In this paper, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) was applied as a data assimilation scheme to enhance the sea surface temperature (SST) simulation and whereupon the underwater temperature of the Persian Gulf in the finite volume community ocean model (FVCOM). The daily satellite measured SST data that obtained from advanced very high-resolution radiometer pathfinder were considered as observational assimilation data. The comparisons between the results of both proposed models including FVCOM and SST measurements were carried out to evaluate the efficiency of data assimilation. The comparisons revealed a meaningful improvement in the assimilated simulation of the spatiotemporal SST variability in the whole domain, especially in the shallow parts and near the Hormuz Strait. The root-mean-square error reduced significantly in assimilation run. The statistical comparisons of the results bias denote a positive impact of the data assimilation.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the spatial and temporal distribution of land degradation hotspots and their driving forces in the northwest coast of Egypt (NWC) based on MODIS-Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite rainfall data, using time series analysis and binomial logistic regression methodologies. The time series analyses of rainfall TRMM data across 20012016 proved the inter-annual rainfall variability through northwest coast of Egypt. Year 2016 was the most wet year with similar to 690 mm/year and year 2010 is the most dry one with 89 mm/year with a trend line of 150 to 300 mm. Negative trends in vegetation degradation occurred across 2001-2016 in 28-37% at NWC, Dabaa and Matrouh, but only in 13% at Barrani Areas with improvement of vegetation cover ranged between 5 and 15% at NWC, Dabaa and Matrouh and increased to 38% at Barrani. The reclassified RESTREND-human induced rainfall adjusted map gives land degradation hotspots up to about 37% of the NWC area across 2001-2016, while 27% responded to land improvement measures. About half of the land degradation area (16%) and about one tenth (9%) of the land improvement areas are statistically significant. Spatial logistic regression modeling ranked the factors influencing land degradation dynamics in Matrouh subarea in decreasing order as: elevation, slope, range land, vegetation index, negative change in vegetation index, bare land, mid-slope position, and multi resolution ridge top flatness index.

TI  - Understanding climate and land surface changes impact on water resources using Budyko framework and remote sensing data in Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and land degradation are the two drivers playing a significant role in changing freshwater availability. Targeted intervention requires understanding the role of each driver and their spatial dominance. However, detangling the effects of these factors and identifying where each plays the most important role is still unclear. In this study, we used Budyko-like framework and remote sensing data to evaluate the spatial effects of climate and land surface changes on water availability in Ethiopia. At national level, the mean long-term annual runoff change after 20 years is positive (about 80 mm/year), and is equally accountable to climate change (50%) and landscape surface changes (50%). However, both the change and contribution of the two factors vary spatially. In northern (Tigray region) and southeastern (Somali region) Ethiopia, the contribution of climate change is larger than the land surface changes on water resources. Particularly in the southeastern part of the country (Somali region), 70% of the changes in water resources is attributed to climate change. In most areas of the country, the change in water resources due to land surface change is positive. The detail percentage contribution of the two factors on the water resource change for each administrative zone is provided.

TI  - Remote sensing satellite imagery for prospecting geothermal systems in an aseismic geologic setting: Yankari Park, Nigeria
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this investigation is to evaluate the applicability of multispectral satellite imagery for hydrothermal alteration mineral mapping and thermal anomaly detection as a proxy for the characterization of subtle geothermal systems in an aseismic geologic setting. The Yankari Park, an area in northeastern Nigeria characterized by several surface manifestations of hotsprings and hydrothermally altered rock deposits was selected for this study. The study evaluates the effectiveness of the Independent Component Analysis and Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) algorithm for target detection of hydrothermal alteration zones and the Single Channel Algorithm for thermal anomaly detection associated with subtle geothermal systems using spectral bands of Landsat-8, ASTER and Landsat-7, respectively. The results indicated that the use of verified image endmember spectra gives more accurate results compared to that from library spectra by implementing MTMF. Results of mapping thermally anomalous pixels did not conform to known locations of the thermal springs, however, examining the spatial correlation of the anomaly areas with the major fault-fracture systems from the geological map of the study area indicates a close affinity between them and with previously reported thermal gradients within heat conserving sedimentary formations. This investigation has significant implications as it signifies the need for the integrative use of alteration mineral mapping and thermal anomaly detection for cost-effective prefeasibility stage mapping of geothermal systems in an aseismic geologic setting located in African plate and other regions around the world.

AB  - The reliable forecast of imminent future earthquakes is still questionable due to uncertainties regarding the complex phenomena of earthquake occurrence and the hierarchical nature of the lithosphere. However, numerous retrospective studies suggest the implications of earthquake-accompanying processes within the context of earthquake forecasting. In this connection, an attempt is made here to verify the enhancement in thermal IR emissions associated with the extraordinary major (M 7.7) and shallow (depth approximate to 15 km) Awaran earthquake (Sep 24, 2013). The satellite thermal imagery record is analyzed to identify the possible effect of pre- and post-seismic changes around the epicentral region (latitude 25-29 degrees N; longitude 63-67 degrees E) for a suitable selected time window (July 27, 2013 to Nov 16, 2013). The pre-earthquake satellite imagery records reveal a very clear and distinct thermal anomaly developed within the earthquake preparation zone almost 6-10 days earlier, while the analysis of post-earthquake imagery record shows a decreasing trend of thermal anomaly as a function of time. The daily land surface temperature (LST) shows an anomalous rise of 7-9 degrees C on Sep 18, 2013, almost 6 days prior to the event occurrence, which is further authenticated by the statistical criterion (with a confidence interval of 95%. Furthermore, the comparative and percentile analysis of daily and 5-year-averaged LST also exhibits abnormal increase associated with this particular event. In addition to all above, the present study is also consistent with the earlier findings and suggests a multi-precursory strategy for earthquake forecasting research.

TI  - Assessing Changes in Sodium Content of Selected Popular Commercially Processed and Restaurant Foods: Results from the USDA: CDC Sentinel Foods Surveillance Program
T2  - NUTRIENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This report provides an update from the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Sentinel Foods Surveillance Program, exploring changes in sodium and related nutrients (energy, potassium, total and saturated fat, and total sugar) in popular, sodium-contributing, commercially processed and restaurant foods with added sodium. In 2010-2013, we obtained 3432 samples nationwide and chemically analyzed 1654 composites plus label information for 125 foods, to determine baseline laboratory and label sodium concentrations, respectively. In 2014-2017, we re-sampled and chemically analyzed 43 of the Sentinel Foods (1181 samples), tested for significant changes of at least +/- 10% (p < 0.05), in addition to tracking changes in labels for 108 Sentinel Foods. Our results show that the label sodium levels of a majority of the Sentinel Foods had not changed since baseline (similar to 1/3rd of the products reported changes, with twice as many reductions as increases). Laboratory analyses of the 43 Sentinel Foods show that eight foods had significant changes (p < 0.05); sodium content continues to be high and variable, and there was no consistent pattern of changes in related nutrients. Comparisons of changes in labels and laboratory sodium shows consistency for 60% of the products, i.e., similar changes (or no changes) in laboratory and label sodium content. The data from this monitoring program may help public health officials to develop strategies to reduce and monitor sodium trends in the food supply.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrated the ability of a Landsat-8 OLI multispectral data to identify and delineate hydrothermal alteration zones around auriferous prospects within the crystalline basement, North-western Nigeria. Remote sensing techniques have been widely used in lithological, structural discrimination and alteration rock delineation, and in general geological studies. Several artisanal mining activities for gold deposit occur in the surrounding areas within the basement complex and the search for new possible mineralized zones have heightened in recent times. Systematic Landsat-8 OLI data processing methods such as colour composite, band ratio and minimum noise fraction were used in this study. Colour composite of band 4, 3 and 2 was displayed in Red-Green-Blue colour image to distinguish lithologies. Band ratio 4/2 image displayed in red was used to highlight ferric-ion bearing minerals (hematite, goethite, jarosite) associated with hydrothermal alteration, band ratio 5/6 image displayed in green was used to highlight ferrous-ion bearing minerals such as olivine, amphibole and pyroxenes, while ratio 6/7 image displayed in blue was used to highlight clay minerals, micas, talc-carbonates, etc. Band rationing helped to reduce the topographic illumination effect within images. The result of this study showed the distribution of the lithological units and the hydrothermal alteration zone which can be further prospected for mineral reserves.

TI  - An 18-year Study of Malignant Melanoma in Childhood and Adolescence
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Malignant melanoma is rare in childhood and adolescence. Diagnostic uncertainty and misdiagnosis often lead to delayed treatment.Methods: We evaluated children and adolescents under 20 years of age presenting with malignant melanoma at our institution over an 18-year period. Data were collected, analyzed, and interpreted, following which findings were compared with the existing literature.Results: Twenty-four patients were included in the study with mean follow-up of 61.8 months. Males comprised 54% of cases. On presentation, 33% of children had melanoma of s thickness 2-4mm and 34% had stage III disease. Younger children presented with thicker melanomas, differing subtypes, and more advanced stage disease compared with older children. Extremities were the most common sites affected (42%). Dissection of the draining lymph node basins was undertaken in 38% of cases. Overall survival was 92%.Conclusions: Tumor subtype, biology, hormonal influence, and lymph node status are all important prognostic factors in malignant melanoma in childhood and adolescence. Compared with adults, children presenting with thicker melanomas and more advanced stage disease generally have more favorable outcomes and a better survival. Plastic surgeons, commonly encountering skin lesion in children, must maintain a high index of suspicion so that early excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy may be promptly offered to patients with melanoma.

TI  - MITIGATING THE GENDER GAP IN THE WILLINGNESS TO COMPETE: EVIDENCE FROM A RANDOMIZED FIELD EXPERIMENT
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate the impact on competitiveness of a randomized educational intervention that aims to foster grit, a skill that is highly predictive of achievement. The intervention is implemented in elementary schools, and we measure its impact using a dynamic competition task with interim performance feedback. We find that when children are exposed to a worldview that emphasizes the role of effort in achievement and encourages perseverance, the gender gap in the willingness to compete disappears. We show that the elimination of this gap implies significant efficiency gains. We also provide suggestive evidence on a plausible causal mechanism that runs through the positive impact of enhanced grit on girls' optimism about their future performance.

TI  - Vertical Structure and Seasonal Features of the Heat Island and Humidity Distribution over Moscow Derived from Satellite Data
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical structure and annual variations in the urban heat island (UHI) and dry/wet islands over Moscow are investigated using MetOp satellite data for 2015-2017. It is shown that Moscow is characterized by the dominance of the evening maximum of UHI intensity; however, the UHI intensification during the cold season mainly occurs in the daytime. According to satellite data, the maximum development of UHI over Moscow is observed in the forenoon in January. The urban effect propagates to the height of similar to 2000 m during the warm season and to the height of 1250 m in the forenoon and to 800 m in the evening during the cold season. During the warm season, UHI is accompanied by the dry island in the forenoon and by the wet island at the upper levels in the evening. The existence of the wet island in the lower air layers was not corroborated. Due to the current accuracy of temperature and humidity retrieval (0.5-1 K and 10%, respectively) as well as due to the low vertical resolution of satellite data, the present research is mainly methodological, and the results are preliminary and open to discussion.

TI  - Validating the Predictive Power of Statistical Models in Retrieving Leaf Dry Matter Content of a Coastal Wetland from a Sentinel-2 Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf dry matter content (LDMC), the ratio of leaf dry mass to its fresh mass, is a key plant trait, which is an indicator for many critical aspects of plant growth and survival. Accurate and fast detection of the spatiotemporal dynamics of LDMC would help understanding plants' carbon assimilation and relative growth rate, and may then be used as an input for vegetation process models to monitor ecosystems. Satellite remote sensing is an effective tool for predicting such plant traits non-destructively. However, studies on the applicability of remote sensing for LDMC retrieval are scarce. Only a few studies have looked into the practicality of using remotely sensed data for the prediction of LDMC in a forest ecosystem. In this study, we assessed the performance of partial least squares regression (PLSR) plus 11 widely used vegetation indices (VIs), calculated based on different combinations of Sentinel-2 bands, in predicting LDMC in a coastal wetland. The accuracy of the selected methods was validated using LDMC, destructively measured in 50 randomly distributed sample plots at the study site in Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands. The PLSR applied to canopy reflectance of Sentinel-2 bands resulted in accurate prediction of LDMC (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.71, RMSE = 0.033). PLSR applied to the studied VIs provided an R-2 of 0.70 and RMSE of 0.033. Four vegetation indices (enhanced vegetation index(EVI), specific leaf area vegetation index (SLAVI), simple ratio vegetation index (SRVI), and visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI)) computed using band 3 (green) and band 11 of the Sentinel-2 performed equally well and achieved a good measure of accuracy (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 0.034). Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data to map LDMC in a coastal wetland.

TI  - Contribution of remote sensing and geochemistry approaches to identify hydrogeological interconnections between Sminja and Oued Rmel Aquifer System (SORAS) (North-eastern Tunisia)
T2  - DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sminja-Oued Rmel aquifer system, located at Zaghouan region, is exploited for irrigation and meeting the drinking water demands of agglomerations. To identify the lateral communications between the Sminja and Oued Rmel aquifer system, two approaches were applied: geochemistry and remote sensing. The chemical analyses of waters of the two aquifers show a predominance of sodium and calcium cations and chloride and bicarbonate anions. An enrichment of sodium and chloride from upstream to downstream of each aquifer was found. A raise of sodium and chloride concentrations were founded from upstream to downstream for each aquifer. A similar chemical composition of the water samples located in the west part of Oued Rmel aquifer and waters of Sminja aquifer was identified. This proves, through mixture phenomenon, the importance of communication of waters of the Sminja to the Oued Rmel aquifer. The lineaments mapping was developed by processing Landsat ETM+ satellite data with several techniques (color composition, principal component analysis and filtering) and using computer softwares such as Envi, ArcGis and PCI Geomatica. The analysis of lineaments map pulled out a total of 13 hydraulic fractures which allow the hydrogeological interconnections between both aquifers. The statistical analysis of lineament patterns using directional rosettes and the lineament density map showed a predominance of ESE-WNW faults.

TI  - Revisiting the activated protein C-protein S-thrombomodulin ternary pathway: Impact of new understanding on its laboratory investigation
T2  - TRANSFUSION AND APHERESIS SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Although suspected conceptually in the 60 s, Protein C and Protein S activities in hemostasis were investigated and reported from the mid-80 s, followed by the discovery of Thrombomodulin, an endothelial cell membrane associated protein, playing the most important heamostatic role. These 3 proteins act in regulating thrombo-genesis and protecting against thrombo-embolic events. When blood is activated, any trace of circulating thrombin is captured by Thrombomodulin in the microcirculation, making thrombin become an anticoagulant through its capacity to activate Protein C to Activated Protein C, which operates as a sentinel in blood coagulation, in the form of a complex with free Protein S, to block any new blood activation site, and more especially circulating activated Factors V and VIII. Protein S not only acts as the Activated Protein C cofactor, but also as the cofactor of Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor. In addition, it has some functions in the complement pathway through its binding to C4b-BP. Another capability of activated protein C is to lower fibrinolytic activity, as the Activated Protein C Inhibitor is also known as Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 3. The Protein C-Protein S system becomes less efficient in the presence of mutated Factor V (Factor V-Leiden or other variants), which is resistant to its inactivating effect. Other pathologies linked to this system concern the development of allo- or auto-antibodies to Protein S or to thrombin, which can generate severe thrombotic complications in affected patients. Some antithrombotic drugs have originated from this regulatory system. Protein C or Protein S concentrates are used for treating deficient patients. Activated Protein C (especially in patients with sepsis) or Thrombomodulin are proposed as antithrombotic medications. Most importantly, congenital or acquired Protein C or Protein S deficiencies are associated with severe recurrent thrombotic events. From the clinical standpoint most of the patients are heterozygous, as homozygosity is almost incompatible with life in the absence of a continuous and efficient treatment. Laboratory investigation of this highly complex system involves many different specialized assays for measuring these 3 proteins' activities, their antigenic content or their genetic sequence. The Protein S in-vitro anticoagulant activity is weak and contrasts with its high antithrombotic role in-vivo, showing that diagnostic assays have not yet succeeded in reproducing all the natural mechanisms for evidencing the anticoagulant role of Protein S. This paradoxal notion is discussed and illustrated in this manuscript as well is a revisit of the major characteristics and pathophysiological functions of the Protein C-Protein S-Thrombomodulin system; the associated pathologies; and the main laboratory tools available for clinical diagnosis. In respect to future perspectives, we also focused on developing more significant and relevant assays, especially for Protein S, thanks to the understanding of its biological roles.

TI  - A 10-year wave energy resource assessment and trends of Indonesia based on satellite observations
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wave energy resource assessment and trends around Indonesian's ocean has been carried out by means of analyzing satellite observations. Wave energy flux or wave power can be approximated using parameterized sea states derived from satellite data. Unfortunately, only some surface parameters can be measured from remote sensing satellites, for example for ocean surface waves: significant wave height. Others, like peak wave period and energy period are not available, but can instead be estimated using empirical models. The results have been assessed by meteorological season. The assessment shows clearly where and when the wave power resource is promising around Indonesian's ocean. The most striking result was found from June to August, in which about 30-40 kW/m (the 90th percentile: 40-60 kW/m, the 99th percentile: 50-70 kW/m) wave power energy on average has been found around south of the Java Island. The significant trends of wave energy at the 95% level have also been studied and it is found that the trends only occurred for the extreme cases, which is the 99th percentile (i.e., highest 1%). Wave power energy could increase up to 150 W/m per year. The significant wave heights and wave power have been compared with the results obtained from global wave model hindcast carried out by wave model WAVEWATCH III. The comparisons indicated excellent agreements.

TI  - Estimation of fruit load in mango orchards: tree sampling considerations and use of machine vision and satellite imagery
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In current best commercial practice, pre-harvest fruit load predictions of mango orchards are provided based on a manual count of fruit number on up to 5% of trees within each block. However, the variability in fruit number per tree (coefficient of variation, CV, from 27 to 93% across ten orchards) was demonstrated to be such that the best case commercial sampling practice was inadequate for reliable estimation (to an error of 54-82 fruit/tree, and percentage error, PE, of 10% at a probability of 0.95). These results highlight the need for alternative methods for estimation of orchard fruit load. Pre-harvest fruit load was estimated for a case study orchard of 469 trees using (i) count of a sample of trees, (ii) in-field machine vision and (iii) correlation to a tree spectral index estimated using high resolution satellite imagery. A count of 5% of trees (23) in the trial orchard resulted in a PE of 31% (error of 37 fruit/tree), with a count of 157 trees required to achieve a PE of 10% (error of 12 fruit/tree). Sampling effort to achieve a PE of 10% was decreased by only 10% by sampling from aspatial k-means tree classifications based on machine vision derived fruit counts of all trees. Clustering based on tree attributes of canopy volume and trunk circumference was not helpful in decreasing sampling effort as these attributes were poorly correlated to fruit load (R-2=0.21 and 0.17, respectively). In-field multi-view machine vision-based estimation of fruit load per tree achieved a R-2=0.97 and a RMSE=14.8 fruit/tree against harvest fruit count per tree for a set of 18 trees (average=88; SD=82 fruit/tree), using a faster region convolutional neural network trained the previous season. The relationship between WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite spectral reflectance characteristics of sampled trees and fruit number was characterised by a R-2=0.66 and a RMSE=56.1 fruit/tree. For this orchard, for which the actual fruit harvest was 56,720 fruit, the estimate based on a manual count of 5% of trees was 47,955 fruit, while estimates based on 20 iterations of stratified sampling (of 5% of trees in each cycle) had variation (SD) of 9597. The machine vision method resulted in an estimate of 53,520 (SD=1960) fruit and the remote sensing method, 51,944 (SD=26,300) fruit for the orchard.

TI  - Offshore Spreading of Mississippi Waters: Pathways and Vertical Structure Under Eddy Influence
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The three-dimensional structure of the offshore export of Mississippi River (MR) waters is documented for the first time with in situ data. Numerical simulations and satellite data in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) are also employed to study two pathways that were detected in summer of 2015, along the eastern and western sides of the Loop Current (LC). The initial formation of offshore branches was primarily due to the interaction of the anticyclonic LC and LC Eddy (which were close to the MR Delta and the Louisiana-Texas shelf-slope, respectively) with riverine waters that had been advected eastward by westerly winds (which reduced the westward buoyancy-driven currents). The interaction of anticyclonic circulation patterns with cyclones (LC Frontal Eddies) was found to influence the dynamics and structure of the branches. Thickness variability and other vertical characteristics of the brackish plumes were investigated from their origin in the northern GoM through their extension in the Straits of Florida. In particular, offshore branch thickness increased near the LC and LC Frontal Eddy fronts. The two types of pathways revealed different factors contributing to the low-salinity waters. Besides the MR input, precipitation contributed to the eastern pathway, while waters from additional northern GoM rivers contributed to the western pathway. The study offers new insights on the processes that control the formation and the offshore (southward) advection of low-salinity waters. These processes have implications on the properties of waters hundreds of kilometers from the northern river sources, extending to the southern Gulf and the Straits of Florida.

TI  - Ultrasound-guided FNA cytology of groin lymph nodes improves the management of squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva: Results from a comparative cytohistological study
T2  - CANCER CYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Lymph node metastases represent the most important negative prognostic predictor in vulvar carcinoma. Therefore, an accurate preoperative assessment of suspicious lymph nodes would be fundamental for a personalized therapy. The aim of this article was to assess the reliability of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the preoperative assessment of nodal metastatic disease in 43 patients with vulvar cancer. Methods In total, 43 FNAC specimens of clinicoradiologically suspicious lymph nodes with corresponding nodal resection specimens were collected from 2016 to 2018 at Catholic University Hospital in Rome. Cytohistologic correlation was performed. Patients were treated with wide local excision of the vulvar mass followed by bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy and radiotherapy if the tumor involved a lymph node or the vulvar margins. Results Cytologic examination agreed with histology in 37 of 43 cases (86.04%). The authors observed a positive FNAC result in 14 of 20 histologically confirmed metastatic lymph nodes, 6 false-negative cases, and no false-positive results. The sensitivity and specificity of cytological examination were 76.92% and 100%, respectively. All patients with FNAC-positive results showed metastatic disease in other surgically resected inguinofemoral nodes. Eleven of 29 patients (37.9%) with FNAC-negative results also showed metastatic disease in subsequent lymphadenectomy specimens, but the extent of metastases was always <1 cm (range, 0.1-0.6 cm). Conclusions FNAC of suspicious lymph nodes represents a useful tool in the management of patients with vulvar cancer. A positive result enables the surgeon to immediately perform a bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy thus avoiding an unnecessary sentinel lymph node sampling. Finally, FNAC can also predict the presence and extent of metastatic disease in other surgically resected inguinofemoral lymph nodes.

TI  - Detection of Phytoplankton Temporal Anomalies Based on Satellite Inherent Optical Properties: A Tool for Monitoring Phytoplankton Blooms
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The baseline of a specific variable defines the average behavior of that variable and it must be built from long data series that represent its spatial and temporal variability. In coastal and marine waters, phytoplankton can produce blooms characterized by a wide range of total cells number or chlorophyll a concentration. Classifying a phytoplankton abundance increase as a bloom depends on the species, the study area and the season. The objective of this study was to define the baseline of satellite absorption coefficients in Todos Santos Bay (Baja California, Mexico) to determine the presence of phytoplankton blooms based on the satellite inherent optical properties index (satellite IOP index). Two field points were selected according to historical bloom reports. To build the baseline, the data of phytoplankton absorption coefficients (a(phy,GIOP)) and detritus plus colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (a(dCDOM,GIOP)) from the generalized inherent optical property (GIOP) satellite model of the NASA moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua) sensor was studied for the period 2003 to 2016. Field data taken during a phytoplankton bloom event on June 2017 was used to validate the use of satellite products. The association between field and satellite data had a significant positive correlation. The satellite baseline detected a trend change from high values to low values of the satellite IOP index since 2010. Improved wastewater treatment to waters discharged into the Bay, and increased aquaculture of filter-feeding mollusks could have been the cause. The methodology proposed in this study can be a supplementary tool for permanent in situ monitoring programs. This methodology offers several advantages: A complete spatial coverage of the specific coastal area under study, appropriate temporal resolution and a tool for building an objective baseline to detect deviation from average conditions during phytoplankton bloom events.

M3  - Article
AB  - Smart phones are generally utilized in our everyday lives. We utilize computationally escalated versatile applications, for example, face location, enlarged reality, video preparing, video gaming and discourse acknowledgment. These applications are perplexing as well as they request high figuring assets. These gadgets show a few constraints, for example, restricted calculation control, little memory estimate, erratic system availability, constrained battery lifetime, and so forth. Every one of these constraints can be survived if distributed computing can be coordinated with cell phones. Versatile distributed computing is the worldview which can be utilized to give boundless access of figuring assets to cell phones. Computational offloading is a ground-breaking system utilized in versatile distributed computing for improving reaction time and battery productivity of the cell phones which are considered as two basic factors in the ease of use of portable applications. By offloading computationally concentrated assignments to committed processing framework, gadgets can diminish load alone assets while profiting by assets given by the devoted foundation. This paper gives a diagram of different foundation, structures and procedures for calculation offloading.

TI  - Spatial prediction of gully erosion using ALOS PALSAR data and ensemble bivariate and data mining models
T2  - GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is recognized as a powerful and efficient tool that provides a comprehensive view of large areas that are difficult to access, and also reduces costs and shortens the timing of projects. The purpose of this study is to introduce effective parameters using remote sensing data and subsequently predict gully erosion using statistical models of Density Area (DA) and Information Value (IV), and data mining based Random Forest (RF) model and their ensemble. The aforementioned models were employed at the Tororud-Najarabad watershed in the northeastern part of Semnan province, Iran. For this purpose, at first using various resources, the map of the distribution of the gullies was prepared with the help of field visits and Google Earth images. In order to analyse the earth's surface and extraction of topographic parameters, a digital elevation model derived from PALSAR (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) radar data with a resolution of 12.5 meters was used. Using literature review, expert opinion and multi-collinearity test, 15 environmental parameters were selected with a resolution of 12.5 meters for the modelling. Results of RF model indicate that parameters of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), elevation and land use respectively had the highest effect on the gully erosion. Several techniques such as area under curve (AUC), seed cell area index (SCAI), and Kappa coefficient were used for validation. Results of validation indicated that the combination of bivariate (IV and DA models) with the RF data-mining model has increased their performance. The prediction accuracy of AUC and Kappa values in DA, IV and RF are (0.745, 0.782, and 0.792) and (0.804, 0.852, and 0.860) and these values in ensemble models of DA-RF and IV-RF are (0.845, and 0.911) and (0.872, and 0.951) respectively. Results of SCAI show that ensemble models had a good performance, so that, with increasing of sensitivity, the values of SCAI have decreased. Based on results, determination of gullies and assessing the process of gullying through remote sensing technology in combination with field observations and accurate statistical and computer methods can be a suitable methodology for predicting areas with gully erosion potential.

TI  - Utility of Normalized Difference Water Index and GIS for Mapping Surface Water Dynamics in Sub-Upper Krishna Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of the surface water dynamics in parts of Upper Krishna River basin, Maharashtra State of India, was attempted in this study. It comprises an upland watershed and a major tributary of Krishna River in the Upper Krishna basin. Keeping in view that it is essential to appraise the accessibility of surface water in a basin containing the non-perennial river to deal with the water resource management, the present study area was chosen for investigations. This study modelled the surface water dynamics of the Sub-upper Krishna basin (SUKB) over a period of 17 years from 1999 to 2016 with cloud-free Landsat data sets. The technique of normalized difference water index (NDWI) was used to detect the surface water bodies of the basin. The NDWI-generated images were classified into water and non-water pixels, and an accuracy assessment was performed to find out producer's, user's, and overall accuracies of output. The NDWI method displays a good result of water surface detection with a Kappa coefficient ranging from 0.81 to 1.00 for the classified images. The surface water-mapped images were used to classify the water into permanent water, seasonal water and new permanent water. The change detection is performed and mapped using geographic information system (GIS) operations to understand the surface water dynamics from 1999 to 2016. The results illustrated the effectiveness of the NDWI approach for surface water mapping and GIS for change detection analysis, especially in detecting the changes in different times, simultaneously.

TI  - Evaluation of Grass Quality under Different Soil Management Scenarios Using Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral and multispectral imagery have been demonstrated to have a considerable potential for near real-time monitoring and mapping of grass quality indicators. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of remote sensing techniques for quantification of aboveground grass biomass (BM) and crude protein (CP) in a temperate European climate such as Ireland. The experiment was conducted on 64 plots and 53 paddocks with varying quantities of nitrogen applied. Hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and multispectral imagery (MSI) were analyzed to develop the prediction models. The MSI data used in this study were captured using an unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) and the satellite Sentinel-2, while the HSI data were obtained using a handheld hyperspectral camera. The prediction models were developed using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and stepwise multi-linear regression (MLR). Eventually, the spatial distribution of grass biomass over plots and paddocks was mapped to assess the within-field variability of grass quality metrics. An excellent accuracy was achieved for the prediction of BM and CP using HSI (RPD > 2.5 and R-2 > 0.8), and a good accuracy was obtained via MSI-UAV (2 < RPD < 2.5 and R-2 > 0.7) for the grass quality indicators. The accuracy of the models calculated using MSI-Sentinel-2 was reasonable for BM prediction and insufficient for CP estimation. The red-edge range of the wavelengths showed the maximum impact on the predictability of grass BM, and the NIR range had the greatest influence on the estimation of grass CP. Both the PLSR and MLR techniques were found to be sufficiently robust for spectral modelling of aboveground BM and CP. The PLSR yielded a slightly better model than MLR. This study suggested that remote sensing techniques can be used as a rapid and reliable approach for near real-time quantitative assessment of fresh grass quality under a temperate European climate.

TI  - Improving Estimation Accuracy of Growing Stock by Multi-Frequency SAR and Multi-Spectral Data over Iran's Heterogeneously-Structured Broadleaf Hyrcanian Forests
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Via providing various ecosystem services, the old-growth Hyrcanian forests play a crucial role in the environment and anthropogenic aspects of Iran and beyond. The amount of growing stock volume (GSV) is a forest biophysical parameter with great importance in issues like economy, environmental protection, and adaptation to climate change. Thus, accurate and unbiased estimation of GSV is also crucial to be pursued across the Hyrcanian. Our goal was to investigate the potential of ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1's polarimetric features in combination with Sentinel-2 multi-spectral features for the GSV estimation in a portion of heterogeneously-structured and mountainous Hyrcanian forests. We used five different kernels by the support vector regression (nu-SVR) for the GSV estimation. Because each kernel differently models the parameters, we separately selected features for each kernel by a binary genetic algorithm (GA). We simultaneously optimized R-2 and RMSE in a suggested GA fitness function. We calculated R-2, RMSE to evaluate the models. We additionally calculated the standard deviation of validation metrics to estimate the model's stability. Also for models over-fitting or under-fitting analysis, we used mean difference (MD) index. The results suggested the use of polynomial kernel as the final model. Despite multiple methodical challenges raised from the composition and structure of the study site, we conclude that the combined use of polarimetric features (both dual and full) with spectral bands and indices can improve the GSV estimation over mixed broadleaf forests. This was partially supported by the use of proposed evaluation criterion within the GA, which helped to avoid the curse of dimensionality for the applied SVR and lowest over estimation or under estimation.

TI  - Assessment of Energy-Population-Urbanization Nexus with Changing Energy Industry Scenario in India
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The demand for energy has been growing worldwide, especially in India partly due to the rapid population growth and urbanization of the country. To meet the ever-increasing energy requirement while maintaining an ecological balance is a challenging task. However, the energy industry-induced effect on population and urbanization has not been addressed before. Therefore, this study investigates the linkages between energy, population, and urbanization. The study also aims to find the quantifiable indicators for the population growth and rate of urbanization due to the expanding energy industry. The integrated framework uses a multi-temporal Landsat data to analyze the urbanization pattern, a census data for changes in population growth, night time light (NTL) data as an indicator for economic development and energy production and consumption data for energy index. Multi-attribute model is used to calculate a unified metric, termed as the energy-population-urbanization (EPU) nexus index. The proposed approach is demonstrated in the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Dadri power plant located in Uttar Pradesh, India. Landsat and NTL data clearly shows the urbanization pattern, economic development, and electrification in the study area. A comparative analysis based on various multi-attribute decision model assessment techniques suggests that the average value of EPU nexus index is 0.529, which significantly large compared to other studies and require special attention by policymakers because large EPU index indicates stronger correlation among energy, population, and urbanization. The authors believe that it would help the policymakers in planning and development of future energy projects, policies, and long-term strategies as India is expanding its energy industry.

TI  - Assimilation of Remotely-Sensed LAI into WOFOST Model with the SUBPLEX Algorithm for Improving the Field-Scale Jujube Yield Forecasts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to enhance the simulated accuracy of jujube yields at the field scale, this study attempted to employ SUBPLEX algorithm to assimilate remotely sensed leaf area indices (LAI) of four key growth stages into a calibrated World Food Studies (WOFOST) model, and compare the accuracy of assimilation with the usual ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) assimilation. Statistical regression models of LAI and Landsat 8 vegetation indices at different developmental stages were established, showing a validated R-2 of 0.770, 0.841, 0.779, and 0.812, and a validated RMSE of 0.061, 0.144, 0.180, and 0.170 m(2) m(-2) for emergence, fruit filling, white maturity, and red maturity periods. The results showed that both SUBPLEX and EnKF assimilations significantly improved yield estimation performance compared with un-assimilated simulation. The SUBPLEX (R-2 = 0.78 and RMSE = 0.64 t ha(-1)) also showed slightly better yield prediction accuracy compared with EnKF assimilation (R-2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 0.71 t ha(-1)), especially for high-yield and low-yield jujube orchards. SUBPLEX assimilation produced a relative bias error (RBE, %) that was more concentrated near zero, being lower than 10% in 80.1%, and lower than 20% in 96.1% for SUBPLEX, 72.4% and 96.7% for EnKF, respectively. The study provided a new assimilation scheme based on SUBPLEX algorithm to employ remotely sensed data and a crop growth model to improve the field-scale fruit crops yield estimates.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surveillance of traffic condition by sensors is widely used in society to monitor the traffic condition of roads. To save budget andlengthen sensors' lifetime, it is thus of paramount importance to estimate the dynamical traffic condition of all the targeted locations by partial observing a minimum number of sensors. As thus, we do not need to deploy or open all of the expensive sensors of traffic condition everywhere and every time in the process of monitoring. Previous studies focus on the finding of a group of sentinel sensors with a single objective of precise estimation. However, the traffic sensors located in the city are inevitably influenced by their social/natural environment (e.g., social management and power) with complex interactions. In this paper, we propose a dynamic optimization model of sensor location selection for the sentinel surveillance of dynamical traffic condition under the realistic social and natural environment of a city. We use some non-concave items to model the interactions among sensors, which are the challenge to infer via nonlinear optimization algorithms. As thus, we give the details of alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm for our model, with the capability to deal with large interactions of variables. Taking the traffic system of Shanghai as a case study, our experiments show the proposed model's performance both in accuracy and flexibility of different balance among precision and natural/social constraints.

TI  - Disaggregation of modis land surface temperature in urban areas using improved thermal sharpening techniques
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of satellite thermal images are usually impeded by the low spatial resolution, leading to the development of various downscaling techniques. The thermal sharpening model based on the relationship between LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was developed which shows good results in agricultural areas but may not be applicable for urban areas. Therefore, the present study focuses on determining improved downscaling techniques that shows good results in different urban regions. Hence, the performance of six different indices, namely NDVI, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Urban Index (UI), Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were compared for thermal sharpening using Disaggregation of Radiometric Temperature (Distrad) Model over four different cities in India i.e. Bikaner, Hyderabad, Vadodara and Varanasi. LST obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors (930 m) were disaggregated to the spatial resolution of Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) (100 m) and compared with the Landsat LST. The performance of NDBI was found better as compared to other indices in the four cities having Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 1.54 K, 1.24 K, 1.10 K and 1.03 K, respectively. Further, NDBI was used for disaggregation using two robust regression techniques i.e. Least Median Square Regression (LMSR) and Bi-square regression which shows better results as compared to that of Distrad model in the four study sites. Bi-square regression method shows RMSE values of 1.30 K, 1.21 K, 0.98 K and 0.97 K, respectively for the four study sites. The LMSR and Bi-square regressions are less sensitive to outliers resulting in increased accuracy of downscaled LST. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Clinical features and outcomes of spitzoid proliferations in children and adolescents
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Spitzoid proliferations range from Spitz naevi to melanomas. There are few studies describing clinical features and outcomes in the paediatric population. Objectives To determine the clinical features and outcomes of a large paediatric cohort with histopathologically confirmed Spitz tumours. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of patients seen at Boston Children's Hospital who were aged < 20 years and had a histopathological diagnosis of spitzoid proliferation from 1 January 1994 to 23 October 2012. Results In total 595 patients with 622 spitzoid proliferations were identified (median age 7 center dot 4 years, interquartile range 4 center dot 6-11 center dot 7). Overall 512 proliferations (82 center dot 3%) were typical, 107 (17 center dot 2.%) were atypical and three (0 center dot 5%) were melanomas. The median ages at biopsy were 7 center dot 4, 7 center dot 2 and 17 center dot 2 years, respectively, and there was a significant difference in age at biopsy for patients with typical or atypical proliferations vs. melanoma (P < 0 center dot 01). Among samples with positive margins (n = 153), 55% (54 of 98) of typical proliferations, 77% (41 of 53) of atypical proliferations and 100% (two of two) of melanomas were re-excised. Six patients had sentinel lymph node biopsy performed, with three patients demonstrating nodes positive for melanocytic cells. Within a median follow-up of 4 center dot 1 years for the full cohort there were no related deaths. Conclusions Spitz tumours have strikingly benign outcomes in the paediatric population, although this study is limited by the low number of melanomas and restriction to a single paediatric institution. Aggressive management recommendations should be reconsidered for children and adolescents with banal-appearing Spitz naevi, based on the clinically indolent behaviour in this cohort.

TI  - Seasonal Progression of Ground Displacement Identified with Satellite Radar Interferometry and the Impact of Unusually Warm Conditions on Permafrost at the Yamal Peninsula in 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground subsidence monitoring by Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (InSAR) over Arctic permafrost areas is largely limited by long revisit intervals, which can lead to signal decorrelation. Recent satellite missions such as COSMO-Skymed (X-band) and Sentinel-1 (C-band) have comparably short time intervals of a few days. We analyze dense records of COSMO-Skymed from 2013 and 2016 and of Sentinel-1 from 2016, 2017, and 2018 for the unfrozen period over central Yamal (Russia). These years were distinct in environmental conditions and 2016 in particular was unusually warm. We evaluate the InSAR-derived displacement with in situ subsidence records, active-layer thickness measurements, borehole temperature records, meteorological data, C-band scatterometer records, and a land-cover classification based on Sentinel-1 and -2 data. Our results indicate that a comparison of seasonal thaw evolution between years is feasible after accounting for the early thaw data gap in InSAR time series (as a result of snow cover) through an assessment with respect to degree-days of thawing. Average rates of subsidence agree between in situ and Sentinel-1 (corrected for viewing geometry), with 3.9 mm and 4.3 mm per 100 degree-days of thaw at the test site. X-band and C-band records agree well with each other, including seasonal evolution of subsidence. The average displacement is more than twice in magnitude at the active-layer monitoring test site in 2016 compared to the other years. We further demonstrate that InSAR displacement can not only provide information on the magnitude of ground thaw but also on soil properties through analyses of seasonal evolution in extreme years.

TI  - Processes and patterns of glacier-influenced sedimentation and recent tidewater glacier dynamics in Darbel Bay, western Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetric data of unprecedented resolution are used to provide insights into former ice dynamics and glacial processes in a western Antarctic Peninsula embayment. An assemblage of submarine glacial landforms, which includes subglacially produced streamlined features and ice-marginal ridges, reveals the former pattern of ice flow and retreat. A group of more than 250 small (< 1-3 m high, 10-20 m wide) and relatively evenly spaced recessional moraines was identified beyond the margin of Philippa Glacier. The small recessional moraines are interpreted to have been produced during short-lived, possibly annual re-advances of a grounded ice margin during overall retreat. This is the first time that these features have been shown to be part of the assemblage of landforms produced by tidewater glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula. Glacier-terminus changes during the last four decades, mapped from LANDSAT satellite images, were analysed to determine whether the moraines were produced during recent still-stands or re-advances of Philippa Glacier and to further investigate the short-term (annual to decadal) variability in ice-marginal position in tidewater glacier systems. The asynchronous response of individual tidewater glaciers in Darbel Bay is interpreted to be controlled mainly by local topography rather than by glacier catchment-area size.

TI  - Mapping Irrigated Areas Using Sentinel-1 Time Series in Catalonia, Spain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping irrigated plots is essential for better water resource management. Today, the free and open access Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data with high revisit time offers a powerful tool for irrigation mapping at plot scale. Up to date, few studies have used S1 and S2 data to provide approaches for mapping irrigated plots. This study proposes a method to map irrigated plots using S1 SAR (synthetic aperture radar) time series. First, a dense temporal series of S1 backscattering coefficients were obtained at plot scale in VV (Vertical-Vertical) and VH (Vertical-Horizontal) polarizations over a study site located in Catalonia, Spain. In order to remove the ambiguity between rainfall and irrigation events, the S1 signal obtained at plot scale was used conjointly to S1 signal obtained at a grid scale (10 km x 10 km). Later, two mathematical transformations, including the principal component analysis (PCA) and the wavelet transformation (WT), were applied to the several SAR temporal series obtained in both VV and VH polarization. Irrigated areas were then classified using the principal component (PC) dimensions and the WT coefficients in two different random forest (RF) classifiers. Another classification approach using one dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) was also performed on the obtained S1 temporal series. The results derived from the RF classifiers with S1 data show high overall accuracy using the PC values (90.7%) and the WT coefficients (89.1%). By applying the CNN approach on SAR data, a significant overall accuracy of 94.1% was obtained. The potential of optical images to map irrigated areas by the mean of a normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) temporal series was also tested in this study in both the RF and the CNN approaches. The overall accuracy obtained using the NDVI in RF classifier reached 89.5% while that in the CNN reached 91.6%. The combined use of optical and radar data slightly enhanced the classification in the RF classifier but did not significantly change the accuracy obtained in the CNN approach using S1 data.

TI  - Socially responsible pedagogy: critical information literacy and art
T2  - REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the theoretical concept of socially responsible pedagogy because it applies to teaching information literacy.Design/methodology/approach - At Weber State University, two librarians use a socially responsible pedagogical approach, combining critical information literacy and visual literacy to teach an undergraduate information literacy course.Findings - Initial results suggest that the course design and the authors' approach to socially responsible pedagogy are largely successful based on students' application of course material to a signature assignment in the course.Research limitations/implications - Data are limited because this approach was only used for two semesters. The authors are aware that a socially responsible information literacy classroom needs quality assessment to help make instructional decisions, evaluate teaching strategies and assist with ongoing student learning. Additional semesters of using this instructional approach will allow for reflection and critical inquiry into the theories and teaching strategies that currently inform instruction. Early implications of using this method of instructional design reflect students' deep understanding of the importance of information literacy because they explore social justice topics.Practical implications - The practical implications of this research reveal a theoretical framework for teaching critical information literacy, called socially responsible pedagogy. The theory looks at teaching based on the "spirit" of the course, which is the promotion of equality. It also looks at "the art" of designing an information literacy course, incorporating socially responsible pedagogy, culturally responsive teaching and critical information literacy. This study also looks at "the science" of assessment and offers suggestions on how one might go about assessing a socially responsible information literacy class. Moreover, the authors examine how visual literacy helps teach information literacy concepts in the course as students put together a signature assignment that meets both information literacy course objectives and general education outcomes.Social implications - This general review of the theoretical concept of socially responsible pedagogy is limited to two semesters of information literacy instruction. In researching these topics, students situate themselves within a diverse worldview and work to promote awareness and advocacy through group presentations.Originality/value - While librarians are exploring critical librarianship and social justice, many are not using socially responsible pedagogy combined with other social theories and images to help students work through the research process and develop information literacy skills.

TI  - The Assimilation of Remote Sensing-Derived Soil Moisture Data into a Hydrological Model for the Mahanadi Basin, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate knowledge of the spatio-temporal variation in soil moisture provides insight into larger-scale hydrological processes and can, therefore, help in improving hydrological predictions. The strength of remote sensing for mapping surface soil moisture is well proven. In addition, data assimilation offers the opportunity to combine the advantages of modelling with those of remote sensing data to achieve higher accuracy and continuous improvement in hydrological forecasts. In this study, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth observation science soil moisture product was assimilated into Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model using Kalman filter data assimilation technique. Further, the updated multilayer spatio-temporal soil moisture distributions across the Mahanadi Basin, India, were simulated using the hydrological model. The VIC model was set up and parameterized using field-observed and remote sensing-derived data. Based on the sensitivity analysis of the model, the 'four-parameter' (Tmax, Tmin, Prec, and WS) meteorological forcing scenario was selected as the operational scenario. The output fluxes obtained from VIC were routed to simulate discharge at five stations for the calibration and validation of the model. With R-2 and model efficiency values close to 0.95 and 0.99, respectively, the model was proven to be suitable for simulating the hydrological responses of the basin. Soil moisture was assimilated in the top soil layer of the model using the Kalman filter approach, and the multilayer soil moisture regime was generated using the modelling approach. The validation of soil moisture (assimilated) products proves that these products are better than remote sensing and traditionally modelled soil moisture products, in both spatial and temporal domains in terms of availability and accuracy.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover change causes unprecedented changes on the surrounding environment at different spatial and temporal scales. Muga watershed of Upper Blue Nile basin is characterized by deterioration with mismanagement of natural resources. Thus, this study was aimed at detecting the magnitude and pattern of land use/land cover changes and assessing drivers of changes over the last three decades (1985-2017) in the Muga watershed. Synergy of Landsat imageries (1985, 2002, and 2017), household survey, focus group discussion, key informant interview, and field observation were used to detect changes and drivers of changes. Land use/land cover changes in the study watershed were detected using digital image analysis techniques, and their socioeconomic and biophysical drivers were analysed using descriptive statistics. The change detection results revealed a significant increasing trend of cultivated land and urban areas by 12 and 270%, respectively. In contrast, grasslands, forest lands and shrub-bushlands showed a declining trend of about 40, 21 and 12%, respectively. The socioeconomic data analysis results indicated that expansion of cultivated land, cutting of trees for fuelwood and construction purposes, population growth, land tenure policy, and climate variability were the most influential drivers of land use/land cover changes in the study watershed. The findings of this study confirmed that unmanaged land cover conversion led to degradation of natural resources of the study watershed. Thus, alternative sources of income for youths and landless peasants, and integrated watershed management, which has paramount importance in maintaining economic and ecological benefits were suggested to alleviate the adverse effects of land use/land cover changes in Muga watershed.

TI  - Characterisation of invasive plant proliferation within remnant riparian green corridors in Lusaka District of Zambia using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural riparian corridors can serve as biodiversity reservoirs in urban environments. Despite the many opportunities that riparian corridors present for biodiversity conservation within urban environments, they may present conservation challenges by providing a thriving hub for local and alien invasive plants. The aim of the study was to map and characterise the occurrence of local and alien invasive plants along the natural green riparian corridors in Lusaka district of Zambia. A combination of field surveys and remote sensing approaches using Sentinel-2 imagery were employed to conduct the vegetation mapping and characterise the invasive plant proliferation. Five local and nine alien invasive plant species were identified within the natural green riparian corridors at 23 field survey sites. A total of 108 plant species were recorded in the study area out of which 57 were grasses of the Poacea family, five were local invasive and nine were alien invasive plant species. Six of the invasive plant species were mapped using Sentinel-2 data. The study showed that 47.35% of areal extent of the natural green riparian corridors in Lusaka had invasive and alien plant presence. Invasive and alien plant richness was determined to affect non-invasive plant richness and diversity. There was no linear association between poverty and percentage cover of invasive plant species but percentage cover of invasive plants seemed to be concentrated around wards with a poverty headcount around 0.15. The outcomes of this research are relevant for the management of invasive species within natural green corridors in urban areas.

TI  - A comparison of chlorophyll a values obtained from an autonomous underwater vehicle to satellite-based measures for Lake Michigan
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate methods to track changes in lake productivity through time and space are critical to fisheries management. Chlorophyll a is the most widely studied proxy for ecosystem primary production and has been the topic of many studies. The main sources of chlorophyll a measurements are ship-based measures or multi-spectral satellite data. Autonomous underwater vehicles can survey large spatial extents approaching the scale of satellite data, but with the accuracy of ship-based water sampling methods. We use several statistical measures to compare measures of chlorophyll a collected in Lake Michigan with spatiotemporally matched satellite-derived measures of chlorophyll a from the MODIS Aqua multi-spectral sensor using NASA's OC3 and the Great Lakes Fit algorithms. Our findings show a near one to one relationship between AUV data and both satellite-derived data sets when the AUV data are coarsened to the resolution of the satellite data. A comparison of satellite-based chlorophyll a to AUV-derived chlorophyll summarized in discrete water depth bins suggested that, based on decreasing coefficients of determination, satellite estimates of chlorophyll accounted for the most variability in chlorophyll a concentrations in the upper 10 m of the water column, even though satellite sensors may detect past this depth.

TI  - Radon-Augmented Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery to Derive Wave-Patterns and Regional Bathymetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatological changes occur globally but have local impacts. Increased storminess, sea level rise and more powerful waves are expected to batter the coastal zone more often and more intense. To understand climate change impacts, regional bathymetry information is paramount. A major issue is that the bathymetries are often non-existent or if they do exist, outdated. This sparsity can be overcome by space-borne satellite techniques to derive bathymetry. Sentinel-2 optical imagery is collected continuously and has a revisit-time around a few days depending on the orbital-position around the world. In this work, Sentinel-2 imagery derived wave patterns are extracted using a localized radon transform. A discrete fast-Fourier (DFT) procedure per direction in Radon space (sinogram) is then applied to derive wave spectra. Sentinel-2 time-lag between detector bands is employed to compute the spectral wave-phase shift and depth using the gravity wave linear dispersion. With this novel technique, regional bathymetries are derived at the test-site of Capbreton, France with an root mean squared (RMS)-error of 2.58 m and a correlation coefficient of 0.82 when compared to the survey for depths until 30 m. With the proposed method, the 10 m Sentinel-2 resolution is sufficient to adequately estimate bathymetries for a wave period of 6.5 s or greater. For shorter periods, the pixel resolution does not allow to detect a stable celerity. In addition to the wave-signature enhancement, the capability of the Radon Transform to augment Sentinel-2 20 m resolution imagery to 10 m is demonstrated, increasing the number of suitable bands for the depth inversion.

TI  - Isolated Tumor Cells in Sentinel Lymph Nodes of Primary Invasive Breast Carcinoma: A Cohort Analysis
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The finding of isolated tumor cells (ITCs) in lymph nodes from resected early stage breast cancer has been found to have limited prognostic relevance. We examined 2 different strategies for ITC detection among cohorts of 250 patients over 2 different time intervals (2010-2011 and 2015-2016). There were significantly fewer cases of ITC observed over the latter time period during which selective, as opposed to reflex cytokeratin staining, was used (P < .02). This observation resulted in cost savings to the pathology laboratory and did not affect adjuvant treatment decision-making.Background: The practice of performing routine cytokeratin immunohistochemistry (CK-IHC) on sentinel lymph nodes in early stage invasive breast cancer leads to frequent identification of isolated tumor cells (ITCs), the clinical significance of which remains unclear. After emergence of guidelines that suggested limited clinical utility of ITC detection, routine CK-IHC (rCK-IHC) staining was discontinued at our institution. We studied the rate and clinical utility of ITC detection before and after the discontinuation of rCK-IHC. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 2 cohorts of 250 consecutive early stage invasive breast cancer (IBC) patients with sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNBs) in 2010 to 2011 (rCK-IHC) and 2015 to 2016 (selective CK-IHC (sCK-IHC)). Variables abstracted included: tumor histology, tumor size, grade, lymphatic-vascular invasion, hormone receptor expression, HER2 status, and nodal status including ITCs. All cases from the 2015 to 2016 cohort for which sCK-IHC was performed underwent pathology review. A clinical review of treatment decision effect and cost analysis was undertaken. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Fisher exact test. Results: In the rCK-IHC cohort, all 250 cases underwent CK-IHC staining versus 57 cases in the sCK-IHC cohort. There were 23 ITC cases observed in the rCK-IHC cohort compared with 11 in the sCK-IHC cohort (P = .049). Excluding lobular carcinomas, 19 ITC cases were observed with rCK-IHC versus 7 with sCK-IHC (P = .02). ITC detection did not affect adjuvant treatment decision-making and resulted in savings of at least Can$8000. Conclusion: Selective rather than routine use of CK-IHC staining for SLNB evaluation in early-stage IBC results in decreased ITC detection without affecting treatment decisions and leads to cost savings.

TI  - LandMOD ET mapper: A new matlab-based graphical user interface (GUI) for automated implementation of SEBAL and METRIC models in thermal imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing based surface energy balance (SEB) models, such as SEB Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Mapping evapotranspiration (ET) at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) are widely used to monitor ET. However, their operational use is challenged by model complexity and the tedious process of selecting hot and cold pixels. We developed a new Matlab-based ET mapping toolbox named "LandMOD ET Mapper" for automated implementation of these models to facilitate their widespread applications among new users. The toolbox is demonstrated using one Landsat and one Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra image covering three AmeriFlux sites in Nebraska, U.S. Daily ET estimates were comparable with the observed ET for five days when near cloud-free Landsat and MODIS Terra images were available in the 2006 maize growing season. The toolbox provides a viable ET mapping option to new and inexperienced users with reduced time and labor demands.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating regional evapotranspiration (ET) is challenging in data-limited regions where a lack of in situ observations constrain model calibration and implementation. Here we developed an ensemble mean surface energy balance (EnSEB) modeling framework that is independent of any ground calibration and applied it in India to understand the magnitude and variability of ET in this agriculturally important region. EnSEB uses daily land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation biophysical inputs from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and climatic information from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Modem-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (Merra-2) products and runs seven surface energy balance (SEB) algorithms to estimate ensemble mean ET or latent heat (LE) fluxes at a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km. Due to limited access to observed flux data, we conducted three different types of model evaluation: i) instantaneous LE validation using observed SEB fluxes from Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) measurements in four agroecosystems, ii) annual and seasonal ET comparison with six global products at the regional scale, and iii) by closing the basin-scale monthly water budget (WB) for five large river basins (87,900-312,812 km(2)) in India. Validation with the BREB measurements revealed hourly EnSEB LE estimates to be within 2% of the observed LE (R-2 = 0.57 and RMSE = 59 W m(-2)) and EnSEB was more accurate than any of the individual SEB models. Annual ET from EnSEB was positively correlated with six widely-used global ET products (r = 0.52-0.83, p-value < 0.001), but EnSEB captured the magnitude of ET in intensively irrigated regions much better. Basin-scale monthly WB miscloures were found to be between -1 and 9 mm month(-1) from EnSEB ET estimates, which were better than those from the six global ET products. The gap filling method based on the constant ETrF (ET/reference ET) approach introduced some uncertainties in EnSEB, which presents room for future improvements. Overall, our results suggest that the automated and calibration free multi-model EnSEB framework, which uses only remote sensing and readily available reanalysis data, has the ability to estimate ET with reliable accuracy in Indian agroecosystems. Such a framework could help us better understand and monitor the water cycle in regions where ground data are limited or non-existent.

AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) changes are continuous phenomena, often driven by natural and anthropogenic factors. In Ethiopia, a conversion of forest and grass lands into cultivated and urbanized lands has been reported. While such changes are known to have multidirectional impacts on river flows, erosion and sedimentation, and the socio-economic situation within a catchment, there is a lack of assessment on the scale and rate of these changes, and consequent impacts. This study quantifies the rate of LULC in the Gumara catchment (1413 km(2)), an important tributary to Lake Tana in northwest Ethiopia. Landsat images of three years (1986, 2001 and 2015) were processed using the supervised classification method. An extensive field survey generated over 150 ground truth points, which were used in the classification and accuracy assessment process. Then, a conceptual rainfall-runoff model (HBV) was calibrated and validated to assess the impacts of LULC changes on water balance components - evapotranspiration, soil moisture, groundwater recharge and runoff. Additionally, the decadal means and trends of precipitation and discharge were analysed to further examine and quantify the observed changes (if any).A reasonably reliable LULC classification was achieved, with an overall accuracy of 90%. The results indicated that the catchment area under forest and grass land was about 11 and 18%, respectively, in 1986, which reduced to 5 and 10%, respectively, in 2015. In contrast, cultivated land increased from 70% in 1986 to 82% in 2015. Contrary to the expected impact of these LULC changes on hydrology, the HBV model, indicated only a slight change in the water balance components (+/- 5%). Runoff and all other water balance components remained more or less stable despite considerable LULC changes. However, the uncertainties encountered in the modelling process (e.g. model structure, LULC representation) could have masked the LULC impacts on hydrology. This was supported by the significant increase in the observed discharge indicated by the statistical analysis, even in view of no substantial changes in precipitation. Therefore, LULC could cause considerable increase in discharge, which needs further testing (e.g. through physically based modelling with detailed inclusion of LULC processes).

TI  - Progress towards lymphatic filariasis elimination in Ghana from 2000-2016: Analysis of microfilaria prevalence data from 430 communities
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundGhana started its national programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) in 2000, with mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin and albendazole as main strategy. We review the progress towards elimination that was made by 2016 for all endemic districts of Ghana and analyze microfilaria (mf) prevalence from sentinel and spot-check sites in endemic districts.MethodsWe reviewed district level data on the history of MDA and outcomes of transmission assessment surveys (TAS). We further collated and analyzed mf prevalence data from sentinel and spot-check sites.ResultsMDA was initiated in 2001-2006 in all 98 endemic districts; by the end of 2016, 81 had stopped MDA after passing TAS and after an average of 11 rounds of treatment (range 8-14 rounds). The median reported coverage for the communities was 77-80%. Mf prevalence survey data were available for 430 communities from 78/98 endemic districts. Baseline mf prevalence data were available for 53 communities, with an average mf prevalence of 8.7% (0-45.7%). Repeated measurements were available for 78 communities, showing a steep decrease in mean mf prevalence in the first few years of MDA, followed by a gradual further decline. In the 2013 and 2014 surveys, 7 and 10 communities respectively were identified with mf prevalence still above 1% (maximum 5.6%). Fifteen of the communities above threshold are all within districts where MDA was still ongoing by 2016.ConclusionsThe MDA programme of the Ghana Health Services has reduced mf prevalence in sentinel sites below the 1% threshold in 81/98 endemic districts in Ghana, yet 15 communities within 13 districts (MDA ongoing by 2016) had higher prevalence than this threshold during the surveys in 2013 and 2014. These districts may need to intensify interventions to achieve the WHO 2020 target.

TI  - Collection and transport of sentinel mussels in biomarker-based coastal pollution monitoring: Current flaws and reliable practices
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomarkers use to be recorded in sentinel mussels for biological effects assessment in coastal pollution monitoring. There are recommended procedures (e.g., by ICES) for biomarker determination but not for sample collection and transport. However, where and when mussels are collected and how samples are processed can be a major source of variability in biomarker values. Thus, the present study aims at contributing to identify reliable practices for collection and transport of intertidal mussels in biomarker-based coastal pollution monitoring. Mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, were handpicked from the high (2.5-3.0 m) and low (0.5-1.0 m) tide-mark levels at autumn tides in Gorliz, a relatively clean locality of the Basque Coast (Bay of Biscay). Then, they were processed by different ways: (a) in situ dissected immediately after sampling; (b) transported to the laboratory either in air or in seawater; and (c) dissected at different time intervals after sampling. Oxidative stress, lysosomal and tissue-level biomarkers were investigated. Oxidative stress and lysosomal biomarkers were significantly affected by collection and transport to the laboratory, due to the combination of air exposure (hypoxia) and digestion process. Consequently, it is recommended that sentinel mussels should be collected the nearest possible to the 0 tide-mark level and processed in situ as soon as possible, and always within 1 h upon collection. If in situ processing is not possible, mussels should be transported in air and processed within the shortest time possible. Finally, details on sampling should be always provided to made possible the proper interpretation and comparison of results.

TI  - Large dyke intrusion and small eruption: The December 24, 2018 Mt. Etna eruption imaged by Sentinel-1 data
T2  - TERRA NOVA
M3  - Article
AB  - On December 24th, Mt. Etna volcano underwent a seismic crisis beneath the summit and upper southern flank of the volcano, accompanied by significant ash emission. Eruptive fissures opened at the base of summit craters, propagating SE-wards. This lateral eruption lasted until December 27th. Despite the small eruption, seismic swarm and ground deformation were very strong. Sentinel-1 interferograms show a wide and intense ground deformation with some additional features related to volcano-tectonic structures. We inverted DInSAR data to characterise the magma intrusion. The resulting model indicates that a large dyke intruded but aborted its upraise at about the sea level; however, this big intrusion stretched the edifice, promoting the opening of the eruptive fissures fed by a shallower small dyke, and activating also several faults. This model highlights that a big intrusion beneath a structurally complex volcano represents a main issue even if the eruption is aborted.

AB  - Philosophy is the contribution to questioning the absolute of ideologies. Such ways of seeing and interpreting, the world, the world of things, the Lebenswelt, does not require convergence of reports; on the other hand, interpreting, understanding and explaining are fundamental aspects to Western rationality. Today requires ideological abstractions to give way to scientific objectivity, while subjectivity of values contributing to the development of society is placed in another plane. Reflecting on interpretive diversity is questioning the univocity of ideologies that constantly want to subdue the freedom of the human subject.

TI  - Global data and tools for local forest cover loss and REDD plus performance assessment: Accuracy, uncertainty, complementarity and impact
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the performance of efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD +) requires data on forest cover change. Innovations in remote sensing and forest monitoring provide ever-increasing levels of coverage, spatial and temporal detail, and accuracy. More global products and advanced open-source algorithms are becoming available. Still, these datasets and tools are not always consistent or complementary, and their suitability for local REDD + performance assessments remains unclear. These assessments should, ideally, be free of any confounding factors, but performance estimates are affected by data uncertainties in unknown ways. Here, we analyse (1) differences in accuracy between datasets of forest cover change; (2) if and how combinations of datasets can increase accuracy; and we demonstrate (3) the effect of (not) doing accuracy assessments for REDD + performance measurements.Our study covers five local REDD + initiatives in four countries across the tropics. We compared accuracies of a readily available global forest cover change dataset and a locally modifiable open-source break detection algorithm. We applied human interpretation validation tools using Landsat Time Series data and high-resolution optical imagery. Next, we assessed whether and how combining different datasets can increase accuracies using several combination strategies. Finally, we demonstrated the consequences of using the input datasets for REDD + performance assessments with and without considering their accuracies and uncertainties.Estimating the amount of deforestation using validation samples could substantially reduce uncertainty in REDD + performance assessments. We found that the accuracies of the various data sources differ at site level, although on average neither one of the input products consistently excelled in accuracy. Using a combination of both products as stratification for area estimation and validated with a sample of high-resolution data seems promising. In these combined products, the expected trade-offs in accuracies across change classes (before, after, no change) and across accuracy types (user's and producer's accuracy) were negligible, so their use is advantageous over single-source datasets. More locally calibrated wall-to-wall products should be developed to make them more useful and applicable for REDD + purposes. The direction and degree of REDD+ performance remained statistically uncertain, as CIs were overlapping in most cases for the deforestation estimates before and after the start of the REDD + interventions. Given these uncertainties and inaccuracies and to increase the credibility of REDD+ it is advised to (1) be conservative in REDD+ accounting, and (2) not to rely on results from single currently available global data sources or tools without sample-based validation if results-based payments are intended to be made on this basis.

TI  - Spectral modeling and spectral impacts on the performance of mc-Si and new generation CdTe photovoltaics in warm and sunny climates
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an analysis of spectral impacts on me-Si and new generation CdTe in two distinct regions of Brazil: Florianopolis-SC (27 degrees S, 48 degrees W) in the South, and Assu-RN (5 degrees S, 37 degrees W) in the Northeast. As utility-scale PV power plants are progressively being deployed in the Brazilian Northeast, the need for evaluation of the spectral effects of local blue-biased spectra on the energy yield of different PV technologies arises, as well as the need for spectral correction of field peak-power measurements done during commissioning and system performance tests. Considering the high cost of adequate spectral measurement equipment, this paper proposes a new approach for the estimation of spectral impacts without the need for in loco measurements. The proposed methodology consists of the use of satellite data acquired from NASA's Giovanni platform as inputs for the SMARTS 2.9.5 spectra model. Results for measured spectra showed that, for both locations, new generation CdTe (i.e. First Solar Series 4 and 6) has significant spectral gains: up to 10% for Assu-RN (Northeastern Brazil) and 2% for Florianopolis-SC (Southern Brazil). A seasonal variation could also be detected for the Florianopolis site, with lower spectral gains for CdTe - and higher for mc-Si - close to the Southern Hemisphere's winter solstice, due to higher air mass values and lower precipitable water content of the atmosphere. The proposed method using Giovanni data and SMARTS spectra modeling produced very similar spectra to those measured for clear days in the field at both sites, yielding good results for the calculation of spectral factors for both mc-Si and CdTe. For days with a higher diffuse fraction the results were not as satisfactory, as expected. The proposed method was also applied to instantaneous measurements for three different times (and AM values) of the day for Florianopolis: 9:00, 12:00 and 15:00, yielding satisfactory results for IV curve spectral correction.

TI  - Modeling Mid-Season Rice Nitrogen Uptake Using Multispectral Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mid-season nitrogen (N) application in rice crops can maximize yield and profitability. This requires accurate and efficient methods of determining rice N uptake in order to prescribe optimal N amounts for topdressing. This study aims to determine the accuracy of using remotely sensed multispectral data from satellites to predict N uptake of rice at the panicle initiation (PI) growth stage, with a view to providing optimum variable-rate N topdressing prescriptions without needing physical sampling. Field experiments over 4 years, 4-6 N rates, 4 varieties and 2 sites were conducted, with at least 3 replicates of each plot. One WorldView satellite image for each year was acquired, close to the date of PI. Numerous single- and multi-variable models were investigated. Among single-variable models, the square of the NDRE vegetation index was shown to be a good predictor of N uptake (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 22.8 kg/ha for data pooled from all years and experiments). For multi-variable models, Lasso regularization was used to ensure an interpretable and compact model was chosen and to avoid over fitting. Combinations of remotely sensed reflectances and spectral indexes as well as variety, climate and management data as input variables for model training achieved R2< 0.9 and RMSE < 15 kg/ha for the pooled data set. The ability of remotely sensed data to predict N uptake in new seasons where no physical sample data has yet been obtained was tested. A methodology to extract models that generalize well to new seasons was developed, avoiding model overfitting. Lasso regularization selected four or less input variables, and yielded R2 of better than 0.67 and RMSE better than 27.4 kg/ha over four test seasons that weren't used to train the models.

TI  - Estimating Forest Leaf Area Index and Canopy Chlorophyll Content with Sentinel-2: An Evaluation of Two Hybrid Retrieval Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of biophysical and biochemical variables such as leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) are a fundamental requirement for effectively monitoring and managing forest environments. With its red-edge bands and high spatial resolution, the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on board the Sentinel-2 missions is particularly well-suited to LAI and CCC retrieval. Using field data collected throughout the growing season at a deciduous broadleaf forest site in Southern England, we evaluated the performance of two hybrid retrieval algorithms for estimating LAI and CCC from MSI data: the Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL)-based L2B retrieval algorithm made available to users in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP), and an alternative retrieval algorithm optimised for forest environments, trained using the Invertible Forest Reflectance Model (INFORM). Moderate performance was associated with the SNAP L2B retrieval algorithm for both LAI (r(2) = 0.54, RMSE = 1.55, NRMSE = 43%) and CCC (r(2) = 0.52, RMSE = 0.79 g m(-2), NRMSE = 45%), while improvements were obtained using the INFORM-based retrieval algorithm, particularly in the case of LAI (r(2) = 0.79, RMSE = 0.47, NRMSE = 13%), but also in the case of CCC (r(2) = 0.69, RMSE = 0.52 g m(-2), NRMSE = 29%). Forward modelling experiments confirmed INFORM was better able to reproduce observed MSI spectra than SAIL. Based on our results, for forest-related applications using MSI data, we recommend users seek retrieval algorithms optimised for forest environments.

TI  - Tatyana Tolstaya, a Blogger: Ways of Self-Presentation
T2  - TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZDANIE-TEXT BOOK PUBLISHING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tatyana Tolstaya is a writer who understands the rules of the times she lives in. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the epoch of literature centrism has been replaced by the epoch of visualization, the traditional paper version of literature becomes network-based, more free in writing and expansion. This tendency is not to shy away from diaries - they become the basis of the blogosphere.Blogger is the inherent creative role of Tatyana Tolstaya in the 2010s. Her blog appeared in 2007 on the LiveJournal platform and then was transferred to Facebook. Initially, it was a way of self-presentation, but in the course of time it became the basis for a new creative strategy development - a shift from the third to the first person in her prose.Blog on the LiveJournal platform was initially created for answering questions related to the show "The School for Scandal". Themes of blog posts widen gradually - recipes, previews, everyday sketches, dreams, stories about the family and the past appear. In its few years of existing, texts of all genres (including everyday sketches) acquire a strongly pronounced artistic discourse The theme of "imperceptible worlds" first appeared in the blog; later it became one of the main themes of Tolstaya's new prose. "Imperceptible worlds" is an unreal space closely connected with the real world; in this space, meetings with the dead loved ones are possible, and animated things have their own fate.In 2014-5, Tatyana Tolstaya published a tetralogy in a traditional paper version. It had 4 books: Aestherial Worlds (2014), The Girl in Bloom (2015), The Invisible Maiden (2015), Felt Age (2015). The tetralogy was composed of Tolsataya's early prose, publicistic texts and autobiographical texts from her two blogs. For Tolstaya, her blogs become closely connected with offline art - they fulfill functions of a writer's traditional paper diary.After publishing the tetralogy, Tolstaya entirely switches to Facebook. The genres and stylistics of her posts remain the same at first, but the writer gradually changes the style of her blogging. Tolstaya's Facebook is more edgy than LiveJournal, the writer speaks simply, in a rough style. The posts' themes are concrete, frequently invective; usually there is no turning away from the everyday to the existential. On Facebook, Tolstaya also has a dialogue with users, and her answers are often quite rude and sarcastic.From 2016 to 2017, Tolstaya also has a blog as part of the project Insider.Moscow (it is a restaurant guide that publishes objective reviews of eating places in Moscow). The project encourages a free style of writing, and Tolstaya makes an extensive use of it.Formulating her own worldview in the blog posts, Tolstaya creates the new poetics of her prose. After performing its function, the blog loses its focus on artistic discourse and becomes an instrument of communication. An autobiographical character is substituted by the writer Tatyana Tolstaya, who speaks her mind and shares her perception of contemporary life with users.

TI  - Spectral Albedo Estimation of Snow Covers in Pakistan Using Landsat Data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate snow spectral albedo measurements from satellite data can essentially help to determine the changes over the snow surface area. In the current study, spectral snow albedo is measured over the northern region of Pakistan using spatio-temporal imagery datasets taken by Landsat satellite series equipped with TM and ETM+ sensors. An Automatic Cloud Cover Assessment (ACCA) algorithm is used to mask cloudy pixels from further processing. Furthermore, an image independent model, Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) is used in the current research work to atmospherically correct the satellite data. The snow cover albedo of northern Pakistan is estimated using pixel values prior to correction, ACCA output values, and 6S model output values. The results of the study show that highest albedo values are estimated using Landsat band 4 data with albedo model. The results of the study also show that the albedo values measured (band 4) in the year 1992 (0.989) are reduced in the year 2000 (0.931). It is expected that the results of the study could be utilized to predict climatic variations for spring runoff estimation.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal consistency of the fAPAR GEOV2 full time series (constituted by data derived from SPOT-VGT1/2 and PROBA-V) is analyzed against the single-sensor MODIS dataset, with a particular focus on the most recent fAPAR anomalies (z-scores) produced from PROBA-V in the period 2014-2017. The intercomparison highlights a systematic overestimation of GEOV2 fAPAR z-scores when compared to MODIS fAPAR, likely related to the observed positive bias (over 90% of the domain) in the PROBA-V vs. SPOT-VGT1/2 relationship. A simple two-step harmonization procedure has been proposed to remove this discrepancy, based on two separate linear corrections of SPOT-VGT1/2 (2001-2013) and PROBA-V (2014-2017) data with respect to MODIS, followed by a time lag correction. The harmonized GEOV2 time series preserves the overall dynamic of fAPAR, while removing the sensor bias and improving the consistency with MODIS data. The fAPAR anomalies from the harmonized GEOV2 time series provide unbiased estimates of z-scores that are overall well correlated (R = 0.55 +/- 0.25) with the MODIS fAPAR anomalies.

TI  - Interannual lake fluctuations in the Argentine Puna: relationships with its associated peatlands and climate change
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - High elevation ecosystems are likely more sensitive to climate change. But, due to paucity of instrumental records, such effects are poorly studied, particularly in mountains outside Europe and North America. Here, we quantified water body area fluctuations for the last 32years in 15 lakes spread over an area of 14.3 million ha in the Argentine Puna, through the classification of Landsat images; and we quantified peatlands NDVI (a proxy of vegetation productivity) from MODIS images. We evaluated the pairwise similarity between lakes interannual fluctuations and their relationship with climate models (TRMM 3B43 v7; CRU TS 4.10) and potential controls (ENSO index); and the correlations between water body area and the NDVI variation of its associated peatlands. Lakes were grouped in two clusters defined by their synchronic water body area variability and these clusters define two main geographic zones: NE and SW. Consistent with previous observations of an overall aridization trend, water body area generally decreased but showed large variability among lakes. Peatlands productivity was more correlated with lake variability than with modeled precipitation, and lake water body area was weakly related to indices of ENSO, providing an additional tool to relate local climate with continental and global climate models. The analysis shows that lake behavior is highly variable spatially and temporally, and that satellite-based monitoring is a valuable tool for assessing ecological conditions of wetlands in the region, characterized by the lack of climatic instrumental records; and to explore the vulnerability of wetlands to climate change.

TI  - Impact of confinement and food access restriction on the three-spined stickleback (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>, L.) during caging: a multi-biomarker approach
T2  - FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Caging is an active biomonitoring strategy that employs a sentinel species, sometimes a species naturally absent from the studied site, in the surveillance of water bodies to verify whether biota may be at risk. The main advantage of caging is the possibility to standardize several biotic and abiotic parameters. However, little knowledge is available about the effects of confinement on physiology and metabolism of caged organisms. The aim of this study is to characterize confinement and food access restriction effects, induced via caging experiments using a multi-biomarker approach (biometric data, immunity, antioxidant, metabolic detoxication, and digestive enzymes). The study has been undertaken using the same experiment conducted in ecosystem conditions using three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) during two different periods: one in April, corresponding to breeding season, and the other in October, outside breeding season. Fifteen fish were maintained for 21 days in different conditions (caged or uncaged and with or without food supply). The main result was that confinement stress had little impact on the biological markers of sticklebacks. However, the stressors seemed to increase the negative effects of food restriction on these biomarkers, when sticklebacks needed more energy, that is, during their breeding period. Outside breeding period, most investigated biomarkers were not impacted by caging. This study showed a way to specify the conditions of application and interpretation of biomarkers during active monitoring to ensure an effective, reliable diagnosis of water body quality.

TI  - Risk of acute respiratory infection from crop burning in India: estimating disease burden and economic welfare from satellite and national health survey data for 250 000 persons
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Respiratory infections are among the leading causes of death and disability globally. Respirable aerosol particles released by agricultural crop-residue burning (ACRB), practised by farmers in all global regions, are potentially harmful to human health. Our objective was to estimate the health and economic costs of ACRB in northern India.Methods The primary outcome was acute respiratory infection (ARI) from India's fourth District Level Health Survey (DLHS-4). DLHS-4 data were merged with Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data on fire occurrence. Mutually adjusted generalized linear models were used to generate risk ratios for risk factors of ARI. Overall disease burden due to ACRB was estimated in terms of disability-adjusted life years.Results Seeking medical treatment for ARI in the previous 2weeks was reported by 5050 (2%) of 252539 persons. Living in a district with intense ACRB-the top quintile of fires per day-was associated with a 3-fold higher risk of ARI (mutually adjusted risk ratio 2.99, 95% confidence interval 2.77 to 3.23) after adjustment for socio-demographic and household factors. Children under 5years of age were particularly susceptible (3.65, 3.06 to 4.34 in this subgroup). Additional ARI risk factors included motor-vehicle congestion (1.96, 1.72 to 2.23), open drainage (1.91, 1.73 to 2.11), cooking with biomass (1.73, 1.58 to 1.90) and living in urban areas (1.35, 1.26 to 1.44). Eliminating ACRB would avert 14.9million disability-adjusted life years lost per year, valued at US$152.9billion over 5years.Conclusions Investments to stop crop burning and offer farmers alternative crop-residue disposal solutions are likely to improve population-level respiratory health and yield major economic returns.

T2  - CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, breast cancer has overtaken cervical cancer to become the most common cancer among women in India, as in most Western nations. In addition to the high incidence, the morbidity and mortality associated with this malignancy are disproportionately higher in India. Although some efforts are being made to increase awareness about this disease, a large majority of Indian patients present with advanced disease. Here, important institutional data and treatment outcomes are reviewed and compared with data from the West. Additionally, we highlight recent efforts in setting up collaborative multicentre trials in breast cancer in India and suggest some ways forward to improve outcomes.

TI  - Regional Economic Activity Derived From MODIS Data: A Comparison With DMSP/OLS and NPP/VIIRS Nighttime Light Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) and Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP/VIIRS) nighttime light data are the two most commonly used indicators of gross domestic product (GDP) estimation. Few studies explore the potential of daytime satellite data for estimating GDP. This study demonstrates a linear support vector machine (Linear-SVM) model to estimate GDP over Hubei province and Guangdong province, China, in 2013 from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Also, a comparison of MODIS data with DMSP/OLS and NPP/VIIRS nighttime light data was conducted. Results show that the Linear-SVM model (Hubei: R-2 = 0.66, 0.71, 0.92; Guangdong: R-2 = 0.37, 0.32, 0.67) has better model performance than simple linear regression (R-2 = 0.54, 0.59, 0.86; R-2 = 0.23, 0.23, 0.63) based on DMSP/OLS nighttime lights, DMSP/OLS corrected nighttime lights, and NPP/VIIRS nighttime lights, respectively, while MODIS data has model performance of R-2 = 0.77 (Hubei) and R-2 = 0.55 (Guangdong) based on the Linear-SVM model, further indicating that MODIS data improves the accuracy of GDP estimation compared to DMSP/OLS nighttime lights. In addition, MODIS data produced finer GDP estimation than DMSP/OLS nighttime lights, especially in dark and light saturated areas. Although MODIS data is not as accurate as the NPP/VIIRS nighttime lights for estimating GDP, the proposed method could be applicable to other daytime satellite data and has broad prospects for improving the spatial and temporal resolution of regional economic activity and improving estimation accuracy.

TI  - A Secchi Depth Algorithm Considering the Residual Error in Satellite Remote Sensing Reflectance Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A scheme to semi-analytically derive waters' Secchi depth (Z(sd)) from remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) considering the effects of the residual errors in satellite R-rs was developed for the China Eastern Coastal Zone (CECZ). This approach was evaluated and compared against three existing algorithms using field measurements. As it was challenging to provide the accurately inherent optical properties data for running the three existing algorithms in the extremely turbid waters, the new developed algorithm worked more effective than the latter. Moreover, with both synthetic and match-up data, the results indicated that the proposed algorithm was able to minimize some residual errors in R-rs, and thus could generate inter-mission consistent Z(sd) results from two ocean color missions. Finally, after application of new model to satellite images, we presented the spatial and temporal variations of Secchi depth and trophic state in the CECZ during 2002-2014. The study led to several findings: Firstly, the Z(sd)-based trophic state index (TSI) in the East China Sea first increased since 2002, and then gradually dropped during 2008-2014. Secondly, more and more waters within 30-35 m and 20-25 m isobaths were deteriorating from oligotrophic to mesotrophic type and from mesotrophic to eutrophic water, respectively, during 2002-2014. Lastly, the TSI increased on average 0.091 and 0.286 m per year respectively in Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea since 2002, and it might only take 14 and 67 years for Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea to deteriorate from mesotrophic to eutrophic water, following their current yearly deterioration rate and trophic trend. These results highlighted the importance to make some strict regulations for protecting the aquatic environment in the CECZ.

TI  - Water Requirement for Irrigation of Complicated Agricultural Land by Using Classified Airborne Digital Sensor Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use of irrigated areas nearby the metropolitan is complex. On fields, crop growth may differ with variations in the water demand. Among the image classification methods, combined object-oriented classification is currently preferred over conventional pixel-based classification. Compared with the traditional pixel-based method, which generally exhibits a spot-like salt-and-pepper effect, object-based classification can significantly reduce the salt-and-pepper effect and amount of data required for analysis. To obtain improved spectral recognition, maximum image information is described using color, texture, and shape to enhance image recognition. In this study, image information extraction and crop interpretation were performed using the airborne digital sensor ADS40 to obtain experimental data, and the traditional supervised image and image object classification methods were compared. The results indicate that both the image classification methods could yield an overall accuracy of more than 80%, and the accuracy of object-based classification (88.68%) was higher than that of the other classification. The daily water requirement of crops in the study area, calculated using a high-precision image object classification method, was approximately 2585 m(3). The current results may aid in the effective estimation of agricultural irrigation water consumption.

TI  - A short follow-up of prosthesis-based breast reconstruction using TiLOOP<SUP>®</SUP> Bra surgical mesh
T2  - NIGERIAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A new approach for prosthesis-based breast reconstruction is the use of a titanium-coated polypropylene mesh TiLOOP (R) Bra. However, the safety and outcomes are currently unclear in Chinese breast cancer patients. Methods: A retrospective study of patients undergoing prosthesis-based breast reconstruction using TiLOOP (R) Bra was carried out. Complications were divided into minor complications (require conservative treatment) and major complications (require surgical intervention). The influence of patient- and surgery-related characteristics on complications was analyzed. Results: Postoperative hematoma and seroma were respectively found in one and two breasts and could be treated conservatively. In three breasts skin infection occurred immediately after surgery resulting in skin necrosis of two breasts and wound dehiscence of one breast. These three breasts were treated with mesh removal, and revisionary surgery. Increased risk of mesh removal and implant explantation were observed in case of skin infection (P = 0.011) and skin necrosis (P = 0.033). Neither patient-related characteristics including age 50 years, BMI 25 kg/m(2), and postoperative radiotherapy/chemotherapy, nor surgery-related characteristics including sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary dissection alone, and curative/prophylactic surgery were significantly correlated with minor and major complications. Ultrasound evaluation showed a well-incorporated mesh into surrounding tissue. Conclusion: This titanium-coated polypropylene mesh showed acceptable complications and could be used safely in prosthesis-based breast reconstruction by stabilizing the implant pocket. Longer follow-up data and more randomized trials are necessary to determine the clinical use of this mesh.

TI  - Contrasting Performance of the Remotely-Derived GPP Products over Different Climate Zones across China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise quantification of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) has been recognized as one of the most important components in understanding the carbon balance between the biosphere and the atmosphere. In recent years, although many large-scale GPP estimates from satellite data and ecosystem models have been generated, few attempts have been made to compare the different GPP products at national scales, particularly for various climate zones. In this study, two of the most widely-used GPP datasets were systematically compared over the eight climate zones across China's terrestrial ecosystems from 2001 to 2015, which included the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP and the breathing Earth system simulator (BESS) GPP products. Additionally, the coarse (0.05(o)) GPP estimates from the vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM) at the same time scale were used for auxiliary analysis with the two products. Both MODIS and BESS products exhibited a decreasing trend from the southeast region to the northwest inland. The largest GPP was found in the tropical humid region with 5.49 g C m(-2) d(-1) and 5.07 g C m(-2) d(-1) for MODIS and BESS, respectively, while the lowest GPP was distributed in the warm temperate arid region, midtemperate semiarid region and plateau zone. Meanwhile, the work confirmed that all these GPP products showed apparent seasonality with the peaks in the summertime. However, large differences were found in the interannual variations across the three GPP products over different climate regions. Generally, the BESS GPP agreed better than the MODIS GPP when compared to the seasonal and interannual variations of VPM GPP. Furthermore, the spatial correlation analysis between terrestrial GPP and the climatic factors, including temperature and precipitation, indicated that natural rainfall dominated the variability in GPP of Northern China, such as the midtemperate semiarid region, while temperature was a key controlling factor in the Southern China and the Tibet Plateau area.

TI  - Improved Remotely Sensed Total Basin Discharge and Its Seasonal Error Characterization in the Yangtze River Basin
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Total basin discharge is a critical component for the understanding of surface water exchange at the land-ocean interface. A continuous decline in the number of global hydrological stations over the past fifteen years has promoted the estimation of total basin discharge using remote sensing. Previous remotely sensed total basin discharge of the Yangtze River basin, expressed in terms of runoff, was estimated via the water balance equation, using a combination of remote sensing and modeled data products of various qualities. Nevertheless, the modeled data products are presented with large uncertainties and the seasonal error characteristics of the remotely sensed total basin discharge have rarely been investigated. In this study, we conducted total basin discharge estimation of the Yangtze River Basin, based purely on remotely sensed data. This estimation considered the period between January 2003 and December 2012 at a monthly temporal scale and was based on precipitation data collected from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, evapotranspiration data collected from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite, and terrestrial water storage data collected from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite. A seasonal accuracy assessment was performed to detect poor performances and highlight any deficiencies in the modeled data products derived from the discharge estimation. Comparison of our estimated runoff results based purely on remotely sensed data, and the most accurate results of a previous study against the observed runoff revealed a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.89 and 0.74, and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 11.69 mm/month and 14.30 mm/month, respectively. We identified some deficiencies in capturing the maximum and the minimum of runoff rates during both summer and winter, due to an underestimation and overestimation of evapotranspiration, respectively.

TI  - Prediction of axillary pathologic response with breast pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeMany breast cancer patients receive sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). We evaluated the axillary pathologic complete response (pCR) in relation to achievement of breast pCR.MethodsWe evaluated 1044 patients who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and were treated with NAC followed by curative surgery at the Samsung Medical Center between January 2008 and December 2016. The pathologic node-positive rates in breast pCR patients were compared for different breast cancer subtypes and clinical nodal stages.ResultsAxillary pCR was achieved in 51.9% of the patients after NAC. In this case, the axillary pCR was associated with a biologic subtype (P<0.0001), initial clinical tumor stage (P<0.0001), clinical nodal stage (P=0.0071), and breast pCR (P<0.0001). In particular, axillary pCR correlated more than 80% with breast pCR (87.1%) or clinical nodal stage N0 (81.0%). Patients with breast pCR had 96.4% axillary pCR in clinical nodal stage N0, 86.1% in N1, and 84.7% in N2/N3.ConclusionOur study may help to predict node-positive rates in patients with breast pCR after NAC according to clinical node stage. Patients with a high probability of achieving pCR might be suitable candidates for more minimal surgery.

TI  - Assessment of land use land cover changes and its impact on variations of land surface temperature in Asansol-Durgapur Development Region
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast transformation of land use/land cover because of urban expansion profoundly influences biodiversity and ecosystem function, as well as local and regional climate. One of the more serious impacts of urbanization is the formation of urban heat island (UHI) effect. Asansol-Durgapur Development Region is the second largest urban identity in West Bengal just after Kolkata urban agglomeration. Rapid urban growth in Asansol-Durgapur Development Region has brought about fast transformation of LULC pattern which in turn significantly affect the LST. Fast transformation of land use and land cover pattern brought significant changes in LST. The study attempts to examine the influence of land use/land cover (LULC) on land surface temperature in Asansol-Durgapur Development Region by employing multi temporal satellite data. LST is extracted in three different phases seasonally (e.g. winter, summer and post-monsoon periods) by using LANDSAT 4-5 TM and LANDSAT 8 OLI over the period of 1993, 2009 and 2015. Results depict that LST increases 0.06 degrees C/year in winter and 0.43 degrees C/year in summer periods respectively and the difference of surface radiant temperature is significant over existing different LULC units. The result of the study revealed that the impervious surface, industrial area and coal mining area has high surface temperature (38 degrees C) and water bodies and vegetation cover has experienced low surface temperature (27 degrees C). The study also examined causality of association between LST and deriving factors such as NDVI, NDBI and NDWI. The result reveals that LST maximally controls by impervious surface (r = 0.95) than water bodies (r = 0.62) and vegetation cover (r = 0.61).

TI  - Examination of Radiometric Deviations in Bands 29, 31, and 32 of MODIS Collection 6.0 and 6.1
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The radiometric stability of selected thermal emissive bands (TEBs) of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites is examined via a direct intersensor comparison with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite. The analysis adapts a "nadir-only" refinement of the simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNOs) analysis to evaluate radiometric deviations in MODIS Collection 6.0 and 6.1 data releases, the latter having been implemented with a version of crosstalk effect mitigation for Terra MODIS bands 27-30. The comparison time series result, with an average precision of 0.4%, shows radiometric deviation in Terra MODIS band 29 (8.55 mu m) up to 6%, or 3 K in brightness temperature (BT), in Collection 6.0, and correspondingly -1.5%, or -0.7 K in BT, in Collection 6.1, in particular significantly worsened by the safe mode event of February 2016. This paper includes the inter-TEB comparisons of MODIS bands B31 and B32 with SNPP VIIRS as two representative cases of nonideal spectral match demonstrating various key features and new information as revealed under the " nadir-only" framework, and also describes a procedure using both radiance-to-radiance comparison and BT-difference time series to estimate the BT-difference uncertainty specifications as well as the radiance-to-radiance time series baselines that are shifted away from unity. The finding for Terra MODIS band 29 highlights the continual nontrivial impact of crosstalk effect on numerous TEBs of MODIS Collection 6.1 not fully mitigated, which can further impact cloud masks, sea surface temperatures, and other product retrievals.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in Merkel cell carcinoma: Predictors of sentinel lymph node positivity and association with overall survival
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive malignancy with high rates of recurrence and metastasis.Objective: To evaluate predictors of sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity in MCC using the National Cancer Database.Methods: The National Cancer Database, from 2012 to 2014, was used to identify 3048 patients with MCC, of whom 1174 received an SLN biopsy. Predictors of SLN positivity were evaluated using logistic regression. Overall survival was evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model.Results: Of patients who underwent SLN biopsy, those with primary lesions on the trunk (odds ratio, 1.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-3.17; P = .004), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (odds ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.01-2.46; P = .04), or lymphovascular invasion (odds ratio, 3.45; 95% CI, 2.51-4.76; P < .001) were more likely to have positive SLNs on multivariate analysis. Overall survival was negatively affected by age >= 75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.55; 95% CI, 1.36-4.77; P = .003), male sex (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.09-2.91, P = .022), immunosuppression (HR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.72-7.13; P = .001), and SLN positivity (HR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.98-5.04; P < .001).Limitations: Lack of disease-specific survival and potential selection bias from a retrospective data set.Conclusions: Truncal MCC, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and presence of lymphovascular invasion were independent predictors of positive SLNs. Overall survival was negatively affected by advancing age, male sex, immunosuppression, and SLN positivity.

TI  - Mapping Recent Lava Flows at Mount Etna Using Multispectral Sentinel-2 Images and Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of recent lava flows can provide significant insight into the development of flow fields that may aid in predicting future flow behavior. The task is challenging, due to both intrinsic properties of the phenomenon (e.g., lava flow resurfacing processes) and technical issues (e.g., the difficulty to survey a spatially extended lava flow with either aerial or ground instruments while avoiding hazardous locations). The huge amount of moderate to high resolution multispectral satellite data currently provides new opportunities for monitoring of extreme thermal events, such as eruptive phenomena. While retrieving boundaries of an active lava flow is relatively straightforward, problems arise when discriminating a recently cooled lava flow from older lava flow fields. Here, we present a new supervised classifier based on machine learning techniques to discriminate recent lava imaged in the MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 satellite. Automated classification evaluates each pixel in a scene and then groups the pixels with similar values (e.g., digital number, reflectance, radiance) into a specified number of classes. Bands at the spatial resolution of 10 m (bands 2, 3, 4, 8) are used as input to the classifier. The training phase is performed on a small number of pixels manually labeled as covered by fresh lava, while the testing characterizes the entire lava flow field. Compared with ground-based measurements and actual lava flows of Mount Etna emplaced in 2017 and 2018, our automatic procedure provides excellent results in terms of accuracy, precision, and sensitivity.

TI  - Determining Effective Meter-Scale Image Data and Spectral Vegetation Indices for Tropical Forest Tree Species Differentiation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate several high-resolution remote sensing data products derived from WorldView-3 satellite imagery to determine which product or product grouping would be most applicable for identifying and mapping tropical tree species. The study site, La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, provides the infrastructure to facilitate collection of proper ground-truth data for image validation. An objective statistical analysis demonstrated that the WorldView-3 imagery, after applying a series of spectral and illumination image corrections, was able to accurately identify selected tree species. Specifically, this study defines the image bands and image-derived spectral vegetation indices that are the most effective for tree species discrimination. We show that corrected absolute reflectivity values from the green, red, red edge, and near-infrared are good differentiators of tropical tree species crowns. We also evaluate 14 possible multiband vegetation indices and show that two new indices developed here, using WorldView-3 image bands, have the highest discriminatory power for tropical tree species. A combination of both individual band information and vegetation indices would significantly improve image-based classification of tropical forests.

TI  - Molecular matching for patients with haematological diseases expressing altered <i>RHD-RHCE</i> genotypes
T2  - VOX SANGUINIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives The high homology and the inverted orientation of RHD and RHCE may give rise to non-functional and aberrant RH alleles. RH genotyping is used to screen RH matched donors to African descent patients. This study aimed to define a strategy for testing RHD and RHCE variants in blood donors to provide compatible units for transfusion of patients with haematological diseases. Materials and Methods Samples from 132 patients [101 Sickle cell disease (SCD), 14 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 17 acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML)] and 198 Brazilian donors were studied. Major blood group alleles, RHD, RHCE alleles and RHD zygosity were determined by the blood-MLPA assay. Sequencing was performed to determine RHD and RHCE variant subtypes. A match was an RH genotype that did not encode Rh antigens absent in the patient, along with matching for ABO, MNS, KEL, FY, JK and DI antigens. Results Overall, 7 center dot 6% of blood donors and 17.4% of patients presented RH genotypes that predict expression of partial Rh antigens or lack of high prevalence Rh antigens. From 23 patients with clinically relevant RH genotypes, 15 had available matched donors. Conclusion We report the presence of clinically relevant RH genotypes in SCD and in non-SCD patients. In our admixed population, many patients carry variant RHCE alleles in heterozygosity with normal RHCE alleles. Thus, our results suggest that donors could be selected based on the normal RH allele.

AB  - Wetlands can be considered as one of the most vulnerable and endangered ecosystems on the planet. The threat is even more emphasized when the "kidneys of the landscapes" are used for agricultural purposes. The agricultural intensification in Rwanda resulted year-round cultivation in most of the wetlands. Despite its higher water and labor demand than other crops paddy rice is the preferred and policy recommended food and cash crop in the wetlands of the country. For effective management planning processes to ensure food security there is a serious need for accurate and up-to-date information on the agriculture sector. The objective our study is to contribute to this effort by using spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to retrieve phenological parameters of paddy rice in the Southern Province of Rwanda. High spatial resolution dual polarized Sentinel-1 SAR data were obtained for the time period covering Season B of the two rice cropping seasons of 2017. For the derivation of the selected phenological indicators (start, end, middle and length of season) time series analysis was performed. Based on the temporal pattern of radar backscatter values, the temporal and spatial distribution of SAR derived phenological indicators considerable differences were identified among the investigated four paddy rice fields. These differences are related to the different level of management harmonization, embedding other crops in the paddy rice fields, and as well as to the topographical characteristics of the valley bottoms where the cropping activity takes place. The study confirms that using SAR is a promising technology for agricultural monitoring especially in regions where cloud cover is the main reason for the limited use of optical imagery.

T2  - REVISTA GEOARAGUAIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Laminar erosion is one of the main erosive processes, however, these events are hardly noticeable. In this way, the objective of this work was to map the susceptibility to laminar erosion in the upper reaches of the Banabuiu River-CE, by using geoprocessing techniques, subsidizing a better management of the area's natural resources. In this study were used: the software QGIS 2.8.6, ALOS PALSAR radar images with spatial resolution of 12.5m and a pedological base in the scale of 1:100,000. The methodology adopted uses data on soil erodibility and land declivity in order to generate mappings of areas susceptible to laminar erosion. The crossing of erodibility and declivity layers resulted in data on the erosion susceptibility. The study area presents a class III level on soil erodibility, predominating areas that are moderately susceptible to laminar erosion. The results showed with fidelity the different classes of susceptibility to laminar erosion, fact confirmed on field observations. Thus, the mapping generated will serve as a subsidy to the environmental planning of the area, aiming at the conservation of natural resources.

M3  - Review
AB  - Despite the growing popular and scientific interest in mindfulness and other forms of meditation, there are important gaps in our understanding of the full range of contemplative practices and the manner in which specific forms of meditation may contribute to well-being. In this article, we discuss the relationship between mindfulness and other forms of meditation, such as those related to prosocial qualities, cognitive insight, and meaning and purpose. We propose that mindfulness plays an important role as a foundation for other contemplative practices. We also discuss the importance of worldview as a variable in mindfulness practice and raise questions that may guide future research in this area.

TI  - Coastline extraction from repeat high resolution satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new coastline extraction method that improves water classification accuracy by benefitting from an ever-increasing volume of repeated measurements from commercial satellite missions. The widely-used Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) method is tested on a sample of around 12,600 satellite images for statistical analysis. The core of the new water classification method is the use of a water probability algorithm based on the stacking of repeat measurements, which can mitigate the effects of translational offsets of images and the classification errors caused by clouds and cloud shadows. By integrating QuickBird, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 multispectral images, the final data product provides a 2 m resolution coastline, as well as a 2 m water probability map and a repeat-count measurement map. Improvements on the existing coastline (GSHHS-the Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoreline Database, 50 m-5000 m) in terms of resolution (2 m) is substantial, thanks to the combination of multiple data sources.

TI  - New Orleans Levee Displacement Study via Interferometric Point Target Analysis Technique and In Situ Instrumentation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The integrity of a levee is an important issue that needs to be checked frequently. This can be done by monitoring the subsidence of the levee for a long time to identify the weak sections and prioritize maintenance efforts. This paper presents the application of a remote sensing technique to monitor the displacement of the London Avenue Canal levee in New Orleans, Louisiana, from 2009 to 2014. The input data were radar images taken by the German Space Agency's X-band satellite, TerraSAR-X, over those 6 years. The displacement of a levee section at London Avenue was determined by analyzing the displacement of selected points using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method. The required steps to calculate the displacement at selected points were presented. In situ instrumentation was also installed to measure the displacement at several locations in the London Avenue section. The comparisons of the different monitoring methods revealed similar displacement trends. The favorable comparison increases confidence in the suitability of remote sensing techniques to monitor the displacement of entire levee systems.

TI  - Analysis of the urban surface thermal condition based on sky-view factor and vegetation cover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of the surface thermal condition within the urban area of Akure City, Nigeria, has been investigated in this study. Surface heat flux, which is an expression of the thermal environment was estimated from Landsat 8 satellite image based on the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model. The study applied the use of sky view factor and vegetation cover in identifying the variation of the surface heat flux and Land Surface Temperature (LST) within sixteen (16) different urban sites. The surface heat flux distribution at these sites differed distinctly in magnitude and intensity according to the sky-view and surface characteristics. The areas with the highest Sensible Heat flux (H) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) were notably the areas with higher sky-view factor and lower vegetation cover abundance. Two of the sites with the lowest intensities of H and LST had sky view factors of 0.82 and 0.42. However, the areas differed in the vegetation composition; one area was a park while the other was composed of a mixture of scattered trees and grasses. Correlation analysis revealed that over the city, surface features had more contribution to the variation of heat flux as well as LST compared to the sky-view factor. The information presented in this study is essential in sustainable urban planning and adequate response to urban thermal risks associated with the changing patterns of urban geometry and land use within the region.

AB  - Increased in human anthropogenic activities resulted in large degradation of wetlands affecting the biotic and abiotic components of the freshwater ecosystems. The Loktak Lake of Manipur in the Indo-Burma Biodiversity region has been degraded and threatened due to increase in population and the demand for more resources. The aim of the present study was to assess the changes in land use pattern in Loktak Lake during the last 38 years using digital change detection approaches. Spatial technique of land uses detection using multi-temporal satellite data followed by remote sensing techniques were used to assess the land cover changes. Maximum likelihood algorithm was employed to analyze the data collected from the Earth Resource Development Assessment System imagine in order to detect the change in land cover. Further, five types of land use pattern viz. open water bodies, agricultural area, Phumdis with thick vegetation, Phumdis with thin vegetation and settlement were studied. The results showed an alternation in the land use profile of the Loktak Lake. The present finding indicates that overall increased in open water bodies, agricultural area and settlement by 10.94%, 10.26% and 2.23% respectively while Phumdis with thick and Phumdis with thin vegetation have decreased by 3.48% and 28.89%. Changes in land use pattern were found to be affecting the fragile ecosystem of the Loktak Lake and posed a serious threat to the aquatic ecosystem. The study identified the need for proper land use planning and implementation of Manipur Loktak Lake Act 2006 for sustainable management of the lake.

TI  - Use of Logistic Regression in Land-Cover Classification with Moderate-Resolution Multispectral Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study highlights the use of binary logistic regression for land-use land-cover (LULC) classification. The moderate-resolution Sentinel-2 multispectral data was used for LULC map generation for the post-monsoon season. The main focus of this study is to present a simple and precise approach for image classification using binary logistic regression (BLR) technique. The study was carried out in cropland, fallow land, forest and water body dominated subtropical region of India located in the eastern coastal region. The cropland and fallow lands are mostly dependent on the monsoon and reciprocal land covers. A large number of training and testing data points were collected viewing the image in a standard false-color composite. ArcGIS, Microsoft Office Excel and R software were used for classification. In addition to BLR, the training and testing data points were also used to perform the classification with 'random forest' classifier in R. We observed higher classification accuracy for spectrally pure classes and pixels and lower for closely associated mix-pixels. Lower user's and producer's accuracies (< 90%) were observed for fallow land, water body and grassland class during training and model building and for fallow land and forest during accuracy assessment, whereas the accuracies were more than 90% for the rest of classes during both training and testing. Misclassifications were mostly observed between forest, fallow land, grassland and water body during training, which were forest and fallow land in testing, due to their lower spectral difference with reference to classified classes. However, the overall accuracy and kappa value during training and testing were more than 94% and 0.98, respectively. Similar accuracies and misclassification were also obtained with the results of random forest model, validating the adopted methodology. Regardless of the seasonal variations in cropland and fallow land, the field observations (52 locations) also corroborated the estimated classification accuracy. The easy implementation and comparatively higher classification accuracy with the binary logistic technique are believed to increase its intense use in land-cover classification.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover are important biophysical factors which have a major role in different terrestrial processes on the earth. Land use and land cover change are a vital element of global environmental change. It is very essential for regional development and land use management towards sustainable development. The different time's period satellite images in the study area have been studied to understand temporal as well as the spatial variability of land use and land cover (LULC) change. In this, an attempt was made to adopt the Markov model for obtaining and investigating the dynamics of land use change. Markov model was used as a stochastic model to make quantitative comparisons of the land-use changes between time periods extending from 2001 to 2010. Model performance was evaluated between the empirical LULC map obtained extracted from Landsat 8 (2017) image and the simulated LULC map obtained from the Markov model. The future land use distribution in the year 2019 and 2028 was acquired using a Markov model. This result shows that the Markov model and geospatial technology together are able to effectively capture the spatiotemporal trend in the landscape pattern in this study area.

TI  - Early Detection of Invasive Exotic Trees Using UAV and Manned Aircraft Multispectral and LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exotic conifers can provide significant ecosystem services, but in some environments, they have become invasive and threaten indigenous ecosystems. In New Zealand, this phenomenon is of considerable concern as the area occupied by invasive exotic trees is large and increasing rapidly. Remote sensing methods offer a potential means of identifying and monitoring land infested by these trees, enabling managers to efficiently allocate resources for their control. In this study, we sought to develop methods for remote detection of exotic invasive trees, namely Pinus sylvestris and P. ponderosa. Critically, the study aimed to detect these species prior to the onset of maturity and coning as this is important for preventing further spread. In the study environment in New Zealand's South Island, these species reach maturity and begin bearing cones at a young age. As such, detection of these smaller individuals requires specialist methods and very high-resolution remote sensing data. We examined the efficacy of classifiers developed using two machine learning algorithms with multispectral and laser scanning data collected from two platforms-manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The study focused on a localized conifer invasion originating from a multi-species pine shelter belt in a grassland environment. This environment provided a useful means of defining the detection thresholds of the methods and technologies employed. An extensive field dataset including over 17,000 trees (height range = 1 cm to 476 cm) was used as an independent validation dataset for the detection methods developed. We found that data from both platforms and using both logistic regression and random forests for classification provided highly accurate (kappa <mml:semantics><0.996</mml:semantics>) detection of invasive conifers. Our analysis showed that the data from both UAV and manned aircraft was useful for detecting trees down to 1 m in height and therefore shorter than 99.3% of the coning individuals in the study dataset. We also explored the relative contribution of both multispectral and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data in the detection of invasive trees through fitting classification models with different combinations of predictors and found that the most useful models included data from both sensors. However, the combination of ALS and multispectral data did not significantly improve classification accuracy. We believe that this was due to the simplistic vegetation and terrain structure in the study site that resulted in uncomplicated separability of invasive conifers from other vegetation. This study provides valuable new knowledge of the efficacy of detecting invasive conifers prior to the onset of coning using high-resolution data from UAV and manned aircraft. This will be an important tool in managing the spread of these important invasive plants.

TI  - Hurricane damage detection on four major Caribbean islands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclones are natural events that transform into natural disasters as they approach and reach land. In 2017 alone, tropical cyclones caused an estimated $215 billion in damage. While MODIS data are regularly used in the analysis of hurricanes and typhoons, damage studies typically focus on just a few events without providing a comprehensive overview and comparison across events. The MODIS record is now sufficiently long to enable standardization in time, allowing us to extend previously developed disturbance methodology and to remove dependency on land cover datasets. We apply this new approach to detect the impact of both droughts and hurricanes on the four largest Caribbean islands since 2001. We find that the percentage of disturbed land on the four islands varies from approximately 0-50% between 2001 and 2017, with the highest percentages coinciding with major droughts in Cuba, and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. We demonstrate that (1) Hurricane Maria resulted in significant disturbance across 50% of Puerto Rico (4549 km(2)), and (2) gradual recovery started about 2.5 months after the hurricane hit. While our approach focuses on the identification of damage arising from hurricanes, it is also capable of identifying the damage from droughts. This approach ultimately enables a better understanding of the combined effects of these two natural hazards across island landscapes.

TI  - A Novel Data Fusion Technique for Snow Cover Retrieval
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel data fusion technique for improving the snow cover monitoring for a mesoscale Alpine region, in particular in those areas where two information sources disagree. The presented methodological innovation consists in the integration of remote-sensing data products and the numerical simulation results by means of a machine learning classifier (support vector machine), capable to extract information from their quality measures. This differs from the existing approaches where remote sensing is only used for model tuning or data assimilation. The technique has been tested to generate a time series of about 1300 snow maps for the period between October 2012 and July 2016. The results show an average agreement between the fused product and the reference ground data of 96%, compared to 90% of the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data product and 92% of the numerical model simulation. Moreover, one of the most important results is observed from the analysis of snow cover area (SCA) time series, where the fused product seems to overcome the well-known underestimation of snow in forest of the MODIS product, by accurately reproducing the SCA peaks of winter season.

TI  - Impact of a dam construction on the surface biophysical parameters in amazonia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon rainforest has undergone some changes in its vegetation cover due to the anthropic action driven mainly by the construction of a hydroelectric plant in the Legal Amazon. Those changes have impact on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI, surface temperature, albedo and, consequently, in the net radiation. Thus, the main aim of this paper was to evaluate the modification of the biophysics parameters (albedo, NDVI, surface temperature and net radiation) at the surface due to the construction of the Santo Antonio power plant. Landsat-5/TM and Landsat-8/OLI satellite imageries (path 232 and row 66) of the dry season of 2008 and 2016 (before and after the power plant building) were used in this study. The results have shown that the NDVI and the net radiation diminish and both surface temperature and albedo have increased due to the power plant building. The highest impact was observed in a 2.5 km radius, but injuries still can be observed up to 10 km away. The results here presented have shown the impact of the Santo Antonio power plant building in the biophysical indexes and, consequently, in the reduction of the available energy in the study area.

TI  - Validation of the 3D-MOHID Hydrodynamic Model for the Tagus Coastal Area
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrodynamics of the TagusROFI (Regions of Freshwater Influence) is affected by the coastal upwelling, the estuarine tidal flow, the thermohaline circulation that is modulated by the Tagus freshwater discharge, and by its complex bathymetry. The use of numerical models is the best way to explain the processes that characterize this region. These models are also crucial to answer important scientific and management questions. Nevertheless, the robustness of the products derived from models depend on their accuracy and therefore models must be validated to determine the uncertainty associated. Time and space variability of the driving forces and of bathymetry enhance flow complexity increasing validation difficulties, requiring continuous high-resolution data to describe flow and thermohaline horizontal and vertical variabilities. In the present work, to increase the precision and accuracy of the coastal processes simulations, the sub-systems coastal area and the Tagus estuary were integrated into a single domain, which considers higher resolution grids in both horizontal and vertical directions. The three-dimensiosal (3D)-MOHID Water model was validated for the TagusROFI by comparing statistically modelling results with in situ and satellite L4 data. Validation with a conductivity, temperature, and depth probe (CTD), an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) and satellite data was performed for the first time. Validation against tidal gauges showed that the model is able to simulate tidal propagation inside the estuary with accuracy. A very good agreement between CTD data and surface sea water temperature (SST) and salinity simulations was observed. The validation of current direction and velocity from ADCP data also indicated a high model accuracy for these variables. Comparisons between model and satellite for SST also showed that the model produces realistic SSTs and upwelling events. Overall results showed that MOHID setup and parametrisations are well implemented for the TagusROFI domain. These results are even more important when a 3D model is used in simulations due to its complexity once it considers both horizontal and vertical discretization allowing a better representation of the heat and salinity fluxes in the water column. Moreover, the results achieved indicates that 3D-MOHID is robust enough to run in operational mode, including its forecast ability, fundamental to be used as a management tool.

T2  - APPLIED NURSING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Reporting falls in the hospital setting is a world-recognized strategy to prevent these incidents.Objective: To describe in-hospital falls reported in a large hospital in the South of Brazil.Method: Retrospective, descriptive study of falls reported in the hospital's electronic reporting system.Results: We analyzed 1071 fall incidents. The incidence of falls in inpatient units was 1.7 per 1000 patient days. Among the recorded falls, 95.3% occurred in patients who had been previously assessed as being at high or moderate risk of falls; 61.5% were using medications associated with increased risk of falls. Regarding age, 70.8% of the falls occurred in patients aged >= 60 years. Falls occurred mostly (72.6%) in inpatients units, and in 63.4% of the incidents the fail was witnessed by a family member/companion or a health team professionals. No injuries were recorded in 71.4% of the patients. Serious adverse events or sentinel events, such as fractures or head trauma occurred in 2.1% of the patients. Of these, 80% were in the group aged >= 60 years; 83% of the head traumas and 58% of the fractures occurred in patients who had been assessed as being at high risk of falls. Fractures were associated (p = 0.026) with age 70-79 years.Conclusion: At the hospital where the study was performed, new fall prevention strategies must focus on patients admitted to inpatient units, aged >= 60 years, assessed as being at high risk of falls, and using medications associated with increased risk of falls.

TI  - Object-Based Flood Analysis Using a Graph-Based Representation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount of freely available satellite data is growing rapidly as a result of Earth observation programmes, such as Copernicus, an initiative of the European Space Agency. Analysing these huge amounts of geospatial data and extracting useful information is an ongoing pursuit. This paper presents an alternative method for flood detection based on the description of spatio-temporal dynamics in satellite image time series (SITS). Since synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data has the capability of capturing images day and night, irrespective of weather conditions, it is the preferred tool for flood mapping from space. An object-based approach can limit the necessary computer power and computation time, while a graph-based approach allows for a comprehensible interpretation of dynamics. This method proves to be a useful tool to gain insight in a flood event. Graph representation helps to identify and locate entities within the study site and describe their evolution throughout the time series.

TI  - Vegetation Phenological Characterization of Alluvial Plain Shorea robusta-dominated Tropical Moist Deciduous Forest of Northeast India Using MODIS NDVI Time Series Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study attempts to extract the phenological variables of alluvial plain Shorea robusta-dominated tropical moist deciduous forest of Northeast India using threshold-based method. A total of 230 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD13Q1 time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets (year 2006-2015) has been used. Time series NDVI datasets were fitted to an adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter for smoothing. Important phenological matrices, namely start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), length of season (LOS), peak of season (POS), seasonal amplitude, seasonally integrals (large and small integral), were evaluated. SOS varied from 106 to 120 day of year (DOY) (average of 110 +/- 17.6), and EOS varied from 425 to 441 DOY (average of 431 +/- 14.33). POS reaches in the month of September and October (average 262 +/- 15). In the current study, a mean amplitude of 0.35, lower value of small integral (4.70 +/- 0.34) and higher value of large integral (16.24 +/- 0.25) signify that the studied forest is highly productive ecosystem, with semievergreen or moist deciduous canopy. Strong linear relationship of NDVI with temperature and rainfall was witnessed, particularly with a 1-2 month time lag. Also, NDVI-temperature correlation was found stronger than NDVI-precipitation correlation, suggesting that the area being a humid subtropical region, temperature plays a greater role in the timing of phenological events than rainfall and can act as a crucial factor for growth of the species under the climate changing scenario.

TI  - Scabies polymerase chain reaction with standardized dry swab sampling: an easy tool for cluster diagnosis of human scabies
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Expert visualization of Sarcoptes scabiei remains essential for diagnosing human scabies, but access to said experts can be difficult. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a specific tool for the detection and confirmation of S. scabiei but has poor sensitivity. Objectives To evaluate PCR as a diagnostic method for scabies using nonexpert-dependent standardized sampling. Methods The dry swab was systematically rubbed across the front of both wrists, the eight interdigital spaces and on any suspected scabies lesions in all patients referred for scabies. A new PCR-based diagnostic test was run on the samples. All patients underwent clinical and dermoscopic examination. Scabies diagnosis was confirmed when dermoscopic examination was positive or the patient had typical clinical signs of scabies. Results Of 183 suspected cases of scabies, 164 patients were sampled, 87 had confirmed scabies (dermoscopy positive n = 87, typical clinical signs n = 1) and 77 did not. Of the 87 patients with proved scabies, 33 patients had positive scabies PCR, resulting in a 37 center dot 9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 28 center dot 4-48 center dot 4%] sensitivity and a 61 center dot 7% (95% CI 52 center dot 4-72 center dot 7%) negative predictive value. None of the 77 patients ruled out for scabies had a positive PCR result. Conclusions This method is nontraumatic, repeatable and non-expert-dependent. It shows sensitivity similar to previous studies involving expert skin scraping. However, this method facilitates the multiplication of sampling, which increased the sensitivity for cluster scabies diagnosis. This method may be suitable as a first-line diagnosis tool where a large cluster scabies outbreak is suspected.

TI  - A Metric for Evaluating the Geometric Quality of Land Cover Maps Generated with Contextual Features from High-Dimensional Satellite Image Time Series without Dense Reference Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover maps are a key resource for many studies in Earth Observation, and thanks to the high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolutions of systems like Sentinel-2, maps with a wide variety of land cover classes can now be automatically produced over vast areas. However, certain context-dependent classes, such as urban areas, remain challenging to classify correctly with pixel-based methods. Including contextual information into the classification can either be done at the feature level with texture descriptors or object-based approaches, or in the classification model itself, as is done in Convolutional Neural Networks. This improves recognition rates of these classes, but sometimes deteriorates the fine-resolution geometry of the output map, particularly in sharp corners and in fine elements such as rivers and roads. However, the quality of the geometry is difficult to assess in the absence of dense training data, which is usually the case in land cover mapping, especially over wide areas. This work presents a framework for measuring the geometric precision of a classification map, in order to provide deeper insight into the consequences of the use of various contextual features, when dense validation data is not available. This quantitative metric, named the Pixel Based Corner Match (PBCM), is based on corner detection and corner matching between a pixel-based classification result, and a contextual classification result. The selected case study is the classification of Sentinel-2 multi-spectral image time series, with a rich nomenclature containing context-dependent classes. To demonstrate the added value of the proposed metric, three spatial support shapes (window, object, superpixel) are compared according to their ability to improve the classification performance on this challenging problem, while paying attention to the geometric precision of the result. The results show that superpixels are the best candidate for the local statistics features, as they modestly improve the classification accuracy, while preserving the geometric elements in the image. Furthermore, the density of edges in a sliding window provides a significant boost in accuracy, and maintains a high geometric precision.

TI  - Comparison of Molecular and Histologic Ultrastaging Methods in Sentinel Lymph Node Analysis from Clinical Stage II Colon Cancers
T2  - APPLIED IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR MORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Various studies have demonstrated that occult metastases may be present in patients with clinical stage II colon cancer. The objective of this prospective investigation was to compare the performance of molecular analysis and histologic ultrastaging in detecting occult metastases in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). SLNs were collected ex vivo during surgery in 29 patients. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays were constructed. The results were compared with histologic ultrastaging analysis by hemalum and eosin stain and immunohistochemistry on step serial sections. At least 1 SLN was identified in 76% of the cases. The first hemalum and eosin section identified metastases in 23% of the 22 SLNs. Immunohistochemistry identified isolated tumor cells in 24% of the remaining 17 cases. An overall 73% of the SLNs analyzed by qRT-PCR were positive. Four of them were negative for ultrastaging analysis. qRT-PCR is a powerful tool for the detection of occult metastases in colorectal SLN and seems to be more sensitive than histologic ultrastaging analysis. A larger prospective cohort study is necessary to provide further evidence.

TI  - Complex network-based time series remote sensing model in monitoring the fall foliage transition date for peak coloration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenological events, especially peak foliage coloration, are among the ecological phenomena that are most sensitive to climate change. Compared to spring seasonally recurring events, fall phenology remains much less understood. Remotely sensed monitoring of fall phenology provides a wealth of opportunities to understand the underlying processes and mechanisms. However, the gradual change of foliage color in the fall season makes it challenging to remotely estimate critical phenological transition dates. Particularly, the transition date for foliage peak coloration cannot be adequately captured via conventional curve fitting-based phenological models. Also the lack of consensus among the conventional models makes it desirable to explore new remotely sensed representations of the fall phenological process. In this study, we developed an innovative complex network based phenological model, namely "pheno-network", to estimate the fall foliage transition date for peak coloration. The pheno-network model characterizes the phenological process through analyzing the collective changes of spectral signatures along the temporal trajectory. A network measure, moving average bridging coefficient, is newly designed to estimate the phenological transition date. With Harvard Forest and Hubbard Brook Forest as reference sites, the results demonstrated that the transition date estimated through the devised pheno-network model corresponds well with the peak coloration period of the reference sites. The unique structure of the pheno-network formulated via spectral similarities differentiates the various roles of vegetation spectral signatures at different phenological stages. This study is the first attempt at introducing network science to time series remote sensing in modeling the complex phenological processes of vegetation. The innovative network-based phenological representation shows great potential in improving remotely sensed phenological monitoring and shedding light on the subsequent modeling of vegetation phenological responses to climate change.

TI  - Comparison of LiDAR and Digital Aerial Photogrammetry for Characterizing Canopy Openings in the Boreal Forest of Northern Alberta
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy openings are a key element of forest structure, influencing a host of ecological dynamics. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is the de-facto standard for measuring three-dimensional forest structure, but digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) has emerged as a viable and economical alternative. We compared the performance of LiDAR and DAP data for characterizing canopy openings and no-openings across a 1-km(2) expanse of boreal forest in northern Alberta, Canada. Structural openings in canopy cover were delineated using three canopy height model (CHM) alternatives, from (i) LiDAR, (ii) DAP, and (iii) a LiDAR/DAP hybrid. From a point-based detectability perspective, the LiDAR CHM produced the best results (87% overall accuracy), followed by the hybrid and DAP models (47% and 46%, respectively). The hybrid and DAP CHMs experienced large errors of omission (9-53%), particularly with small openings up to 20m(2), which are an important element of boreal forest structure. By missing these, DAP and hybrid datasets substantially under-reported the total area of openings across our site (152,470 m(2) and 159,848 m(2), respectively) compared to LiDAR (245,920 m(2)). Our results illustrate DAP's sensitivity to occlusions, mismatched tie points, and other optical challenges inherent to using structure-from-motion workflows in complex forest scenes. These under-documented constraints currently limit the technology's capacity to fully characterize canopy structure. For now, we recommend that operational use of DAP in forests be limited to mapping large canopy openings, and area-based attributes that are well-documented in the literature.

TI  - Land-Use/Land-Cover Changes and Their Impact on Surface Urban Heat Islands: Case Study of Kandy City, Sri Lanka
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - An urban heat island (UHI) is a phenomenon that shows a higher temperature in urban areas compared to surrounding rural areas due to the impact of impervious surface (IS) density, and other anthropogenic activities including changes of land use/land cover (LULC). The purpose of this research is to examine the spatiotemporal land-use/land-cover changes and their impact on the surface UHI (SUHI) in Kandy City, Sri Lanka, using Landsat data and geospatial techniques. LULC classification was made by using a pixel-oriented supervised classification method, and LULC changes were computed by using a cross-cover comparison. The SUHI effect was discussed mainly through the variation of land-surface temperature (LST) over persistent IS and newly added IS. The study showed the dynamics of each LULC and its role in the SUHI. The results showed that IS areas expanded from 529 to 1514 ha (2.3% to 6.7% of the total land area) between 1996 and 2006, and to 5833 ha (23.9% of the total land area) in 2017, with an annual growth rate of 11.1% per year from 1996 to 2006 and 12.2% per year from 2006 to 2017. A gradually declining trend was observed in forest areas. Persistent IS reported the highest mean LST areas compared to newly added IS. The mean LST difference between persistent IS and newly added IS was 1.43 degrees C over the study period. This is because areas of persistent IS are typically surrounded by IS even in their neighborhoods, whereas areas of newly added IS occur at the edges of the city and are, therefore, cooled by the surrounding nonurban surfaces. This calls for appropriate green-oriented landscape-management methods to mitigate the impact of the SUHI in Kandy City. The findings of the study showed that LULC changes and their effect on the SUHI from 1996 to 2017 made a significant contribution to long records of change dynamics.

TI  - Field-Scale Crop Seeding Date Estimation from MODIS Data and Growing Degree Days in Manitoba, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on crop seeding date is required in many applications such as crop management and yield forecasting. This study presents a novel method to estimate crop seeding date at the field level from time-series 250-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and growing degree days (GDD; base 5 degrees C; degrees C-days). The start of growing season (SOS) was first derived from time-series EVI2 (two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index) calculated from a MODIS 8-day composite surface reflectance product (MOD09Q1; Collection 6). Based on GDD calculated from the Daymet gridded estimates of daily weather parameters, a simple model was developed to establish a linkage between the observed seeding date and the SOS. Calibration and validation of the model was conducted on three major crops, spring wheat, canola and oats in the Province of Manitoba, Canada. The estimated SOS had a strong linear correlation with the observed seeding date; with a deviation of a few days depending on the year. The seeding date of the three crops can be calculated from the SOS by adjusting the number of days needed to accumulate GDD (AGDD) for emergence. The overall root-mean-square-difference (RMSD) of the estimated seeding date was less than 10 days. Validation showed that the accuracy of the estimated seeding date was crop-type independent. The developed method is useful for estimating the historical crop seeding date from remote sensing data in Canada to support studies of the interactions among seeding date, crop management and crop yield under climate change. It is anticipated that this method can be adapted to other crops in other locations using the same or different satellite data.

TI  - A generalized space-time OBIA classification scheme to map sugarcane areas at regional scale, using Landsat images time-series and the random forest algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of sugarcane areas is important for sustainable planning and management of the sugarcane industry in Brazil. We developed an operational Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) classification scheme, with generalized space-time classifier, for mapping sugarcane areas at the regional scale in Sao Paulo State (SP). Binary random forest (RF) classification models were calibrated using multi-temporal data from Landsat images, at 10 sites located across SP. Space and time generalization were tested and compared for three approaches: a local calibration and application; a cross-site spatial generalization test with the RF model calibrated on a site and applied on other sites; and a unique space-time classifier calibrated with all sites together on years 2009-2014 and applied to the entire SP region on 2015. The local RF models Dice Coefficient (DC) accuracies at sites 1 to 8 were between 0.83 and 0.92 with an average of 0.89. The cross-site classification accuracy showed an average DC of 0.85, and the unique RF model had a DC of 0.89 when compared with a reference map of 2015. The results demonstrated a good relationship between sugarcane prediction and the reference map for each municipality in SP, with R-2 = 0.99 and only 5.8% error for the total sugarcane area in SP, and compared with the area inventory from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, with R-2 = 0.95 and -1% error for the total sugarcane area in SP. The final unique RF model allowed monitoring sugarcane plantations at the regional scale on independent year, with efficiency, low-cost, limited resources and a precision approximating that of a photointerpretation.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Environmental Changes in Cold Regions: Methods, Achievements and Challenges
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Cold regions, including high-latitude and high-altitude landscapes, are experiencing profound environmental changes driven by global warming. With the advance of earth observation technology, remote sensing has become increasingly important for detecting, monitoring, and understanding environmental changes over vast and remote regions. This paper provides an overview of recent achievements, challenges, and opportunities for land remote sensing of cold regions by (a) summarizing the physical principles and methods in remote sensing of selected key variables related to ice, snow, permafrost, water bodies, and vegetation; (b) highlighting recent environmental nonstationarity occurring in the Arctic, Tibetan Plateau, and Antarctica as detected from satellite observations; (c) discussing the limits of available remote sensing data and approaches for regional monitoring; and (d) exploring new opportunities from next-generation satellite missions and emerging methods for accurate, timely, and multi-scale mapping of cold regions.

TI  - Context-Enabled Extraction of Large-Scale Urban Functional Zones from Very-High-Resolution Images: A Multiscale Segmentation Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban functional-zone (UFZ) analysis has been widely used in many applications, including urban environment evaluation, and urban planning and management. How to extract UFZs' spatial units which delineates UFZs' boundaries is fundamental to urban applications, but it is still unresolved. In this study, an automatic, context-enabled multiscale image segmentation method is proposed for extracting spatial units of UFZs from very-high-resolution satellite images. First, a window independent context feature is calculated to measure context information in the form of geographic nearest-neighbor distance from a pixel to different image classes. Second, a scale-adaptive approach is proposed to determine appropriate scales for each UFZ in terms of its context information and generate the initial UFZs. Finally, the graph cuts algorithm is improved to optimize the initial UFZs. Two datasets including WorldView-2 image in Beijing and GaoFen-2 image in Nanchang are used to evaluate the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method can generate better results from very-high-resolution satellite images than widely used approaches like image tiles and road blocks in representing UFZs. In addition, the proposed method outperforms existing methods in both segmentation quality and running time. Therefore, the proposed method appears to be promising and practical for segmenting large-scale UFZs.

TI  - Drought hazard in Kazakhstan in 2000-2016: a remote sensing perspective
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts have significant negative impacts on livelihoods and economy of Kazakhstan. In this study, we assessed and characterized drought hazard events in Kazakhstan using satellite Remote Sensing time series for the period between 2000 and 2016. First, we calculated Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Standardized Enhanced Vegetation Index anomalies (Z(EVI)) based on 250m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series. Second, we assessed vegetation cover changes for the observation period. Third, we analyzed different characteristics of the drought hazard as well as spatial distribution of the drought-affected areas within the country. The results confirmed that drought was one of the environmental challenges for Kazakhstan in 2000-2016. The obtained maps showed that drought hazard conditions were observed every year, though the areal coverage of the drought conditions largely varied between the analyzed years. The calculated drought indices indicated that in years 2000, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014, more than 50% of the area of the country were affected by drought conditions of different severity with the largest droughts in terms of the areal spread occurring in 2012 and 2014. We concluded that the pre-requisite of successful implementation of drought hazard and risk mitigation strategies is availability of spatially explicit, timely, and reliable information on drought hazard. This suggests the necessity of incorporation of remote sensing-based drought information, as was demonstrated in this paper, in the national drought monitoring system of Kazakhstan.

TI  - Precise and Automatic 3-D Absolute Geolocation of Targets Using Only Two Long-Aperture SAR Acquisitions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with precise absolute geolocation of point targets by means of a pair of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions, acquired from a satellite. Even though a single SAR image is a 2-D projection of the backscatter, some 3-D information can be extracted from a defocussing analysis, depending on the resolution, thanks to orbital curvature. A second acquisition, observing the same scene under a different look angle, adds stereogrammetric capability and can achieve geolocation accuracy at decimeter level. However, for the stereogrammetric analysis to work, it is necessary to match targets correctly in the two images. This task is particularly difficult if it has to be automatic and targets are dense. Unfortunately, the defocussing-based geolocation is not sufficient for reliable target matching: the limiting factor is the unknown tropospheric delay that can cause geolocation errors of several meters in the elevation direction. However, observing that the tropospheric phase screen displays a low-pass character, this paper shows how to identify statistically the local atmospheric disturbances, therefore dramatically improving the score of successful matching. All steps involved exploit peculiar radar image characteristics and, thanks to this, avoid generic point cloud matching algorithms. The proposed algorithm is shown at work on a pair of TerraSAR-X staring spotlight images.

TI  - Mapping Physiognomic Types of Indigenous Forest using Space-Borne SAR, Optical Imagery and Air-borne LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous forests cover 24% of New Zealand and provide valuable ecosystem services. However, a national map of forest types, that is, physiognomic types, which would benefit conservation management, does not currently exist at an appropriate level of detail. While traditional forest classification approaches from remote sensing data are based on spectral information alone, the joint use of space-based optical imagery and structural information from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and canopy metrics from air-borne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) facilitates more detailed and accurate classifications of forest structure. We present a support vector machine (SVM) classification using data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1 and 2 missions, Advanced Land Orbiting Satellite (ALOS) PALSAR, and airborne LiDAR to produce a regional map of physiognomic types of indigenous forest. A five-fold cross-validation (repeated 100 times) of ground data showed that the highest classification accuracy of 80.5% is achieved for bands 2, 3, 4, 8, 11, and 12 from Sentinel-2, the ratio of bands VH (vertical transmit and horizontal receive) and VV (vertical transmit and vertical receive) from Sentinel-1, and mean canopy height and 97th percentile canopy height from LiDAR. The classification based on optical bands alone was 72.7% accurate and the addition of structural metrics from SAR and LiDAR increased accuracy by 7.4%. The classification accuracy is sufficient for many management applications for indigenous forest, including biodiversity management, carbon inventory, pest control, ungulate management, and disease management.

TI  - Deep Learning for Soil and Crop Segmentation from Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most challenging problems in precision agriculture is to correctly identify and separate crops from the soil. Current precision farming algorithms based on artificially intelligent networks use multi-spectral or hyper-spectral data to derive radiometric indices that guide the operational management of agricultural complexes. Deep learning applications using these big data require sensitive filtering of raw data to effectively drive their hidden layer neural network architectures. Threshold techniques based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or other similar metrics are generally used to simplify the development and training of deep learning neural networks. They have the advantage of being natural transformations of hyper-spectral or multi-spectral images that filter the data stream into a neural network, while reducing training requirements and increasing system classification performance. In this paper, to calculate a detailed crop/soil segmentation based on high resolution Digital Surface Model (DSM) data, we propose the redefinition of the radiometric index using a directional mathematical filter. To further refine the analysis, we feed this new radiometric index image of about 3500 x 4500 pixels into a relatively small Convolution Neural Network (CNN) designed for general image pattern recognition at 28 x 28 pixels to evaluate and resolve the vegetation correctly. We show that the result of applying a DSM filter to the NDVI radiometric index before feeding it into a Convolutional Neural Network can potentially improve crop separation hit rate by 65%.

TI  - Comparison of two remote sensing models for estimating evapotranspiration: algorithm evaluation and application in seasonally arid ecosystems in South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing tools are becoming increasingly important for providing spatial information on water use by different ecosystems. Despite significant advances in remote sensing based evapotranspiration (ET) models in recent years, important information gaps still exist on the accuracy of the models particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. In this study, we evaluated the Penman-Monteith based MOD16 and the modified Priestley-Taylor (PT-JPL) models at the daily time step against three measured ET datasets. We used data from two summer and one winter rainfall sites in South Africa. One site was dominated by native broad leaf and the other by fine leafed deciduous savanna tree species and C-4 grasses. The third site was in the winter rainfall Cape region and had shrubby fynbos vegetation. Actual ET was measured using open-path eddy covariance systems at the summer rainfall sites while a surface energy balance system utilizing the large aperture boundary layer scintillometer was used in the Cape. Model performance varied between sites and between years with the worst estimates (R(2)0.80 mm/d) observed during years with prolonged mid-summer dry spells in the summer rainfall areas. Sensitivity tests on MOD16 showed that the leaf area index, surface conductance and radiation budget parameters had the largest effect on simulated ET. MOD16 ET predictions were improved by: (1) reformulating the emissivity expressions in the net radiation equation; (2) incorporating representative surface conductance values; and (3) including a soil moisture stress function in the transpiration sub-model. Implementing these changes increased the accuracy of MOD16 daily ET predictions at all sites. However, similar adjustments to the PT-JPL model yielded minimal improvements. We conclude that the MOD16 ET model has the potential to accurately predict water use in arid environments provided soil water stress and accurate biome-specific parameters are incorporated.

TI  - Phytoplankton Diversity in the Mediterranean Sea From Satellite Data Using Self-Organizing Maps
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new method to identify phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) in the Mediterranean Sea from ocean color data (GlobColour data in the present study) and AVHRR sea surface temperature. The principle of the method is constituted by two very fine clustering algorithms, one mapping the relationship between the satellite data and the pigments and the other between the pigments and the PFTs. The clustering algorithms are constituted of two efficient self-organizing maps, which are neural network classifiers. We were able to identify and estimate the percentage of six PFTs: haptophytes, chlorophytes, cryptophytes, Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus, and diatoms. We found that these PFTs present a peculiar variability due to the complex physical and biogeochemical characteristics of the Mediterranean Sea: Haptophytes and chlorophytes dominate during winter and mainly in the western Mediterranean basin, while Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus dominate during summer. The dominance of diatoms was mainly observed in spring in the Balearic Sea in response to deep water convection phenomena and near the coastline and estuaries due to important continental inputs. Cryptophytes present a weak concentration in the Aegean Sea in autumn. The validation tests performed on in situ matchups showed satisfying results and proved the ability of the method to reconstruct efficiently the spatiotemporal patterns of phytoplankton groups in the Mediterranean Sea. The method can easily be applied to other oceanic regions.Plain Language Summary The identification and spatiotemporal distribution of phytoplankton assemblages give powerful insights on the dynamics of the marine food web and the ocean role in climate regulation in the context of the global change. A new method to identify phytoplankton functional types from satellite observations has been developed and applied in the Mediterranean Sea. It is based on artificial intelligence clustering, the so-called self-organizing maps. The method was able to differentiate multiple phytoplankton assemblages and to provide their different pigment compositions. This approach had been validated successfully with in situ data sets and the spatiotemporal variability of the phytoplankton functional types showed a significant coherence. The method is very general and can be applied to other regions.

TI  - Mapping black ash dominated stands using geospatial and forest inventory data in northern Minnesota, USA
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerald ash borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, 1888) has been a persistent disturbance for ash forests in the United States since 2002. Of particular concern is the impact that EAB will have on the ecosystem functioning of wetlands dominated by black ash (Fraxinus nigra Marsh.). In preparation, forest managers need reliable and complete maps of black ash dominated stands. Traditionally, forest survey data from the United States Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program have provided rigorous measures of tree species at large spatial extents but are limited when providing estimates for smaller management units (e.g., stands). Fortunately, geospatial data can extend forest survey information by generating predictions of forest attributes at scales finer than those of the FIA sampling grid. In this study, geospatial data were integrated with FIA data in a randomForest model to estimate and map black ash dominated stands in northern Minnesota in the United States. The model produced low error rates (overall error = 14.5%; area under the curve (AUC) = 0.92) and was strongly informed by predictors from soil saturation and phenology. These results improve upon FIA-based spatial estimates at national extents by providing forest managers with accurate, fine-scale maps (30 m spatial resolution) of black ash stand dominance that could ultimately support landscape-level EAB risk and vulnerability assessments.

TI  - A statewide urban tree canopy mapping method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Maps of urban tree canopy are essential to estimate the magnitude and spatial distribution of ecosystem services, and to determine who benefits from them. Our objective was to develop a repeatable method to map urban tree canopy cover for the state of Wisconsin. We compared two types of imagery (pan-sharpened 1.5 m SPOT-6 and 1 m NAIP aerial photography), three classification algorithms, seven segment sizes ranging from single pixels to 105 m(2), three levels of compactness for each segment size, and sixteen subsets of features. NAIP outperformed SPOT. On average across classification algorithms there were no significant differences in map agreement. Pixel-based maps with convolution features performed as well as the best segment-based maps. The best segment size tested was 60 m(2) on average, but there was also a local maximum around 15 m(2), which suggests a large range of possible segment sizes must be tested to find the best. The model chosen for application to the whole state was a pixel-level Random Forest classifier with 160 features, and the final state-wide map has five classes: tree/woody vegetation, grass/herbaceous vegetation, impervious surfaces/bare soil, water, and non-forested wetland. Overall accuracy for our state-wide map at the pixel-scale was 79.3% (95% CI: 77.5-81%). Errors occurred due to meter-scale heterogeneity in the urban environment which increases the errors due to spatial misregistration and the number of difficult-to-classify mixed and edge pixels. At larger management level scales, mean absolute error (MAE) decreases to about 10% at the Landsat pixel scale and about 6% at the scale of a city block. Our work is comparable to past efforts to map urban tree canopy, and the open source software and use of imagery that is freely available for all cities in the contiguous US make it broadly applicable.

TI  - Spatial structure and temporal variability of a surface urban heat island in cold continental climate
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Warm urban climate anomalies are a challenging problem for city's economy and ecology. This problem is even more pressing in boreal environment with its sensitive ecosystems and considerable anthropogenic urban heat flux. The boreal regions of Eurasia witness both rapid urbanization and accelerated regional warming in the twenty-first century. Still, local climate of boreal cities is only fragmentary studied. There were no studies addressing spatial and temporal variability of urban temperature anomalies in Eurasian cities with cold continental climate. There were many indirect reports indicating large temperature anomalies and longer growing season in boreal cities. This study considered a land surface temperature (LST) anomaly, frequently referred to as a surface urban heat island (SUHI), in a typical young mid-size boreal city of Nefteyugansk. This city exemplifies urban planning and energy use patterns of a pleiad of cities in this oil and gas region of northern West Siberia. The study is based on LST products from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) onboard of the Terra and Aqua satellite platforms. The MODIS data for 14years (2001-2015) were processed to reveal geographical extent and diurnal variations of the SUHI in summer (June, July, August) and winter (December, January, February) seasons. The study found that the mean annual SUHI has higher LST than the surrounding natural background by +2.4K. Considering the meridional temperature gradient in this region, such a strong SUHI makes the urban climate similar to climate found 600km south of the city. The diurnal mean summer (+2.1K) and winter (+2.4K) SUHI intensities are rather similar in Nefteyugansk. The daytime (+2.1K) and nighttime (+2.5K) SUHI intensities are also similar in wintertime. In summertime, however, the daytime SUHI intensity (+3.3K) is significantly larger than that in nighttime (+1.0K). There is also larger interannual variability of the SUHI in the summer season, especially in nighttime. The SUHI statistics in Nefteyugansk discerns this cold continental city from previously studied cities in the temperate climate zone. Heating of apartment and industrial buildings maintains a large anthropogenic heat flux in the city (estimated to be on average of 15-20Wm(-2)) and therefore supports the persistent winter SUHI. Weak turbulent mixing in the stably stratified lower atmosphere traps the heat in the urbanized area. This study found that the SUHI footprint in Nefteyugansk is considerably (two to three times) larger than the area of the city proper itself.

TI  - Mapping parasite transmission risk from white-tailed deer to a declining moose population
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - White-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus) are the definitive hosts of meningeal worm (Parelaphostrongylus tenuis) and liver fluke (Fascioloides magna); two parasites implicated in the decline of moose populations (Alces alces) in northern USA. Understanding which areas pose transmission risk may contribute to effective mitigation of these parasites in imperiled moose populations. Our objective was to predict areas of potential P. tenuis and F. magna transmission risk in terms of landscape features and deer density. Analyses were based on biogeographic and ecological factors related to both parasites. Using ecological niche modeling tools, remote sensing satellite data, field sampling, and estimated densities of WTD in Minnesota, we characterized current suitable environmental conditions for F. magna and P. tenuis across the historical range of moose in the state and identified potential areas for the occurrence of these parasites in unsampled areas. Our results help elucidate risky landscapes for F. magna and P. tenuis transmission by identifying geographic locations where WTD occur at high densities and with the landscape features suitable for the parasites. High-risk areas identified by our models may guide future surveillance, conservation, and management plans by identifying hotspots of potential infection of these parasites from WTD to moose populations. Our study shows the applicability of ecological niche modeling tools for investigating disease transmission risks of complex parasite systems for conservation purposes.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Analysis in Colorectal Cancer Patients Using One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification in Combination With Fluorescence and Indocyanine Green
T2  - ANNALS OF COLOPROCTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Analysis of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients was proposed for more accurate staging and tailored lymphadenectomy. The aim of this study was to assess the ability to predict lymph node (LN) involvement through analysis of the SLN with a one-step nucleic acid (OSNA) technique in combination with peritumoral injection of indocyanine green (ICG) and near-infrared (NIR) lymphangiography in CRC patients.Methods: A total of 34 patients were enrolled. Overall, 51 LNs were analyzed with OSNA. LNs of 17 patients (50%) were examined simultaneously with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and OSNA.Results: SLN analysis of 17 patients examined with H&E and OSNA revealed that OSNA had a higher sensitivity (1 vs. 0.55), higher negative predictive value (1 vs. 0.66) and higher accuracy (100% vs. 76.4%) in predicting LN involvement. Overall, OSNA showed a sensitivity of 0.69, specificity of 1, accuracy of 88.2%, and stage migration of 8.8%. Compared to those who were OSNA (-), OSNA (+) patients had a greater number of LN metastases (4.8 vs. 0.16, P = 0.04), higher G3 rate (44.4% vs. 4%, P = 0.01), more advanced stage of disease (stage III: 77.8% vs. 16%; P = 0.00) and were more rapidly subjected to adjuvant chemotherapy (39.1 days vs. 50.2 days, P = 0.01).Conclusion: SLN analysis with OSNA in combination with ICG-NIR lymphangiography is feasible and can detect LN involvement in CRC patients. Furthermore, it allows for more accurate staging reducing the delay between surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - Estimating Forest Volume and Biomass and Their Changes Using Random Forests and Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the popularity of random forests (RF) as a prediction algorithm, methods for constructing confidence intervals for population means using this technique are still only sparsely reported. For two regional study areas (Spain and Norway) RF was used to predict forest volume or aboveground biomass using remotely sensed auxiliary data obtained from multiple sensors. Additionally, the changes per unit area of these forest attributes were estimated using indirect and direct methods. Multiple inferential frameworks have attracted increased recent attention for estimating the variances required for confidence intervals. For this study, three different statistical frameworks, design-based expansion, model-assisted and model-based estimators, were used for estimating population parameters and their variances. Pairs and wild bootstrapping approaches at different levels were compared for estimating the variances of the model-based estimates of the population means, as well as for mapping the uncertainty of the change predictions. The RF models accurately represented the relationship between the response and remotely sensed predictor variables, resulting in increased precision for estimates of the population means relative to design-based expansion estimates. Standard errors based on pairs bootstrapping within or internal to RF were considerably larger than standard errors based on both pairs and wild external bootstrapping of the entire RF algorithm. Pairs and wild external bootstrapping produced similar standard errors, but wild bootstrapping better mimicked the original structure of the sample data and better preserved the ranges of the predictor variables.

TI  - Arctic climate and snow cover trends - Comparing Global Circulation Models with remote sensing observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the impact of climate change on snow resources in the Arctic. Climate was classified for the period 1950-2100 according to the Koppen-Geiger (KG) classification system using the ensemble average of NASA-NEX CMIP5 projections for the rcp 4.5 scenario. Snow Cover Frequency (SCF) in days/year was calculated from the MODIS10A1 snow product and the SCF trends were calculated across the Arctic for the MODIS period (2001-2016). Ten pollution monitoring areas in the Arctic lowlands, especially vulnerable to climate change impacts, were selected for analyzing the climate and snow regimes. In seven of the ten areas we observed significant changes in the climate during the MODIS period and these same areas also showed the largest SCF trends. At lower latitudes we observed decreasing SCF, while further north, by the shores of the Arctic seas, SCF has increased. Averaged across the Arctic we observed a 0.91 days/year decrease in SCF. Our results show that across the Arctic warmer climate classes have and will continue to replace polar tundra and cold summer regions. Based on the CMIP5 simulations, we expect the coverage of the currently dominant Arctic climate class, Cold climate with cold summers and no dry season (Dfc), to decline by about 40% by 2100 and be replaced by climate classes associated with warm (Dfb, Dsb, Dwb) and hot (Dfa, Dsa, Dwa) summers.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increases in the concentrated amounts of ozone (O-3) on the earth's surface have become a major matter of concern for human health and may have dire consequences. The purpose of this study is to predict the ozone concentration and demonstrate its spatio-temporal changes in Tehran. A large amount on meteorology, concentration of other pollutants, traffic information, industrial agglomeration and remote sensing data were used for this purpose. Study parameters on ozone concentrations were initially analyzed in order to find meaningful relationships between the study parameters and ozone concentrations. Ozone concentration was then predicted using multivariate linear regression and spatio-temporal changes of ozone concentration were finally investigated. Results indicated that the proposed regression model was able to account for 89 percent of changes in 2015. Spatio-temporal analysis showed that the best performance of the model, in regards to ozone concentration, occurred in autumn (R-2 = 0.84) at Park Rose (R-2 = 0.89). Furthermore, the spatial distribution of estimated ozone concentrations at the park were consistent with the actual amounts observed. Finally, in accordance with spatial dispersion of ozone concentrations throughout the 22 districts of Tehran, areas 8, 13, and 20, located in the eastern and southern parts of Tehran were indicated as areas with the highest ozone concentration.

TI  - Oil Rig Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network on Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in deep learning for automatic target recognition have inspired studies for maritime surveillance with synthetic aperture radar (SAR). In this context, oil rigs monitoring is of particular interest. There are offshore platforms of different types and sizes which poses challenges for classification methods. In this letter, we compare the recognition of oil rigs on Sentinel-1 SAR images, discriminating them from false alarms, through a convolutional neural network with a different number of layers named models VGG-16 and VGG-19. We used the Sentinel-1 GRD product, which has a resolution of about 20 m, with VV and VH channel image data sets separated to observe polarization influences on target recognition. The experiments show that the VH polarization image embedding contributes with the best classification values, with the mean global accuracy of fifty random sampling tests equal to 86.4% and 84.1% using the VGG-16 and VGG-19 architectures, respectively, to extract features and feed a logistic regression classifier method. Results suggest that these approaches are a useful alternative for maritime surveillance employing SAR images of medium resolution and large swaths. Furthermore, the database balancing for wind conditions did not provide significant contributions to the accuracy of classification algorithms.

TI  - Spatial characteristics of island urban expansion and landscape ecological evolution: a case of the Zhoushan Island
T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zhoushan Island was selected as the study area in this paper. Five landscape types were gained from seven Landsat series remote sensing images from 1985 to 2015. Four spatial analysis indicators were introduced to analyze the urban expansion characteristics of orientation, intensity, speed and the characteristics of landscape changing. Then, the natural factors were analyzed in method of spatial analysis and socioeconomic factors were analyzed in method of correlation analysis, which all have relevance to urban expansion. The results show that: (1) The urban expansion of the Zhoushan Island present the spatial characteristic of beaded shape with the most significant orientation in fourth quadrant. (2) There are three phases in urban expansion: the phase of urban birth (1985-1995), the phase of urban growth (1995-2010) and the phase of urban maturity (2010 -2015). (3) In the phase of urban birth, the orientation of urban expansion is the regional area of forest, which leads a 10.33 km(2) decreasing in forests area. In the phase of urban growth, the orientation of urban expansion is the regional area of offshore ocean. The offshore ocean has been converted into cultivated land and construction land with the area of 25.10 km(2). In the phase of urban maturity, the orientations of urban expansion are on both offshore ocean and to the central forest region, which make the pressure on both land and ocean. (4) The region of urban expansion are mainly located in valleys, coastal plains and reclamation areas, in which elevation less than 20 m and slope less than 10 degrees. At the same time, the population, real estate investment, GDP and total length of road network have significant correlation with urban expansion.

TI  - Marine Floating Raft Aquaculture Detection of GF-3 PolSAR Images Based on Collective Multikernel Fuzzy Clustering
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine floating raft aquaculture (MFRA) is a primary human activity on oceanic resources utilization and development, the physical structure of which is so particular that conventional optical remote sensing images cannot discover thoroughly. GaoFen-3 (GF-3), as the first launched full polarimetric synthetic aperture radar satellite of China, can offer a unique opportunity to performlong-term precise monitoring of the nearshore MFRA. In this paper, GF-3 product description is discussed to choose applicable modes to analyze MFRA imaging characters. Moreover, the structure of MFRA is decomposed into different parts to reveal its specific polarimetric scattering mechanism for the first time via the electromagnetic wave propagation theory. Based on the above-mentioned physical analysis, appropriate target decomposition methods are selected to combine other source features of MFRA to integrate into initial distinct features. After that, a novel unsupervised collective multikernel fuzzy C-means (CMK-FCM) algorithm with collective neurodynamic optimization approach is proposed to exploit these multisource features of MFRA. The effective feature combination based on proposed CMKFCM can take full advantage of various features through establishing a unified framework, which can optimize local and global parameters hierarchically and improve the entire clustering accuracy in the end. The experiments substantiate the efficacy and superiority of GF-3 MFRA detection based on our proposed algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches.

TI  - Ocean Surface Wind Speed Retrieval Using Simulated RADARSAT Constellation Mission Compact Polarimetry SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the use of C-band RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for retrieval of ocean surface wind speeds by using four new channels (right circular transmit, vertical receive (RV); right circular transmit, horizontal receive (RH); right circular transmit, left circular transmit (RL); and right circular transmit, right circular receive (RR)) in compact polarimetry (CP) mode. Using 256 buoy measurements collocated with RADARSAT-2 fine beam quad-polarized scenes, RCM CP data was simulated using a CP simulator. Provided that the relative wind direction is known, our results demonstrate that wind speed can be retrieved from RV, RH and RL polarization channels using existing C-band model (CMOD) geophysical model function (GMF) and polarization ratio (PR) models. Simulated RR-polarized radar returns have a strong linear relationship with speed and are less sensitive to relative wind direction and incidence angle. Therefore, a model is proposed for the RR-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Our results show that the proposed model can provide an efficient methodology for wind speed retrieval.

TI  - Detection of Building Shadow in Remote Sensing Imagery of Urban Areas With Fine Spatial Resolution Based on Saturation and Near-Infrared Information
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the satellite orbit height and solar elevation angle, remote sensing imagery of urban areas with fine spatial resolution inevitably contains shadows cast by buildings, which thus decreases the accuracy of target recognition and information extraction. This paper proposes a new normalized-difference shadow detection index based on the saturation and near-infrared information of imagery to detect building shadows. The method was validated using typical images of urban areas from the WorldView-2, TripleSat-2, and RapidEye satellites and compared with the C3 component, multispectral band shadow detection, principal component analysis shadow detection (PCAS), normalized-difference umbra index, and GeoEye-1 shadow detection index methods. The results indicated that the proposed method effectively distinguishes building shadows from other dark ground objects and provides higher detection accuracy. The recall rate, precision, and F1 score exceeded 85%, 80%, and 85%, respectively, and their average values for four representative images were 91%, 89%, and 90%, respectively. Our method provides greater usability and better performance in the detection of building shadows in remote sensing imagery with fine spatial resolution.

TI  - Differentiating forest types using TerraSAR-X spotlight images based on inferential statistics and multivariate analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the potential of applying statistical analysis tests, for example, two sample Z-test and the Factor Analysis (FA) tool, on the TerraSAR-X backscattering coefficient, for distinguishing between different types of forests and detecting changes in distribution and extent of them. Two sample Z-test is an inferential statistical test that determines whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means in the data from two independent groups. FA is a multivariate analysis that can examine the structure or relationship between variables. Twelve pilot plots for forests of 17 ha were surveyed in a water protection catchment near Hanover, Germany. The forest types were deciduous, coniferous, and mixed. In order to sustain groundwater quality, deciduous trees were planted over a period of several years to gradually replace the coniferous trees in the catchment area. Regular forest observations were required to ensure that the percentages of deciduous and mixed forests in this catchment area were increasing relative to coniferous forests. Fourteen dual-co-polarized TerraSAR-X (HH/VV) images were used to monitor the forests in the period from March 2008 to January 2009. The values of the backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) for the test plots were statistically analyzed using the two sample Z-test and the Factor Analysis tools.The study showed that Factor analysis tools succeeded in differentiating between the coniferous forest and both the deciduous forest and the mixed forest, but failed to discriminate between the deciduous and the mixed forest. Only one factor was extracted for each sample plot of the coniferous forest with approximately equal loadings during the whole acquisition period from March 2008 to January 2009. However, two factors were extracted for each deciduous or mixed forest sample plot, where one factor had high loadings during the leaf-on period from May to October, and the other one had high loadings during the leaf-off period from November to April. Furthermore, the research revealed that the two sample Z-test differentiated the deciduous and mixed forests from the coniferous forest, and discriminated between deciduous forest and mixed forest. Statistically significant differences were observed between the mean backscatter values of the HH-polarized acquisitions for the deciduous forest and the mixed forest during the leaf-off period from November to April, but no statistically significant difference was found during the leaf-on period from May to October. Moreover, plot samples for the deciduous forest had slightly higher mean backscattering coefficients than those for the mixed forest during the leaf-off period.Applying the Factor Analysis and the two sample Z-test on the backscattering coefficient of multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data facilitates distinction of forest types, tracks changes in forest patterns, and estimates the extent of environmental disasters in forest regions. This accomplishes sustainable forest management, which can play an important role not only in preserving groundwater quality but also in achieving climate change adaptation goals.

TI  - Assessing long-term urban surface water changes using multi-year satellite images: A tale of two cities, Dhaka and Hong Kong
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is a fundamental component of an urban environment. Management of water resources is important to facilitate a liveable environment and urban sustainability. Several factors affect water resources, including urbanization, climate change and seasons. Moreover, the nature of urban expansion and unsustainable water management practices have been associated with water scarcity, loss of biodiversity and increase of flood risk. Knowledge of the changes in urban surface water in relation to changes in seasons, land covers, anthropogenic activities, and topographical characteristics are important for managing watersheds and urban planning, and developing adaptation strategies to address environmental challenges posed by urbanization. However, existing studies rarely consider all the above factors when monitoring surface water changes in the urban environment. To address this problem, this study uses satellite images from multiple seasons and years, and assess the changes in surface water in relation to changes of several important factors, e.g., seasons, urbanization, land cover and topography. Moreover, this study applies advanced geostatistical tools to assess the local relationship between changes in surface water and the driving factors, and compares the findings in two cities Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Hong Kong with a large contrast in many aspects. First, seasonal influence in the distribution of water area is evaluated. Second, land cover classifications are assigned, and then the contingency matrix and decadal maps are formulated to investigate and evaluate the influence of urbanization on the occurrence and transitions in surface water. Third, an advanced geostatistical regression model is used to investigate the spatially varying relationships for change in surface water in relation to change in other land covers and topography. The investigations confirm that the temporal and seasonal variation, and urbanization induced land cover changes largely affect surface water. In addition, topography influences the nature of the city's expansion, which in turn entails the changes in surface water. The flat terrain of Dhaka facilitates the easy invasion of water bodies and horizontal expansion, in contrast, the steep terrain of Hong Kong prohibits horizontal expansion thus it's surface water is more stable than Dhaka.

TI  - Feminist legal geographies of intimate-image sexual abuse: Using copyright logic to combat the unauthorized distribution of celebrity intimate images in cyberspaces
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Women's rights are often curtailed online due to the pervasive internet atmosphere of cybermisogyny. Extreme examples include 'image-based sexual abuse', a term which encompasses the non-consensual creation and/or distribution of private sexual images. The harms attached to this phenomenon are well documented. In this paper, we explore how copyright logic, despite its male-centric and property oriented worldview, presents one legal solution to this problem. We assert that Digital Millennium Copyright Act Takedown Notices, a copyright mechanism that notifies websites they are hosting infringing content and requires the prompt removal of the content, represents a novel legal mechanism to force websites to remove image-based sexual abuse from women's online spaces. By using critical discourse analysis to review how Digital Millennium Copyright Act Takedown Notices attempt to provide solutions to the socio-spatial problem of image-based sexual abuse, we argue that copyright can subvert its current leanings to return to its original purpose: supporting creativity. Supporting creativity also helps to protect against the reproduction of gendered harms, from the real world to virtual spaces. This theorization represents not just legal geography but a feminist legal geography, in that it recognizes the internet should be a safe and legal space for women. In endorsing a pragmatic legal solution for women to regulate the sexually violent and nonconsensual distribution of their intimate images online, copyright is one mechanism that affirms women's right to cyberspaces.

TI  - Towards Automated Ship Detection and Category Recognition from High-Resolution Aerial Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship category classification in high-resolution aerial images has attracted great interest in applications such as maritime security, naval construction, and port management. However, the applications of previous methods were mainly limited by the following issues: (i) The existing ship category classification methods were mainly to classify on accurately-cropped image patches. This is unsatisfactory for the results of the existing methods in practical applications, because the location of the ship in the patch obtained by the object detection varies greatly. (ii) The factors such as target scale variations and class imbalance have a great influence on the performance of ship category classification. Aiming at the issues above, we propose a novel ship detection and category classification framework. The category classification is based on accurate location. The detection network can generate more precise rotated bounding boxes in large-scale aerial images by introducing a novel Sequence Local Context (SLC) module. Besides, three different ship category classification networks are proposed to eliminate the effect of scale variations, and the Spatial Transform Crop (STC) operation is used to get aligned image patches. Whatever the problem of insufficient samples or class imbalance have, the Proposals Simulation Generator (PSG) is considered to handle this properly. Most remarkably, the state-of-the-art performance of our framework is demonstrated by experiments based on the 19-class ship dataset HRSC2016 and our multiclass warship dataset.

TI  - Flooded-area satellite monitoring within a Ramsar wetland Nature Reserve in Argentina
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems is one of the goals to be achieved by the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this framework and requested by government Argentine institutions concerned with water, biodiversity and territorial management, this study analyzes the evolution of the flooded area within the Dulce River wetlands and Mar Chiquita Lake Nature Reserve (centered around 30.6 degrees S, 62.6 degrees W, 70m above sea level) in Argentina since 2003, when the historical maximum extent was reached, until 2017. The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was calculated on atmospherically corrected NASA Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (L5-TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (L8-OLI) reflectance data over two-scene cloudless-sky mosaics to cover the whole Reserve. Mixed-water pixels constituted an important fraction of the total-water covered area, particularly during years of minimum water level in Mar Chiquita Lake. So, MNDWI values were analyzed along transects crossing two stable regional water bodies to determine precise thresholds for detection of non-water (MNDWI < -0.15 for L5-TM, MNDWI < -0.35 for L8-OLI), mixedwater (-0.15 < MNDWI < 0.4 for L5-TM, -0.35 < MNDWI < 0.5 for L8-OLI) and open-water (0.4 < MNDWI for L5-TM, 0.5 < MNDWI for L8-OLI) pixels. A higher spatial resolution image, SPOT5-HGR2, was used to validate the classification method. A confusion matrix was built which resulted in an overall accuracy of 99.2% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.98. In-situ Geo-referenced photographic registers were also taken simultaneously to a Landsat 8 overpass to confirm the classification thresholds. The analysis of simulated MNDWI response, by using the assumption of the linear mixture model, showed that mixed pixels should present from 9% to 76% of detectable open-water area. Maximum total flooded area extensions of about 3600 km(2) by 2003-2005 and a minimum one of 2050 km(2) by the end of 2011 were established, followed by a recent trend to the recovering with a total flooded area of about 3400 km(2) in the period 2015-2017. Open-water covered area follows closely the behavior of in-situ water level measurements of Mar Chiquita Lake, showing a maximum in year 2003 and a minimum towards the end of 2013, in a significant linear relation from which a topographical slope of the terrain of about 0.012% is inferred that agrees with previous bathymetric studies. Results show the powerful complement between a reliable water satellite monitoring tool and locally-measured parameters in so dynamic wetland regions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal characterization of vegetation typologies in degraded caatinga environment: quantification by biophysical variables
T2  - ATELIE GEOGRAFICO
M3  - Article
AB  - The climatic characteristics of the semiarid region strongly influence the dynamics of the vegetation cover and soil, as well as environmental variables such as albedo and vegetation indices, among others. Researches in the semiarid region of Paraiba state have been carried out applying methodologies to analyze these variables, mainly based on orbital data that have subsidized the monitoring of the different landscapes in the caatinga biome. Thus, this paper aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution and the quantification of surface albedo and SAVI vegetation index in different caatinga vegetation typologies in the Experimental Basin of Sao Joao do Cariri, Paraiba state. TM/Landsat-5 sensor images were used. The results showed that the albedo estimate was influenced by the spatial distribution of the vegetation typologies, which evidenced the level of land degradation, while the values obtained with the SAVI estimate did not present the pattern generally defined for the reflectance of the vegetation in the rainy or dry seasons in the study area.

TI  - Combining remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration and GIS analysis for groundwater level modeling
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a combination of large-scale spatially remote-sensed actual evapotranspiration and geographical information systems of surface runoff to estimate groundwater recharge potential, by water balance, to model groundwater level. We selected an area nearby the city of aguas de Santa Barbara, central-western part of SAo Paulo State, Brazil to be analyzed between 2014 and 2018, during recent El Nino-Southern Oscillation most active period (2016/2017) and verify its posteriori effects on vegetation (until early 2018). The Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving (SAFER), with biweekly MODIS and seasonal Sentinel-2 imagery, and the rational method for runoff modeling were applied, which was applied in a daily-basis hydrological model, which is the main novelty of this report. The average annual groundwater recharge potential for each of the land uses (pasture, sugarcane crop, silviculture, and forest) varied between 15 and 50% of the rainfall. Silviculture showed higher evapotranspirations rates than forest and sugarcane crops. Groundwater levels measured at 46 monitoring wells were analyzed to obtain enough data to create the hydrographs required for the validation. 36 shallow wells (which reached depths smaller than 3m) had the best results (R-2>0.92), where the root mean squared absolute error (RMSE) term appeared to be less than 20% of the mean groundwater level, indicating that it has a faster response to remote-sensed actual evapotranspiration and that the water balance is sufficiently understood for policy and decision making. The results of this study lead to the conclusion that including spatiotemporal thermal and soil moisture conditions by remote-sensing tools in the evapotranspiration account improved the modeling of groundwater levels for shallow wells at daily basis.

TI  - Analysis of spatial and temporal variability of aerosol optical depth over China using MODIS combined Dark Target and Deep Blue product
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reviews spatial and temporal variability of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550nm, obtained with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Terra) Collection 6.1 aerosol products with use of combined Dark Target and Deep Blue algorithm. Data was analyzed for 18-year period from 2000 to 2017 over the territory of the whole continental China, covering the largest cities as well as various ecological and geographical regions. Spatial distribution of AOD has distinct geographical differences with gradual decrease from the east to the west of the country. The lowest values (up to 0.25) of annual mean AOD at 550nm occur in sparsely populated areas on the Tibetan Plateau and in the north forest ecosystems in the north-eastern part of China. Areas of desert and semidesert landscapes of Northwest China are characterized by high concentrations of naturally occurring aerosols with moderate values of AOD (0.4-0.7). The most populous regions (Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, North China Plain, and Sichuan Basin) with the highest density of agricultural and industrial activity are characterized with maximum values of AOD (over 0.7). Seasonal variation of aerosols in the most regions of China has maximum AODs in spring or summer and minimum in autumn or winter. angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE), being 0.31-1.7 for the most part of China, was used to detect the size of aerosol particles, with the lowest values (0.31-0.84) in desert north and north-west regions of the country, and the higher values in the south (1.3-1.7). Comparison of results, obtained with MODIS Terra and AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) at 550nm, demonstrate a high interrelation (r=0.8949), where 68.3% fall within the range of expected errors, set by MODIS over the land (+/- 0.05 +/- 0.15xAOD). The conducted Pearson's correlation analysis between various cities of the country showed that cities in one region with shortest distances from one another demonstrated higher correlations, suggesting distinct regional dependence in aerosols distribution.

M3  - Article
AB  - The application of remote sensing in understanding tree species structural diversity and land use patterns relationship is imperative for reforestation and biodiversity conservation efforts. This study assesses land use patterns and tree species structural diversity in previously reforested hilly sandstone regions of northern Togo. The physical height, and diameter at breast height (DBH) more than 5 cm of all tree species in each given plot were measured in summer 2017. A total of 75 plots of 900 m(2) installed along the toposequence were recorded. In addition, a semi-supervised classification of Landsat 8 images in January of 2018, was also used to classify the land use patterns. 36 tree species and 19 families were recorded for the entire study area. Meanwhile, 19 tree species and 15 families were recorded for the previously afforested zones. The most abundant species included the Sterculiaceae, Zygophyllaceae, Meliaceae, and Mimosaceae. The trees stand structure represented 8.61 +/- 0.57 m, 11.28 +/- 1.76 cm, and 0.018 +/- 0.009 m(2) per hectare for height, diameter and basal area respectively. Major land use patterns were tree and shrub savannahs, parklands and croplands which represented over 60% of the landscape. It is necessary to examine the regeneration and vegetative multiplication potentials of the most frequent and abundant tree species for any eventual future afforestation programs in these hilly sandstone regions of northern Togo.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: While progress has been made in defining the clinical and histopathologic features of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HRcSCC), optimal staging guidelines remain elusive.Objective: We seek to guide clinical practice regarding nodal staging options for patients with HRcSCC via review of evolving definitions of HRcSCC, nodal staging options, and how nodal staging may impact treatment and affect outcomes.Methods: This was a retrospective review of the published peer-reviewed literature regarding risk stratification, nodal staging, and treatment and outcomes for patients with HRcSCC via PubMed.Results: For patients without clinical lymphadenopathy, based on literature from head and neck SCC, preoperative nodal staging with ultrasonography may be more useful than computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Early nodal disease is usually curable, and therefore obtaining a sentinel lymph node biopsy specimen may be considered in those with negative imaging while we await studies of nodal staging outcomes.Limitations: More data are needed to validate the relationships between primary tumor stage and sentinel lymph node biopsy status and to determine if early detection of nodal disease impacts survival for patients with HRcSCC.Conclusion: It is reasonable to consider nodal staging for patients with HRcSCC (Brigham and Women's Hospital stage T2b and T3) in the absence of clinically palpable lymphadenopathy via radiographic imaging and, if negative, sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Burkinabe Children's Acquisition and Construction of Astronomical Knowledge
T2  - JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge acquisition and construction in astronomy is a difficult process, as the scientific concepts are mainly counterintuitive. Few studies in this domain have sought to understand children's conceptual development by focusing on the characteristics of their developmental context. Our aim was thus to enhance current understanding of knowledge development in astronomy by studying children in a cultural context where the scientific worldview is not the dominant one. To this end, we interviewed 120 middle-class children from Burkina Faso (approximately 50% girls) in Grades 1, 3, 5, and 8 about their understanding of the Earth's shape and the day-night cycle. Our results showed that first and third graders' responses mainly relied on everyday observations of the Earth (i.e., flat) and a geocentric vision of the day-night cycle, but some scientific elements did appear in the fifth and eighth graders' answers, probably owing to the science lessons they received at school. The present study shows that (a) when they are congruent, everyday observations, initial knowledge and everyday testimony, constitute a strong basis for children's knowledge construction in astronomy and (b) even in Grade 8, after they have been exposed to classroom teaching of astronomy that promotes a scientific worldview, Burkinabe children have a mainly hybrid knowledge, mixing the scientific worldview with their own initial one. We can therefore confirm Jegede's assertion that, for some non-Western children, nothing short of a revolution is needed to acquire a full scientific understanding and put aside traditional beliefs.

TI  - A Phase-Preserving Focusing Technique for TOPS Mode SAR Raw Data Based on Conventional Processing Methods
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new solution for the phase-preserving focusing of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) raw data acquired through the Terrain Observation with Progressive Scan (TOPS) mode. The proposed algorithm consists of a first interpolation stage of the TOPS raw data, which takes into account the Doppler Centroid frequency variations due to the azimuth antenna steering function, and allows us to unfold the azimuth spectra of the TOPS raw data. Subsequently, the interpolated signals are processed by using conventional phase-preserving SAR focusing methods that exploit frequency domain and spectral analyses algorithms, which are extensively used to efficiently process Stripmap and ScanSAR data. Accordingly, the developed focusing approach is easy to implement. In particular, the presented focusing approach exploits one of the available frequency domain Stripmap processing techniques. The only modification is represented by the inclusion, within the 2D frequency domain focusing step, of a spurious azimuth chirp signal with a properly selected azimuthal rate. This allows us to efficiently carry out the TOPS azimuth focusing through the SPECAN method. Furthermore, an important aspect of this algorithm is the possibility to easily achieve a constant and tunable output azimuth pixel size without any additional computing time; this is a remarkable feature with respect to the full-aperture TOPS-mode algorithms available in the existing literature. Moreover, although tailored on Sentinel-1 (S1) raw data, the proposed algorithm can be easily extended to process data collected through the TOPS mode by different radar sensors. The presented experimental results have been obtained by processing real Sentinel-1 raw data and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

TI  - Accounting for aboveground carbon storage in shrubland and woodland ecosystems in the Great Basin
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the accuracy of carbon accounting in terrestrial ecosystems is critical for understanding carbon fluxes associated with land cover change, with significant implications for global carbon cycling and climate change. Semi-arid ecosystems account for an estimated 45% of global terrestrial ecosystem area and are in many locations experiencing high degrees of degradation. However, aboveground carbon accounting has largely focused on tropical and forested ecosystems, while drylands have been relatively neglected. Here, we used a combination of field estimates, remotely sensed data, and existing land cover maps to create a spatially explicit estimate of aboveground carbon storage within the Great Basin, a semi-arid region of the western United States encompassing 643,500 km(2) of shrubland and woodland vegetation. We classified the region into seven distinct land cover categories: pinyon-juniper woodland, sagebrush steppe, salt desert shrub, low sagebrush, forest, non-forest, and other/excluded, each with an associated carbon estimate. Aboveground carbon estimates for pinyon-juniper woodland were continuous values based on tree canopy cover. Carbon estimates for other land cover categories were based on a mean value for the land cover type. The Great Basin ecosystems contain an estimated 295.4 Tg in aboveground carbon, which is almost double the previous estimates that only accounted for forested ecosystems in the same area. Aboveground carbon was disproportionately stored in pinyon-juniper woodland (43.7% carbon, 16.9% land area), while the shrubland systems accounted for roughly half of the total land area (49.1%) and one-third of the total carbon. Our results emphasize the importance of distinguishing and accounting for the distinctive contributions of shrubland and woodland ecosystems when creating carbon storage estimates for dryland regions.

TI  - Can More Accurate Night-Time Remote Sensing Data Simulate a More Detailed Population Distribution?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aging, shrinking cities, urban agglomerations and other new key terms continue to emerge when describing the large-scale population changes in various cities in mainland China. It is important to simulate the distribution of residential populations at a coarse scale to manage cities as a whole, and at a fine scale for policy making in infrastructure development. This paper analyzes the relationship between the DN (Digital number, value assigned to a pixel in a digital image) value of NPP-VIIRS (the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) and LuoJia1-01 and the residential populations of urban areas at a district, sub-district, community and court level, to compare the influence of resolution of remote sensing data by taking urban land use to map out auxiliary data in which first-class (R1), second-class (R2) and third-class residential areas (R3) are distinguished by house price. The results show that LuoJia1-01 more accurately analyzes population distributions at a court level for second- and third-class residential areas, which account for over 85% of the total population. The accuracy of the LuoJia1-01 simulation data is higher than that of Landscan and GHS (European Commission Global Human Settlement) population. This can be used as an important tool for refining the simulation of residential population distributions. In the future, higher-resolution night-time light data could be used for research on accurate simulation analysis that scales down large-scale populations.

TI  - Assessing land use/cover dynamics and exploring drivers in the Amazon's arc of deforestation through a hierarchical, multi-scale and multi-temporal classification approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) are intrinsically tied to ecological and social dynamics. Still, classifying LULC in ecotones, where landscapes are commonly heterogeneous and have a wide range of physiognomies, remains a challenge. Here we present a three-level hierarchical classification approach, using both Landsat and MODIS images, and both pixels and objects as units of information. We applied this multi-temporal and -spatial approach to classify land use in the Upper Xingu River Basin (similar to 170,000 km(2)), located in the arc of deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon. The first level includes five classes and differentiates managed land from native vegetation with high overall accuracy (93%). The second level has 11 classes (overall accuracy= 86%) and separates main land uses and native vegetation domains. The third level has 16 classes (overall accuracy= 83%) and addresses productivity of both managed and natural systems. We find that this new method presented here is more efficient than existing regional and global land cover products. Applying this approach to assess land cover transitions in the basin from 1985 to 2015, we find that agricultural production increased, yet manifested itself differently in the northern (Amazon biome) and southern (Cerrado biome) portions of the basin. Analyzing land use change in different levels, we identify that agricultural intensification occurred mainly in the Amazon while the Cerrado has undergone an expansion in agricultural area. The method presented here can be adapted to other regions, improving efficiency and accuracy of classifying land cover in heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - Evaluation and comparison of Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and Deimos-1 remote sensing indices for assessing burn severity in Mediterranean fire-prone ecosystems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of improved spatial and spectral resolution sensors provides new opportunities to assess burn severity more accurately. This study evaluates the ability of remote sensing indices derived from three remote sensing sensors (i.e., Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, Sentinel-2 MSI and Deimos-1 SLIM-6.22) to assess burn severity (site, vegetation and soil burn severity). As a case study, we used a megafire (9,939 ha) that occurred in a Mediterranean ecosystem in northwestern Spain. Remote sensing indices included seven reflective, two thermal and four mixed indices, which were derived from each satellite and were validated with field burn severity metrics obtained from CBI index. Correlation patterns of field burn severity and remote sensing indices were relatively consistent across the different sensors. Additionally, regardless of the sensor, indices that incorporated SWIR bands (i.e., NBR-based indices), exceed those using red and NIR bands, and thermal and mixed indices. High resolution Sentinel-2 imagery only slightly improved the performance of indices based on NBR compared to Landsat 8. The dNDVI index from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images showed relatively similar correlation values to NBR-based indices for site and soil burn severity, but showed limitations using Deimos-1. In general, monotemporal and relativized indices better correlated with vegetation burn severity in heterogeneous systems than differenced indices. This study showed good potential for Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and Sentinel-2 MSI for burn severity assessment in fire-prone heterogeneous ecosystems, although we highlight the need for further evaluation of Deimos-1 SLIM-6-22 in different fire scenarios, especially using bi-temporal indices.

TI  - Bistatic-Like Differential SAR Tomography
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Motivated by prospective synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite missions, this paper addresses the problem of differential SAR tomography (D-TomoSAR) in urban areas using spaceborne bistatic or pursuit monostatic acquisitions. A bistatic or pursuit monostatic interferogram is not subject to significant temporal decorrelation or atmospheric phase screen and, therefore, ideal for elevation reconstruction. We propose a framework that incorporates this reconstructed elevation as deterministic prior to deformation estimation, which uses conventional repeat-pass interferograms generated from bistatic or pursuit monostatic pairs. By means of theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that this framework is, in the pursuit monostatic case, both statistically and computationally more efficient than the standard D-TomoSAR. In the bistatic case, its theoretical bound is no worse by a factor of 2. We also show that reasonable results can be obtained by using merely six TerraSAR-X add-on for digital elevation measurements (TanDEM-X) pursuit monostatic pairs, if additional spatial prior is introduced. The proposed framework can be easily extended for multistatic configurations or external sources of scatterer's elevation.

TI  - Hydrological Response of Dry Afromontane Forest to Changes in Land Use and Land Cover in Northern Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the impact of land use/land cover (LULC) changes on the hydrology of the dry Afromontane forest landscape in northern Ethiopia. Landsat satellite images of thematic mapper (TM) (1986), TM (2001), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) (2018) were employed to assess LULC. All of the images were classified while using the maximum likelihood image classification technique, and the changes were assessed by post-classification comparison. Seven LULC classes were defined with an overall accuracy 83-90% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.82-0.92. The classification result for 1986 revealed dominance of shrublands (48.5%), followed by cultivated land (42%). Between 1986 and 2018, cultivated land became the dominant (39.6%) LULC type, accompanied by a decrease in shrubland to 32.2%, as well as increases in forestland (from 4.8% to 21.4%) and bare land (from 0% to 0.96%). The soil conservation systems curve number model (SCS-CN) was consequently employed to simulate forest hydrological response to climatic variations and land-cover changes during three selected years. The observed changes in direct surface runoff, the runoff coefficient, and storage capacity of the soil were partially linked to the changes in LULC that were associated with expanding bare land and built-up areas. This change in land use aggravates the runoff potential of the study area by 31.6 mm per year on average. Runoff coefficients ranged from 25.3% to 47.2% with varied storm rainfall intensities of 26.1-45.4 mm/ha. The temporal variability of climate change and potential evapotranspiration increased by 1% during 1981-2018. The observed rainfall and modelled runoff showed a strong positive correlation (R-2 = 0.78; p < 0.001). Regression analysis between runoff and rainfall intensity indicates their high and significant correlation (R-2 = 0.89; p < 0.0001). Changes were also common along the slope gradient and agro-ecological zones at varying proportions. The observed changes in land degradation and surface runoff are highly linked to the change in LULC. Further study is suggested on climate scenario-based modeling of hydrological processes that are related to land use changes to understand the hydrological variability of the dry Afromontane forest ecosystems.

TI  - Large-Area Characterization of Urban Morphology-Mapping of Built-Up Height and Density Using TanDEM-X and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we establish a novel multistep procedure for morphologic characterization of built environments in terms of built-up height and density. We rely on elevation measurements from the TanDEM-X mission (TDM) and multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. These earth observation systems feature a notable tradeoff between a fairly high spatial resolution and large-area coverage and, thus, allow for spatially continuous analysis of built environments around the globe. To this purpose, we follow an automated workflow that foresees the distinction of "built-up" and "non-built-up" areas by relying on the so-called Global Urban Footprint processor. This information is deployed within a tailored filtering procedure for the TDM digital surface model data to extract elevation information for built-up areas. Subsequently, the intra-urban land cover is mapped under consideration of Sentinel-2 imagery and serves as basis to compute built-up heights and densities. These two measures are finally combined for a morphologic characterization of the built environment on an ordinal scale of measurement. Empirical validation efforts are provided based on comparative analysis with respect to more than 3.2 million individual building geometries and affiliated height measurements from cadastral data sources. The datasets cover the settlement areas of the capital cities and other major cities in Germany, England, and the Netherlands. The experimental results underline the capability for a morphologic characterization of built environments with viable accuracies.

TI  - Spatial decision support system for land use management of newly reclaimed areas in arid regions

M3  - Article
AB  - The current work is an attempt to establish a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for the newly reclaimed areas, especially saline soils of the arid regions. The proposed system is based on database of ArcGIS environment and includes land capability and suitability models. A base map of the study area, remotely sensed data, soil and water analytical data, meteorological data and socio-economic information formulate the essential database for the SDSS implementation. Based on processing the proposed SDSS, the agricultural and fish farming land uses would be increased from about 48% to 71% of the total area where almost 60% would be devoted to field crop cultivation, 11% can be used as permanent fish farms and 29% could be assigned to residential and industrial purposes or any other recreational uses. The soils capabilities would be improved through good management policy and land reclamation processes. (C) 2018 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the distribution of snow cover in Iran using the 8-day moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow product (MOD10A2) during 2001-2015. The year 2008 was found to have the most extensive snow cover and was used to determine the snow-covered areas into five regions based on topographic characteristics (elevation, slope, and aspect). Our results show that the mean snow cover extent (SCE) on the slopes higher than 20 degrees is greater (62.94% on average) than on the slopes lower than 20 degrees (55.28% on average). The highest and lowest SCEs are related to the north-facing aspect and flat-surface regions, respectively. In addition, a direct relationship between SCE and elevation was revealed, with snow cover reaching 100% in the highlands (above 3000m). The highest values of the mean (171,905.1km(2) in slope1 from region 3), standard deviation (SD) (70,856.53km(2) in slope 1 from region 3), and coefficient of variation (CV) (214.65% in region 1) of SCE were obtained from 17 to 24 January, 9 to 16 January, and 10 to 17 February, respectively. The SD peaked in the early 8days and then decreased in the middle and ending 8days. The highest CV was obtained in the Caspian coastal region and decreased with increasing elevation.

TI  - Multitemporal Remote Sensing Based on an FVC Reference Period Using Sentinel-2 for Monitoring <i>Eichhornia crassipes</i> on a Mediterranean River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive aquatic plants are a serious global ecological and socio-economic problem because they can cause local extinction of native species and alter navigation and fishing. Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth) is a dangerous invasive floating plant that is widely distributed throughout the world. In Lebanon, it has spread since 2006 in the Al Kabir River. Remote sensing techniques have been widely developed to detect and monitor dynamics and extents of invasive plants such as water hyacinth over large areas. However, they become challenging to use in narrow areas such as the Al Kabir River and we developed a new image-analysis method to extract water hyacinth areas on the river. The method is based on a time series of a biophysical variable obtained from Sentinel-2 images. After defining a reference period between two growing cycles, we used the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) to estimate the water hyacinth surface area in the river. This method makes it possible to monitor water hyacinth development and estimate the total area it colonizes in the river corridor. This method can help ecologists and other stakeholders to map invasive plants in rivers and improve their control.

TI  - Fine needle aspirates comprehensively sample intrahepatic immunity
T2  - GUT
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective In order to refine new therapeutic strategies in the pipeline for HBV cure, evaluation of virological and immunological changes compartmentalised at the site of infection will be required. We therefore investigated if liver fine needle aspirates (FNAs) could comprehensively sample the local immune landscape in parallel with viable hepatocytes.Design Matched blood, liver biopsy and FNAs from 28 patients with HBV and 15 without viral infection were analysed using 16-colour multiparameter flow cytometry.Results The proportion of CD4 T, CD8 T, Mucosal Associated Invariant T cell (MAIT), Natural Killer (NK) and B cells identified by FNA correlated with that in liver biopsies from the same donors. Populations of Programmed Death-1 (PD-1)(hi)CD39(hi) tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells (CD69(+)CD103(+)) and liver-resident NK cells (CXCR6(+) T-bet(lo)Eomeshi), were identified by both FNA and liver biopsy, and not seen in the blood. Crucially, HBV-specific T cells could be identified by FNAs at similar frequencies to biopsies and enriched compared with blood. FNAs could simultaneously identify populations of myeloid cells and live hepatocytes expressing albumin, Scavenger Receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1), whereas hepatocytes were poorly viable after the processing required for liver biopsies.Conclusion We demonstrate for the first time that FNAs identify a range of intrahepatic immune cells including locally resident sentinel HBV-specific T cells and NK cells, together with PD-L1-expressing hepatocytes. In addition, we provide a scoring tool to estimate the extent to which an individual FNA has reliably sampled intrahepatic populations rather than contaminating blood. The broad profiling achieved by this less invasive, rapid technique makes it suitable for longitudinal monitoring of the liver to optimise new therapies for HBV.

TI  - High-Resolution Snowline Delineation From Landsat Imagery to Infer Snow Cover Controls in a Himalayan Catchment
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The snow cover dynamics of High Mountain Asia are usually assessed at spatial resolutions of 250 m or greater, but this scale is too coarse to clearly represent the rugged topography common to the region. Higher-resolution measurement of snow-covered area often results in biased sampling due to cloud cover and deep shadows. We therefore develop a Normalized Difference Snow Index-based workflow to delineate snow lines from Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ imagery and apply it to the upper Langtang Valley in Nepal, processing 194 scenes spanning 1999 to 2013. For each scene, we determine the spatial distribution of snow line altitudes (SLAs) with respect to aspect and across six subcatchments. Our results show that the mean SLA exhibits distinct seasonal behavior based on aspect and subcatchment position. We find that SLA dynamics respond to spatial and seasonal trade-offs in precipitation, temperature, and solar radiation, which act as primary controls. We identify two SLA spatial gradients, which we attribute to the effect of spatially variable precipitation. Our results also reveal that aspect-related SLA differences vary seasonally and are influenced by solar radiation. In terms of seasonal dominant controls, we demonstrate that the snow line is controlled by snow precipitation in winter, melt in premonsoon, a combination of both in postmonsoon, and temperature in monsoon, explaining to a large extent the spatial and seasonal variability of the SLA in the upper Langtang Valley. We conclude that while SLA and snow-covered area are complementary metrics, the SLA has a strong potential for understanding local-scale snow cover dynamics and their controlling mechanisms.

TI  - Deep Groundwater as an Alternative Source of Water in the Ogaden Jesoma Sandstone Aquifers of Somali Region, Ethiopia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Between 2015 and 2018, the Horn of Africa was affected by a series of climatic-induced events, namely El Nino, La Nina, and the Indian Ocean Dipole. These events modified the variability of rainfall patterns and resulted in extended periods of low rainfall, low recharge, and high evapotranspiration. That situation prompted humanitarian water professionals to finance the transportation of water from selected locations with high groundwater potential through water trucks to areas facing groundwater depletion and drought. To mitigate this, UNICEF identified alternative water supplies by exploring sustainable deeper groundwater sources. This paper describes a three-phase methodology of deep groundwater development of wells in the Ogaden Jesoma sandstone aquifers of the Somali region of the Horn of Africa, to a depth of 600 m below ground level. The methodology included the development of groundwater suitability maps using geological and remote sensing data, hydrogeological ground truthing of the maps, and then test drilling at the selected locations. The results concluded that the deep sandstone aquifer of Jesoma can provide fresh water with yields of 15 L/s to the local population of the Somali region. The study provided insights into deep groundwater identification and development as well as adaptive deep borehole drilling as a source for climate-resilient water supplies.

TI  - Climatology of easterly wave disturbances over the tropical South Atlantic
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A 21-year climatology of Easterly Waves Disturbances (EWDs) over the tropical South Atlantic (TSA) has been examined using data from the European Centers for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting interim reanalysis (ERAI) and satellite data. This includes the frequency distribution of EWDs and their interannual variability. The large-scale environment associated with EWDs has been investigated for the coastal region of Northeast Brazil (NEB) for the rainy (April-August) season using a composite analysis. EWDs were first identified in ERAI, resulting in 518 observed cases. These were found to show notable interannual variability with around 16-40 episodes each year and with an average lifetime of 4-6days. Of the identified EWDs, 97% reached the coast of NEB, of which 64% were convective in nature and 14% moved across the NEB region and reached the Amazon. The annual occurrence of EWDs seems to be lower (higher) during El Nino (La Nina). The monthly occurrence of EWDs shows higher activity in the rainy season. EWDs originate in association with four types of system: cold fronts, convective clusters from the west coast of Africa, Intertropical Convergence Zone and Tropical Upper Tropospheric Cyclonic Vortices. The composite analysis indicates strong relative vorticity and divergence anomalies at low levels, as well as in the vertical profiles of relative humidity and vertical velocity (omega). The precipitation composites show that the EWDs propagate between the TSA and NEB and contribute at least 60% of the total rainfall over the east coast of NEB throughout the rainy season.

TI  - Potato Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques and Sentinel 2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional potato growth models evidence certain limitations, such as the cost of obtaining the input data required to run the models, the lack of spatial information in some instances, or the actual quality of input data. In order to address these issues, we develop a model to predict potato yield using satellite remote sensing. In an effort to offer a good predictive model that improves the state of the art on potato precision agriculture, we use images from the twin Sentinel 2 satellites (European Space Agency-Copernicus Programme) over three growing seasons, applying different machine learning models. First, we fitted nine machine learning algorithms with various pre-processing scenarios using variables from July, August and September based on the red, red-edge and infra-red bands of the spectrum. Second, we selected the best performing models and evaluated them against independent test data. Finally, we repeated the previous two steps using only variables corresponding to July and August. Our results showed that the feature selection step proved vital during data pre-processing in order to reduce multicollinearity among predictors. The Regression Quantile Lasso model (11.67% Root Mean Square Error, RMSE; R-2 = 0.88 and 9.18% Mean Absolute Error, MAE) and Leap Backwards model (10.94% RMSE, R-2 = 0.89 and 8.95% MAE) performed better when predictors with a correlation coefficient > 0.5 were removed from the dataset. In contrast, the Support Vector Machine Radial (svmRadial) performed better with no feature selection method (11.7% RMSE, R-2 = 0.93 and 8.64% MAE). In addition, we used a random forest model to predict potato yields in Castilla y Leon (Spain) 1-2 months prior to harvest, and obtained satisfactory results (11.16% RMSE, R-2 = 0.89 and 8.71% MAE). These results demonstrate the suitability of our models to predict potato yields in the region studied.

TI  - Intercomparison of remote-sensing based evapotranspiration algorithms over amazonian forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is considered a key variable in the understanding of the Amazonian tropical forests and their response to climate change. Remote-Sensing (RS) based evapotranspiration models are presented as a feasible means in order to provide accurate spatially-distributed ET estimates over this region. In this work, the performance of four commonly used ET RS models was evaluated over Amazonia using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. RS models included i) Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL), ii) Penman-Monteith MODIS operative parametrization (PM-Mu), iii) Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS), and iv) Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis (LSASAF). These models were forced using two ancillary meteorological data sources: i) in-situ data extracted from Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment (LBA) stations (scenario I), and ii) three reanalysis datasets (scenario II), including Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application (MERRA-2), European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis-Interim (ERA-Interim), and Global Land Assimilation System (GLDAS-2). Performance of algorithms under the two scenarios was validated using in-situ eddy-covariance measurements. For scenario I, PT-JPL provided the best agreement with in-situ ET observations (RMSE = 0.55 mm/day, R = 0.88). Neglecting water canopy evaporation resulted in an underestimation of ET measurements for LSASAF. SEBS performance was similar to that of PT-JPL, nevertheless SEBS estimates were limited by the continuous cloud cover of the region. A physically-based ET gap-filling method was used in order to alleviate this issue. PM-Mu tended to overestimate in-situ ET observations. For scenario II, quality assessment of reanalysis input data demonstrated that MERRA-2, ERA-Interim and GLDAS-2 contain biases that impact model performance. In particular, biases in radiation inputs were found the main responsible of the observed biases in ET estimates. For the region, MERRA-2 tends to overestimate daily net radiation and incoming solar radiation. ERA-Interim tends to underestimate both variables, and GLDAS tends to overestimate daily radiation while underestimating incoming solar radiation. Discrepancies amongst these reanalysis inputs generally explain the observed discrepancies in model spatial and temporal patterns.

TI  - Functions for aboveground biomass estimation derived from satellite images data in Mediterranean agroforestry systems
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass has been having an increasing importance in the world economy and in the evaluation of the forests development and monitoring. The main goal of this study is the development of functions for the estimation of aboveground biomass, using crown cover as independent variable, for Quercus rotundifolia, Quercus suber and Pinus pinea in agroforestry systems, both for monospecies and multispecies stands, based on Portuguese data. Crown cover per specie was derived from crown horizontal projection obtained by processing very high spatial resolution satellite images (Quickbird and Worldview-2), with contrast split segmentation method and object-oriented classification. The stand species composition distinguished species and monospecies from multispecies stands. The best model was the one with crown cover and dummy variables for composition as explanatory variables, reflecting the differences between species and stand structure. Aboveground biomass with this function should ideally be calculated with the grid areas applied in this study, though similar accuracies can be obtained for other grid sizes.

TI  - California forest die-off linked to multi-year deep soil drying in 2012-2015 drought
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread episodes of recent forest die-off have been tied to the occurrence of anomalously warm droughts, although the underlying mechanisms remain inadequately understood. California's 2012-2015 drought, with exceptionally low precipitation and warmth, and widespread conifer death, provides an opportunity to explore the chain of events leading to forest die-off. Here, we present the spatial and temporal patterns of die-off and moisture deficit during California's drought, based on field and remote sensing observations. We found that die-off was closely tied to multi-year deep-rooting-zone drying, and that this relationship provides a framework with which to diagnose and predict mortality. Marked tree death in an intensively studied Sierra Nevada forest followed a four-year moisture overdraft, with cumulative 2012-2015 evapotranspiration exceeding precipitation by similar to 1,500 mm, and subsurface moisture exhaustion to 5-15-m depth. Observations across the entire Sierra Nevada further linked tree death to deep drying, with die-off and moisture overdraft covarying across latitude and elevation. Unusually dense vegetation and warm temperatures accelerated southern Sierran evapotranspiration in 2012-2015, intensifying overdraft and compounding die-off by an estimated 55%. Climate change is expected to further amplify evapotranspiration and moisture overdraft during drought, potentially increasing Sierran tree death during drought by similar to 15-20% degrees C-1.

TI  - Surface Water Body Detection in Polarimetric SAR Data Using Contextual Complex Wishart Classification
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of surface water from satellite images is important for water management purposes like for mapping flood extents, inundation dynamics, and water resources distributions. In this research, we introduce a supervised contextual classification model to detect surface water bodies from polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. A complex Wishart Markov Random Field (WMRF) combines Markov Random Fields with the complex Wishart distribution. It is applied on Single Look Complex Sentinel 1 data. Using Markov Random Fields, we utilize the geometry of surface water to remove speckle from SAR images. Results were compared with the Wishart Maximum Likelihood Classification (WMLC), the Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classification, and a median filter followed by thresholding. Experiments demonstrate that the statistical representation of data using the Wishart distribution improves the F-score to 0.95 for WMRF, while it is 0.67, 0.88, and 0.91 for Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classification, WMLC, and thresholding, respectively. The main improvement in the precision increases from 0.80 and 0.86 for WMLC and thresholding to 0.96 for WMRF. The WMRF model accurately distinguishes classes that have a similar backscatter, like water and bare soil. Hence, the high accuracy of the proposed WMRF model is a result of its robustness for water detection from Single Look Complex data. We conclude that the proposed model is a great improvement on existing methods for the detection of calm surface water bodies.

TI  - Early-life exposure to ambient fine particulate air pollution and infant mortality: pooled evidence from 43 low- and middle-income countries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Many low- and middle-income countries are experiencing high and increasing exposure to ambient fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5). The effect of PM2.5 on infant and child mortality is usually modelled using concentration response curves extrapolated from studies conducted in settings with low ambient air pollution, which may not capture its full effect.Methods We pool data on more than half a million births from 69 nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys that were conducted in 43 low- and middle-income countries between 1998 and 2014, and we calculate early-life exposure (exposure in utero and post partum) to ambient PM2.5 using high-resolution calibrated satellite data matched to the child's place of residence. We estimate the association between the log of early-life PM2.5 exposure, both overall and separated by type, and the odds of neonatal and infant mortality, adjusting for child-level, parent-level and household-level characteristics.Results We find little evidence that early-life exposure to overall PM2.5 is associated with higher odds of mortality relative to low exposure to PM2.5. However, about half of PM2.5 is naturally occurring dust and sea-salt whereas half is from other sources, comprising mainly carbon-based compounds, which are mostly due to human activity. We find a very strong association between exposure to carbonaceous PM2.5 and infant mortality, particularly neonatal mortality, i.e. mortality in the first 28days after birth. We estimate that, at the mean level of exposure in the sample to carbonaceous PM2.5-10.9 mu g/m(3)-the odds of neonatal mortality are over 50% higher than in the absence of pollution.Conclusion Our results suggest that the current World Health Organization guideline of limiting the overall ambient PM2.5 level to less than 10 mu g/m(3) should be augmented with a lower limit for harmful carbonaceous PM2.5.

T2  - JOURNAL OF LINGUISTIC ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A'ama mreme, or a'ama speech, spoken by incumbents of a special ceremonial role within central Brazilian A'uw-Xavante society, illustrates Joel Sherzer's argument regarding the centrality of speech play to both linguistic and social analysis. A'ama mreme is a ludic code variant, a system of lexical substitution primarily at the level of nouns and verbs, spoken exclusively by a'ama. Morphological analysis of of a'ama mreme reveals the existence of conceptual categories and perceptions that are not otherwise linguistically transparent. Further, a'ama, who indexically make their ceremonial identity and role salient through the everyday practice of ama speech, add an additional layer of complexity to A'uw-Xavante's complicated dualistic system of social organization. This complexity, heretofore overlooked by anthropologists of A'uw-Xavante, becomes apparent through attention to socially situated discourse and verbal arts. A'ama mreme enriches and adds complexity to understandings of A'uw-Xavante language, thought, and social organization. It is, as Sherzer contends, a place where language, cognition, perception, worldview and social structure come together in distilled form.

AB  - Active and passive microwave remote sensing has evolved into a well-accepted and widely used method for the spatially continuous, coarse to medium resolution mapping of the surface soil moisture content (SMC). Presently, the exploitation of high-resolution data is less mature. Sentinel-1 is a high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (similar to 5 by 20 m), which acts as the basis for mapping of SMC in this study. There aren't any other comparable SAR missions currently available whose data can be accessed and used for free.One of the applications for SMC measurements is connected to the relationship between SMC anomalies and natural hazards such as droughts, flooding, or landslides. A requirement for the detection and quantification of an anomaly is a long time-series (often 10-30 years) to derive a reference value. Herein lies one of the issues of Sentinel-1 based SMC mapping - at the time of writing, the Sentinel-1 time-series spanned a period of approximately 3.5 years.We introduce an approach to overcome this problem and enable the Sentinel-1 based SMC anomaly detection. The method is based on a cross-calibration between Sentinel-1 SMC estimations and coarse resolution (similar to 30 km) modelled SMC from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), which covers the time-span from 1948 to today. As a result, we can derive the long-term averages for each Sentinel-1 pixel.Results show that the proposed method allows a very accurate reproduction of the average SMC (for any given pixel) - if computed for the S1 time-span, the RMSE between estimated (GLDAS based) and true average S1 SMC is 0.7 %-Vol. Furthermore, the comparison with an in-situ time-series shows the correct detection of negative and positive anomalies, respectively. The method presented here may allow the integration of S1 data into, e.g., drought monitoring or flood forecasting applications.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the paper is to examine and analyze the long-term spatial dynamics of LULC (Land Use/Land Cover) and the impact of their changes on the SUHI (Surface Urban Heat Island). The study covered the area of Bucharest Municipality, the capital of Romania and its neighboring areas, and involved a series of Landsat images, taken in the summer, and ranging from 1984 to 2016. To achieve the goal the following were accomplished: (i) a supervised image classification, done with good accuracy and (ii) a post classification change detection approach was used to assess the LULC changes; (iii) the thermal signature for each land use category was determined using LST (Land Surface Temperature); also, iv) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) has been used to determine a relationship between the thermal behavior and the characteristics of each land use category. The results have revealed that by 2016 there has been an increase in the built-up areas and the fallow land areas and a decrease in the croplands and forested areas. Also, there were observed the increase in surface temperature and a decrease for the difference between the average temperature of the urban area and the surrounding areas of the city indicating the extension of the area where the phenomenon of the Urban Heat Island of Bucharest occurs.

AB  - Interaction between space and time is well documented in the study of urban sprawl, where expansion of urban margins becomes the outcome of changing functionality of space within the given time frame. While urban sprawl becomes inevitable phenomena, the paper seeks to identify the role of population growth and sectors of working population that contributed to the sprawl in Bathinda city, Punjab. In this regards, Reilly's law of retail gravitation is analyzed for spatial expansion of built up areas. Using remote sensing and GIS (Geographical Information System) as a platform for creating land use land cover changes from Landsat images reveals the change matrix for the different land use classification. Thus, readdressing urban sprawl as an outcome of increasing retail sector is an interesting finding that perhaps would further enhances knowledge in urban research.

TI  - Estimation of spatial and temporal changes in net primary production based on Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model in semi-arid rangelands of Semirom County, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary production (NPP) is an indicator of rangeland ecosystem function. This research assessed the potential of the Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model for estimating NPP and its spatial and temporal changes in semi-arid rangelands of Semirom County, Iran. Using CASA model, we estimated the NPP values based on monthly climate data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from the MODIS sensor. Regression analysis was then applied to compare the estimated production data with observed production data. The spatial and temporal changes in NPP and light utilization efficiency (LUE) were investigated in different rangeland vegetation types. The standardized precipitation index (SPI) was also calculated at different time scales and the correlation of SPI with NPP changes was determined. The results indicated that the estimated NPP values varied from 0.00 to 74.48 g C/(m2 center dot a). The observed and estimated NPP values had different correlations, depending on rangeland conditions and vegetation types. The highest and lowest correlations were respectively observed in Astragalus spp.-Agropyron spp. rangeland (R-2=0.75) with good condition and Gundelia spp.-Cousinia spp. rangeland (R-2=0.36) with poor and very poor conditions. The maximum and minimum LUE values were found in Astragalus spp.-Agropyron spp. rangeland (0.117 g C/MJ) with good condition and annual grasses-annual forbs rangeland (0.010 g C/MJ), respectively. According to the correlations between SPI and NPP changes, the effects of drought periods on NPP depended on vegetation types and rangeland conditions. Annual plants had the highest drought sensitivity while shrubs exhibited the lowest drought sensitivity. The positive effects of wet periods on NPP were less evident in degraded areas where the destructive effects of drought were more prominent. Therefore, determining vegetation types and rangeland conditions is essential in NPP estimation. The findings of this study confirmed the potential of the CASA for estimating rangeland production. Therefore, the model output maps can be used to evaluate, monitor and optimize rangeland management in semi-arid rangelands of Iran where MODIS NPP products are not available.

TI  - Impact assessment of meteorological and environmental parameters on PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations using remote sensing data and GWR analysis (case study of Tehran)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The PM2.5 as one of the main pollutants in Tehran city has a devastating effect on human health. Knowing the key parameters associated with PM2.5 concentration is essential to take effective actions to reduce the concentration of these particles. This study assesses the relationship between meteorological (humidity, pressure, temperature, precipitation, and wind speed) and environmental parameters (normalize difference vegetation index and land surface temperature of MODIS satellite data) on PM2.5 concentration in Tehran city. The Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was employed to assess the impact of key parameters on PM2.5 concentrations in winter and summer. For this purpose, first the seasonal average of meteorological data were extracted and synchronized to satellite data. Then, using the ordinary least square model, the important parameters related to PM2.5 concentration were determined and evaluated. Finally, using the GWR model, the relationships between parameters related to PM2.5 concentration were analyzed. The results of this study indicate that meteorological and environmental parameters in winter season (71%) have a much higher ability to explain PM2.5 concentration than summer season (40%). In winter, PM2.5 concentration has a negative correlation with vegetation at most parts of the study area, a negative correlation with LST in the western and a positive correlation in the eastern part of the study area, a positive correlation with temperature, and a negative correlation with wind speed in the northeastern part of the study area. Precipitation has a positive correlation with PM2.5 concentration in most parts of the study area in both seasons. But, it was investigated in case of higher precipitation (more than 2 mm), PM2.5 concentration decreases. But, there is no negative relationship in any of the dependent parameters with PM2.5 concentration in summer. In this season, the air temperature parameter showed a high correlation with PM2.5 concentration. Also, spatial variations of the local coefficients for all parameters are higher in winter than in summer.

TI  - Using a species-centered approach to predict bird community responses to habitat fragmentation
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context The relative importance of habitat fragmentation versus loss on species richness has been much debated. However, recent findings that fragmentation effects are relatively weak may be an artifact of using human-classified vegetation rather than adopting a species-eye view to measure landscape structure. Objectives We present the first example of a species-centered approach for examining fragmentation effects on ecological communities. We tested hypotheses relating to the relative influence of habitat amount, configuration, and focal patch size on southwest Oregon bird communities. Methods We used boosted regression trees based on unclassified Landsat TM to create 'stacked' species distribution models (S-SDMs) for a large pool of avian species and nested subset of habitat specialists. We tested the relative importance of S-SDM-derived habitat amount, patch number, mean patch size, and focal patch size in explaining species richness. We compared this approach to metrics based on generic land-cover classifications. Results Species-centered models had greater statistical support than land-cover models. In species-centered models, species richness increased as a function of focal patch size and decreased with patch number, supporting the hypothesis of negative effects of fragmentation per se. Land-cover based models indicated inconsistent support for habitat amount but a positive effect of fragmentation. Conclusion The species-centered approach identified habitat configuration relationships obscured by land-cover based approaches. While positive land-cover based fragmentation effects were consistent with recent synthesis work, the species-centered approach consistently revealed strong negative effects of fragmentation matching traditional theoretical expectations. S-SDMs may offer promise for generalizing ecological theory to real species distributions.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous water disasters have recently occurred all over the world, including South Korea, due to global climate change in recent years. As water-related disasters occur extensively and their sites are difficult for people to access, it is necessary to monitor them using satellites. The Ministry of Environment and K-water plan to launch the next-generation medium satellite No. 5 (water resource/water disaster satellite) equipped with C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in 2025. C-band SAR has the advantage of being able to observe water resources twice a day at a high resolution both day and night, regardless of weather conditions. Currently, RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 equipped with C-band SAR achieve the purpose of their launch and are used in various environmental fields such as forest structure detection and coastline change monitoring, as well as for unique purposes including the detection of flooding, drought and soil moisture change, utilizing the advantages of SAR. As such, this study aimed to analyze the characteristics of the next-generation medium satellite No. 5 and its application in environmental fields. Our findings showed that it can be used to improve the degree of precision of existing environmental spatial information such as the classification accuracy of land cover map in environmental field works. It also enables us to observe forests and water resources in North Korea that are difficult to access geographically. It is ultimately expected that this will enable the monitoring of the whole Korean Peninsula in various environmental fields, and help in relevant responses and policy supports.

T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric quality is closely related to human living environment. Atmospheric pollutants, especially fine particulate matter, directly and indirectly endanger human health. Therefore, many cities put the monitoring of fine particulate concentration at an important position. We analyzed the correlation between MODIS high-resolution aerosol products (aerosol optical depth, AOD) and PM2.5 concentration monitoring data in Guanzhong area in spring 2017 and constructed a direct fitting model. A multiple regression model containing meteorological elements was established by combining meteorological observation data. Those two models were compared. The results showed that the multivariate regression model with meteorological factors had better fitting degree for the spatial distribution of PM2.5 in Guanzhong area ( r(2) = 0.768, P < 0.01). In the spring of 2017, the spatial distribution of PM2.5 AOD) in Guanzhong area showed a trend of being high in the east region and low in the west region. The highest value appeared in Xi' an, Weinan and Xianyang, being 1.019, 0.911, and 0.124, respectively. Results from the principal component analysis of a typical polluted weather and simulation of its potential transmission path based on HYSPLIT backward trajectory model showed that atmospheric quality in Guanzhong area in spring 2017 was affected by multi-pollutants, multi-pollutant sources and multi-channel combined pollution, and the air mass mainly came from southwestern Mongolia. Our results provide reference for the prevention and control of air pollution and ecological environment protection in Guanzhong area.

TI  - New evidence-based A1, A2, A3 alarm time zones for transferring thrombolysed patients to hyper-acute stroke units: faster is better
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThe National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence and The Royal College of Physicians recommend transferring thrombolysed patients with stroke to a hyperacute stroke unit (HASU) within 4h from hospital arrival (TArrival-HASU), but there is paucity of evidence to support this cut-off. We assessed if a shorter interval within this target threshold conferred a significant improvement in patient mortality.DesignWe conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme.SettingFour major UK hyperacute stroke centres between 2014 and 2016.ParticipantsA total of 183 men (median age=75years, IQR=66-83) and 169 women (median age=81years, IQR=72.5-88) admitted with acute ischaemic stroke.Main outcome measuresWe evaluated TArrival-HASU in relation to inpatient mortality, adjusted for age, sex, co-morbidities, stroke severity, time between procedures, time and day on arrival.ResultsThere were 51 (14.5%) inpatient deaths. On ROC analysis, the AUC (area under the curve) was 61.1% (52.9-69.4%, p=0.01) and the cut-off of TArrival-HASU where sensitivity equalled specificity was 2h/15min (intermediate range=30min to 3h/15min) for predicting mortality. On logistic regression, compared with the fastest TArrival-HASU group within 2h/15min, the slowest TArrival-HASU group beyond upper limit of intermediate range (>= 3h/15min) had an increased risk of mortality: 5.6% vs. 19.6%, adjusted OR=5.6 (95%CI:1.5-20.6, p=0.010).ConclusionsWe propose three new alarm time zones (A1, A2 and A3) to improve stroke survival: A1 Zone (TArrival-HASU<2h/15min) indicates that a desirable target, A2 Zone (TArrival-HASU=2h/15min to 3h/15min), indicates increasing risk and should not delay any further, and A3 Zone (TArrival-HASU >= 3h/15min) indicates high risk and should be avoided.

TI  - Identifying changing precipitation extremes in Sub-Saharan Africa with gauge and satellite products
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sparse gauge networks in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) limit our ability to identify changing precipitation extremes with in situ observations. Given the potential for satellite and satellite-gauge precipitation products to help, we investigate how daily gridded gauge and satellite products compare for seven core climate change precipitation indices. According to a new gauge-only product, the Rainfall Estimates on a Gridded Network (REGEN), there were notable changes in SSA precipitation characteristics between 1950 and 2013 in well-gauged areas. We examine these trends and how these vary for wet, intermediate, and dry areas. For a 31 year period of overlap, we compare REGEN data, other gridded products and three satellite products. Then for 1998-2013, we compare a set of 12 satellite products. Finally, we compare spatial patterns of 1983-2013 trends across all of SSA. Robust 1950-2013 trends indicate that in well-gauged areas extreme events became wetter, particularly in wet areas. Annual totals decreased due to fewer rain days. Between 1983 and 2013 there were positive trends in average precipitation intensity and annual maximum 1 d totals. These trends only represent 15% of SSA, however, and only one tenth of the main wet areas. Unfortunately, gauge and satellite products do not provide consensus for wet area trends. A promising result for identifying regional changes is that numerous satellite products do well at interannual variations in precipitation totals and number of rain days, even as well as some gauge-only products. Products are less accurate for dry spell length and average intensity and least accurate for annual maximum 1 d totals. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (3B42-V7) and Climate Hazards center Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS v2.0) ranked highest for multiple indices. Several products have seemingly unrealistic trends outside of the well-gauged areas that may be due to influence of non-stationary systematic biases. Social media abstract. Sparse data show increasing Africa rainfall extremes and satellite products fill some missing pieces.

TI  - Evaluation of an Extended PICS (EPICS) for Calibration and Stability Monitoring of Optical Satellite Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pseudo Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) have been increasingly used as an independent data source for on-orbit radiometric calibration and stability monitoring of optical satellite sensors. Generally, this would be a small region of land that is extremely stable in time and space, predominantly found in North Africa. Use of these small regions, referred to as traditional PICS, can be limited by: (i) the spatial extent of an individual Region of Interest (ROI) and/or site; (ii) and the frequency of how often the site can be acquired, based on orbital patterns and cloud cover at the site, both impacting the time required to construct a richly populated temporal dataset. This paper uses a new class of continental scaled PICS clusters (also known as Extended PICS or EPICS), to demonstrate their capability in increasing temporal frequency of the calibration time series which ultimately allows calibration and stability assessment at a much finer scale compared to the traditional PICS-based method while also reducing any single location's potential impact to the overall assessment. The use of EPICS as a calibration site was evaluated using data from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Sentinel-2A&B Multispectral Instrument (MSI) images at their full spatial resolutions. Initial analysis suggests that EPICS, at its full potential and with nominal cloud consideration, can significantly decrease the temporal revisit interval of moderate resolution sensors to as much as of 0.33 day (3 collects/day). A traditional PICS is expected to have a temporal uncertainty (defined as the ratio of temporal standard deviation and temporal mean) of 2-5% for TOA reflectance. Over the same time period EPICS produced a temporal uncertainty of 3%. But the advantage to be leveraged is the ability to detect sensor change quicker due to the denser dataset and reduce the impact of any potential local' changes. Moreover, this approach can be extended to any on-orbit sensor. An initial attempt to quantify the minimum detectable change (a threshold slope value which must be exceeded by the reflectance trend to be considered statistically significant) suggests that the use of EPICS can decrease the time period up to approximately half of that found using traditional PICS-based approach.

TI  - Assessing the performance of decision tree and neural network models in mapping soil properties
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To build any spatial soil database, a set of environmental data including digital elevation model (DEM) and satellite images beside geomorphic landscape description are essentials. Such a database, integrates field observations and laboratory analyses data with the results obtained from qualitative and quantitative models. So far, various techniques have been developed for soil data processing. The performance of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Decision Tree (DT) models was compared to map out some soil attributes in Alborz Province, Iran. Terrain attributes derived from a DEM along with Landsat 8 ETM+, geomorphology map, and the routine laboratory analyses of the studied area were used as input data. The relationships between soil properties (including sand, silt, clay, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, and carbonates) and the environmental variables were assessed using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Principle Components Analysis. Slope, elevation, geomforms, carbonate index, stream network, wetness index, and the band's number 2, 3, 4, and 5 were the most significantly correlated variables. ANN and DT did not show the same accuracy in predicting all parameters. The DT model showed higher performances in estimating sand (R-2=0.73), silt (R-2=0.70), clay (R-2=0.72), organic carbon (R-2=0.71), and carbonates (R-2=0.70). While the ANN model only showed higher performance in predicting soil electrical conductivity (R-2=0.95). The results showed that determination the best model to use, is dependent upon the relation between the considered soil properties with the environmental variables. However, the DT model showed more reasonable results than the ANN model in this study. The results showed that before using a certain model to predict variability of all soil parameters, it would be better to evaluate the efficiency of all possible models for choosing the best fitted model for each property. In other words, most of the developed models are site-specific and may not be applicable to use for predicting other soil properties or other area.

TI  - Beyond "greening": which paradigms shape sustainable pest management strategies in the European Union?
T2  - BIOCONTROL
M3  - Review
AB  - Various strategies exist to manage agriculture pests with few or without conventional pesticides. Farmers can rely on ecosystem services delivered by agro-biodiversity or use biotechnologies and biological plant protection products (PPP). Integrated Pest Management (IPM) has developed as an approach that combines these tools. The adoption of IPM has been supported by the European Union (EU) in the recent years. In parallel, EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has strengthened its agri-environmental incentives to further protect biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. These evolutions have been presented as the greening of the CAP. We argue that this greening aims at strengthening agricultural competitiveness while preserving biodiversity. Hence, we suggest that the EU policy is entrenched in a green productivism paradigm, which objective is to produce more with less to achieve green growth within capitalism. Nonetheless, this worldview does not content all European farmers. We explain that those who reject productivism treasure a sufficiency paradigm by refusing the use of biotechnologies and biological PPP to consolidate their autonomy, especially regarding markets. By producing enough, and not more with less, they achieve complementary objectives, notably meeting their consumers' expectations and perpetuating their productive resources. We based our arguments on discussions with farmers, participation to various meetings between 2013 and 2017 where these issues were debated, and the analyses of the EU policies, scientific studies, as well as the farmer unions' and the companies' publications.

TI  - DOUBLE LAYER PROGRAMMING MODEL TO THE SCHEDULING OF REMOTE SENSING DATA PROCESSING TASKS
T2  - DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS-SERIES S
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data are widely used in disaster and environment monitoring. To complete the tasks associated with processing these data, it is a practical and pressing problem to match the resources for these data with data processing centers in real or near-real time and complete as many tasks on time as possible. However, scheduling remotely sensed data processing tasks has two phases, namely, task assignment and task scheduling. This paper presents a model using bilevel optimization, which considers task assignment and task scheduling as a single problem. Using this architecture, a mathematical model for both levels of the problem is presented. To solve the mathematical model, this paper presents a cooperative coevolution algorithm that combines the advantages of a very fast simulated annealing algorithm with a learnable ant colony optimization algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach compared with the conventional method is demonstrated through empirical results.

TI  - Gravity transfer characteristics and common relationships of mangroves in China and mangrove communities in typical area.
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of society and economy, the gravity center and spatial structure of mangrove communities would change. The center of gravity model could be used to construct transfer distance and direction, and explore spatial transfer characteristics and distribution pattern of mangrove communities. Multi-source and multi-temporal remote sensing data in past 25 years were used to extract information of mangrove forests in China and information of Avicennia marina, Kandelia obovata, Aegiceras corniculatum, Phragmites karka and Cyperus malaccensis in a typical reserve of Zhangjiang Estuary by GIS and remote sensing technology. With the center of gravity model, gravity transfer characteristics and common relations of mangroves in China and mangrove communities in the typical reserve of Zhangjiang Estuary were analyzed from whole to part perspective. The results showed that (1) There was a clear deviation of mangrove center of gravity in the northeast direction. This deviation was mainly reflected in longitude, with an imbalance between the east and the west. Mangrove center of gravity was mainly located at the entrance to the sea, and pointed to the area where river network was dense and economic was prosperous. (2) Center of gravity of mangrove communities was dominated by the direction of southeast, pointing to high aggregation area of the mangrove communities. Mangrove communities gradually spread to northern and eastern areas. The center of gravity showed a trend toward the north. (3) The common characteristics of provincial-level mangrove forests and those in the typical area were of consistency, retraction and hierarchy. The main features were as follows: both directions of gravity transfer of mangrove forests and mangrove communities were basically consistent with the trend of coastal intertidal zone; the directions of track of the two pointed to the harbor or estuary bay covered well by waves; the center of gravity of provincial-level mangrove forests and those in the typical area had different degrees of retraction after 2005 and 2011, respectively. To a certain extent, the center of gravity transfer of mangrove communities in the typical area belonged to the enlarged situation of provincial-level mangrove gravity center transfer, with the former reflecting the local internal structure characteristics and the latter reflecting the overall characteristics. Our results would help management agencies to propose protective measures and plans for the balanced, stable and sustainable growth of mangrove.

TI  - Using healthcare-seeking behaviour to estimate the number of Nipah outbreaks missed by hospital-based surveillance in Bangladesh
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Understanding the true burden of emergent diseases is critical for assessing public-health impact. However, surveillance often relies on hospital systems that only capture a minority of cases. We use the example of Nipah-virus infection in Bangladesh, which has a high case-fatality ratio and frequent person-to-person transmission, to demonstrate how healthcare-seeking data can estimate true burden.Methods We fit logistic-regression models to data from a population-based, healthcare-seeking study of encephalitis cases to characterize the impact of distance and mortality on attending one of three surveillance hospital sites. The resulting estimates of detection probabilities, as a function of distance and outcome, are applied to all observed Nipah outbreaks between 2007 and 2014 to estimate the true burden.Results The probability of attending a surveillance hospital fell from 82% for people with fatal encephalitis living 10km away from a surveillance hospital to 54% at 50km away. The odds of attending a surveillance hospital are 3.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.6, 6.6) times greater for patients who eventually died (i.e. who were more severely ill) compared with those who survived. Using these probabilities, we estimated that 119 Nipah outbreaks (95% confidence interval: 103, 140)-an average of 15 outbreaks per Nipah season-occurred during 2007-14; 62 (52%) were detected.Conclusions Our findings suggest hospital-based surveillance missed nearly half of all Nipah outbreaks. This analytical method allowed us to estimate the underlying burden of disease, which is important for emerging diseases where healthcare access may be limited.

TI  - Cancer-bone microenvironmental interactions promotes STAT3 signaling
T2  - MOLECULAR CARCINOGENESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) patients' mortality is mainly attributed to complications caused by metastasis of the tumor cells to organs critical for survival, such as bone. We hypothesized that PCa cell-bone interactions would promote paracrine signaling. A panel of PCa cell lines were cocultured with hydroxyapatite ([HA]; inorganic component of bone) of different densities. Conditioned media (CM) was collected and analyzed for calcium levels and effect on paracrine signaling, cell migration, and viability in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that calcium levels were elevated in CM from cancer cell-bone cocultures, compared to media or cancer cells alone, and this could be antagonized by ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N ',N '-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a calcium chelator, or knockdown of Snail protein. We also observed increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation and paracrine cell proliferation and migration in LNCaP cells incubated with CM from various cell lines; this phosphorylation and cell migration could be antagonized by Snail knockdown or various inhibitors including EGTA, STAT3 inhibitor (WP1066) or cathepsin L inhibitor (Z-FY-CHO). In vivo, higher HA bone density increased tumorigenicity and migration of tumor cells to HA implant. Our study shows that cancer-bone microenvironment interactions lead to calcium-STAT3 signaling, which may present an area for therapeutic targeting of metastatic PCa.

TI  - Evolution of the Use of Completion Axillary Lymph Node Dissection in Patients with T1/2N0M0 Breast Cancer and Tumour-Involved Sentinel Lymph Nodes Undergoing Mastectomy: A Cohort Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn breast cancer, completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) was previously recommended for patients with at least one tumour-affected sentinel lymph node (SLN). Several prospective trials predominantly in patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery showed no benefit and increased arm morbidity with this procedure. We report the influence of these trials on clinical practice of patients undergoing mastectomy.MethodsWe analysed prospectively collected data from patients with primary invasive breast cancer treated at German breast cancer units between January 2008 and December 2015. Time trends of cALND rates were analysed in patients undergoing mastectomy for T1/2N0M0 breast cancer with one or two tumour-involved SLNs. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors influencing the decision not to perform cALND.ResultsAmong the entire study cohort of 166,074 patients treated at 179 breast cancer units, 4093 patients (2%) had T1/2N0M0 breast cancer with one or two tumour-involved SLNs and underwent mastectomy. cALND rates decreased from 89.9% in 2010 to 55.5% in 2015 (p<0.001). Rates decreased from 82% to 8% in patients with micrometastatic SLN disease and from 93% to 63% in those with macrometastasis (p<0.001). In multivariable analysis, factors associated with omission of cALND were treatment at a general, nonacademic hospital, pT1 status, older age, higher number of removed SLNs, fewer tumour-affected SLNs, and SLN micrometastasis (all p<0.001).ConclusionsDespite limited evidence from prospective trials relating to the omission of cALND specifically in patients undergoing mastectomy, our nationwide data show that use of cALND decreased in these patients in routine clinical practice.

TI  - Radical hysterectomy in cervical cancer-Controversies in surgery
T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a long history of controversial discussions regarding the surgical treatment for cervical cancer. The operative approach is the treatment of choice for early stage cervical cancer. Abdominal radical hysterectomy combined with a radical pelvic lymph node dissection represents the standard first-line treatment for early cervical cancer. This surgical procedure has proven its effectiveness in several clinical studies; however, this approach is also associated with various risks and side effects, which can severely impair the postoperative quality of life of patients. This is mostly caused by injuries to peripheral and autonomous nerves, adjacent organs and lymphatic vessels. Several new strategies have been developed in order to reduce this high morbidity and ideally not to increase the mortality. The most important approaches are laparoscopic radical hysterectomy, total mesometrial resection and sentinel lymph node dissection. The question arises whether a reduced morbidity implies a higher mortality. For example, the surprising results of the recent LACC study showed a higher mortality for patients treated by laparoscopic surgery questioned the previous guideline recommendations. Based on the current literature this review discusses the advantages and risks associated with these "new" surgical procedures compared to the previous standard in the treatment of early cervical cancer

TI  - Mapping Crop Residue by Combining Landsat and WorldView-3 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A unique, multi-tiered approach was applied to map crop residue cover on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay, United States. Field measurements of crop residue cover were used to calibrate residue mapping using shortwave infrared (SWIR) indices derived from WorldView-3 imagery for a 12-km x 12-km footprint. The resulting map was then used to calibrate and subsequently classify crop residue mapping using Landsat imagery at a larger spatial resolution and extent. This manuscript describes how the method was applied and presents results in the form of crop residue cover maps, validation statistics, and quantification of conservation tillage implementation in the agricultural landscape. Overall accuracy for maps derived from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 were comparable at roughly 92% (+/- 10%). Tillage class-specific accuracy was also strong and ranged from 75% to 99%. The approach, which employed a 12-band image stack of six tillage spectral indices and six individual Landsat bands, was shown to be adaptable to variable soil moisture conditions-under dry conditions (Landsat 7, 14 May 2015) the majority of predictive power was attributed to SWIR indices, and under wet conditions (Landsat 8, 22 May 2015) single band reflectance values were more effective at explaining variability in residue cover. Summary statistics of resulting tillage class occurrence matched closely with conservation tillage implementation totals reported by Maryland and Delaware to the Chesapeake Bay Program. This hybrid method combining WorldView-3 and Landsat imagery sources shows promise for monitoring progress in the adoption of conservation tillage practices and for describing crop residue outcomes associated with a variety of agricultural management practices.

TI  - Secretory carcinoma of the breast: clinicopathologic profile of 14 cases emphasising distant metastatic potential
T2  - HISTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Secretory carcinoma of the breast (SCB) is a rare histological type of breast carcinoma with a generally indolent clinical behaviour. We aim to elucidate the clinical, pathological and molecular findings of SCB cases and identify characteristics associated with aggressive clinical courses. Methods and results Fourteen patients with SCB were identified, including 12 women and two men, with a median age of 56 years (range = 8-81 years). Clinical data, histological diagnosis, molecular findings and follow-up were reviewed. Eight patients presented with palpable masses and four patients with radiographic abnormalities. All cases were unilateral. Surgical procedures included excisional biopsies and ipsilateral mastectomies. In 10 cases, oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) results were obtained, with six cases positive for ER and three positive for PR. All cases lacked HER2 overexpression. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 10 cases, and two patients had axillary lymph node metastasis. Follow-up ranged from 21 to 212 months (median = 70 months). Two patients developed distant metastasis of SCB. Molecular analysis of these aggressive tumours revealed amplification of the 16p13.3 locus, a TERT promotor mutation and loss of 9p21.3 locus. Review of the literature for SCB cases with distant metastasis was performed. Conclusions Although SCBs are generally associated with a favourable prognosis, our study and review demonstrate that a subset of SCBs may develop distant metastases. Further studies are warranted to identify markers predictive of more aggressive clinical behaviour in this rare breast cancer subtype.

TI  - Using Forest Inventory Data with Landsat 8 Imagery to Map Longleaf Pine Forest Characteristics in Georgia, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study improved on previous efforts to map longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) over large areas in the southeastern United States of America by developing new methods that integrate forest inventory data, aerial photography and Landsat 8 imagery to model forest characteristics. Spatial, statistical and machine learning algorithms were used to relate United States Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field plot data to relatively normalized Landsat 8 imagery based texture. Modeling algorithms employed include softmax neural networks and multiple hurdle models that combine softmax neural network predictions with linear regression models to estimate key forest characteristics across 2.3 million ha in Georgia, USA. Forest metrics include forest type, basal area and stand density. Results show strong relationships between Landsat 8 imagery based texture and field data (map accuracy > 0.80; square root basal area per ha residual standard errors < 1; natural log transformed trees per ha < 1.081). Model estimates depicting spatially explicit, fine resolution raster surfaces of forest characteristics for multiple coniferous and deciduous species across the study area were created and made available to the public in an online raster database. These products can be integrated with existing tabular, vector and raster databases already being used to guide longleaf pine conservation and restoration in the region.

TI  - An adaptive topography correction method of gravity field and gradient measurements by polyhedral bodies
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new adaptive algorithm for topographic correction of gravity measurements based on a triangulated polyhedral representation of topographic surfaces. The adaptive grid resampling of topography is driven by the actual gravity effect on the station, which depends on the topographic mass and distance. This is a major improvement for accuracy and computational speed compared to some old algorithms that account only for distance. Today, global availability of gravity data allows the regional investigation (similar to 100 km anomaly wavelengths) of the lithosphere. The variety of different data sets (from terrestrial and aero surveys to satellite data), the size of possible investigation areas and the availability of high-resolution, digital terrain models ask for new approaches of topographic correction. Specifically, an algorithm for topographic correction should be useable on large-scale investigation areas, that is, correctly model the long wavelength signal of topography, work in spherical domain, be able to handle high-resolution topography data available and accurately represent topography. The new algorithm does consider sphericity of the Earth, calculates gravity gradients, deals with large data sets and uses an adaptive approach for resampling topography to save computation time significantly. The resampling uses an efficient quadtree representation of the topography grid. High resolution of the topography grid is only considered if it has a significant influence on the gravity effect at the station. This leads to an accurate representation of distant terrain and a massive speed up of computation time. The new algorithm is tested in an area of South America and Central Asia. The results are almost identical to calculations with constant grid resolutions, but need only 2 per cent of calculation time. This method enables to correct all gravity data sources (terrestrial, aero, satellite data) with the necessary topographic resolution with huge saving in computation time without presumptions by the user.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Using Preoperative Computed Tomographic Lymphography and Intraoperative Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging in Patients With Localized Tongue Cancer
T2  - JAMA OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE The indocyanine green method alone is unsuitable for sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with oral cancer because of poor transcutaneous identification of the fluorescent signal through the platysma and sternocleidomastoid muscles.OBJECTIVE To assess the utility of a novel sentinel lymph node biopsy technique using preoperative computed tomographic (CT) lymphography followed by the intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence method.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this prospective study performed at Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan, participants comprised 18 patients with previously untreated cN0 tongue cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) were enrolled from November 2012 to November 2016. Median observer period was 38 (range, 14-62) months. Analysis was completed between January 10 and March 10, 2018.INTERVENTIONS For preoperative sentinel lymph node mapping, CT lymphography was performed the day before sentinel lymph node biopsy. For sentinel lymph node biopsy, a minimum skin incision was made according to the predetermined location of sentinel lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph nodes were excised under indocyanine green fluorescence guidance.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Identification rate of preoperative sentinel lymph node mapping by CT lymphography and the number of sentinel lymph node successfully identified by the intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence method.RESULTS Among 18 patients (8 men, 10 women; median age, 65.5 [range, 40-83] years), sentinel lymph nodes could be mapped by preoperative CT lymphography in 16 patients (89%). At least 1 sentinel lymph node was successfully identified and excised in each of these 16 patients using intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence. Among the 16 patients in whom sentinel lymph nodes were excised, metastases to sentinel lymph nodes were found in 5 patients (31%).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The novel sentinel lymph node biopsy technique of preoperative CT lymphography mapping with intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence has a high potential for identifying sentinel lymph nodes in patients with cN0 tongue cancer. Because the intraoperative indocyanine green method alone cannot identify sentinel lymph nodes in the neck region, this combined method has clinical potential as a sentinel lymph node biopsy technique that does not require radioisotopes.

TI  - Estimation of HCHO Column Using a Multiple Regression Method with OMI and MODIS Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have estimated the vertical column density (VCD) of formaldehyde (HCHO) on a global scale using a multiple linear regression method (MRM) with Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. HCHO VCDs were estimated in regions of biogenic, pyrogenic, and anthropogenic emissions using independent variables, including NO2 VCD, land surface temperature (LST), an enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the mean fire radiative power (MFRP), which are strongly correlated with HCHO. To evaluate the HCHO estimates obtained using the MRM, we compared estimates of HCHO VCD data measured by OMI (HCHOOMI) with those estimated by multiple linear regression equations (MRE) (HCHOMRE). Good MRM performances were found, having the average statistical values (R = 0.91, slope = 1.03, mean bias = -0.12 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2), percent difference = 11.27%) between HCHOMRE and HCHOOMI in our study regions where high HCHO levels are present. Our results demonstrate that the MRM can be a useful tool for estimating atmospheric HCHO levels.

TI  - Characterization of total suspended solid dynamics in a large shallow lake using long-term daily satellite images
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Large, shallow-water lakes located on floodplains play an important role in creating highly productive ecosystems and are prone to high concentrations of suspended solids due to sediment resuspension. In this study, the aim was to determine the dominant processes governing the total suspended solid (TSS) concentration at the water surface in Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia, which is a large, shallow-water lake. Satellite remotely sensed daily reflectance data from 2003 to 2017 were used. Seasonal changes in TSS concentration indicated that bottom sediment resuspension during dry seasons was mostly caused by wind and the TSS concentration was closely correlated with the water depth of the lake. The TSS concentration during flood periods was controlled by both wind and inflow currents from the Tonle Sap River. Additionally, we confirmed that surface/subsurface flow with a low TSS concentration from forests on the floodplain lowered the TSS concentration year round, except during August and September. This fact implied that the floodplain forest area decrease may increase the lake TSS concentration. An analysis of the long-term changes in TSS indicated that a decrease in the water level during flood periods resulted in the high TSS concentrations observed during the subsequent dry periods. Therefore, climate change and water resource development, which are likely to cause water level reductions in the Mekong River during flood periods, may increase the TSS concentration in Tonle Sap Lake, particularly during the dry season.

TI  - Verification of <i>Fengyun-3D</i> MWTS and MWHS Calibration Accuracy Using GPS Radio Occultation Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The newly launched Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite carries microwave temperature sounder (MWTS) and microwave humidity sounder (MWHS), providing the global atmospheric temperature and humidity measurements. It is important to assess the in orbit performance of MWTS and MWHS and understand their calibration accuracy before using them in numerical weather prediction and many other applications such as hurricane monitoring. This study aims at quantifying the biases of MWTS and MWHS observations relative to the simulations from the collocated Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) data. Using the collocated FY-3C Global Navigation Satellite System Occultation Sounder (GNOS) RO data under clear-sky conditions as inputs to Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM), brightness temperatures and viewing angles are simulated for the upper level sounding channels of MWTS and MWHS. In order to obtain O - B statistics under clear sky conditions, a cloud detection algorithm is developed by using the two MWTS channels with frequencies at 50.3 and 51.76 GHz and the two MWHS channels with frequencies centered at 89 and 150 GHz. The analysis shows that for the upper air sounding channels, the mean biases of the MWTS observations relative to the GPS RO simulations are negative for channels 5-9, with absolute values < 1 K, and positive for channels 4 and 10, with values < 0.5 K. For the MWHS observations, the mean biases in brightness temperature are negative for channels 2-6, with absolute values < 2.6 K and relatively small standard deviations. The mean biases are also negative for channels 11-13, with absolute values < 1.3 K, but with relatively large standard deviations. The biases of both MWTS and MWHS show scan-angle dependence and are asymmetrical across the scan line. The biases for the upper air MWTS and MWHS sounding channels are larger than those previously derived for the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder.

The daily temporal resolution of passive microwave brightness temperatures provides the most widely utilized observations to detect melt onset but are limited to a spatial resolution of 25 km. Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery provides a much higher spatial resolution (20-100 m) but melt onset detection remains challenging because of i) insufficient temporal resolution to facilitate accurate melt onset detection, ii) inconsistent viewing geometries and iii) limited image availability across the Arctic. Here, we construct high temporal resolution composite gamma nought backscatter products (1 day, 1-2 day and 2-4 day) using Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 over a close-to-seamless revisit region located in northern Canadian Arctic and Greenland for estimating melt onset over Arctic sea ice in 2016 and 2017. We employ the necessary radiometric terrain flattening and local resolution weighting techniques to generate normalised backscatter over the entire study region, removing restrictions limiting analysis to a single sensor or track's swath width by integrating both ascending and descending passes into the composite products. Results indicate that higher temporal resolution multi-sensor composite gamma nought products (1 day) that make use of the most imagery provide a robust temporal evolution of the backscatter. This allows for more representative estimates of melt onset as it is easier to separate the melt onset threshold from winter variability that is otherwise a considerable challenge for SAR based melt onset algorithms because of inconsistent temporal resolution. Multi-sensor composite gamma naught melt onset detection is in good agreement with melt onset estimates derived from the Advance Scatterometer (ASCAT) backscatter values and passive microwave brightness temperatures over homogenous sea ice regions but very noticeable improvement was found within narrow channels and regions with more heterogeneous sea ice. In anticipation of the availability of data from even more SAR satellites with the launch of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission, the multi-sensor composite gamma nought approach presented here may offer the most robust approach to estimate the timing of melt onset over sea ice across the Arctic using high spatiotemporal resolution SAR.

TI  - Risks of Mixtures of Oil Sands Contaminants to a Sensitive Mayfly Sentinel, <i>Hexagenia</i>
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Tailings ponds in northeastern Alberta, Canada contain massive amounts of oil sands process water (OSPW) that cannot currently be released due to the toxicity of some components. Limited space and the need for reclamation of oil sands operation sites will necessitate the release of OSPW in the near future. Knowledge of the composition and toxicity of OSPW is lacking yet is crucial for both risk assessment and management planning. This study examines chronic toxicity of a mixture of OSPW components sodium naphthenate and naphthenic acid (NA) to nymphs of the mayfly Hexagenia spp. in control and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)-spiked sediment treatments. The objective of this study was to determine whether the addition of the PAH-spiked sediment significantly contributed to or masked responses of these sensitive mayflies to mixtures of NA. Mean survival in nymphs exposed to NA and PAH-spiked sediment treatments was reduced by 48% compared to those exposed to the NA mixture alone. Lethal responses were observed in all of the PAH-spiked sediment treatments. However, within PAH-spiked and control sediment treatments, there was no significant difference in nymph survival due to NA concentration, indicating that changes in survivorship were predominantly a reflection of increased mortality associated with sediment PAHs and not to the NA mixture treatment. Sublethal effects on body segment ratios suggest that mayflies exposed to NA and PAH-spiked sediment, as well as those exposed to the highest NA concentration tested (1 mg/L) and control sediment, made developmental trade-offs in order to emerge faster and escape a stressful environment. These results reveal that the release of OSPW to the surrounding environment could cause a reduction in mayfly populations. Mayflies provide ecosystem services and are an important food source for higher trophic levels in both the aquatic and terrestrial communities.

TI  - A phenology-based spectral and temporal feature selection method for crop mapping from satellite time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on crop distribution and its changes is important for food security and environmental management. Although time series analysis is a widely-used and useful tool to characterize the seasonal dynamics of crops, the traditional image stacking approach misses important phenological events. This condition makes it difficult to identify the spectral and temporal features that are potentially important for crop identification, and therefore, makes it difficult to determine the optimal feature inputs for classifying crops with both high accuracy and low computation time. To address this gap, we developed a method to automatically select the spectro-temporal features by mining crop phenology information so as to improve the accuracy of crop classifications. This method of Phenology-based Spectral and Temporal Feature Selection (PSTFS) contains two major components: to identify the features with the highest separability between each pair of classes, and to prune redundant features to retain the best for classification. Using this optimal set of features and support vector machines (SVMs), we generated a high-quality corn cultivation map of China's Heilongjiang Province for 2011. The corn map had accuracies greater than 85% and agreed well with the corn census areas. We also demonstrate the goodness of this method for selecting features with high interpretability: it identified two phenological stages (three leaf and milky mature) that could best separate corn from other land use classes in the region. Our approach indicates the great potential for using the PSTFS method in conjunction with SVM classifiers to accurately map crop types based on satellite time series data.

TI  - Mapping the Spatial-Temporal Dynamics of Vegetation Response Lag to Drought in a Semi-Arid Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought, as an extreme climate event, affects the ecological environment for vegetation and agricultural production. Studies of the vegetative response to drought are paramount to providing scientific information for drought risk mitigation. In this paper, the spatial-temporal pattern of drought and the response lag of vegetation in Nebraska were analyzed from 2000 to 2015. Based on the long-term Daymet data set, the standard precipitation index (SPI) was computed to identify precipitation anomalies, and the Gaussian function was applied to obtain temperature anomalies. Vegetation anomaly was identified by dynamic time warping technique using a remote sensing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. Finally, multilayer correlation analysis was applied to obtain the response lag of different vegetation types. The results show that Nebraska suffered severe drought events in 2002 and 2012. The response lag of vegetation to drought typically ranged from 30 to 45 days varying for different vegetation types and human activities (water use and management). Grasslands had the shortest response lag (similar to 35 days), while forests had the longest lag period (similar to 48 days). For specific crop types, the response lag of winter wheat varied among different regions of Nebraska (35-45 days), while soybeans, corn and alfalfa had similar response lag times of approximately 40 days.

TI  - Constructing a Finer-Resolution Forest Height in China Using ICESat/GLAS, Landsat and ALOS PALSAR Data and Height Patterns of Natural Forests and Plantations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring forest height is crucial to determine the structure and biodiversity of forest ecosystems. However, detailed spatial patterns of forest height from 30 m resolution remotely sensed data are currently unavailable. In this study, we present a new method for mapping forest height by combining spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with imagery from multiple remote sensing sources, including the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), the Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radars (PALSAR), and topographic data. The nationwide forest heights agree well with results obtained from 525 independent forest height field measurements, yielding correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.92, 4.31 m, and 3.87 m, respectively. Forest heights derived from remotely sensed data range from 1.41 m to 38.94 m, with an average forest height of 16.08 +/- 3.34 m. Mean forest heights differ only slightly among different forest types. In natural forests, conifer forests have the greatest mean forest heights, whereas in plantations, bamboo forests have the greatest mean forest heights. Important predictors for modeling forest height using the random forest regression tree method include slope, surface reflectance of red bands and HV backscatter. The uncertainty caused by the uneven distribution of Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) footprints is estimated to be 0.64 m. After integrating PALSAR data into the model, the uncertainty associated with forest height estimation was reduced by 4.58%. Our finer-resolution forest height could serve as a benchmark to estimate forest carbon storage and would greatly contribute to better understanding the roles of ecological engineering projects in China.

TI  - Unraveling location-specific and time-dependent interactions between soil water content and environmental factors in cropped sandy soils using Sentinel-1 and moisture probes
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in sensor technologies provide the potential for real-time monitoring of soil moisture status. Little work has been conducted to study the spatial and temporal variations of soil water content at the field scale and the interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors in cropped fields during the growing season. In this study, we assessed the spatial and temporal variations of surface soil water content (0-0.1 m) using seven in-situ soil moisture probes and Sentinel-1 satellite data over the 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons in irrigated fields of the Central Sands Plains, Wisconsin, USA. An empirical multiple linear regression model was developed between the soil water content with Sentinel-1 backscatter data. The model was evaluated with leave-one-group-out cross-validation, which showed an R-2 of 0.60, mean error of -0.00 m(3) m(-3), root mean square error of 0.02 m(3) m(-3), and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.75. Soil volumetric water content (VWC) and soil water deficit (SWD) were mapped at 30-m resolution every 6-12 days across one field (DU field at the Wallendal farm). Using two statistical metrics ("first metric" and "last metric") and a bootstrapping approach, the location-specific and time-dependent interactions between estimated soil water content and environmental controlling factors across the DU field during the cropping season were evaluated, and it was found that such interactions were affected by initial soil water content and plant stress status. The robustness of the model needs to be improved in the future by collecting more VWC measurements in different soil and crop conditions. The method has the potential to provide a baseline soil moisture map and can be coupled with mechanistic models and subsoil VWC measurements for improved irrigation management and water use efficiency under a changing climate.

TI  - Evaluating the Performance of Satellite-Derived Vegetation Indices for Estimating Gross Primary Productivity Using FLUXNET Observations across the Globe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived vegetation indices (VIs) have been widely used to approximate or estimate gross primary productivity (GPP). However, it remains unclear how the VI-GPP relationship varies with indices, biomes, timescales, and the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effect. We examined the relationship between VIs and GPP for 121 FLUXNET sites across the globe and assessed how the VI-GPP relationship varied among a variety of biomes at both monthly and annual timescales. We used three widely-used VIs: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and 2-band EVI (EVI2) as well as a new VI - NIRV and used surface reflectance both with and without BRDF correction from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) to calculate these indices. The resulting traditional (NDVI, EVI, EVI2, and NIRV) and BRDF-corrected (NDVIBRDF, EVIBRDF, EVI2(BRDF), and NIRV, BRDF) VIs were used to examine the VI-GPP relationship. At the monthly scale, all VIs were moderate or strong predictors of GPP, and the BRDF correction improved their performance. EVI2(BRDF) and NIRV, BRDF had similar performance in capturing the variations in tower GPP as did the MODIS GPP product. The VIs explained lower variance in tower GPP at the annual scale than at the monthly scale. The BRDF-correction of surface reflectance did not improve the VI-GPP relationship at the annual scale. The VIs had similar capability in capturing the interannual variability in tower GPP as MODIS GPP. VIs were influenced by temperature and water stresses and were more sensitive to temperature stress than to water stress. VIs in combination with environmental factors could improve the prediction of GPP than VIs alone. Our findings can help us better understand how the VI-GPP relationship varies among indices, biomes, and timescales and how the BRDF effect influences the VI-GPP relationship.

M3  - Article
AB  - Based on MODIS NDVI remote sensing and contemporaneous weather data, we used trend analysis, coefficient of variation and Hurst index to investigate the dynamics of vegetation coverage in Ningxia from 2000 to 2016. The vegetation coverage showed an overall increasing trend over time, with a large difference between north and south. NDVI increased significantly from 2000 to 2005, relatively slowly increased from 2006 to 2011, and slightly decreased from 2012 to 2016. Precipitation and humidity index showed the greatest response to vegetation growth. In the growing season, NDVI showed an overall rising trend, with 79.88% of the study region showing significant increase in NDVI. Seasonal NDVI increased at a rate of 0.026 . 10 a(-1), 0.07 . 10 a(-1) and 0.049 . 10 a(-1) in spring, summer and autumn respectively, during 2000-2016. Although the vegetation coverage in 62.13% of the vegetation-covered area continued to increase, some regions exhibited decreasing vegetation coverage. The continued improved area in vegetation coverage in southern forest area was larger than that in northern irrigation area around the Yellow River.

TI  - Estimating and Examining the Sensitivity of Different Vegetation Indices to Fractions of Vegetation Cover at Different Scaling Grids for Early Stage Acacia Plantation Forests Using a Fixed-Wing UAS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the information on land conditions and especially green vegetation cover is important for monitoring ecosystem dynamics. The fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) is a key variable that can be used to observe vegetation cover trends. Conventionally, satellite data are utilized to compute these variables, although computations in regions such as the tropics can limit the amount of available observation information due to frequent cloud coverage. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) have become increasingly prominent in recent research and can remotely sense using the same methods as satellites but at a lower altitude. UASs are not limited by clouds and have a much higher resolution. This study utilizes a UAS to determine the emerging trends for FVC estimates at an industrial plantation site in Indonesia, which utilizes fast-growing Acacia trees that can rapidly change the land conditions. First, the UAS was utilized to collect high-resolution RGB imagery and multispectral images for the study area. The data were used to develop general land use/land cover (LULC) information for the site. Multispectral data were converted to various vegetation indices, and within the determined resolution grid (5, 10, 30 and 60 m), the fraction of each LULC type was analyzed for its correlation between the different vegetation indices (Vis). Finally, a simple empirical model was developed to estimate the FVC from the UAS data. The results show the correlation between the FVC (acacias) and different Vis ranging from R-2 = 0.66-0.74, 0.76-0.8, 0.84-0.89 and 0.93-0.94 for 5, 10, 30 and 60 m grid resolutions, respectively. This study indicates that UAS-based FVC estimations can be used for observing fast-growing acacia trees at a fine scale resolution, which may assist current restoration programs in Indonesia.

TI  - The Diary of a Modern Eurasian in the Book by the Buryat Poet B. Dugarov <i>The Sutra of Moments</i> (Ulan-Ude, 2011)
T2  - TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZDANIE-TEXT BOOK PUBLISHING
M3  - Article
AB  - The diary book by the Buryat poet Bair Dugarov, The Sutra of Moments, was published in 2011. It is based on a real poet's diary which he wrote in 1982. More than 25 years later, the author assumed that the diaries of the Soviet (or rather late Soviet) time, which were not intended to be made public, could be of interest to readers of the early 21st century.One of the important ideas of the book is the Eurasian essence of a modern Russian poet. The author explains Eurasianism as the unity of Eastern and Russian consciousness in the worldview and in the works of the bilingual poet. While writing in non-native (or rather second native) language and realizing his involvement in Russian (more generally European) culture, Dugarov stays true to his Eastern-Asian mental community. His book provides a fertile material for explaining its "bilingualism" as the existence at the junction of two (or rather several) traditions, although its unique content is certainly due to the awareness of the primordial national identity.The Sutra of Moments diary book can be included in a series of prosaic works written by poets such as, for example, The Day Stars (1960) by Olga Bergholz or My Dagestan (1974) by Rasul Gamzatov. In such books, prose and poetry interweave: the prose part of the diary is invariably supplemented, commented, comprehended by poetic statements. But the form of Dugarov's prose-and-poetic diary is different for it incorporates the creative use of samples of Eastern prose-and-poetic writing, first of all the 13th-century historical literary monument The Secret History of the Mongols by an anonymous chronicler.The book title has the word "sutra" in it, which is translated from Sanskrit as a maxim, a concise utterance (literally, "thread"), or a set of fragmentary utterances united by some topic. In the preface, the author explains that he seeks to unite, to "stitch" all diary entries, memoirs, fragments of scientific speech and lyrical passages in a single outline. At the same time, Dugarov derives the meaning of this word from the Russian word "gut - [essence]. Human life, in his opinion, consists of moments, and their essence lies in the search for their purpose, in the need for self-knowledge, a person's self-determination at a difficult time, "at a sharp turn" of history.The general lyrical principle, implemented in The Sutra of Moments in the form of a prose-and-poetic diary, corresponds to the Eurasian perspective. The diary form contains poetic inclusions filled with emotional, deeply personal statements of the lyrical "self". Poetic inclusions are parts of a common thread (sutra), and diverse genre structures, while fixing the general outline, help to unfold the drama of self-comprehension of the bilingual poet, the Eurasian poet. The effect of the intertwining of "direct" utterances and metaphorical figurative speech reflects the process of self-comprehension, self-determination, which allows revealing features of a historical personality in the poet.

T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose It was aimed to examine the performance of planar, SPECT and SPECT/CT in lymph nodes detection of breast cancer.Materials and methods In-house made phantom was immersed in water-filled container. Disparate activities were injected into spheres emulating breast tumour (1.5 cm(3)), and adjacent lymph nodes (1, 0.5 and 0.25 cm(3)). Planar, SPECT and SPECT/CT scans were made at depths of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 cm. Rose Criteria was employed to investigate the detectability in planar imaging, and contrast to noise ratios (CNRs) were used in SPECT and SPECT/CT images. SPECT and SPECT/CT of 20 patients were randomly incorporated in the current study.Results CNR values from planar images at 1 cm depth for the simulated nodes of 1, 0.5 and 0.25 cm(3) were 36, 18 and 17, respectively. Whereas, those from SPECT/CT were 94.5, 63.3 and 20.9, repectively. CNRs from SPECT were lower than SPECT/CT in order of 60.1, 41.8 and 17.1 at the same depth. At 9 cm, CNR values of 1, 0.5 and 0.25 cm(3) from the planar images were 14, 6 and 5, respectively. While CNR values from SPECT were higher as 53.6, 38.0, and 14.9, respectively, and the greatest CNRs were in SPECT/CT as 85.7, 55.8, and 19.1, repectively.Conclusion The CNR values in SPECT/CT were 1.5- and 3.5-folds higher than SPECT and planar imaging at depth range 1-9 cm. The patients study exhibited larger SPECT/CT CNRs over SPECT as great as 1.6-fold. Copyright (C) 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The coastal wetlands of Chennai are increasingly being affected by anthropogenic factors, such as urbanization, residential, and industrial development. This study helps to monitor and map the dynamics of the coastal wetlands of Chennai using Landsat satellite images of 1988, 1996, 2006, and 2016 by following a supervised classification method. Post-classification wetland change detection was done in three temporal phases, that is, 1988-1996, 1996-2006, and 2006-2016. Change detection matrix analysis was performed to identify the from-to changes. Ground truthing was carried out to validate the wetland classes. The overall accuracy of the classified image was 79.29% and the kappa coefficient was 0.7600. These results were imported into a GIS environment for further analysis. It was found that the wetlands have decreased to an alarming extent in the past 28 years from 23.14% in 1988 to 15.79% in 2016 of the total study area, owing to conversion of wetlands into industrial development, urban expansion, and other developmental activities.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis and prediction of landscape patterns and change processes in the Central Zagros region, Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Unfortunately in recent decades Central Zagros region has been changed adversely due to human activities. To analyze changes land cover maps produced using multi-temporal classification of Landsat satellite images of TM, ETM+ and OLI sensors, respectively for 1989, 2000 and 2013 years. Then derived maps used as input data in Land Change Modeler (LCM) to predict land cover changes on 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 based on a historical scenario. Results of classification and prediction were used to analyze landscape patterns and change processes. Five landscape pattern metrics as Normalized Entropy, Edge Density, Patch Area, Patch Compactness and Relative Richness were used to quantify landscape pattern and occurrence of ten landscape change processes as Attrition, Aggregation, Dissection, Creation, Shrinkage, Perforation, Shift, Deformation, Enlargement and Fragmentation were studied. Land cover maps showed great changes in central Zagros region in Lorestan province (Iran) whereas residential areas have destroyed about 5166.7 km(2) of Zagros forests from 1989 to 2013. In this period residential areas are increased about 47.71 km(2). Based on a "historical" scenario between 2013 up to 2050 about 4304.66 km(2) of Zagros forests will lose and residential areas will increase about 244.51 km(2) from. Results of landscape pattern analysis show increase of all studied landscape pattern metrics values; Normalized entropy from 0.001895 to 0.45236, Relative richness 11.12 to 22.89 percent, Edge density 0.002-0.44 m/ha, Patch area 92.04-193171.7 ha and Patch compactness 0.006 to 0.568 patches/100ha from 1989 to 2050. More over occurred change processes in different periods include: Shift, Enlargement, Attrition, Aggregation, Creation and Dissection. Results of this study present a clear perspective of future for managers and planners and can be used in natural resources management and environmental policy making, as well as creating mitigation measures in vulnerable areas.

TI  - NCA-LDAS: Overview and Analysis of Hydrologic Trends for the National Climate Assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial hydrologic trends over the conterminous United States are estimated for 1980-2015 using the National Climate Assessment Land Data Assimilation System (NCA-LDAS) reanalysis. NCA-LDAS employs the uncoupled Noah version 3.3 land surface model at 0.125 degrees x 0.125 degrees forced with NLDAS-2 meteorology, rescaled Climate Prediction Center precipitation, and assimilated satellite-based soil moisture, snow depth, and irrigation products. Mean annual trends are reported using the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test at p < 0.1 significance. Results illustrate the interrelationship between regional gradients in forcing trends and trends in other land energy and water stores and fluxes. Mean precipitation trends range from +3 to +9 mm yr(-1) in the upper Great Plains and Northeast to -1 to -9 mm yr(-1) in the West and South, net radiation flux trends range from +0.05 to +0.20 W m(-2) yr(-1) in the East to -0.05 to -0.20 W m(-2) yr(-1) in the West, and U.S.-wide temperature trends average about +0.03 K yr(-1). Trends in soil moisture, snow cover, latent and sensible heat fluxes, and runoff are consistent with forcings, contributing to increasing evaporative fraction trends from west to east. Evaluation of NCA-LDAS trends compared to independent data indicates mixed results. The RMSE of U.S.-wide trends in number of snow cover days improved from 3.13 to 2.89 days yr(-1) while trend detection increased 11%. Trends in latent heat flux were hardly affected, with RMSE decreasing only from 0.17 to 0.16 W m(-2) yr(-1), while trend detection increased 2%. NCA-LDAS runoff trends degraded significantly from 2.6 to 16.1 mm yr(-1) while trend detection was unaffected. Analysis also indicated that NCA-LDAS exhibits relatively more skill in low precipitation station density areas, suggesting there are limits to the effectiveness of satellite data assimilation in densely gauged regions. Overall, NCA-LDAS demonstrates capability for quantifying physically consistent, U.S. hydrologic climate trends over the satellite era.

TI  - APPLICATION OF REMOTE SENSING AND GIS TO WATER TRANSPARENCY ESTIMATION IN RESERVOIRS
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the use of satellite imagery, GIS applications and in-situ measurements for the estimation of water transparency in reservoirs. Satellite data from the Sentinel-2 sensor and interpolation methods (Kriging, IDW, Natural Neighbour, Spline, Trend) were used for Secchi Disk Transparency (SDT). The results of this study show that the Sentinel-2 blue/red band ratio is a reliable predictor of SDT with the coefficient of determination equal to 0.83 (p< 0.001). The analysis indicates low coefficients of determination between the SDT calculated using interpolation methods based on GIS and in-situ measurements. The SDT modelled on the basis of satellite imagery was further used to indicate parts of the reservoir characterized by the highest uncertainty. The high uncertainty occurs near the shoreline of the reservoir and near the dam, which might be related to spectral reflectance from wooded areas, the overgrowth process or small depth of water. Additionally, it was observed that the highest uncertainty associated with the applied individual regression occurs in the case of limit values of the B2/B4 ratio which were not used during regression model development. The results show that more than 91% of the reservoir is characterized by a standard deviation less than 0.2, while only 0.25% shows values higher than 0.5. The results indicate that the application of remote sensing has important significance for water transparency estimation in reservoirs.

TI  - Integrating hydrogeological, geophysical, and remote-sensing data to identify fresh groundwater resources in arid regions: a case study from Western Iraq
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a limited availability of fresh groundwater in the western part of Iraq due to the aridity of the region, and new water supplies are required to meet the demands of potential industrial, mining, and agricultural projects. Consequently, the factors that influence the quality, availability, and distribution of fresh groundwater in the region were assessed by combining hydrogeological, geophysical, and remote-sensing data within a GIS environment. For this purpose, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation data, geophysical data (gravity and magnetic), and hydrogeological database were used in an integrated approach. It was concluded that both a regionally extensive, deep intergranular aquifer and shallow-fractured and karstified carbonate aquifers have the potential to contain fresh groundwater in the region. It was inferred from the hydrochemical statistics that the main factors controlling groundwater chemistry are the dissolution of evaporite minerals and the weathering of carbonate rocks. Gravity (measured and satellite) data and magnetic data were processed and interpreted to identify the locations and characteristics of subsurface structures. Source Parameter Imaging was applied to calculate depth to the magnetic basement map from gridded magnetic data. The decompensative anomaly maps showed that zones with fresh groundwater are distributed on gravity lows which coincide with areas with a large depth to basement. Most of the fresh groundwater zones in the region are distributed between the pre-Tertiary and Tertiary axes of the Ha'il Arch due to increased recharge along this structure caused by intense fracturing. The extension of the gravity high outside the Iraq territory may suggest similar freshwater zones of groundwater occur in Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.

TI  - METRIC and WaPOR Estimates of Evapotranspiration over the Lake Urmia Basin: Comparative Analysis and Composite Assessment
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration is one of the main components of water and energy balance. In this study, we compare two ET products, suitable for regional analysis at high spatial resolution: The recent WaPOR product developed by FAO and METRIC algorithm. WaPOR is based on ETLook, which is a two-source model and relies on microwave images. WaPOR is unique as it has no limitation under cloudy days, but METRIC is limited by clouds. METRIC and WaPOR are more sensitive to land surface temperature and soil moisture, respectively. Using two years (2010 and 2014) of data over Lake Urmia basin, we show that in most areas, ET from METRIC is higher than WaPOR and the difference has an ascending trend with the elevation. The ET of lysimeter station is fairly consistent with METRIC based on a single observation. Our analysis using NDVI and land use maps suggests that the histogram of ET from WaPOR might be more realistic than METRIC, but not its amount. The fraction of ET to precipitation in rainfed agriculture areas shows that WaPOR is more accurate than METRIC, mainly because in the absence of other water resources such as ground water annual ET cannot exceed annual precipitation. In contrast, METRIC produces a more realistic estimate than WaPOR over irrigated farms. The results suggest that the two products can complement each other.

TI  - Semiautomated Detection and Mapping of Vegetation Distribution in the Antarctic Environment Using Spatial-Spectral Characteristics of WorldView-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective monitoring of changes in the geographic distribution of cryospheric vegetation requires high-resolution and accurate baseline maps. The rationale of the present study is to compare multiple feature extraction approaches to remotely mapping vegetation in Antarctica, assessing which give the greatest accuracy and reproducibility relative to those currently available. This study provides precise, high-resolution, and refined baseline information on vegetation distribution as is required to enable future spatiotemporal change analyses of the vegetation in Antarctica. We designed and implemented a semiautomated customized normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) approach for extracting cryospheric vegetation by incorporating very high resolution (VHR) 8-band WorldView-2 (WV-2) satellite data. The viability of state-of-the-art target detection, spectral processing/matching, and pixel-wise supervised classification feature extraction techniques are compared with the customized NDVI approach devised in this study. An extensive quantitative and comparative assessment was made by evaluating four semiautomatic feature extraction approaches consisting of 16 feature extraction standalone methods (four customized NDVI plus 12 existing methods) for mapping vegetation on Fisher Island and Stornes Peninsula in the Larsemann Hills, situated on continental east Antarctica. The results indicated that the customized NDVI approach achieved superior performance (average bias error ranged from similar to 6.44 +/- 1.34% to similar to 11.55 +/- 1.34%) and highest statistical stability in terms of performance when compared with existing feature extraction approaches. Overall, the accuracy analysis of the vegetation mapping relative to manually digitized reference data (supplemented by validation with ground truthing) indicated that the 16 semi-automatic mapping methods representing four general feature extraction approaches extracted vegetated area from Fisher Island and Stornes Peninsula totalling between 2.38 and 3.72 km(2) (2.85 +/- 0.10 km(2) on average) with bias values ranging from 3.49 to 31.39% (average 12.81 +/- 1.88%) and average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.41 km(2) (14.73 +/- 1.88%). Further, the robustness of the analyses and results were endorsed by a cross-validation experiment conducted to map vegetation from the Schirmacher Oasis, East Antarctica. Based on the robust comparative analysis of these 16 methods, vegetation maps of the Larsemann Hills and Schirmacher Oasis were derived by ensemble merging of the five top-performing methods (Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering, Matched Filtering, Matched Filtering/Spectral Angle Mapper Ratio, NDVI-2, and NDVI-4). This study is the first of its kind to detect and map sparse and isolated vegetated patches (with smallest area of 0.25 m(2)) in East Antarctica using VHR data and to use ensemble merging of feature extraction methods, and provides access to an important indicator for environmental change.

AB  - Since the launch of Landsat-1 in 1972, the scientific domain of geo-information has been incrementally shaped through different periods, due to technology evolutions: in devices (satellites, UAV, IoT), in sensors (optical, radar, LiDAR), in software (GIS, WebGIS, 3D), and in communication (Big Data). Land Cover and Disaster Management remain the main big issues where these technologies are highly required. Data fusion methods and tools have been adapted progressively to new data sources, which are augmenting in volume, variety, and in quick accessibility. This Special Issue gives a snapshot of the current status of that adaptation, as well as looking at what challenges are coming soon.

TI  - A cloud detection algorithm for satellite imagery based on deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable detection of clouds is a critical pre-processing step in optical satellite based remote sensing. Currently, most methods are based on classifying invidual pixels from their spectral signatures, therefore they do not incorporate the spatial patterns. This often leads to misclassifications of highly reflective surfaces, such as human made structures or snow/ice. Multi-temporal methods can be used to alleviate this problem, but these methods introduce new problems, such as the need of a cloud-free image of the scene. In this paper, we introduce the Remote Sensing Network (RS-Net), a deep learning model for detection of clouds in optical satellite imagery, based on the U-net architecture. The model is trained and evaluated using the Landsat 8 Biome and SPARCS datasets, and it shows state-of-the-art performance, especially over biomes with hardly distinguishable scenery, such as clouds over snowy and icy regions. In particular, the performance of the model that uses only the RGB bands is significantly improved, showing promising results for cloud detection with smaller satellites with limited multi-spectral capabilities. Furthermore, we show how training the RS-Net models on data from an existing cloud masking method, which are treated as noisy data, leads to increased performance compared to the original method. This is validated by using the Fmask algorithm to annotate the Landsat 8 datasets, and then use these annotations as training data for regularized RS-Net models, which then show improved performance compared to the Fmask algorithm. Finally, the classification time of a full Landsat 8 product is 18.0 +/- 2.4 s for the largest RS-Net model, thereby making it suitable for production environments.

TI  - Evaluating the Temperature Difference Parameter in the SSEBop Model with Satellite-Observed Land Surface Temperature Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model uses the principle of satellite psychrometry to produce spatially explicit actual evapotranspiration (ETa) with remotely sensed and weather data. The temperature difference (dT) in the model is a predefined parameter quantifying the difference between surface temperature at bare soil and air temperature at canopy level. Because dT is derived from the average-sky net radiation based primarily on climate data, validation of the dT estimation is critical for assuring a high-quality ETa product. We used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to evaluate the SSEBop dT estimation for the conterminous United States. MODIS data (2008-2017) were processed to compute the 10-year average land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at 1 km resolution and 8-day interval. The observed dT (dT(o)) was computed from the LST difference between hot (NDVI < 0.25) and cold (NDVI > 0.7) pixels within each 2 degrees x 2 degrees sampling block. There were enough hot and cold pixels within each block to create dT(o) timeseries in the West Coast and South-Central regions. The comparison of dT(o) and modeled dT (dT(m)) showed high agreement, with a bias of 0.8 K and a correlation coefficient of 0.88 on average. This study concludes that the dT(m) estimation from the SSEBop model is reliable, which further assures the accuracy of the ETa estimation.

TI  - Spatio-temporal evolution of coastlines of sand-barrier lagoons over 26 years through historic Landsat imagery in Lingshui County, Hainan Province, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 35th International Geological Congress (IGC)
CL  - Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA
AB  - Coastlines of sand-barrier lagoons have provided significant locations for coastal economic development as has frequently occurred along the eastern coast of Hainan Island in southern China. Here, increased levels of human activity have greatly destabilized this ecosystem, subjecting it to major damage. The present study used innovative technology to classify and evaluate six phases of overlapping coastlines in Li'an and Xincun Lagoons in Lingshui County in southeastern Hainan Island between 1987 and 2013. This included the retrieval and integrated analysis of remote sensing images that was combined with data related to ocean dynamics and bathymetric surveys. Average historic high-tide lines were acquired by extracting humidity parameters from images using the Kauth-Thomas Transformation. Variations in the position and length of multiple coastlines were analyzed using GIS with a mathematical and statistical approach. The lengths of anthropogenic coastlines increased by 50% and moved seawards by 94.04 m in Li'an and 102.56 m in Xincun. Meanwhile, the areas in the Xincun and Li'an Lagoons decreased from 21.17 km(2) to 19.43 km(2) (-8.2%) and 9.94 km(2) to 7.92 km(2) (20.3%), respectively. Extensive human activity along the coastlines, such as saltwater aquaculture and farming, salt plant, and land reclamation, have profoundly altered the sedimentary geomorphology, local hydrodynamics, and the ecosystem itself. Consequently, the coastlines in Xincun and Li'an Lagoons in this newly designated pilot tourism city became vulnerable to modification. This research fills a critical gap related to the evolution of historical coastlines and provides an inventory of coastlines in support of coastal management.

TI  - Super-Resolution Land Cover Mapping Based on the Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Super-resolution mapping (SRM) is used to obtain fine-scale land cover maps from coarse remote sensing images. Spatial attraction, geostatistics, and using prior geographic information are conventional approaches used to derive fine-scale land cover maps. As the convolutional neural network (CNN) has been shown to be effective in capturing the spatial characteristics of geographic objects and extrapolating calibrated methods to other study areas, it may be a useful approach to overcome limitations of current SRM methods. In this paper, a new SRM method based on the CNN (SRMCNN) is proposed and tested. Specifically, an encoder-decoder CNN is used to model the nonlinear relationship between coarse remote sensing images and fine-scale land cover maps. Two real-image experiments were conducted to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the overall accuracy of the proposed SRMCNN method was 3% to 5% higher than that of two existing SRM methods. Moreover, the proposed SRMCNN method was validated by visualizing output features and analyzing the performance of different geographic objects.

TI  - The Role of Satellite-Based Remote Sensing in Improving Simulated Streamflow: A Review
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - A hydrological model is a useful tool to study the effects of human activities and climate change on hydrology. Accordingly, the performance of hydrological modeling is vitally significant for hydrologic predictions. In watersheds with intense human activities, there are difficulties and uncertainties in model calibration and simulation. Alternative approaches, such as machine learning techniques and coupled models, can be used for streamflow predictions. However, these models also suffer from their respective limitations, especially when data are unavailable. Satellite-based remote sensing may provide a valuable contribution for hydrological predictions due to its wide coverage and increasing tempo-spatial resolutions. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of satellite-based remote sensing in streamflow simulation. First, difficulties in hydrological modeling over highly regulated basins are further discussed. Next, the performance of satellite-based remote sensing (e.g., remotely sensed data for precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, snow properties, terrestrial water storage change, land surface temperature, river width, etc.) in improving simulated streamflow is summarized. Then, the application of data assimilation for merging satellite-based remote sensing with a hydrological model is explored. Finally, a framework, using remotely sensed observations to improve streamflow predictions in highly regulated basins, is proposed for future studies. This review can be helpful to understand the effect of applying satellite-based remote sensing on hydrological modeling.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is an important parameter used to characterize land vegetation growth patterns, and LAI forecasts are highly beneficial to natural resource management decisions. However, the LAI can be affected by biophysical, climate, and anthropogenic factors, thus, its future watershed-scale patterns remain difficult to assess. Herein, an object-oriented watershed-scale LAI forecasting (OWLF) method is proposed to solve the forecasting difficulties encountered when using only past meteorological data. The model was constructed with filtered multi-year MODIS LAI time series and climate index variables. Then, the dependence of the LAI on four mean monthly climate index variables was evaluated, namely, latent evapotranspiration, rainfall capacity, average air temperature, and sunlight hours, in the Poyang Lake basin. By combining the climate indexes derived from the past 1-3months, the model forecasts the subsequent months LAI for different land cover types. The LAI forecasting results derived with a 13-year time series (2000-2012) suggest that the OWLF method can effectively recognize the expected spatial patterns, and the data agreed reasonably well with LAI dynamics and phenological periods. This work offers a promising way to exploit combined satellite and climate index data in novel and more accurate watershed-scale forecasting studies.

TI  - Variations in spring phenology of different vegetation types in the Mongolian Plateau and its responses to climate change during 2001-2017.
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - With MODIS NDVI data from 2001 to 2017 smoothed by the S-G and HANTS methods, we applied three phenological extraction models ( the cumulative NDVI based Logistic curvature ( CUM), rate of change of curvature ( RCC), dynamic threshold method) to identify the start of growing season ( SOS) in the Mongolian Plateau. The response characteristics of the SOS to climate change were analyzed on the vegetation type scale. The results showed that although the S-G method was slightly better than the HANTS method, both of them had relatively less influence on extracting the SOS. Among the three phenological extraction methods, CUM method had better extraction accuracy. The average SOS of the Mongolian Plateau was approximately 124 d. Spatially, the earlier SOS was observed in the southwestern part of the plateau and the Hentiy Mountain areas, whereas the later SOS occurred in Hangay Mountains and western part of the Greater Khingan Mountain. Temporally, the SOS generally showed a weak advancing trend ( -0.04 d . a(-1)). Spatially, the delayed SOS was observed in the Hangay Mountains, and the advanced SOS occurred in the Greater Khingan Mountain, Hentiy Mountain, the Great Lakes basin, and central and western Inner Mongolia. At the vegetation type scale, expect for the forest vegetation (-0.67 d . a(-1)), there were no apparent trends of SOS in other vegetation types. The temperature prior to the SOS, especially in March, negatively correlated with the SOS in the Mongolian Plateau, and the precipitation in the autumn and winter of the previous year had a positive correlation with the SOS.

TI  - Evaluation of topographic effects on multiscale leaf area index estimation using remotely sensed observations from multiple sensors
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Local topography significantly affects remotely sensed reflectance data and subsequently impacts leaf area index (LAI) retrieval over mountainous areas. Therefore, mountain vegetation LAI mapping from satellite observations at multiple scale levels is often obstructed by topographic distortion. To analyze the effects of topography on multiresolution LAI retrievals, consistent LAI estimations were first generated across six spatial scales (i.e., 960 m, 480 m, 240 m, 120 m, 60 m and 30 m) from MODIS and Landsat OLI reflectance data using the ensemble multiscale filter (EnMsF) approach over rugged surfaces. Subsequently, the topographic influence on LAI was evaluated based on spatial patterns and retrieval accuracies at multiple scale levels by comparing the EnMsF-based multiscale LAI results obtained before and after terrain correction of a Landsat image. The results demonstrated that the multiresolution LAI values retrieved from topographically corrected surface reflectance data outperformed those without topographic correction, regardless of various slopes or aspects at the 30 m scale or the differences in spatial resolutions. The accuracies were determined for the retrieved LAI values before (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.32 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.03) and after (R-2 = 0.60 and RMSE = 0.82) topographic correction when compared to the field measurements over slopes facing toward the sun at the 30 m resolution. The R-2 and RMSE values were 0.57 and 0.54, respectively, for the LAI estimations with terrain corrections in the shady aspects. Moreover, the topographic effect on the LAI estimations depended on our spatial scales. The finer the spatial resolution is, the more significant the topographic effects on the multiscale LAI retrieval are, and vice versa. Thus, the results of this study open an encouraging path to deepen the understanding of terrain effects on multiscale LAI estimations, and further improve the LAI retrieval algorithm across different spatial scales over mountainous areas.

TI  - Development of an Optical Multispectral Remote Sensing System for Measuring Volcanic Surface Phenomena - Promotion Project for Next Generation Volcano Research B2 (Subtopic 2-2)
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2016, we launched the "Promotion Project for Next Generation Volcano Research B2 (Theme B: Development of Cutting-edge Volcano Observation Technology, subtheme 2: Development of Remote Sensing Techniques for Volcano Observation), subtopic 2-2 (Development of Remote Sensing Techniques for Surface Phenomena of Volcano)" under the " Integrated Program for Next Generation Volcano Research and Human Resources Development" [1], aiming at the development of an optical multispectral remote sensing systemformeasuring volcanic surface phenomena. With subtopic 2-2, we are planning to develop a new observation device called a surface phenomena imaging camera (SPIC), which is technically superior to current remote sensing techniques, i.e., optical remote observation techniques used to observe volcanic surface phenomena from aircrafts or ground. We are also aiming at applying the developed observation system to quantify volcanic activities and determine volcanic eruption potentials (degrees of urgency) or branching of event trees for volcanic crises with high accuracy, contributing to better predictions of volcanic eruption transitions. To achieve the above-mentioned aims, we started the development of the SPIC by equipping it with camera-type sensors, based on preliminary analyses of the experimental observations made with the airborne spectral imaging system ARTS-SE, which consists of a pushbroom scanner and a camera system, developed by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience in FY 2015. We have already developed its components, such as the prototype filter-type multiband cameras SPIC-UC, a prototype uncooled infrared camera, SPIC-C, a cooled camera, and SPIC-SS, a visible-light camera. The SPIC-UC is a two-band camera with the function of visualizing temperature and SO2 gas concentration distributions. The SPIC-C has the function of measuring temperatures between 2 and 1075 degrees C with high accuracy (noise equivalent temperature difference, NETD: 16 mK); it is equipped with a sensor and a filter wheel that work in the middle wave infrared region (MWIR). The SPIC-SS is a six-lens multiband camera system that estimates the measured images from multiband spectra (6 bands) to hyper spectra (300 bands). Further, we studied a method to estimate digital surface model with a similar to 30-m error. As our plan has progressed as scheduled, we intend to complete the prototype SPIC by 2020.

T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - PurposeThe steady move towards axillary conservatism in breast cancer is based on studies demonstrating that axillary node clearance affords no survival benefit in a subset of patients with a positive pre-operative axillary ultrasound (AUS). However, less attention has been paid to AUS-negative patients who receive sentinel node biopsy as standard.MethodsPreviously assembled systematic review data was reassessed to evaluate nodal burden amongst patients with breast cancer and a clinically and radiologically negative axilla.ResultsPooled data from four cohort studies reporting pre-operative axillary ultrasound in 5139 patients with breast cancer show it has a negative predictive rate of 0.951 (95% confidence interval 0.941-0.960).ConclusionsReconsidering the use of ultrasound in patients with early breast cancer and non-palpable axillae reveals that sentinel node biopsy itself may represent surgical over-treatment in patients with a negative axillary ultrasound. The implications of this on the future of surgical management of the axilla are discussed.

TI  - Application of Multi-periodic Harmonic Model for Classification of Multi-temporal Satellite Data: MODIS and GOCI Imagery
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A multi-temporal approach using remotely sensed time series data obtained over multiple years is a very useful method for monitoring land covers and land-cover changes. While spectral-based methods at any particular time limits the application utility due to instability of the quality of data obtained at that time, the approach based on the temporal profile can produce more accurate results since data is analyzed from a long-term perspective rather than on one point in time. In this study, a multi-temporal approach applying a multi-periodic harmonic model is proposed for classification of remotely sensed data. A harmonic model characterizes the seasonal variation of a time series by four parameters: average level, frequency, phase, and amplitude. The availability of high-quality data is very important for multi-temporal analysis. An satellite image usually have many unobserved data and bad-quality data due to the influence of observation environment and sensing system, which impede the analysis and might possibly produce inaccurate results. Harmonic analysis is also very useful for real-time data reconstruction. Multi-periodic harmonic model is applied to the reconstructed data to classify land covers and monitor land-cover change by tracking the temporal profiles. The proposed method is tested with the MODIS and GOCI NDVI time series over the Korean Peninsula for 5 years from 2012 to 2016. The results show that the multi-periodic harmonic model has a great potential for classification of land-cover types and monitoring of land-cover changes through characterizing annual temporal dynamics.

TI  - The Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Using Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Plus Radioisotope Method Compared With the Radioisotope-Only Method for Breast Cancer Patients After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Prospective, Randomized, Open-Label, Single-Center Phase 2 Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to compare the sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification rates for breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) between the dual method (DM) of indocyanine green fluorescence (ICG-F) plus a radioisotope (RI) and RI alone.MethodsThis randomized study enrolled 130 patients who received NAC for breast cancer and 122 patients who received SLN biopsy (SLNB) using either DM (n=58) or RI only (n=64). The study compared the identification rate, number of SLNs, and detection time of SLNB.ResultsAmong the 122 patients, 113 (92.6%) were clinically node-positive before NAC. The SLN identification rate was 98.3% in the DM group and 93.8% in the RI group (p=0.14). The DM group and the RI group were similar in the average number of SLNs (2.21.13 vs. 1.9 +/- 1.33; p=0.26) and the time to detection of the first SLN (8.7 +/- 4.98 vs. 8.3 +/- 4.31min; p=0.30). In the DM group, transcutaneous lymphatic drainage was visualized by fluorescence imaging for 65.5% (38 of 58) of the patients. The SLN identification rate was 94.7% using ICG-F and 93% using RI (p=0.79). During and after the operation, no complications, including allergic reactions or skin necrosis, occurred.Conclusions p id=Par4 This study is the first randomized trial to use ICG-F for SLNB in breast cancer patients after NAC. The DM including ICG-F could be a feasible and safe method for SLNB in initially node-positive breast cancer patients with NAC.

TI  - Diagnosis of Xinmo (China) Landslide Based on Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Observation and Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Xinmo landslide occurred on 24 June 2017 and caused huge casualties and property losses. As characteristics of spatiotemporal pre-collapse deformation are a prerequisite for further understanding the collapse mechanism, in this study we applied the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique to recover the pre-collapse deformation, which was further modeled to reveal the mechanism of the Xinmo landslide. Archived SAR data, including 44 Sentinel-1 A/B data and 20 Envisat/ASAR data, were used to acquire the pre-collapse deformation of the Xinmo landslide. Our results indicated that the deformation of the source area occurred as early as 10 years before the landslide collapsed. The deformation rate of source area accelerated about a month before the collapse, and the deformation rate in the week before the collapse reached 40 times the average before the acceleration. Furthermore, the pre-collapse deformation was modeled with a distributed set of rectangular dislocation sources. The characteristics of the pre-collapse movement of the slip surface were acquired, which further confirmed that a locked section formed at the bottom of the slope. In addition, the spatial-temporal characteristics of the deformation was found to have changed significantly with the development of the landslide. We suggested that this phenomenon indicated the expansion of the slip surface and cracks of the landslide. Due to the expansion of the slip surface, the locked section became a key area that held the stability of the slope. The locked section sheared at the last stage of the development, which triggered the final run-out. Our study has provided new insights into the mechanism of the Xinmo landslide.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the aim is to determine the volcanic and tectonic structures developed in the "Can-Etili Lignite basin" with the aid of satellite images. The Can-Etili lignite basin consists of Oligocene-Early Miocene volcanics (Can Volcanics) overlying early-Middle Miocene lignite-bearing stream and lake sediments (Can formation) occurring above an unconformity. In order to complete this study, two different satellite images (ASTER and ALOS-PALSAR) and a digital elevation model (DEM) of the region were used. Multispectral optical remote sensing data provide information about material composition, while radar data reflect surface topography and morphology better. During mapping of lineaments on satellite images, in addition to visual assessment, image processing techniques were used. A variety of orientation filters were applied to ASTER satellite images for lineament mapping. The lineaments on PALSAR images were determined with visual methods.Using DEM data along with ASTER and PALSAR satellite images for the study area, lineaments were mapped. The results were shown that a significant portion of the lineaments had NE-SW strike. This orientation coincides with the NE-SW striking Can-Etili fault. Additionally, some curved linear structures were obtained from satellite images and are interpreted to be associated with caldera development.

TI  - Mapping the extent of land cover colour harmony based on satellite Earth observation data
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of colour harmony, being rarely used in geography, landscape and environmental studies, has been significantly developed in psychology, art and computer science within the different approaches: colour wheel geometry and, more recently, numerical models applied to colour combinations. Using the main numerical principles of colour harmony, borrowed from the psychological literature, this study aims to investigate the ways of mapping the extent of the colour harmony of land cover, based on satellite Earth observations and explain the spatial distribution of colour harmony scores. The naturalness of environment, as well as heat and moisture balance, are confirmed to be the main drivers of the colour harmony of land cover. Crowdsourced photographs, collected from Mapillary service, were used to link satellite and ground-based estimations of the colour harmony of land cover as "proof of concept". They have a limited applicability for ground-based assessment of scenic colour harmony. Therefore, remote sensing data provide a significant support for nature conservation and sustainable management, being used for mapping of the colour harmony of land cover as an indicator of the visual quality of the perceived environment.

TI  - Deterministic simulations to determine the impacts of economic and non-economic breeding objectives on sustainable intensification of developing smallholder dairy farms
T2  - LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dairy cattle farming in developing countries is mainly by resource poor smallholder farmers. Intensification of production within smallholder production systems is being driven by increasing demand for animal products. Current intensification is driven by importation of high-input high-output genotypes. This puts in question the sustainability of these resource constrained systems under harsh environmental conditions. Sustainability of production systems can be defined as long-term resilience and productivity. We use deterministic simulations to compare the impacts of three criteria to define breeding objectives i.e,, economic, desired gains and non-market value, on annual genetic and monetary gains in production (market) and functional (non-market) traits for a small-sized nucleus genomic selection breeding program under developing country conditions. Market traits considered were milk yield (MY) and mature body weight (MBW). Non-market traits were calving interval (CI) and production lifetime (PLT). Fat yield (FY) was also considered a non-market trait as it had no market value. With the economic objective, traits were weighted on economic values. Weights for desired gains and non-market (NM) values were derived iteratively. Economic objectives placed highest emphasis on MY with very little gains in non-market traits but had the highest returns on investment. For desired gains objective, maximal achievable gains in PLT, CI and FY were lower than the indicated desired gains. The non-market value objective achieved the best compromise between gains in MY and other traits. We conclude that non-market value objectives can be applied to direct selection towards more robust genotypes but with loss in monetary gain. Breeding robust genotypes can contribute to sustainable intensification in developing small-holder dairy systems. However, for such objectives to be satisfactory, a sound criterion is required to determine declines in genetic gains for market traits that are acceptable by producers.

TI  - Hydrologic model parameterization using dynamic Landsat-based vegetative estimates within a semiarid grassland
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of hydrologic models to assess long-term watershed condition through repeated simulations of runoff and erosion is one common approach for rangeland health evaluation. However, obtaining vegetative data of appropriate spatiotemporal resolution for model parameterization can be difficult. The goal of this research was to assess the utility of using time-varying, Landsat-derived vegetative values to parameterize an event-based, watershed-scale hydrologic model. This study was conducted on a small, instrumented grassland watershed in the USDA Agricultural Research Service operated Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in southeastern, Arizona. Cloud-free Landsat scenes were acquired over the watershed for the years 1996-2014. The Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI) was calculated for each image and calibrated using ground measured data to produce a time series of satellite-based foliar cover rasters. These values were used to parameterize the Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM) for 26 rainfall-runoff events with corresponding observed data. Three parameterization scenarios using these data aggregated to different temporal resolutions (static, long-term mean, annual mean, and intra-annual values) were compared to a static literature-based scenario for evaluation. The linear relationship between field-measured foliar cover and SATVI showed statistically significant agreement with R-2 = 0.85 and p < 0.05. Simulated runoff volume and peak flow rate using the three remotely sensed parameterization scenarios improved upon that of the literature-based scenario, with the annual mean scenario performing the best of the three temporal aggregations. The methodological framework outlined here provides a means for improved parameterization for watershed-scale modelling where vegetative data may be scarce or unobtainable for long-term analysis.

M3  - Article
AB  - Distinguishing debris-covered glaciers from debris-free glaciers is difficult when using only optical remote sensing images to extract glacier boundaries. According to the features that the surface temperature of debriscovered glacier is lower than surrounding objects, and higher than clean glaciers, glacial changes in the Yigong Zangbo basin was analyzed on the basis of visible, near-infrared and thermal-infrared band images of Landsat TM and OLI/TIRS in the support of ancillary digital elevation model (DEM). The results indicated that glacier area gradually declined from 928.76 km(2) in 1990 to 918.46 km(2) in 2000 and 901.51 km(2) in 2015. However, debriscovered glacier area showed a slight increase from 63.39 km(2) in 1990 to 66.24 km(2) in 2000 and 71.16 km(2) in 2015. During 25 years, the glacier length became shorter continuously with terminus elevation rising up. The area of moraine lakes in 1990 was 1.43 km(2), which increased to 1.98 km(2) in 2000 and 3.41 km(2) in 2015. In other words, the total area of the moraine lakes in 2015 is 2.38 times of that in 1990. This increase in moraine lake area could be the result of accelerated glacier melt and retreat, which is consistent with the significant warming trend in recent decades in the basin.

TI  - Spatial and temporal distribution of open bio-mass burning in China from 2013 to 2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Open bio-mass burning plays an important role in the formation of heavy pollution events during harvest seasons in China by releasing the trace gases and particulate matters into the atmosphere. A better understanding of spatial-temporal variations of open bio-mass burning in China is required to assess its impacts on the air quality and especially on the heavy haze pollution. The MODIS fire spots data and the calculated burned areas were used in this research, which shows the varying number of fire spots in China from 2013 to 2017, with the highest in 2014 and the lowest in 2016. Meanwhile, the fire spots were found mainly concentrated in three key periods (March-April, June and October-November) and two zones (Zone 1 and Zone 2) with inter-annual variations of burned areas. In addition, the contribution of major vegetation types burning was studied, the cropland occupied the largest proportion of burned area of more than 70% in any period time, followed by forest. Finally, from the perspective of climate and human activities, the causes of inter-annual variations were discussed. By comparing the average temperature and precipitation in the two zones from 2013 to 2017, it was found that the burned forest area is positively correlated with the average temperature of the zones and negatively correlated with the average precipitation. Meanwhile, the relationship between the El Nino events and the bio-mass burning was discussed.

TI  - Livestock Revolution and Ghostly Apparitions: South China as a Sentinel Territory for Influenza Pandemics
T2  - CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article develops three ethnographic scenes in Hong Kong reflecting three narratives of pandemic influenza as a side effect of the livestock revolution: an expert's view of the Hong Kong territory as a sentinel post on the edge of the epicenter for pandemic flu, a farmer's view of Hong Kong as a colonial experimentation on ways to raise chickens industrially, and a bird-watcher's view of Hong Kong as a place full of bird spirits. In these different settings, I contrast the logic of indicators with the logic of sentinels and ask what it means to release a bird on the threshold of domestication, considered not as an evolutionary step but as a space of friction where humans and birds enter into an uncertain interaction.

TI  - Crop Monitoring Using Sentinel-1 Data: A Case Study from The Netherlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is of huge economic significance in The Netherlands where the provision of real-time, reliable information on crop development is essential to support the transition towards precision agriculture. Optical imagery can provide invaluable insights into crop growth and development but is severely hampered by cloud cover. This case study in the Flevopolder illustrates the potential value of Sentinel-1 for monitoring five key crops in The Netherlands, namely sugar beet, potato, maize, wheat and English rye grass. Time series of radar backscatter from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 Mission are analyzed and compared to ground measurements including phenological stage and height. Temporal variations in backscatter data reflect changes in water content and structure associated with phenological development. Emergence and closure dates are estimated from the backscatter time series and validated against a photo archive. Coherence data are compared to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and ground data, illustrating that the sudden increase in coherence is a useful indicator of harvest. The results presented here demonstrate that Sentinel-1 data have significant potential value to monitor growth and development of key Dutch crops. Furthermore, the guaranteed availability of Sentinel-1 imagery in clouded conditions ensures the reliability of data to meet the monitoring needs of farmers, food producers and regulatory bodies.

TI  - Spaceborne tomography of multi-species Indian tropical forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter is the coherent combination of the scattering from multiple individual scatterers within the radar resolution cell, which results into a 2-D radar image. Tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) takes advantage of multiple SAR acquisitions to provide 3-D vertical structure of the imaged target. Over forests, parameters such as canopy structure, canopy density, leaf area and phenology contribute to different SAR scattering mechanisms along the vertical dimension of the trees. Tomography has been demonstrated in various earlier works for forest bio-physical parameter estimation using airborne data. In this research work, multi-polarimetric space-borne TanDEM-X tomograms are examined for the first time over a multi-species Indian tropical forest. Multiple TanDEM-X acquisitions are focused using Capon beamforming at five polarimetric channels - HH, HV, VV, HH - VV and HH + VV. Four distinct forest species compartments are selected representing different canopy structure and density. The tomograms obtained in different polarizations for these species are analyzed in detail to understand the scattering patterns across different forest species. Field surveys carried out in several forest locations provide in situ observations of forest height and vertical structure. It was observed that canopy gaps and leaf density play a crucial role for X-band SAR signal penetration through ground. For dense canopy species the backscatter contributions are spread through the canopy, while in case of sparse canopy species, the ground scattering is dominant. Vertical profiles obtained at surveyed plot locations are plotted in all polarizations, and provide a good agreement with field observations. Further, the obtained TomoSAR backscatter layers have a good correlation with field measured above-ground biomass (AGB). The AGB is modeled from TomoSAR with the HH-pol TomoSAR backscatter layer at 27 m canopy height leading to an AGB estimation with correlation r = 0.76 and RMSE of 50.4 t/ha.

TI  - Groundwater potential assessment of the Sero plain using bivariate models of the frequency ratio, Shannon entropy and evidential belief function
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of the present research is to evaluate three bivariate models of the frequency ratio, Shannon entropy (SE) and evidential belief function in the spatial prediction of groundwater at the Sero plain located in west Azerbaijan, Iran. In the first phase, well locations with groundwater yields >11 m(3)/hr were identified (75 well locations). Ten groundwater conditioning factors affecting the occurrence of groundwater, namely, altitude, slope degree, curvature, slope aspect, rainfall, soil, land-use, geology and distance from the fault and the river, were selected for modelling. Finally, the groundwater potential map results were drawn from three implemented models and they were validated using testing data by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The AUCs of these models were 0.84, 81 and 85%, respectively. The results of the current study demonstrated that these models could be successfully employed for spatial prediction modelling. Moreover, the results of the SE model demonstrated that the most and the least important factors in groundwater occurrences in the area under study were altitude, curvature and rainfall, respectively. The results of this study are helpful for the Regional Water Authority of Urmia and the decision makers to comprehensively assess the groundwater exploration development and environmental management in future planning.

TI  - Feature Selection on Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery for Mapping a Landscape Infested by Parthenium Weed
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent past, the volume of spatial datasets has significantly increased. This is attributed to, among other factors, higher sensor temporal resolutions of the recently launched satellites. The increased data, combined with the computation and possible derivation of a large number of indices, may lead to high multi-collinearity and redundant features that compromise the performance of classifiers. Using dimension reduction algorithms, a subset of these features can be selected, hence increasing their predictive potential. In this regard, an investigation into the application of feature selection techniques on multi-temporal multispectral datasets such as Sentinel-2 is valuable in vegetation mapping. In this study, ten feature selection methods belonging to five groups (Similarity-based, statistical-based, Sparse learning based, Information theoretical based, and wrappers methods) were compared based on f-score and data size for mapping a landscape infested by the Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus). Overall, results showed that ReliefF (a Similarity-based approach) was the best performing feature selection method as demonstrated by the high f-score values of Parthenium weed and a small size of optimal features selected. Although svm-b (a wrapper method) yielded the highest accuracies, the size of optimal subset of selected features was quite large. Results also showed that data size affects the performance of feature selection algorithms, except for statistically-based methods such as Gini-index and F-score and svm-b. Findings in this study provide a guidance on the application of feature selection methods for accurate mapping of invasive plant species in general and Parthenium weed, in particular, using new multispectral imagery with high temporal resolution.

TI  - Histogram Matching of Sentinel-2 Spectral Information to Enhance Planetscope Imagery for Effective Wildfire Damage Assessment
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In abrupt fire disturbances, high quality images suitable for wildfire damage assessment can be difficult to acquire. Quantifying wildfire burn area and severity are essential measures for quick short-term disaster response and efficient long-term disaster restoration. Planetscope (PS) imagery offers 3 m spatial and daily temporal resolution, which can overcome the spatio-temporal resolution tradeoff of conventional satellites, albeit at the cost of spectral resolution. This study investigated the potential of augmenting PS imagery by integrating the spectral information from Sentinel-2 (S2) differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) to PS differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI) using histogram matching, specifically for wildfire burn area and severity assessment of the Okgye wildfire which occurred on April 4th, 2019. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reference data, the results of the study were compared to the wildfire burn area reported by Ministry of the Interior and Safety. The burn area estimates from this study demonstrated that the histogram-matched (HM) PS dNDVI image produced more accurate burn area estimates and more descriptive burn severity intervals in contrast to conventional methods using S2. The HM PS dNDVI image returned an error of only 0.691% whereas the S2 dNDVI and dNBR images overestimated the wildfire burn area by 5.32% and 106%, respectively. These improvements using PS were largely due to the higher spatial resolution, allowing for the detection of sparsely distributed patches of land and narrow roads, which were indistinguishable using S2 dNBR. In addition, the integration of spectral information from S2 in the PS image resolved saturation effects in areas of low and high burn severity.

TI  - Development of Landslide Detection Algorithm Using Fully Polarimetric ALOS-2 SAR Data
T2  - ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) remote sensing data is a very useful tool for near-real-time identification of landslide affected areas that can occur over a large area due to heavy rains or typhoons. This study aims to develop an effective algorithm for automatically delineating landslide areas from the polarimetric SAR data acquired after the landslide event. To detect landslides from SAR observations, reduction of the speckle effects in the estimation of polarimetric SAR parameters and the orthorectification of geometric distortions on sloping terrain are essential processing steps. Based on the experimental analysis, it was found that the IDAN filter can provide a better estimation of the polarimetric parameters. In addition, it was appropriate to apply orthorectification process after estimating polarimetric parameters in the slant range domain. Furthermore, it was found that the polarimetric entropy is the most appropriate parameters among various polarimetric parameters. Based on those analyses, we proposed an automatic landslide detection algorithm using the histogram thresholding of the polarimetric parameters with the aid of terrain slope information. The landslide detection algorithm was applied to the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data which observed landslide areas in Japan triggered by Typhoon in September 2011. Experimental results showed that the landslide areas were successfully identified by using the proposed algorithm with a detection rate of about 82% and a false alarm rate of about 3%.

TI  - Development of Fog Detection Algorithm during Nighttime Using Himawari-8/AHI Satellite and Ground Observation Data
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we developed a hybrid nighttime fog detection algorithm based on the optical and textural characteristics of fog from Himawari-8/ advanced Himawari imager (AHI) data and ground temperature data. The Dual Cannel Difference (DCD) caused by the emissivity difference between the 3.9 and 11.2 mu m is the main evaluation element for fog detection. And, the local standard deviation of Brightness Temperature (BT) and difference between fog top BT and ground temperature (sea surface temperature) were used to distinguish between fog and low cloud. The thresholds and weights of the three evaluation elements were initially determined by visual inspection of fog cases and optimized through receiver operating characteristics analysis using training cases. Although the level of fog detection differs depending on the fog intensity and weather conditions, the quantitative evaluation of results using ground observed visibility data showed that average probability of detection and false alarm ratio are 0.64 (0.24 similar to 0.89) and 0.56 (0.33 similar to 0.71), respectively. We performed sensitivity tests for fog detection methods because the detection levels can be affected by fog detection method. As a result, the Weighted Sum Method (WSM) showed a slightly lowered detection level compared to that of the Simple Decision Tree (SDT), average differences, hit rate, hanssen-kuiper skill score, threat score, and bias are -0.31, 0.01, -0.12, and 2.07, respectively. And more works are needed for the improvement of fog detection levels through the sophistication of thresholds and weights using more cases, because detection level is sensitive to fog cases.

TI  - Addressing the relocation bias in a long temperature record by means of land cover assessment
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The meteorological measurements in Brno, Czech Republic, is among the world's oldest measurements, operating since 1799. Like many others, station was initially installed in the city center, relocated several times, and currently operates at an airport outside the city. These geographical changes potentially bias the temperature record due to different station surroundings and varying degrees of urban heat island effects. Here, we assess the influence of land cover on spatial temperature variations in Brno, capitol of Moravia and the second largest city of the Czech Republic. We therefore use a unique dataset of half-hourly resolved measurements from 11 stations spanning a period of more than 3.5years and apply this information to reduce relocation biases in the long-term temperature record from 1799 to the present. Regression analysis reveals a significant warming influence from nearby buildings and a cooling influence from vegetation, explaining up to 80% of the spatial variability within our network. The influence is strongest during the warm season and for land cover changes between 300 and 500m around stations. Relying on historical maps and recent satellite data, it was possible to capture the building densities surrounding the past locations of the meteorological station. Using the previously established land cover-temperature relation, the anthropogenic warming for each measurement site could be quantified and hence eliminated from the temperature record accordingly, thereby increasing the long-term warming trend.

TI  - Global vertically resolved aerosol direct radiation effect from three years of CALIOP data using the FORTH radiation transfer model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We use global aerosol optical depth data from CALIOP with a radiation transfer model to investigate the aerosol direct radiative effect (DRE) and its sensitivity to the aerosol vertical resolution. Our study spans three years (2007-2009) and uses cloud data from ISCCP D2 to take into account cloud-aerosol radiative interactions on a monthly 2.5 degrees x 2.5 degrees resolution. The three-year global average all-sky aerosol DRE at the surface, in the atmosphere, and at the top of atmosphere (TOA) was calculated to be -4.23, 2.40, and - 1.83 Wm(-2), respectively. As expected, local DREs and atmospheric heating rates are shown to vary significantly. The largest magnitudes of the DREs are observed in regions with heavy aerosol load consisting of both natural and anthropogenic particles, such as desert dust, biomass burning and urban/industrial pollution. At TOA the aerosol effect is generally of negative sign, though a planetary heating effect is found in regions characterized by both absorbing aerosol and large surface albedo, such as deserts. Clouds scatter and absorb solar radiation, which generally decreases the aerosol cooling at the surface and the aerosol warming in the atmosphere. However, the latter effect is attenuated due to the enhancement of radiation absorption by the above-cloud aerosols. As a result, clouds decrease the aerosol TOA (planetary) cooling, and sometimes even cause aerosol warming (e.g. over the tropical South Atlantic). The cloud effect on the aerosol DRE depends strongly on the aerosol optical properties and the aerosol load fraction above low clouds. Comparing the effect of the observed aerosol vertical profile against an exponentially decreasing profile, we find a small sensitivity for the surface DRE, but larger for the atmospheric column and the top of the atmosphere. Under all-sky conditions, when continental aerosols are lifted higher in the atmosphere, the outgoing shortwave radiation at TOA decreases, due to the increase of UV and visible radiation absorption by particles while higher oceanic aerosols generally increase the outgoing shortwave radiation through more efficient backscatter and decrease of the NIR radiation absorption by atmospheric gases below aerosol particles.

AB  - Using Bayesian bootstrap as the informative prior distribution is a key feature of the empirical Bayesian kriging method. We evaluate correctness of the method using two large simulation experiments. We also compare empirical Bayesian kriging performance with several popular geostatistical models implemented in R using two real datasets: the average annual precipitation in South Africa and the daytime land surface temperature satellite data. Results show that empirical Bayesian kriging performs better than other predictors, and increasingly so with data complexity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Regression analysis of aerosol optical properties with long-term MODIS data using forward selection method
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, a new filtering method of forward selection (FS), has been employed for linear and multiple regression analysis of aerosol optical properties with meteorological parameters using long-term moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for New Delhi area. Long-term observation (15years, March 2000-December 2014) of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550nm, fine mode fraction particles (FMF) and Angstrom exponent (AE) are analyzed to study their variability on annual and seasonal basis. The analysis reveals relatively high mean AOD (0.71 +/- 0.25), associated with moderate AE (0.69 +/- 0.13) for the overall period. Considerable higher values of AOD (0.89 +/- 0.33) were reported in monsoon and AE (0.87 +/- 0.10) during winter season. Likewise, seasonal fraction for AOD was also found to be higher (42%) during the monsoon season and for AE (31%) and for FMF (55%) during winter season. The peak value of AOD was during June-July and the lowest in the transitional months of February and September, while AE was high in January-February and low in May-June suggesting significant urban and biomass burning contribution. In general, the analysis shows a rather well-mixed type of aerosols present in the urban environment, which affect the regional air quality as well as climate associated with long-range transport of pollutants through the westerly winds from the Thar Desert and biomass burning in the western parts of India. The presence of AOD trend is evidence of air quality deterioration particularly in highly populated areas. The aerosol classification with relationship between AOD and alpha shows that urban/biomass burning aerosols are dominant in Delhi during winter and pre-monsoon. It is clearly seen that irrespective of constant emissions occurring each month, the estimated pollution is much higher in winter months and lower in summer months. It is concluded that fine particles exhibit much higher variations than urban aerosols annually and seasonally.

TI  - NCA-LDAS Land Analysis: Development and Performance of a Multisensor, Multivariate Land Data Assimilation System for the National Climate Assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes one of the first successful examples of multisensor, multivariate land data assimilation, encompassing a large suite of soil moisture, snow depth, snow cover, and irrigation intensity environmental data records (EDRs) from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E and AMSR2), Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The analysis is performed using the NASA Land Information System (LIS) as an enabling tool for the U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA). The performance of the NCA Land Data Assimilation System (NCA-LDAS) is evaluated by comparing it to a number of hydrological reference data products. Results indicate that multivariate assimilation provides systematic improvements in simulated soil moisture and snow depth, with marginal effects on the accuracy of simulated streamflow and evapotranspiration. An important conclusion is that across all evaluated variables, assimilation of data from increasingly more modern sensors (e.g., SMOS, SMAP, AMSR2, ASCAT) produces more skillful results than assimilation of data from older sensors (e.g., SMMR, SSM/I, AMSR-E). The evaluation also indicates the high skill of NCA-LDAS when compared with other LSM products. Further, drought indicators based on NCA-LDAS output suggest a trend of longer and more severe droughts over parts of the western United States during 1979-2015, particularly in the southwestern United States, consistent with the trends from the U.S. Drought Monitor, albeit for a shorter 2000-15 time period.

TI  - Clustering of Precipitation Pattern in Indonesia Using TRMM Satellite Data
T2  - ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY & APPLIED SCIENCE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper identifies the climatic regions in Indonesia based on the rainfall pattern similarity using TRMM data. Indonesia is a tropical climate region with three main climate clusters, i. e. monsoonal, anti-monsoonal and semi-monsoonal. The clusters were formed by examining rainfall observation datasets recorded at a number of stations over Indonesia with coarse spatial resolution. Clustering based on higher resolution datasets is needed to characterize the rainfall pattern over remote areas with no stations. TRMM provides a high resolution gridded dataset. A statistical test has been applied to evaluate the significance of TRMM bias, and it indicated that the TRMM based satellite precipitation product is a reasonable choice to be used as an input to cluster regions in Indonesia based on the similarity of rainfall patterns. The clustering by Euclidean distance revealed that Indonesia can be grouped into three significantly different rainfall patterns. Compared to the existing references, there have been regions where the rainfall pattern has been shifted. The results in this research thus update the previously defined climate regions in Indonesia.

TI  - Parotitis and influenza: unusual association during 2017, in Santa Fe, Argentina
T2  - REVISTA CHILENA DE INFECTOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Parotitis is an acute viral disease characterized by swelling and pain in one or both salivary glands, submaxiflary or submental, fever, headache, muscle ache and/or fatigue. Aim: To investigate the occurrence of influenza virus infection in parotitis cases in a population of Santa Fe during 2017 and analyze clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the cases. Methods: We studied patients with diagnosis of mumps without age restriction, who came for examination from week 26 to the network of clinicians forming the Sentinel Influenza Unit in Santa Fe. Results: Between epidemiological weeks 26 and 44, 22 clinical parotitis cases we enrolled. The influenza virus was detected in 68.2%, influenza A (H3N2) 93%, and influenza B, 7%. The clinical signs of cases were mild, with an average swelling development of 5 days and no complications. 74% presented with influenza-like illness in tandem with parotitis. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that a proportion of children presenting with parotitis had influenza A(H3N2) virus infection. It is necessary to implement systematic surveillance of parotitis associated with influenza and differential diagnosis even in the absence of respiratory symptoms.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Renal Tumors: Surgical Technique and Safety
T2  - UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE To understand uncertainties and knowledge gaps regarding lymphatic drainage in renal tumors, we performed 2 prospective studies to demonstrate regional lymph node (LN) drainage with sentinel lymph node (SN) imaging and biopsy. Here, we report the technique and perioperative safety of retroperitoneal SN dissection with different surgical approaches.METHODS Seventy three patients from the 2 trials were included in the analysis. Patients had cT1-2N0M0 renal tumors (</=10 cm) and underwent nephrectomy (46/63%) or partial nephrectomy (27/37%) with SN dissection after intraoperative detection with a gamma-probe, and locoregional LND. Twenty-nine of 73 patients had open surgery, 27 of 73 laparoscopic, and 17 of 73 robot-assisted laparoscopic (partial) nephrectomy. Surgery time, intraoperative adverse events (AE) according to CTCAE 5.0, and postoperative AE according to Clavien-Dindo (CD) were retrospectively assessed.RESULTS There were no grade >= 3 intraoperative CTCAE 5.0 AEs. Postoperative AE rate was 16.4% of which 7 (9.6%) were CD grade 1-2 and 5 (6.8%) were 3a grade complications. There were no statistically significant differences between presence of AE, CD grade, and surgical modality (P = .27 and P = .13, respectively). Blood loss was a median of 550 ml (IQR 200-900 ml) and 225 (IQR 42-751 ml) for partial nephrectomy (PN) and radical nephrectomy, respectively. Length of the procedure was 170 minutes (IQR 149-184 minutes), 155 minutes (IQR 130-177 minutes) 180 minutes (IQR 162-202 minutes) in open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted procedures, respectively.CONCLUSION The addition of retroperitoneal SN dissection combined with locoregional LND during (partial) nephrectomy is surgically safe. Complication rate is low and does not differ between surgical approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Sharing Cities and Commoning: An Alternative Narrative for Just and Sustainable Cities
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sharing Cities are emerging as an alternative narrative which promotes sharing as a transformative phenomenon for just and sustainable cities. This article shows that Sharing Cities are conceived within the alternative political economy of the commons. Bringing a theoretical contribution into dialogue with a practice-oriented book, this paper aims at checking the concept of Sharing Cities against the reality on the ground by reviewing 137 secondary cases: (1) Is communal (non-commercial) sharing a substantial phenomenon? (2) What is the role of technology-and more widely, of intermediation-in sharing practices? (3) If at all, what is being transformed by sharing practices? (4) Are commons depicted in each case? Results show that most cases display a communal form of sharing that is independent of digital platforms, i.e., that the sharing transformation affects all arenas of production and social reproduction across a wide variety of sectors, and it relies on translocal replication rather than up-scaling. With only 26% of cases apparently depicting a commons, this paper argues for a relational epistemology of urban commoning, shifting the focus to more-than-human commoning-communities. Thus, Sharing Cities are captured not only as a set of policy proposals and practices but as the performative depiction of an alternative worldview based on interdependence, ready for the Anthropocene.

TI  - Gordon Kaufman and a Theology for the Seeker
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article begins to develop a theology for the multi-worldview seeker, based on the constructive theological work of Gordon Kaufman. Seeking, as discussed in this article, is an attitude of life, characterized by interest in more than one theological, philosophical, or spiritual worldview, without any short or mid-term intention to commit oneself to one of them. In the United States, the Unitarian Universalist Association is a denomination that houses many theological seekers. The principles and sources of faith of that denomination offer an interesting foundation for the attitude of seeking. Constructing a theology for the seeker based on these principles should include a coherent account of concepts such as truth, God, spiritual growth, and ethics as they might follow from those principles. This article identifies possible incoherencies in the use of these concepts by seekers and proposes ways to escape them.

TI  - Robotic sentinel node mapping in clinical stage 1 endometrial cancer using methylene blue dyes using the robotic platform
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER ASSISTED SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Endometrial cancer is a surgically staged cancer. We examined our preliminary experience with sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in early stage endometrial cancer using methylene blue dyes. Method Retrospective review of all clinically stage 1 endometrial cancer staged surgically using the robotic platform. Logistic regression models were built to predict nodal metastasis taking into account age, grade, histology, depth of myometrial invasion, cervical involvement, and use of SLN mapping. Results Four hundred sixty-nine patients were reviewed. Sixty patients had SLN mapping (13%). Four hundred nine patients underwent standard lymphadenectomy with five documented nodal metastasis (1.2%). Five nodal metastasis (8.3%) were seen in the SLN patients. In the logistic model, the application of SLN mapping was significantly associated with diagnosed nodal metastasis (OR 7.74; 95% CI, 2.04-29.3; P = .003) together with nonendometroid histology (OR 5.05; 95% CI, 1.27-20.12; P = .022). Conclusion SLN mapping protocol using methylene blue significantly identifies more nodal metastasis than standard lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Identifying Agricultural Systems Using SVM Classification Approach Based on Phenological Metrics in a Semi-arid Region of Morocco
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand changes in agricultural systems, it is necessary to monitor vegetation dynamics based on the spatio-temporal characterization of phenological parameters. The purpose of this study is to identify the main agricultural systems using a phenology-based classification method in a semi-arid context. Phenological metrics were derived from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index time series extracted from MOD13Q1 product between 2012 and 2016. Furthermore, Support Vector Machine classification method was applied based on phenological metrics, to identify the main agricultural system classes in the study area. The main classes are; (1) irrigated annual crop, (2) irrigated perennial crop, (3) rainfed area and (4) fallow. The classification overall accuracy reached 88%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.83 and values of F1-score greater than 0.76. The results demonstrated the ability of phenological parameters to identify and monitor the main agricultural system classes in the study area and to control the illegal pumping zones.

TI  - Historical socio-environmental assessment of resource development footprints using remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterising the spatial and temporal dimensions of resource development projects is critical for understanding their present and future risk and opportunity profiles. For mining projects, pre-existing land uses, such as agriculture or human settlements, create spatial constraints that drive trade-offs between the development and operation of a mine, and other alternative land uses. Spatial analysis using historical remote sensing data can be used to "go back in time" to assess changes in mining land cover and better understand the physical determinants underlying present day complexities. This article describes a remote sensing workflow for characterising socio-environmental land cover change in mining projects. The workflow is applied in two mine sites in Papua New Guinea and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. An idealised hierarchical land cover classification scheme from which a selection of land covers were derived using Landsat is first described. Using a combination of supervised classification with manual input, and automated classification using CLASlite, 8 scenes are mapped at each mine site. Overall accuracies were greater than 90% for all years at both mine sites. The mapped spatial patterns over time demonstrate the dynamic nature of both mining landscapes with rapidly increasing mine waste footprints (i.e. area on a surface). As undisturbed land becomes scarce, the data shows mining and community activities are in closer proximity to each other. The results represent one of the most detailed cross-disciplinary remote sensing studies in mining in terms of high thematic, spatial and temporal resolution conducted to date. The data demonstrates how methods and perspectives from various social and environmental disciplines can combine to provide a more holistic perspective of a mining footprint.

TI  - Retrieval of Total Precipitable Water from Himawari-8 AHI Data: A Comparison of Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Deep Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Total precipitable water (TPW), a column of water vapor content in the atmosphere, provides information on the spatial distribution of moisture. The high-resolution TPW, together with atmospheric stability indices such as convective available potential energy (CAPE), is an effective indicator of severe weather phenomena in the pre-convective atmospheric condition. With the advent of high performing imaging instrument onboard geostationary satellites such as Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8 of Japan and Advanced Meteorological Imager (AMI) onboard GeoKompsat-2A of Korea, it is expected that unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution data (e.g., AMI plans to provide 2 km resolution data at every 2 min over the northeast part of East Asia) will be provided. To derive TPW from such high-resolution data in a timely fashion, an efficient algorithm is highly required. Here, machine learning approaches-random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and deep neural network (DNN)-are assessed for the TPW retrieved from AHI over the clear sky in Northeast Asia area. For the training dataset, the nine infrared brightness temperatures (BT) of AHI (BT8 to 16 centered at 6.2, 6.9, 7.3, 8.6, 9.6, 10.4, 11.2, 12.4, and 13.3 mu m, respectively), six dual channel differences and observation conditions such as time, latitude, longitude, and satellite zenith angle for two years (September 2016 to August 2018) are used. The corresponding TPW is prepared by integrating the water vapor profiles from InterimEuropean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis data (ERA-Interim). The algorithm performances are assessed using the ERA-Interim and radiosonde observations (RAOB) as the reference data. The results show that the DNN model performs better than RF and XGB with a correlation coefficient of 0.96, a mean bias of 0.90 mm, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.65 mm when compared to the ERA-Interim. Similarly, DNN results in a correlation coefficient of 0.95, a mean bias of 1.25 mm, and an RMSE of 5.03 mm when compared to RAOB. Contributing variables to retrieve the TPW in each model and the spatial and temporal analysis of the retrieved TPW are carefully examined and discussed.

TI  - Maize yield estimation in West Africa from crop process-induced combinations of multi-domain remote sensing indices
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data, crop modelling, and statistical methods are combined in an original method to overcome current limitations of crop yield estimation. It is then tested for timely estimation of maize grain yields and their year-on-year variability in Burkina Faso. Outputs from the SARRA-O crop model were used as a proxy for observed data for calibration. The final remote sensing-based yield model was constructed on the interaction between aboveground biomass at flowering (AGB-F) and crop water stress (Cstr) over the reproductive and maturation phases. Various vegetation and drought-related indices were derived from different spectral domains and tested. Model performance was evaluated by cross-validation against (a) simulated yields and (b) independent yields from ground surveys aggregated at village level. The results showed that the RF (Random Forest) model outperformed the MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) model for year-on-year yield estimation at the end of the season when compared to simulated yields. Surface soil moisture (SSM) information, as a proxy for soil water available for plant growth, together with information on the temperature of the canopy cover, helped to improve the RF maize yield model, impacting more particularly the estimation of crop water stress. Lastly, two months before harvest the RF model predicted 46% of the observed end-of-season maize grain yield variability. The combined remote sensing, crop model and machine learning method is thus an effective approach for estimating and forecasting inter-annual maize crop yields in environments where field data are scarce, such as in most parts of the African continent. However, more research is needed to better retrieve the spatial variability of yields in order to strengthen current agricultural monitoring systems, and to address societal challenges, such as declining food security.

TI  - A spatial assessment of the forest carbon budget for Ukraine
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial representation of forest cover and forest parameters is a prerequisite for undertaking a systems approach to the full and verified carbon accounting of forest ecosystems over large areas. This study focuses on Ukraine, which contains a diversity of bioclimatic conditions and natural landscapes found across Europe. Ukraine has a high potential to sequester carbon dioxide through afforestation and proper forest management. This paper presents a new 2010 forest map for Ukraine at a 60 m resolution with an accuracy of 91.6 +/- 0.8% (CI 0.95), which is then applied to the calculation of the carbon budget. The forest cover map and spatially distributed forest parameters were developed through the integration of remote sensing data, forest statistics, and data collected using the Geo-Wiki application, which involves visual interpretation of very high-resolution satellite imagery. The use of this map in combination with the mapping of other forest parameters had led to a decrease in the uncertainty of the forest carbon budget for Ukraine. The application of both stock-based and flux-based methods shows that Ukrainian forests have served as a net carbon sink, absorbing 11.4 +/- 1.7 Tg C year(-1) in 2010, which is around 25% less than the official values reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

TI  - Time series harmonic regression analysis reveals seasonal vegetation productivity trends in semi-arid savannas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation cover in savannas is characterized by high spatial heterogeneity driven by natural and anthropogenic drivers acting at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This research article identifies trends in vegetation cover and productivity in response to both land management and variable precipitation through a methodological approach that incorporates vegetation transect fieldwork with satellite imagery time series analysis. The phenological cycles of semi-arid savanna vegetation were analyzed over 27 years for both a protected area and a privately-owned property in order to capture multiple vegetation cover categories within the eastern Edwards Plateau ecoregion of central Texas. Line-intercept vegetation transects were established across these two sites in 2015, with ground cover and structural vegetation measurements collected along each transect. These measurements were classified based upon distinct vegetation cover categories: woodland, intermediate, open, and open disturbed. Time series analysis of vegetation productivity utilized 111 multi-season Landsat TM5 and Landsat 8 images that captured spring, fall, and winter seasonalities across the 27-year time period spanning from 1988 to 2015, with the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) calculated as an indicator of vegetative productivity. Harmonic regression was applied to this time series in order to determine the relationship between time of year with respect to growing season and productivity level across vegetation cover types. Fixed mean harmonic amplitudes for calendar year productivity were calculated across the entire time period as well as across three natural breaks-based sub-divisions of the 27-year period. Mean amplitudes per transect were then plotted against field-truthed tree-grass ratios in order to determine the relationship between tree and grass cover and mean harmonic SAVI amplitude. Harmonic regression identified inter- and intra-annual seasonal variability across cover types, with woodland sites exhibiting much lower variability in SAVI levels than open sites. These results provide insight into the phenological response of vegetation cover types typical of semi-arid savannas to spatially and temporally variable precipitation levels and land management schemes, allowing for better informed management and monitoring strategies for these environments.

TI  - Evaluation of the Uncertainty in Satellite-Based Crop State Variable Retrievals Due to Site and Growth Stage Specific Factors and Their Potential in Coupling with Crop Growth Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coupling crop growth models and remote sensing provides the potential to improve our understanding of the genotype x environment x management (G x E x M) variability of crop growth on a global scale. Unfortunately, the uncertainty in the relationship between the satellite measurements and the crop state variables across different sites and growth stages makes it difficult to perform the coupling. In this study, we evaluate the effects of this uncertainty with MODIS data at the Mead, Nebraska Ameriflux sites (US-Ne1, US-Ne2, and US-Ne3) and accurate, collocated Hybrid-Maize (HM) simulations of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy light use efficiency (LUECanopy). The simulations are used to both explore the sensitivity of the satellite-estimated genotype x management (G x M) parameters to the satellite retrieval regression coefficients and to quantify the amount of uncertainty attributable to site and growth stage specific factors. Additional ground-truth datasets of LAI and LUECanopy are used to validate the analysis. The results show that uncertainty in the LAI/satellite measurement regression coefficients lead to large uncertainty in the G x M parameters retrievable from satellites. In addition to traditional leave-one-site-out regression analysis, the regression coefficient uncertainty is assessed by evaluating the retrieval performance of the temporal change in LAI and LUECanopy. The weekly change in LAI is shown to be retrievable with a correlation coefficient absolute value (|r|) of 0.70 and root-mean square error (RMSE) value of 0.4, which is significantly better than the performance expected if the uncertainty was caused by random error rather than secondary effects caused by site and growth stage specific factors (an expected |r| value of 0.36 and RMSE value of 1.46 assuming random error). As a result, this study highlights the importance of accounting for site and growth stage specific factors in remote sensing retrievals for future work developing methods coupling remote sensing with crop growth models.

TI  - Handheld projective imaging device for near-infrared fluorescence imaging and intraoperative guidance of sentinel lymph node resection
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a handheld projective imaging device for orthotopic projection of near-infrared fluorescence images onto target biological tissue at visible wavelengths without any additional visual aid. The device integrates a laser diode light source module, a camera module, a projector, an ultrasonic distance sensor, a Raspberry Pi single-board computer, and a battery module in a rugged handheld unit. It is calibrated at the detected working distance for seamless coregistration between fluorescence emission and projective imaging at the target tissue site. The proposed device is able to achieve a projection resolution higher than 314 mu m and a planar projection bias less than 1 mm at a projection field of view of 58 x 108 mm(2) and a working distance of 27 cm. Technical feasibility for projective imaging is verified in an ex vivo model of chicken breast tissue using indocyanine green as a fluorescence agent. Clinical utility for image-guided surgery is demonstrated in a clinical trial where sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients are identified and resected under the guidance of projective imaging. Our ex vivo and in vivo experiments imply the clinical utility of deploying the proposed device for image-guided surgical interventions in resource-limited settings. (C) The Authors.

CP  - 35th International Geological Congress (IGC)
CL  - Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA
AB  - Morphological change in the Qinzhou Bay (QZB), southwest China, has been studied, using bathymetric charts and remote sensing data. Historical admiralty charts were digitized and analyzed in a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment to provide quantitative estimates of underwater topography changes for exploring the accretion-erosion characteristics from 1960s to 2010s. Multi-temporal satellite images have been used to analyze the coastline developments. The results showed that the bathymetry and coastline of QZB changed dramatically in recent decades. The subaqueous area decreased by about 8% in the study area during the last 50 years, mainly due to coastal land reclamation. The average growth rate of the coastlines was 2.07 km/yr. between 1978 and 2013 with natural curvy coastlines being replaced by straighter artificial shorelines. During the period from 1960s to 1990s, the evolution of QZB was mainly governed by natural factors with slight deposition or erosion in the deep troughs. From 1990s to 2010s, intensive large-scale human activities, such as port building, channel dredging and artificial island construction became the main causes affecting morphological changes in the QZB. Approximately half of the underwater terrain had undergone significant changes (greater than +/- 0.5 m), and the proportion of deposition area accounting for 32.26% of the subaqueous area, about twice more than erosion area. Large scale reclamation projects have made dramatic negative impact on coastal natural ecosystem. Integrated coastal zone management need to be carried out to maintain the balance between economic development and ecological health.

TI  - Examining hickory plantation expansion and evaluating suitability for it using multitemporal satellite imagery and ancillary data
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hickory (Carya cathayensis) plantations in northwestern Zhejiang Province, China, have been extensively expanded in the past three decades due to their high economic value; however, improper management has caused serious soil erosion problems. To better manage hickory plantations, it is necessary to accurately map the spatial distribution of hickory expansion and to evaluate land suitability of current hickory plantations, but little research on these issues has been conducted. This research used bi-temporal Chinese satellite Gaofen-1 images in 2015 (leaf-on and leaf-off) in combination with digital elevation model (DEM) data to develop a land-cover map with emphasis on young and mature hickory plantations using the random forest (RF) approach. The distribution data of hickory plantations in 2015 was then used to extract the spectral signatures of the 2010 Landsat imagery. The extracted spectral signatures were classified into different land covers using cluster analysis. The same approach was used with the Landsat imagery in 2005, 2000, 1995, 1990, and 1985 for mapping hickory dynamic change over time. The maximum entropy-based (MaxEnt) model was then used to evaluate the land suitability of these hickory plantations based on the identified factors from DEM, soil, and climate data. The results indicate that (1) the RF classifier based on multisource data can effectively produce a land-cover map with an overall accuracy of 89.5%, in particular, producer's and user's accuracies of 88.7% and 90.2%, respectively, for mature hickory, and 95.2% and 88.9%, respectively, for young hickory plantations; (2) the areas of hickory plantations increased from 157.6 km(2) in 1985 to 528.5 km(2) in 2015 with the highest average annual increase rate of 25.3 km(2) in 2000-2005 and mainly at the cost of coniferous forests, followed by shrub and broadleaf forests; and (3) the MaxEnt model can be effectively used to evaluate suitability for hickory plantations. Three suitability levels-highly suitable, moderately suitable, and marginally suitable-were grouped. The mature hickory forests in 1985 had a higher proportion at the highly suitable level than the expanded hickory plantations between 1985 and 2015. This research provides important results for local governments and farmers to improve the management of young hickory plantations. The approach used in this research may be used for evaluation of land suitability for other cash forests such as Torreya.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Characteristics of Area Coverage and Observation Geometry of the MISR Land-surface BRF Product: A Case Study of the Central Part of Northeast Asia
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) land-surface (LS) bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) product (MILS_BRF) has unique semi-simultaneous multi-angle sampling and global coverage. However, unlike on-satellite observations, the spatio-temporal characteristics of MILS_BRF data have rarely been explicitly and comprehensively analysed. Results from 5-yr (2011-2015) of MILS_BRF dataset from a typical region in central Northeast Asia as the study area showed that the monthly area coverage as well as MILS_BRF data quantity varies significantly, from the highest in October (99.05%) through median in June/July (78.09%/75.21%) to lowest in January (18.97%), and a large data-vacant area exists in the study area during four consecutive winter months (December through March). The data-vacant area is mainly composed of crop lands and cropland/natural vegetation mosaic. The amount of data within the principal plane (PP) +/- 30 degrees (nPP) or cross PP +/- 30 degrees (nCP), varies intra-annually with significant differences from different view zeniths or forward/backward scattering directions. For example, multiple off-nadir cameras have nPP but no nCP data for up to six months (September through February), with the opposite occurring in June and July. This study provides explicit and comprehensive information about the spatio-temporal characteristics of product coverage and observation geometry of MILS_BRF in the study area. Results provide required user reference information for MILS_BRF to evaluate performance of BRDF models or to compare with other satellite-derived BRF or albedo products. Comparing this final product to on-satellite observations, what was found here reveals a new perspective on product spatial coverage and observation geometry for multi-angle remote sensing.

TI  - Longer conserved alpine forests ecosystem exhibits higher stability to climate change on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimsVegetation dynamics are simultaneously regulated by climate change and anthropogenic activities. Since the 1980s, climate has been warming on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) at a rate higher than North Hemisphere average. Anthropogenic activities, including grazing, farming, and urbanization, are also influencing the alpine ecosystem on the TP. Especially, an ensemble of large engineering projects, such as power transported from west to east by State Grid, has been in operation on the TP. While studies disentangling effects of climate and anthropogenic activities interference are still lacking for the forest ecosystems on the TP. The overarching objectives of this study were to separate effects of natural climates and human interferences on forest ecosystem dynamics on the TP.MethodsWe compared vegetation activities of two typical natural reserves (Gongbu natural reserve, GNR, and Yarlung zangbo river grand canyon natural reserve, YNR) and their surroundings in southeastern Tibet (outside of the natural reserves, ONR) using long-term satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset. Linear regression and partial correlation analyses were constructed for the relationship between vegetation activity and climates to evaluate the distinct climate effects on the two natural reserves.Important FindingsThe two natural reserves were established at different time, which were related to anthropogenic activities impact durations. The results showed that the annual mean NDVI fluctuated between 0.5 and 0.6 in the relatively longer reserved YNR, which was remarkably higher than those in other regions (with NDVI lower than 0.45). The vegetation vigor in the YNR showed neither a significant temporal trend nor significant relationship with climate. Nevertheless, vegetation vigor exhibited a significant increasing trend during the last three decades (0.012/decade) at the GNR. The inter-decadal analysis turned out positive relationships between vegetation vigor and annual temperature since late 1990s until early 2000s when the GNR was officially established. This study underlined the importance of considering human interference duration when assessing the relationships between vegetation dynamics and climates.

TI  - HOW PRE-OPERATIVE SENTINEL LYMPH NODE CONTRAST-ENHANCED ULTRASOUND HELPS INTRA-OPERATIVE SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY IN BREAST CANCER: INITIAL EXPERIENCE
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - We aimed to evaluate the value of sentinel lymph node contrast-enhanced ultrasound (SLN-CEUS) and surface tracing for the biopsy of intra-operative sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Between June 2015 and December 2017, a total of 453 patients with early invasive breast cancer were recruited. Patients received an intradermal injection of microbubble contrast agent around the areola on the day before surgery. The locations and sizes of lymphatic channels (LCs) and SLNs were marked on the body surface using gentian violet. Then, injection of double blue dye was performed half an hour before surgery. We compared the pathway of LCs and the location of SLNs obtained from SLN-CEUS and blue dye during surgery. Among the 453 patients, the mean numbers of LCs and SLNs detected by SLN-CEUS were 1.42 and 1.72, respectively, and the coincidence rate was 98.2% compared with blue dye during surgery. The median distance from the SLN to skin measured by preoperative CEUS and blue dye was 1.95 +/- 0.69 and 2.03 +/- 0.87 cm (p = 0.35). There were three SLN enhancement in our research, including homogeneous enhancement, inhomogeneous enhancement and no enhancement, with the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of SLN-CEUS for the diagnosis of SLNs being 96.82%, 91.91%, 87.54% and 98.01%, respectively. SLN-CEUS with skin marking can identify the pathway of LCs and the location of the SLN before surgery, measure the distance from the SLN to skin and determine if the SLN is metastatic. SLN-CEUS can be used as an effective complement to the blue dye method. (C) 2019 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology. All rights reserved.

TI  - Enhanced Super-Resolution Mapping of Urban Floods Based on the Fusion of Support Vector Machine and General Regression Neural Network
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Super-resolution mapping of urban flood (SMUF) is one of the hotspots in remote sensing and urban environment research. In this letter, a new SMUF method based on the fusion of support vector machine and general regression neural network (FSVMGRNN) was proposed to achieve enhanced performance. An SVM-SMUF algorithm was developed and a fusion criterion was formulated. Then, the FSVMGRNN-SMUF algorithm was developed. The results of FSVMGRNN-SMUF were evaluated using Landsat 8 OLI imagery of two representative cities in China. FSVMGRNN-SMUF yielded the most accurate SMUF results among the five SMUF methods according to visual comparisons and quantitative comparisons. The mapping accuracy of FSVMGRNN-SMUF related to the kernel functions was also analyzed and discussed. The results of this letter will help to boost practical applications of median-low resolution remote sensing images in urban flooding mapping, and to strengthen the means for monitoring and assessing urban flooding disasters.

TI  - Impacts of ocean tidal loading on coastal deformation mapping with wide-swath InSAR observations
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal zone is one of the most complex and fragile natural ecological environments in the world. Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) techniques can provide vital information on surface topography and deformation in the ocean-land transition zones under the background of global human activities, climate warming and violent tectonic movements over subduction zones. Ocean tides cause a temporal variation of the ocean mass distribution and the associated load on the crust and produce time-varying deformations of the Earth that can reach 100 mm with a wavelength scale of 10(2) similar to 10(3) km and deformation gradients of mm level to cm level. This kind of non-tectonic signals will have a significant impact on InSAR precision deformation analysis (e. g. large-scale slow and non-steady tectonic deformation with small magnitude). In this study, we used various ocean tidal models to investigate the ocean tidal load (OTL) effects on wide-swath (WS) mode InSAR (e. g. ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1A) deformation monitoring in three typical coastal regions including China, Chile and Gulf of Alaska. We detailedly demonstrated the method of three-dimensional component estimation of OTL and differential OTL phase for WS InSAR and further discussed the differences of ocean tidal models in the estimation of OTL displacements. We find that (1) the magnitude of the OTL effects relates with the spatial range of the study regions, and (2) there are strong correlations between the OTL deformation gradient changes and costal topography. Therefore, traditional flat or curved surface fitting methods are difficult to effectively separate the tidal load displacement for the long wavelength deformation monitoring. It is thus highly recommended in this paper that they should be estimated and corrected carefully in interferometric processing, particularly when long wavelength crustal deformation is targeted. For long time series of deformation monitoring over a wide range of coastal zone (>100 km), if image acquisition time was not away from the astronomical tide and tidal changes in the peak time especially for those Sentinel SAR images with shorter temporal baselines (e. g. 12 days), one should consider how to effectively estimate and correct the OTL effects. Besides, InSAR OTL estimation should keep up to date with the latest global ocean models at high spatial resolution or region tidal models integrated with long-term tide gauge observation.

TI  - Method to Measure Light Spot Position in Beacon-Less Inter-Satellite Communication System
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on a beacon-less Inter-satellite optical wireless communication (Is-OWC) system. This system uses the same wavelength for the transmitted and received laser beams and uses part of communication light beam as beacon light instead of an additional high divergent beacon laser. Thus, a part of transmitted light will be reflected in optical path and leaked into acquisition, tracking and targeting (ATP) subsystem. This reflected light will seriously interfere with the spot position measurement of received light. To solve this problem, we propose a new method based on intensity modulation and cyclic cross-correlation (CCR). Experiment results show that even when the reflected and received beams differ in intensity by 91.7 times, we can still accurately detect the received light spot position by using the proposed method, where the maximum error is 0.026 mrad and the root mean square error is as low as 0.012 mrad.

TI  - A Positive Iris Feedback: Insights from Climate Simulations with Temperature-Sensitive Cloud-Rain Conversion
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates for equilibrium climate sensitivity from current climate models continue to exhibit a large spread, from 2.1 to 4.7 K per carbon dioxide doubling. Recent studies have found that the treatment of precipitation efficiency in deep convective clouds-specifically the conversion rate from cloud condensate to rain C-p-may contribute to the large intermodel spread. It is common for convective parameterization in climate models to carry a constant C-p, although its values are model and resolution dependent. In this study, we investigate how introducing a potential iris feedback, the cloud-climate feedback introduced by parameterizing C-p to increase with surface temperature, affects future climate simulations within a slab ocean configuration of the Community Earth System Model. Progressively stronger dependencies of C-p on temperature unexpectedly increase the equilibrium climate sensitivity monotonically from 3.8 to up to 4.6 K. This positive iris feedback puzzle, in which a reduction in cirrus clouds increases surface temperature, is attributed to changes in the opacity of convectively detrained cirrus. Cirrus clouds reduced largely in ice content and marginally in horizontal coverage, and thus the positive shortwave cloud radiative feedback dominates. The sign of the iris feedback is robust across different cloud macrophysics schemes, which control horizontal cloud cover associated with detrained ice. These results suggest a potentially strong but highly uncertain connection among convective precipitation, detrained anvil cirrus, and the high cloud feedback in a climate forced by increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.

TI  - Airborne Lidar Sampling Strategies to Enhance Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation from Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) is important in many applications, including monitoring carbon stocks, investigating deforestation and forest degradation, and designing sustainable forest management strategies. Although lidar provides critical three-dimensional forest structure information for estimating AGB, acquiring comprehensive lidar coverage is often cost prohibitive. This research focused on developing a lidar sampling framework to support AGB estimation from Landsat images. Two sampling strategies, systematic and classification-based, were tested and compared. The proposed strategies were implemented over a temperate forest study site in northern New York State and the processes were then validated at a similar site located in central New York State. Our results demonstrated that while the inclusion of lidar data using systematic or classification-based sampling supports AGB estimation, the systematic sampling selection method was highly dependent on site conditions and had higher accuracy variability. Of the 12 systematic sampling plans, R-2 values ranged from 0.14 to 0.41 and plot root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 84.2 to 93.9 Mg ha(-1). The classification-based sampling outperformed 75% of the systematic sampling strategies at the primary site with R-2 of 0.26 and RMSE of 70.1 Mg ha(-1). The classification-based lidar sampling strategy was relatively easy to apply and was readily transferable to a new study site. Adopting this method at the validation site, the classification-based sampling also worked effectively, with an R-2 of 0.40 and an RMSE of 108.2 Mg ha(-1) compared to the full lidar coverage model with an R-2 of 0.58 and an RMSE of 96.0 Mg ha(-1). This study evaluated different lidar sample selection methods to identify an efficient and effective approach to reduce the volume and cost of lidar acquisitions. The forest type classification-based sampling method described in this study could facilitate cost-effective lidar data collection in future studies.

TI  - Optimal Endmember-Based Super-Resolution Land Cover Mapping
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Super-resolution mapping (SRM) aims to determine the spatial distribution of the land cover classes contained in the area represented by mixed pixels to obtain a more appropriate and accurate map at a finer spatial resolution than the input remotely sensed image. The image-based SRM models directly use the observed images as input and can mitigate the uncertainty caused by class fraction errors. However, existing image-based SRM models always adopt a fixed set of endmembers used in the entire image, ignoring the spatial variability and spectral uncertainty of endmembers. To address this problem, this letter proposed an optimal endmember-based SRM (OESRM) model, which considers the spatial variations in endmembers, and determines the best-fit one for each coarse resolution pixel using the spectral angle and the spectral distance as the spectral similarity indexes. A Sentinel-2A and a Landsat-8 multispectral images were used to analyze the performance of OESRM, by comparing with three other SRM methods which adopt a fixed endmember set or multiple endmember sets. The results showed that OESRM generated resultant land cover maps with more spatial detail, and reduced the confusion between land cover classes with similar spectral features. The proposed OESRM model produced the results with the highest overall accuracy in both experiments, showing its effectiveness in reducing the effect of endmember uncertainty on SRM.

TI  - Exploring spatial-temporal change and gravity center movement of construction land in the Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban agglomeration is caused by the continuous acceleration of the urbanization process in China. Studying the expansion of construction land can not only know the changes and development of urban agglomeration in time, but also obtain the great significance of the future management. In this study, taking Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan (Chang-Zhu-Tan) urban agglomeration in Hunan province as a study area, Landsat images from 1995 to 2014 and Autologistic-CLUE-S model simulation data were used. Moreover, several factors including gravity center, direction, distance and landscape index were considered in the analysis of the expansion. The results revealed that the construction area increased by 132.18%, from 372.28 km(2) in 1995 to 864.37 km(2) in 2014. And it might even reach 1327.23 km(2) in 2023. Before 2014, three cities had their own respective and discrete development directions. However, because of the integration policy implementation in 2008, the Chang-Zhu-Tan began to gather, the gravity center moved southward after 2014, and the distance between cities decreased, which was in line with the development plan of urban expansion. The research methods and results were relatively reliable, and these results could provide some reference for the future land use planning and spatial allocation in the urbanization process of Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Correlation of SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and Aerosol Optical Depth with Meteorological Conditions over East Asia from 2005 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intense economic and industrial development in China has been accompanied by severe local air pollution, as well as in other downwind countries in East Asia. This study analyzes satellite observational data of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and aerosol optical depth (AOD) to explore the spatial distribution, long-term temporal variation, and correlation to meteorological conditions over this region over the period 2005-2015. SO2 and NO2 data are retrieved from the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) onboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Aura satellite, while AOD data are from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the NASA Aqua satellite. Spatial distributions of SO2, NO2, and AOD show the highest levels in the North China Plain (NCP), with hotspots also in Southeastern China (SC) and the Sichuan Basin (SB). Biomass burning also contributes to a high level of AOD in Southeast Asia in spring and in Equatorial Asia in fall. Considering the correlation of pollutant levels to meteorological conditions, monitoring data show that higher temperature and higher relative humidity (RH) favor the conversion of SO2 and NO2 to sulfate and nitrate aerosol, respectively. The impact of stronger lower tropospheric stability facilitates the accumulation of SO2 and NO2 in NCP and SC. Transport of SO2 and NO2 from intense source regions to relatively clean regions is highly influential over East Asia; such transport from the NCP leads to a considerable increase of pollutants in SC, SB, Taiwan Island (TW), and Taiwan Strait (TWS), particularly in winter. Aerosols generated by biomass burning in Southeast Asia and anthropogenic aerosol in SC are transported to TW and TWS and lead to the increase of AOD, with the highest levels of AOD in SC, TW, and TWS occurring in spring. Precipitation results in the removal of pollutants, especially in highly polluted regions, the effect of which is most significant in winter and spring.

TI  - De Novo Formation of Pial Arteriovenous Fistulas: Systematic Review of Acquired Lesions and Their Clinical Differences Compared with Primary Lesions
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acquired pial arteriovenous fistula (pAVF) is an extremely rare intracranial vascular malformation, with few case reports in the English literature. This study presents a thorough review and analysis of all acquired pAVF cases from the literature in addition to an illustrated case.METHODS: We report a case with de novo development of intracranial pAVF after craniotomy. A medical literature database search between 1975 and 2018, including the Medline, Ovid, and PubMed databases, was performed to identify all reports with possible acquired lesions. Differences between these acquired lesions and previously reported primary lesions were evaluated.RESULTS: A total of 8 patients with de novo formation of acquired pAVF were included in this series. Most of these pAVFs were fed and drained via a similar arteriovenous pattern, from distal/cortical branches of the middle cerebral artery (6/8, 75%) to the superficial middle cerebral vein (6/8, 75%). Compared with a previously reported primary pAVF series, acquired pAVF tended to be asymptomatic (P < 0.0001) and found essentially in adults (P = 0.0061). Fewer venous varices (P = 0.0049) and associated intracranial mass effect (P = 0.0189) were found in the cases of acquired pAVF. All 4 reported acquired pAVFs that were treated microsurgically resulted in complete angiographic obliteration (4/4, 100%). The overall outcome was good or stable even with observation only (7/8, 87.5%).CONCLUSIONS: Acquired pAVF is highly correlated with sentinel neurosurgical procedures or venous occlusion events. These lesions should be regarded as a different disease entity from primary pAVF because of the relatively low-flow shunting and benign clinical course.

TI  - Urban Flood Detection with Sentinel-1 Multi-Temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Observations in a Bayesian Framework: A Case Study for Hurricane Matthew
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we explored the application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity time series for urban flood detection. Our test case was the flood in Lumberton, North Carolina, USA, caused by the landfall of Hurricane Matthew on 8 October 2016, for which airborne imagery-taken on the same day as the SAR overpass-is available for validation of our technique. To map the flood, we first carried out normalization of the SAR intensity observations, based on the statistics from the time series, and then construct a Bayesian probability function for intensity decrease (due to specular reflection of the signal) and intensity increase (due to double bounce) cases separately. We then formed a flood probability map, which we used to create our preferred flood extent map using a global cutoff probability of 0.5. Our flood map in the urban area showed a complicated mosaicking pattern of pixels showing SAR intensity decrease, pixels showing intensity increase, and pixels without significant intensity changes. Our approach shows improved performance when compared with global thresholding on log intensity ratios, as the time series-based normalization has accounted for a certain level of spatial variation by considering the different history for each pixel. This resulted in improved performance for urban and vegetated regions. We identified smooth surfaces, like asphalt roads, and SAR shadows as the major sources of underprediction, and aquatic plants and soil moisture changes were the major sources of overprediction.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Assessment of Drought in Ethiopia and the Impact of Recent Intense Droughts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent droughts that have occurred in different parts of Ethiopia are generally linked to fluctuations in atmospheric and ocean circulations. Understanding these large-scale phenomena that play a crucial role in vegetation productivity in Ethiopia is important. In view of this, several techniques and datasets were analyzed to study the spatio-temporal variability of vegetation in response to a changing climate. In this study, 18 years (2001-2018) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroscopy (MODIS) Terra/Aqua, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) daily precipitation, and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) soil moisture datasets were processed. Pixel-based Mann-Kendall trend analysis and the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) were used to assess the drought patterns during the cropping season. Results indicate that the central highlands and northwestern part of Ethiopia, which have land cover dominated by cropland, had experienced decreasing precipitation and NDVI trends. About 52.8% of the pixels showed a decreasing precipitation trend, of which the significant decreasing trends focused on the central and low land areas. Also, 41.67% of the pixels showed a decreasing NDVI trend, especially in major parts of the northwestern region of Ethiopia. Based on the trend test and VCI analysis, significant countrywide droughts occurred during the El Nino 2009 and 2015 years. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation coefficient analysis assures that the low NDVI was mainly attributed to the low precipitation and water availability in the soils. This study provides valuable information in identifying the locations with the potential concern of drought and planning for immediate action of relief measures. Furthermore, this paper presents the results of the first attempt to apply a recently developed index, the Normalized Difference Latent Heat Index (NDLI), to monitor drought conditions. The results show that the NDLI has a high correlation with NDVI (r = 0.96), precipitation (r = 0.81), soil moisture (r = 0.73), and LST (r = -0.67). NDLI successfully captures the historical droughts and shows a notable correlation with the climatic variables. The analysis shows that using the radiances of green, red, and short wave infrared (SWIR), a simplified crop monitoring model with satisfactory accuracy and easiness can be developed.

TI  - Oceanic Internal Waves in the Sulu-Celebes Sea Under Sunglint and Moonglint
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moonglint and sunglint satellite imagery acquired from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite sensors were used to study the characteristics of internal waves (IWs) and their relationship to tides and stratification in the Sulu- Celebes Sea. Tidally generated IWs propagate northwestward and southeastward into the Sulu and Celebes Seas, showing a spring-neap tidal cycle behavior with larger/smaller IWs occurring under spring/neap tides, respectively. The length of IW crests, their wavelength, and phase speed derived from the sunglint/moonglint image pairs were observed to decrease from spring to neap tides. IWs in the Sulu-Celebes Sea which are correlated with oceanic stratification display seasonal and regional fluctuations. In the Celebes Sea, IWs were less frequently observed but propagated with faster phase speeds and larger scales compared to those in the Sulu Sea. Comparisons of stratification and barotropic tidal transport among the IWs generation sites indicate that the shallowing maximum Brunt-Vaisala frequency and strongest tidal transport around Pearl Bank are major factors contributing to greater IW activity compared to other generation sites. IWs generated near Pangutaran Island and Pearl Bank further merge into one dynamical system, creating longer wave crests of similar to 200 km that travel at faster phase speed (similar to 2.5 m.s(-1)) in the Sulu Sea. This paper demonstrates a new application using a combination of sunglint/moonglint imagery in tracking an important oceanic phenomenon.

TI  - An efficient approach to capture continuous impervious surface dynamics using spatial-temporal rules and dense Landsat time series stacks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface dynamics have far-reaching consequences on both the environment and human well-being. The expansion of impervious surface is often spontaneous and conscious, particularly in fast developing regions. Thus, monitoring impervious surface dynamics with high temporal frequency in a both accurate and efficient manner is highly needed. Here, we propose an approach to capture continuous impervious surface dynamics using spatial-temporal rules and dense time series stacks of Landsat data. First, a stable area mask based on image classification in the start and the end years is generated to remove pixels that are persistent or spatially irrelevant. The Continuous Change Detection (CCD) algorithm is then employed to determine the change points when non-impervious cover converts to impervious surface based on the property of temporal irreversibility. Finally, the CCD time series models are calibrated for pixels with no change or multiple changes. We apply and assess the proposed approach in Nanchang (China), which has been experiencing rapid impervious surface expansion during the past decade. According to the validation results, overall accuracies of image classification in the start and the end years are 97.2% and 96.7%, respectively. Our approach generates convincing results for impervious surface change detection, with overall accuracy of 85.5% at the annual scale, which is higher than three commonly used approaches in previous studies. At the continuous scale, the mean biases of the detected time of imperviousness emergence are +0.17 (backward) and -3.42 (forward) Landsat revisit periods (16 days) for pixels with one single change and multiple changes, respectively. The derived impervious surface extent maps exhibit comparable performances with five widely used products. The present approach offers a new perspective for providing timely and accurate impervious surface dynamics with dense temporal frequency and high classification accuracy.

TI  - High-Performance Time-Series Quantitative Retrieval From Satellite Images on a GPU Cluster
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality and accuracy of remote sensing instruments continue to increase, allowing geoscientists to perform various quantitative retrieval applications to observe the geophysical variables of land, atmosphere, ocean, etc. The explosive growth of time-series remote sensing (RS) data over large-scales poses great challenges on managing, processing, and interpreting RS "Big Data." To explore these time-series RS data efficiently, in this paper, we design and implement a high-performance framework to address the time-consuming time-series quantitative retrieval issue on a graphics processing unit cluster, taking the aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval from satellite images as a study case. The presented framework exploits the multilevel parallelism for time-series quantitative RS retrieval to promote efficiency. At the coarse-grained level of parallelism, the AOD time-series retrieval is represented as multidirected acyclic graph workflows and scheduled based on a list-based heuristic algorithm, heterogeneous earliest finish time, taking the idle slot and priorities of retrieval jobs into account. At the fine-grained level, the parallel strategies for the major remote sensing image processing algorithms divided into three categories, i.e., the point or pixel-based operations, the local operations, and the global or irregular operations have been summarized. The parallel framework was implemented with message passing interface and compute unified device architecture, and experimental results with the AOD retrieval case verify the effectiveness of the presented framework.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the swabs were collected among patients with an influenza-like illness (ILI) admitted to 2 sentinel surveillance hospitals of Yantai from April 2014 to August 2017. All specimen were cultured and identified by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Complete sequences of Hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A were amplified, sequenced and analyzed using molecular and phylogenetic methods. The potential vaccine efficacy were calculated using Pepiiope model. The result, showed that the antigenicity of A (H3N2) had changed greatly. 8 strains of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 belonged to subclade 6B.1 and 14 strains clustered in 6B.2. 12 strains of influenza A (H3N2) fell into subgroup 3C.3a and 33 strains clustered in 3C.2a. Several residues at antigen sites and potential glycosylation sites had changed in influenza A strains. Vaccine efficacy of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 in 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 season; were 77.29% and 79.11% of that of a perfect match with vaccine strain, meanwhile vaccine efficacy of influenza A (H3N2) in 2014/2015, 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 were -5.18%, 16.97% and 42.05% separately. in conclusion, the influenza A viols circulated in Yantai from 2014 to 2017 presented continual genetic variation. The recommended vaccine strains still afforded protection against influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 strains and provided suboptimal protection against influenza A (H3N2) strains.

TI  - Extraction of Earthquake-Induced Collapsed Buildings From Bi-Temporal VHR Images Using Object-Level Homogeneity Index and Histogram
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of very high resolution (VHR) satellite images has made the analysis of remotely sensed data an increasingly effective tool for the extraction of urban building damage caused by earthquakes. In this study, we proposed a novel method to extract collapsed buildings from bi-temporal VHR images using object-level homogeneity index (OHI) and object histogram. The OHI, which is calculated using an improved spatial homogeneity index of pixel, quantifies internal homogeneity of image object generated from image segmentation. The object histogram quantifies the spectral variability of image object. Ground objects that are intact and significantly different from collapsed buildings, such as vegetation and non-vegetated homogeneous areas, were first extracted from post-event VHR image using OHI and normalized difference vegetation index and were masked out. Collapsed buildings were then extracted from bi-temporal images of the remaining areas using object histogram and a curve matching method, multi-reference spectral angle mapper. The proposed method was evaluated and compared to two existing methods using bi-temporal QuickBird images over Bam, Iran, which was heavily hit by an earthquake in 2003. The experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed the two comparative methods, with the increase of 11.38 and 5.65% in overall accuracy, and 14.27 and 7.83% in F-score, respectively. The proposed method provides a fast and reliable method for extraction of collapsed buildings.

TI  - A Tailings Pond Identification Method Based on Spatial Combination of Objects
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tailings ponds pose a significant risk to the safety of the surrounding residents and the local ecological environment. Therefore, it is necessary to efficiently and accurately monitor tailings ponds. However, the internal structures of tailings ponds are heterogeneous, and they are typically identified through manual interpretation. In this paper, an identification method for four main structures of tailings ponds, namely, starter dams, embankments, deposited beach, and water body, is proposed based on the spatial combinations among them. First, hierarchy objects were established based on GaoFen-2 imagery. Then, candidate objects (such as embankment-like) were identified using the spectral features and the number of parallel lines. Subsequently, rural settlement-like objects were eliminated as interfering objects based on their shapes and distributions. Finally, four structures of tailings ponds could be identified based on their spatial combination. Six cases of tailings ponds were selected for validation. Interference categories were eliminated step by step (79.64%, 38.21%, and 39.75% for case A), and all four structures were identified. The overall identification accuracies were 88.14%-96.21%. The average accuracy is 32.02% higher than that of comparison experiments using the random forest. The method was proved to be applicable to the automatic identification of mining areas, which is of great significance for efficient and accurate supervision of mining safety.

TI  - An approach for heavy metal pollution detected from spatio-temporal stability of stress in rice using satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable stressors on crops (e.g., salts, heavy metals), which are characterized by stable spatial patterns over time, are harmful to agricultural production and food security. Satellite data provide temporally and spatially continuous synoptic observations of stable stress on crops. This study presents a method for identifying rice under stable stress (i.e., Cd stress) and exploring its spatio-temporal characteristics indicators. The study area is a major rice growing region located in Hunan Province, China. Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat images from 2008-2017 as well as in situ measurements were collected. The coupling of a leaf canopy radiative transfer model with the World Food Study Model (WOFOST) via a wavelet transform isolated the effects of Cd stress from other abrupt stressors. An area wavelet transform stress signal (AWTS), based on a time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), was used to detect rice under Cd stress, and its spatio-temporal variation metrics explored. The results indicate that spatial variation coefficients (SVC) of AWTS in the range of 0-1 ha d a coverage area greater than 70% in each experimental region, regardless of the year. Over ten years, the temporal variation coefficients (TVC) of AWTS in the range of 0-1 occurred frequently (more than 60% of the time). In addition, the Pearson correlation coefficient of AWTS over two consecutive years was usually greater than 0.5. We conclude that a combination of multi-year satellite-derived vegetation index data with a physical model simulation is an effective and novel method for detecting crops under environmental stress. A wavelet transform proved promising in differentiating between the effects of stable stress and abrupt stress on rice and may offer a way forward for diagnosing crop stress at continental and global scales.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Differentiation and the Factors of Ecological Vulnerability in the Toutun River Basin Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological vulnerability assessment increases the knowledge of ecological status and contributes to formulating local plans of sustainable development. A methodology based on remote sensing data and spatial principal component analysis was introduced to discuss ecological vulnerability in the Toutun River Basin (TRB). Exploratory spatial data analysis and a geo-detector were employed to evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of ecological vulnerability and detect the driving factors. Four results were presented: (1) During 2003 and 2017, the average values of humidity, greenness, and heat in TRB increased by 49.71%, 11.63%, and 6.51% respectively, and the average values of dryness decreased by 165.24%. However, the extreme differences in greenness, dryness, and heat tended to be obvious. (2) The study area was mainly dominated by a high and extreme vulnerability grade, and the ecological vulnerability grades showed the distribution pattern that the northern desert area was more vulnerable than the central artificial oasis, and the central artificial oasis was more vulnerable than the southern mountainous area. (3) Ecological vulnerability in TRB showed significant spatial autocorrelation characteristics, and the trend was enhanced. The spatial distribution of hot/cold spots presented the characteristics of hot spot-cold spot-secondary hot spot-cold spot from north to south. (4) The explanatory power of each factor of ecological vulnerability was temperature (0.5955) > land use (0.5701) > precipitation (0.5289) > elevation (0.4879) > slope (0.3660) > administrative division (0.1541). The interactions of any two factors showed a non-linear strengthening effect, among which, land use type elevation (0.7899), land use type precipitation (0.7867), and land use type temperature (0.7791) were the significant interaction for ecological vulnerability. Overall, remote sensing data contribute to realizing a quick and objective evaluation of ecological vulnerability and provide valuable information for decision making concerning ecology management and region development.

TI  - Validation of GaoFen-1 Satellite Geometric Products Based on Reference Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of high-resolution remote sensing satellite data are becoming increasingly extensive. China has launched a series of high-resolution optical satellites: GaoFen-1 (GF-1), GaoFen-2, etc., and published several remote sensing image products. However, validation of the long time series of these satellite geometric products is lacking. Therefore, this study selects 2013-2016 GaoFen-1 satellite geometry products for the Beijing area over four years, obtaining a total of 164 images, and uses ZY-3 satellite products to verify the accuracy of the data set. Moreover, the positioning accuracy of the geometric products of two camera types carried by GF-1 (wide field of view, WFV; panchromatic and multispectral, PMS) is analyzed. The results yield the following conclusions. (1) GF-1 satellite geometric products have obvious systematic errors, and the error value varies significantly with the orbit time. (2) The internal distortion of the GF-1 satellite image is well controlled, and the geometric offset magnitude and direction of ground control points (GCPs) are very similar in the interior of each scene. (3) In a short period of time (20 days), the offset direction of the four WFV cameras is very similar, but there is a small difference in the mean plane offset (RMSE2D). The RMSE2D and offset direction of the two PMS cameras are very similar. (4) In the long term, the relative offset of the WFV and PMS cameras varies with the satellite orbit time. At the first year of the satellite orbit time (in 2014), the relative offsets of four WFV cameras increased to maximum (168.96 m, 171.12 m, 226.65 m, and 207.04 m). From 2015 to 2016, the offsets decreased to a relatively stable state (within 100 m). (5) This validation method based on reference data is shown to be feasible. This study provides an important reference for the application of high-resolution remote sensing satellite products.

TI  - Learning from data: A post classification method for annual land cover analysis in urban areas
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual analyses of land cover dynamics in urban areas provide a thorough understanding of the urbanization effects on environment and valuable information for the improvement of urban growth modeling. However, most current studies focus on major land cover changes, such as urbanization and vegetation loss. The most feasible way to evaluate the complex interactions among different land cover types is the post-classification change detection, but the temporal inconsistency in the time series of land cover maps impedes the high-frequency and long-term analyses. This study proposed a spatio-temporal land cover filter (STLCF) to remove the illogical land cover change events in the time series of land cover maps, and analyzed the annual land cover dynamics in urban areas. The knowledge of illogical land cover change events was 'learned' from the land cover maps through the spatio-temporal transition probability matrix, instead of experts' knowledge. The illogical change was modified with the land cover of the maximum probability calculated from the naive Bayesian equation. The STLCF was tested in Wuhan, a typical densely urbanized Chinese city. The annual land cover maps from 2000 to 2013 were derived from multi-date Landsat images using the Decision Tree (DT) classifier. Results showed that the STLCF improved the mean overall accuracy of annual change detection by about 6%. Additionally, the amount of land cover trajectories with unrealistically frequent changes was significantly decreased. During the study period, 7.86% of the pixels experienced one land cover change, and about 0.57% of the pixels experienced land cover changes more than once. The annual analyses demonstrated the non-linear increasing trend in urbanization as well as the corresponding trend in vegetation loss in the study area. We also found the conversion from built-up areas to vegetation near rivers and lakes and in the reserves and rural areas, mainly caused by the restoration of built-up areas to the park or green belt/wedges along rivers and new roads in the metropolitan areas, and to the cropland and woods in the rural areas. Results of this study showed the importance of the spatio-temporal consistency check with knowledge derived from land cover maps of the study area, which facilitates the annual analyses of major and subtle land cover dynamics in urban areas.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of lithium mining and environmental degradation in the Atacama Salt Flat, Chile
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerging electric-vehicle technologies and the global transition to renewable energy have driven the production of lithium batteries significantly in the past ten years. However, potential adverse impacts accompanying this transition require closer scrutiny. The purpose of this research is to assess the environmental impact and its possible correlation with lithium mining in the Atacama Salt Flat, the world's largest lithium extraction site. Using both Landsat imagery and MODIS land products, we investigate the mining areas to (1) determine area and rate of change over time, (2) analyze spatiotemporal patterns of changes in key environmental parameters, and (3) perform regression analysis between lithium mining activities and environmental degradation between 1997 and 2017. We use five environmental parameters for our analysis: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Daytime Land Surface Temperature (Day-LST), Soil Moisture Index (SMI), Nighttime Land Surface Temperature (Night-LST), and Net Evapotranspiration (ET). Our analysis shows that lithium mining operations have expanded rapidly by 7.07% annually. Our pixel-based time-series trend analysis for each image stack, using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope coefficient, shows some significant degradation over the past 20 years including (1) vegetation decline, (2) elevating daytime temperatures, (3) decreasing trend of soil moisture, and (4) increasing drought condition in national reserve areas. However, no substantial degradation in nighttime-LST and ET is observed in the study area. Our analyses of the relationship between mining activities and environmental degradation also indicate that the continuous expansion of lithium mining has strong negative correlations with the NDVI and SMI, and a strong positive correlation with LST. We identified lithium mining activities as one of the major stressors to the local environmental degradation. The results provide a baseline to evaluate future socio-environmental impacts of lithium mining in the region. We anticipate our analysis will help inform mining and environmental regulators, lithium industry decision-makers, and national park managers to provide better management of the world's largest lithium production sites for a sustainable future.

TI  - Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks for Remote Sensing Scene Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown powerful feature representation capability, which provides novel avenues to improve scene classification of remote sensing imagery. Although we can acquire large collections of satellite images, the lack of rich label information is still a major concern in the remote sensing field. In addition, remote sensing data sets have their own limitations, such as the small scale of scene classes and lack of image diversity. To mitigate the impact of the existing problems, a Siamese CNN, which combines the identification and verification models of CNNs, is proposed in this letter. A metric learning regularization term is explicitly imposed on the features learned through CNNs, which enforce the Siamese networks to he more robust. We carried out experiments on three widely used remote sensing data sets for performance evaluation. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the existing methods.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability of Monthly and Annual Snow Depths in Xinjiang, China over 1961-2015 and the Potential Effects
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal variability of snow depth supplies important information for snow disaster prevention. The monthly and annual snow depths and weather data (from Xinjiang Meteorological Observatory) at 102 meteorological stations in Xinjiang, China over 1961-2015 were used to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of snow depths from different aspects. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF), the modified Mann-Kendall method, Morlet wavelet, Daubechies wavelet decomposition and cross wavelet transform were applied to investigate the trend and significance, spatial structure, periods, decomposed series and coherence of monthly and annual snow depths. The results indicated that: (1) The value of EOF first spatial mode (EOF1) of the monthly and annual snow depths in north Xinjiang were larger than south Xinjiang, indicating greater variability of snow depths in north Xinjiang. (2) The change points of annual snow depth mainly occurred during 1969-1979 and 1980-1990. The annual snow depth of most sites showed increasing trends, but with different slope magnitudes. (3) The sites that had main periods of 2-8 and 9-14 years of monthly and annual snow depths (detected by the Morlet wavelet) mainly distributed in northern Xinjiang. The sites that had main periods of 15-20 years of monthly and annual snow depths mainly distributed in southwestern Xinjiang. (4) By using the Daubechies wavelet, the decomposed annual snow depth in entire Xinjiang tended to increase. (5) Through the cross wavelet transform, annual snow depths in entire Xinjiang had good correlations with annual precipitation or relative humidity, and showed a low negative correlation with minimum temperature or sunshine hours. In conclusion, the monthly and annual snow depths had comprehensive spatiotemporal variability but had overall increasing trend during 1961-2015.

TI  - Chlorophyll Concentration Response to the Typhoon Wind-Pump Induced Upper Ocean Processes Considering Air-Sea Heat Exchange
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The typhoon Wind-Pump induced upwelling and cold eddy often promote the significant growth of phytoplankton after the typhoon. However, the importance of eddy-pumping and wind-driven upwelling on the sea surface chlorophyll a concentration (Chl-a) during the typhoon are still not clearly distinguished. In addition, the air-sea heat flux exchange is closely related to the upper ocean processes, but few studies have discussed its role in the sea surface Chl-a variations under typhoon conditions. Based on the cruise data, remote sensing data, and model data, this paper analyzes the contribution of the vertical motion caused by the eddy-pumping upwelling and Ekman pumping upwelling on the surface Chl-a, and quantitatively analyzes the influence of air-sea heat exchange on the surface Chl-a after the typhoon Linfa over the northeastern South China Sea (NSCS) in 2009. The results reveal the Wind Pump impacts on upper ocean processes: (1) The euphotic layer-integrated Chl-a increased after the typhoon, and the increasing of the surface Chl-a was not only the uplift of the deeper waters with high Chl-a but also the growth of the phytoplankton; (2) The Net Heat Flux (air-sea heat exchange) played a major role in controlling the upper ocean physical processes through cooling the SST and indirectly increased the surface Chl-a until two weeks after the typhoon; (3) the typhoon-induced cyclonic eddy was the most important physical process in increasing the surface Chl-a rather than the Ekman pumping and wind-stirring mixing after typhoon; (4) the spatial shift between the surface Chl-a blooms and the typhoon-induced cyclonic eddy could be due to the Ekman transport; (5) nutrients uplifting and adequate light were two major biochemical elements supplying for the growth of surface phytoplankton.

TI  - Mapping Growing Stem Volume of Chinese Fir Plantation Using a Saturation-based Multivariate Method and Quad-polarimetric SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For the planning and sustainable management of forest resources, well-managed plantations are of great significance to mitigate the decrease of forested areas. Monitoring these planted forests is essential for forest resource inventories. In this study, two ALOS PALSAR-2 quad-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and ground measurements were employed to estimate growing stem volume (GSV) of Chinese fir plantations located in a hilly area of southern China. To investigate the relationships between forest GSV and polarization characteristics, single and fused variables were derived by the Yamaguchi decomposition and the saturation value of GSV was estimated using a semi-exponential empirical model as a base model. Based on the estimated saturation values and relative root mean square error (RRMSE), the single and fused characteristics and corresponding models were selected and integrated, which led to a novel saturation-based multivariate method used to improve the GSV estimation and mapping of Chinese fir plantations. The new findings included: (1) All the original polarimetric characteristics, statistically, were not significantly correlated with the forest GSV, and their logarithm and ratio transformation fused variables greatly improved the correlations, thus the estimation accuracy of the forest GSV. (2) The logarithm transformation of surface scattering resulted in the greatest saturation, value but the logarithm transformation of double-bounce scattering resulted in the smallest RRMSE of the GSV estimates. (3) Compared with the single transformations, the fused variables led to more reasonable saturation values and obviously reduced the values of RRMSE. (4) The saturation-based multivariate method led to more accurate estimates of the forest GSV than the univariate method, with the smallest value (29.64%) of RRMSE achieved using the set of six variables. This implied that the novel saturation-based multivariate method provided greater potential to improve the estimation and mapping of the forest GSV.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for management of the N0 neck in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives The management of the clinically N0 (cN0) neck is controversial for early stage squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (OSCC). This paper represents a single institution series analyzing the efficacy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) for early stage oral cavity cancers. Methods From 2005 to 2017, 108 patients with cN0 OSCC were treated with primary resection and SNB. Patients with positive biopsy results proceeded to neck dissection with or without adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Mean follow-up for the entire cohort was 50.8 months (range: 8-147 months). Clinically, 56 patients were T1N0, 49 patients were T2N0, and three patients were T3N0 or greater. Results Disease-specific survival was 93% within the entire cohort. Sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 95.4% of patients. Twenty one patients had a positive biopsy. There were seven false-negative biopsies. The overall rate of nodal disease was 26%. Accuracy of node biopsy was 93%, with sensitivity of 75%, and negative predictive value of 91%. Recurrence rate was 19% (20/108), with an overall survival of 60% in this subgroup. Conclusion SNB is a safe, effective, and well tolerated method for staging cN0 OSCC.

TI  - Field test study and quasi-static analysis of global characteristics and survivability of a wave energy converter test platform mooring system
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN ENGINEERING AND MARINE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a catenary spread mooring system design of a mobile ocean test berth, named the Ocean Sentinel (OS), and developed by the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center to facilitate the ocean testing of wave energy converters (WECs). The original OS mooring design (which was similar to a conventional WEC point absorber mooring system) was evaluated through a field data analysis using a quasi-static approach. The field data analysis on the measurements of mooring tension and environmental conditions collected during an ocean test of the OS is based on a quasi-static analysis of the analytical catenary equations of mooring chains. Both global and survivability characteristics of the mooring system were evaluated. The global characteristics include the influence of the OS excursion on mooring tension, the directional control of the OS, and the environmental contributions of waves, current, and wind. The relationship between the dynamic mooring tension and the environmental conditions of waves and current was quantified through an empirical equation. It was found that the contribution of current to the mooring tension oscillation increased as the current velocity increased and was significant at high current velocity. The survivability characteristics include the anchor movability and strength capacities of mooring lines. Because anchor movement occurred near the end of the field test, a new systematic procedure of designing a mooring system with adequate anchor resistance was developed and applied to improve the OS mooring system design.

TI  - Time series mining subsidence monitoring with temporarily coherent points interferometry synthetic aperture radar: a case study in Peixian, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Peixian, located in the northwest of Xuzhou, Jiangsu province, China, has rich coal resources and is one of the main coal mining regions in this coastal region. Ground subsidence as a result of mining is one of the main causes of environmental damage in Peixian. Using temporarily coherent points interferometry synthetic aperture radar (TCPInSAR), which is characterized by phase unwrapping and temporary coherent points (TCPs), 43 Sentinel-1A images acquired from 4 October 2016 to 21 April 2018 were processed to generate time-series ground deformations of the ZSL (Zhang-shuang-lou), the XZ (Xu-zhuang) and the KZ (Kong-zhuang) mines in the southern region of Peixian. The results showed that the maximum accumulated values for subsidence and velocity in the ZSL mine were -418.3mm and -188.8mm/year, respectively; the maximum accumulated values of subsidence in the XZ mine and the KZ mine reached -213.2mm and -191.5mm, respectively. The monitoring results showed that damage to buildings was consistent with underground mining activities. Therefore, on this basis, the time-series subsidence of large mining areas may be monitored using TCPInSAR.

TI  - Subsurface temperature estimation from remote sensing data using a clustering-neural network method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing observation to estimate subsurface oceanic variables, including subsurface temperature anomaly (STA), is essential for the study of ocean dynamics and climate change. Here we report a new method that combines a pre-clustering process and a neural network (NN) approach to determine the STA using ocean surface temperature, surface height, and surface wind observation data at the global scale. Gridded monthly Argo data were used in the training and validation procedures of the method. Results show that the pre-clustered NN method was better than the same method without clustering, while also outperforming a clustered linear regressor and the random forest method recently reported. The new method was tested over a wide range of time (all months from 2004 to 2010) and depth (down to 1900 m). Overall, our best estimation resulted in an overall root-mean-squared error of 0.41 degrees C and a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.91 at the 50 m level for all months. The R-2 decreased to 0.51 at 300 m but was still better than the calculation without pre-clustering. This method can be expanded to estimate other key oceanic variables and provide new insights in understanding the climate system.

AB  - Point-scale gauge observations have inherent limitations, making it difficult to study the spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation in alpine regions due to gauge undercatch and complex terrains. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission provides new-generation satellite precipitation products that are promising alternative data sources in mountainous areas. However, quality evaluations and bias corrections should be conducted prior to the application of satellite data. In this study, an unprecedentedly dense ground station network composed of more than 1000 automatic weather stations (AWSs) over the Tianshan Mountains in China are used for bias correction of the Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) product. First, universal kriging interpolation is used to downscale IMERG from 0.1 degrees to 500 m to ensure a fair comparison with the gauge observations. Then, the downscaled IMERG precipitation data over this region are corrected by two methods, i.e., stepwise regression (STEP) and geographically weighted regression (GWR). Both methods are established on various terrain factors and vegetation indexes that have strong relations with precipitation. The results show that (1) GWR outperform the conventional STEP method as well as the original IMERG; (2) the original IMERG performs best over the plain region (less than 1000 m), while the best correction effect was found in middle and low-elevation region (1000-1500 m); and (3) the performance of the GWR model is largely dependent on the number of available training stations in mountainous areas. Overall, the methods and results presented in this study provide insight into the correction of satellite precipitation data in mountainous areas with scarce ground observations.

TI  - Capturing coastal water clarity variability with Landsat 8
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal water clarity varies at high temporal and spatial scales due to weather, climate, and human activity along coastlines. Systematic observations are crucial to assessing the impact of water clarity change on aquatic habitats. In this study, Secchi disk depths (Z(SD)) from Boston Harbor, Buzzards Bay, Cape Cod Bay, and Narragansett Bay water quality monitoring organizations were compiled to validate Z(SD) derived from Landsat 8 (L8) imagery, and to generate high spatial resolution Z(SD) maps. From 58 L8 images, acceptable agreement was found between in situ and L8 Z(SD) in Buzzards Bay (N = 42, RMSE = 0.96 m, MAPD = 28%), Cape Cod Bay (N = 11, RMSE = 0.62 m, MAPD = 10%), and Narragansett Bay (N = 8, RMSE = 0.59 m, MAPD = 26%). This work demonstrates the value of merging in situ Z(SD) with high spatial resolution remote sensing estimates for improved coastal water quality monitoring.

TI  - Super-Resolved Multiple Scatterers Detection in SAR Tomography Based on Compressive Sensing Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (CS-GLRT)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of SAR tomography (TomoSAR) on the urban infrastructure and other man-made buildings has gained increasing popularity with the development of modern high-resolution spaceborne satellites. Urban tomography focuses on the separation of the overlaid targets within one azimuth-range resolution cell, and on the reconstruction of their reflectivity profiles. In this work, we build on the existing methods of compressive sensing (CS) and generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), and develop a multiple scatterers detection method named CS-GLRT to automatically recognize the number of scatterers superimposed within a single pixel as well as to reconstruct the backscattered reflectivity profiles of the detected scatterers. The proposed CS-GLRT adopts a two-step strategy. In the first step, an L1-norm minimization is carried out to give a robust estimation of the candidate positions pixel by pixel with super-resolution. In the second step, a multiple hypothesis test is implemented in the GLRT to achieve model order selection, where the mapping matrix is constrained within the afore-selected columns, namely, within the candidate positions, and the parameters are estimated by least square (LS) method. Numerical experiments on simulated data were carried out, and the presented results show its capability of separating the closely located scatterers with a quasi-constant false alarm rate (QCFAR), as well as of obtaining an estimation accuracy approaching the Cramer-Rao Low Bound (CRLB). Experiments on real data of Spotlight TerraSAR-X show that CS-GLRT allows detecting single scatterers with high density, distinguishing a considerable number of double scatterers, and even detecting triple scatterers. The estimated results agree well with the ground truth and help interpret the true structure of the complex or buildings studied in the SAR images. It should be noted that this method is especially suitable for urban areas with very dense infrastructure and man-made buildings, and for datasets with tightly-controlled baseline distribution.

TI  - Fine Monitoring of Wetlands at Provincial Large-Scale Using Object-Based Technique and Medium-Resolution Image
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to extreme similarity of wetland spectra, a significant uncertainty lies in the accuracy of the traditional pixel-based classification, which is a bottleneck in the extraction of wetland information. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) has brought opportunity for fine monitoring of wetland information. However, previous studies on monitoring wetlands have focused mainly on exploratory experiments involving high-resolution images for small areas. The application of OBIA in various medium-resolution images for large areas needs further verification. Here, Landsat and China's HJ-CCD images, a new OBIA mixed binary decision tree, tasseled cap transformation, and field samples were used to refine monitoring of changes in wetlands in Hubei Province. The results showed that while the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the extracted wetland information for 2000 were, respectively, 88.98% and 0.87, the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the detected change were 94.75% and 89.41. This indicated that OBIA performed well with medium-resolution HJ-CCD and Landsat images in monitoring changes in wetlands at provincial scale. The area of wetlands in Hubei increased by 171.03 km(2) during 2000-2010. Lakes and reservoirs/ponds increased the most in the province, with respective contributions to the total wetland area of 40.21% (108.97 km(2)) and 59.17% (160.37 km(2)). At administrative unit scale, Shiyan Prefecture (157.53 km(2)) and Fangxian County (317.33 km(2)) contributed the most to the increase of wetland area. The main reason for the increase in wetland area in Hubei in 2000-2010 was the implementation of major ecological projects during that decade.

TI  - Plant Biodiversity Knowledge Varies by Gender in Sustainable Amazonian Agricultural Systems Called Chacras
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chacras, which are Amazonian agricultural systems, are examples of traditional agricultural management that are sustainable. They are also characteristic of the identities of different ethnographic groups in tropical America. However, information regarding the botanical characterization of chacras is scant. In tropical rural communities, there is a gender bias hypothesis that makes women potential reservoirs of traditional chacras plant knowledge. We present an experimental study in order to demonstrate if this knowledge difference really exists and to plan accordingly. We performed workshops in an isolated Kichwa community from Amazonian Ecuador. We calculated the cultural signififcance index (CSI) for 97 local flora plants. Our results revealed statistically significant differences. They were coherent with the Kichwa worldview and the structure of their society. We concluded that gender perspective must be taken into account in biodiversity conservation programs, such as, for example, those to implement the resilient agricultural practices of tropical contexts promoted by The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SGD2).

TI  - <i>Ubuntu</i> in adult vocational education: Theoretical discussion and implications for teaching international students
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence now calls into question the efficacy and appropriateness of pedagogical practices that force international students to adapt to Eurocentric expectations when they enrol in tertiary education outside their home country and cultural environment. In response to calls for alternative perspectives, this article introduces the educational philosophy of ubuntu, an African worldview prioritising "humanness" and interconnectedness, and utilises it as a conceptual lens to examine the key tenets of engaging pedagogical practices in teaching international students. Based on a research project in Australia, the aim of which was to analyse teachers' adaptation of pedagogical practices in accommodating international students, the authors' findings point to three main ways in which the ubuntu principle can manifest in teaching international students: (1) humanness; (2) interconnectedness; and (3) situatedness. This article offers new insights into how an under-researched, non-Western philosophy - ubuntu - can serve to conceptualise international education practice. In doing so, it contributes to theory building and at the same time provokes consideration of an alternative pedagogical lens. In particular, this article draws on ubuntu as a critical framework to challenge conventional ways of viewing international students as the "other" in "our" educational system.

TI  - Impacts of Coastal Reclamation on Natural Wetlands in Large River Deltas in China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Little information is available on the impacts of coastal reclamation on wetland loss in large-river deltas at a regional scale. Using remote sensing data of coastal wetland and reclamation in four deltas in China from 1978 to 2014, we tracked their continuous area changes in four periods: 1978-1990, 1990-2000, 2000-2008, and 2008-2014. The areal relation between wetland loss and reclamation was quantified and used to identify coastal reclamation mode intensity coupled with another three indicators: reclamation rate, accretion rate and land-use intensity of coastal reclamation. The results showed that coastal reclamation driven by economic development reduced, or even reverse the original growth of delta which was determined by the offset between wetland acceleration rate and wetland loss rate. Generally, the area of reclamation showed a positive linear correlation with the area of wetland loss. The findings imply that human activities should control reclamation rate and intensity to alleviate total wetland loss and maintain wetland 'net gain'. Inappropriate coastal reclamation modes can magnify total wetland loss; therefore, coastal reclamation with a slow increment rate and low impervious surface percent is of great importance for sustainable development in future coastal management.

TI  - Minimum Spanning Tree Co-registration Approach for Time-Series Sentinel-1 TOPS Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image co-registration is one of the essential steps for interferometric SAR processing and the following multitemporal analysis. All acquisitions from time-series images with the Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) model should be co-registrated to a common reference geometry with an accuracy of approximately 0.001 pixels. Such a high accuracy can be achieved by correcting the residual azimuth mis-registration using the Enhanced Spectral Diversity (ESD) technique. However, the performance of the ESD depends on the coherence of image pairs, especially over fast decorrelation areas. To improve the coherence between acquisitions, we develop a joint co-registration procedure based on the minimum-spanning-tree algorithm and iterative reweighted least squares. In order to further improve the accuracy of the azimuth mis-registration over low-coherence scenes, we present a coherence estimator by combining two consecutive bursts of SLC samples to reduce both bias and variance. The proposed method is tested over two low-coherence scenes and compared to the network-based ESD approach. The results from both synthetic and real data demonstrated the advantages of our method.

TI  - Retrieving Total and Inorganic Suspended Sediments in Amazon Floodplain Lakes: A Multisensor Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing imagery are fundamental to increasing the knowledge about sediment dynamics in the middle-lower Amazon floodplains. Moreover, they can help to understand both how climate change and how land use and land cover changes impact the sediment exchange between the Amazon River and floodplain lakes in this important and complex ecosystem. This study investigates the suitability of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 spectral characteristics in retrieving total (TSS) and inorganic (TSI) suspended sediments on a set of Amazon floodplain lakes in the middle-lower Amazon basin using in situ Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-rs) measurements to simulate Landsat 8/OLI (Operational Land Imager) and Sentinel 2/MSI (Multispectral Instrument) bands and to calibrate/validate several TSS and TSI empirical algorithms. The calibration was based on the Monte Carlo Simulation carried out for the following datasets: (1) All-Dataset, consisting of all the data acquired during four field campaigns at five lakes spread over the lower Amazon floodplain (n = 94); (2) Campaign-Dataset including samples acquired in a specific hydrograph phase (season) in all lakes. As sample size varied from one season to the other, n varied from 18 to 31; (3) Lake-Dataset including samples acquired in all seasons at a given lake with n also varying from 17 to 67 for each lake. The calibrated models were, then, applied to OLI and MSI scenes acquired in August 2017. The performance of three atmospheric correction algorithms was also assessed for both OLI (6S, ACOLITE, and L8SR) and MSI (6S, ACOLITE, and Sen2Cor) images. The impact of glint correction on atmosphere-corrected image performance was assessed against in situ glint-corrected R-rs measurements. After glint correction, the L8SR and 6S atmospheric correction performed better with the OLI and MSI sensors, respectively (Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) = 16.68% and 14.38%) considering the entire set of bands. However, for a given single band, different methods have different performances. The validated TSI and TSS satellite estimates showed that both in situ TSI and TSS algorithms provided reliable estimates, having the best results for the green OLI band (561 nm) and MSI red-edge band (705 nm) (MAPE < 21%). Moreover, the findings indicate that the OLI and MSI models provided similar errors, which support the use of both sensors as a virtual constellation for the TSS and TSI estimate over an Amazon floodplain. These results demonstrate the applicability of the calibration/validation techniques developed for the empirical modeling of suspended sediments in lower Amazon floodplain lakes using medium-resolution sensors.

TI  - The Effects of Structural Elements on Groundwater of Wadi Yalamlam, Saudi Arabia Using Integration of Remote Sensing and Airborne Magnetic Survey
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to develop an integrated approach that utilized field geology, remote sensing and airborne magnetic data to identify the Quaternary aquifers impounded by dykes and explain the dykes/lineaments relationship and their effects on the storage and flow of the groundwater of Sadiyah sub-basin, lower part of Wadi Yalamlam basin, Western Arabian Shield, Saudi Arabia. Field visits supported by Landsat ETM+ratio images (5/7, 5/4 and 5/1) revealed the presence of three main dyke types that can be chronologically arranged from older to younger as: Sheared mafic and acidic dykes (D1); Damm dyke complex (D2); and Ghumayqah dykes (D3). Two dykes referred to the first type (D1) were traced with depth using airborne magnetic survey crosscutting the main course of Wadi Yalamlam around Sadiyah village at high angle. According to water table elevation measurements, the aquifer of lower Wadi Yalamlam area is divided into three parts namely I, II and III. The water table elevations decreased from 158 m in the first part (I) to reach 66 m in the third part (III) of the aquifer. This drop is attributed to the effect of dykes which act as natural barriers. The study area was affected by three major fault systems as confirmed by field study and total magnetic map. Two of these systems have NE-SW to ENE-WSW and N-S to NNW-SSE directions, whereas the third one represents the Najd fault system trends in NW-SE direction. The present study identifies two locations valid for agricultural expansion lie just to the north of Sheikh Said and Abu Helal Farms.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we analyze the effect of the representative spectral indices, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) on classification accuracies of Landsat-8 OLI image. After creating these spectral index images, we propose five methods to select the spectral index images as classification features together with Landsat-8 OLI bands from 1 to 7. From the experiments we observed that when the spectral index image of NDVI or NDWI is used as one of the classification features together with the Landsat-8 OLI bands from 1 to 7, we can obtain higher overall accuracy and kappa coefficient than the method using only Landsat-8 OLI 7 bands. In contrast, the classification method, which selected only NDBI as classification feature together with Landsat-8 OLI 7 bands did not show the improvement in classification accuracies.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kadavur basin is located in the Southern Granulite Terrain, central part of Tamil Nadu, India. The basin structure and presence of anorthositic formation in the Kadavur are interesting features for many researchers. Anorthosite is an important igneous rock, with limited coverage on earth crust, and commonly present on lunar surface. The origin and emplacement of anorthosite in terrestrial environment are always a matter of interest among geoscientist. In the present study, moderate-resolution IRS P6 LISS III multispectral satellite data are used to interpret the lithology, structure and morphology of the Kadavur basin. The processed satellite outputs show contrast signatures for various rock types such as anorthosites, gabbro, quartzite, gneiss, augen gneiss and charnockites. The lithological and structural details collected during the field investigation were used for mapping. The DEM-generated image shows detail information on structural features including crust line, dipping beds and fault zone in the Kadavur basin. The circular quartzite ridges formed as major structural hill systems, dipping vertically inward toward the center of the basin. The lineation indicates the axis of the fold structure standing on edge or plunging very steeply. The various theories proposed for the origin of structural basin and emplacement of gabbroic anorthositic plutonic body in the Kadavur basin are discussed.

TI  - Transferable Object-Based Framework Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Building Extraction
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated building extraction from single, very-high-resolution (VHR) images is still one of the most challenging tasks for urban planning, estimating population, understanding urban dynamics, and many other applications. The complexities of building objects have caused the images of buildings to be oversegmented into multiple segments in the object-based image analysis (OBIA) method. Selecting the appropriate segmentation scale parameter is a major challenge in OBIA that influences the discriminative features extraction, especially for building objects. Furthermore, transferability of OBIA method is another challenge. Presently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a well-understood tool for images scene classification. However, scene classification based on CNNs is still difficult due to the scale variation of the objects in VHR images. To meet these challenges, we propose a novel object-based deep CNN (OCNN) framework for VHR images. The datasets used for testing were Vaihingen (Germany) aerial images and a Tunis Worldview-2 (WV2) satellite imagery. Experimental results prove that our framework is extensible to different types of the image with the same sensor or another sensor (for example WV2) with once-fine-tuning. In addition, our framework extracts the different types of building with respect to size, color, material, spectral similarity to roads, and complex backgrounds. Quantitative evaluation at the object level demonstrated that the proposed framework could yield promising results (average precision 0.88, recall 0.92, quality 0.82, F-score 0.90, overall accuracy 0.95, and Kappa coefficient 0.90). Comparative experimental results indicate that our proposed OCNN significantly outperforms the traditional method for building extraction.

AB  - Soil erosion remains a major environmental threat confronting agriculture in South Africa. The main objective of the study was, therefore, to assess and map soil erosion vulnerability in the upper uMgeni catchment of South Africa. To achieve this objective, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to calculate the normalized weights of six soil erosion controlling factors i.e. slope (27.6%), vegetation cover (21.4%), soil type (15.5%), rainfall (19.1%), land cover (8.6%) and drainage network (7.9%). The results show that approximately 41% of the study area had a high risk of soil erosion. These findings, therefore, indicate that use of geospatial technologies yields spatial informative data required for detailed soil erosion risk assessment and remediation.

AB  - In this study, we evaluate the potential of the recently launched Sentinel-2 MSI multispectral sensor in mapping the spatial distribution of gullies in Okhombe valley, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The study further investigates possible environmental factors that contribute towards gully initiation and development. Analysis was done using a robust machine learning algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM). Additionally, possible environmental factors (i.e. slope steepness, percent vegetation cover, and Topographic Wetness Index, Stream Power Index, and hillslope profile and planform curvature) that could have an influence on the extent of the gullies were also derived. An overall land cover classification accuracy of 94% was achieved, while the overall classification accuracy for gullies was 77%. It was observed that bands located in the visible regions of the EM, red edge and SWIR could optimally discriminate gullies from other land cover types. Additionally, the findings of the study indicate no significant difference between the environmental variables across the different estimated gully volumes and indicate a weak correlation between the variables of R = 0.190526. Overall, the findings of the study demonstrate the importance of using the free and readily available multispectral Sentinel-2 MSI data in conjunction with robust non-parametric Support Vector Machine classifier in mapping the spatial distribution of gullies.

TI  - Geoinformatic assessment of urban heat island and land use/cover processes: a case study from Akure
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Akure is one of the cities undergoing rapid growth in Nigeria, which has resulted to remarkable Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. To examine the impact of this development in the city and its environs, this study derived the brightness temperatures and land use land cover (LULC) types using Landsat images between 1984 and 2016, of 190/55 path and row. Normalized Difference Built up Index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), were used as LULC indicators for sub-pixel analysis. The results of this study revealed a remarkable change in built-up area at the expense of vegetation (forest) and bare lands. The sub-pixels analysis between land use/cover indicators and temperature revealed a strong correlation between LULC and temperature in the area. Findings revealed a 4.63 degrees C temperature increase in vegetatedareas between 1984 and 2016; and an overall temperature values ranged from about 14 to 36 degrees C, which have been categorized into six classes (<20 degrees C, 20 degrees C to<24 degrees C, 24 degrees C to<28 degrees C, 28 degrees C to<32 degrees C, and >= 32 degrees C). The temperature increase over the years and the strong correlation between temperature and land use land cover suggests, that any small undesirable change in land use land cover in the future would lead to severe environmental condition.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Breast Cancer: Magnetic Tracer as the Only Localizing Agent
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe combined use of radioisotope and blue dye is the gold standard in sentinel lymph node (SLN) localization in early breast cancer. Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) has recently emerged as a non-inferior new tracer in sentinel lymph node mapping with fewer disadvantages. This study represents the first and the largest cohort of superparamagnetic iron oxide application in Asian population.MethodsRetrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was performed from August 2016 to December 2017. All patients with SLN localization by SPIO were included in this study.ResultsA total of 328 breast cancer patients with 333 SLNB procedures were included in this study. Median age was 54years (range 32-86). Median tumor size was 1.9cm (range 0.1-12cm).There were 138 breast-conserving surgeries and 195 mastectomies. All patients received injection of SPIO 1day prior to operation. A total of 329 successful sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedures were undertaken with 1514 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) identified. One hundred and fifty-three (10.1%) of the SLNs were positive for malignancy. There were 54 patients with macrometastases, 26 with micrometastases and 24 with isolated tumor cells. Sixty-seven patients underwent subsequent axillary dissection. Four patients failed sentinel lymph node identification with SPIO. The success rate of SPIO in sentinel lymph node localization was 98.8%.ConclusionSPIO represents a feasible alternative in sentinel lymph node mapping with comparably high nodal detection rate.

TI  - Extreme temperature and rainfall events in National Capital Region of India (New Delhi) in the recent decades and its possible impacts
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) promulgated a clear message that there have been many extreme weather and climate events observed globally since 1950, and these changes occurred mainly due to anthropogenic causes and emission of greenhouse gases. A computation study was carried out to assess the extreme temperature and rainfall events for the period 1984-2015 at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi by using ETCCDI indices through RClimDex software. The statistical significance of time series data and various calculated indices was done by linear regression as well as by Mann-Kendall test. Results indicated that annual mean maximum temperature decreased significantly at 0.019 degrees C/year and annual mean minimum temperature showed an increasing trend but without statistical significance. Alteration has happened in atmospheric properties, both physical and chemical over Delhi region during the period because of rapid urbanization and, increased concentration of aerosol. Fossil fuel/biomass waste burning, transportation of sand dust from Thar Desert, and reduction in incoming solar radiation have contributed both for fall in daytime temperature and rise in nighttime temperature. The changes in temperature would affect agricultural production through reduction in the rate of photosynthesis and excessive nocturnal respiration. Frequency and magnitude of coolest day (maximum temperature <15 degrees C) and night (minimum temperature <5 degrees C) have been rising at IARI, New Delhi. In the case of rainfall-based indices, annual rainfall (PRCPTOT), consecutive wet days (CWD), and number of days with rainfall >= 20mm (R20) showed significant increasing tendency. Increasing trend in simple daily intensity index (SDII), rainy days (R2.5), and declining trend of consecutive dry days (CDD) indicates better distribution of rainfall. Nevertheless, increasing tendency in RX1day, RX5day, and R99p indicates possibilities of heavy rainfall events although the trend has been found insignificant.

TI  - Optimising rice mapping in cloud-prone environments by combining quad-source optical with Sentinel-1A microwave satellite imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical satellite images are prone to cloud contamination in the tropics and subtropics especially during the monsoon season which is contemporaneous with rice cultivation. Producing rice field maps in such areas using a single optical satellite source is therefore very challenging. To obtain an adequate number of usable optical images that captures the seasonal profile of rice fields for their discrimination, this study explored an operational approach to combining quad-source optical satellite data that include Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A, China's environment and disaster monitoring and forecasting satellite constellation (HJ-1 A and B), and Gaofen-1 over a test site located in southeast China at two rice growing seasons (2016 and 2017). To minimise inter-sensor differences, a spectral index (SI) dataset containing cross-calibrated Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) images from all optical sensors and Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI) images from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, was derived. As more accurate rice maps have been obtained with the synergistic use of optical and microwave data, the aforementioned datasets were combined with the vertical transmitted and horizontal received (VH) and vertical transmitted and vertical received (VV) polarisation images of Sentinel-1A. The resultant optical, microwave, and combinations of optical and microwave data were used as inputs to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms available in ENVI 5.3 and ENMAP Box 2.0, respectively to discriminate rice fields from other land-cover types. Results showed that Sentinel-1A data produced higher mapping accuracies than the quad-source optical datasets. This is attributed to the higher number of Sentinel-1A images at the early stages of rice growth (vegetative phase), a period where changes in rice satellite signals are most abrupt and therefore most diagnostic for discriminating the rice crop from other land-cover types. Additionally, combinations of optical and microwave data produced higher overall accuracies than when used separately, and the highest overall accuracies for both years were achieved with the application of RF on a combination of VH, VV and SI (VHVVSI), yielding 98.43% in 2016 and 96.73% in 2017. Moreover, combining VH with SI (VHSI) produced overall mapping accuracies that are more equivalent to the above (98.40% in 2016 and 96.53% in 2017) than with the combination of VV and SI (VVSI) which yielded 97.22% in 2016 and 93.92% in 2017. This indicates that VH is not only more complementary to optical satellite imagery in rice discrimination, but its combination with SI alone can produce rice distribution maps of the highest possible accuracies in cloud-prone environments.

TI  - Partitioning the ocean using dense time series of Earth Observation data. Regions and natural boundaries in the Western Iberian Peninsula
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biogeographic partitioning systems provide an important framework under which ocean management practices can be designed and implemented.Sea Surface Temperature (SST) provides important insights into the features and processes governing biogeography and the natural boundaries that separate regions (fronts). In this paper, a new methodology is suggested to segment the ocean at a subset of an Eastern Boundary Current system (Western Iberian Peninsula).To this end, a dense time series of daily MODIS data (Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a concentration, 2003-2014) was analyzed using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The resulting dissimilarity matrix was then clustered using UPGMA to generate a set of dynamic regions. To determine whether the boundaries separating regions coincided with areas of maximum frontal activity, a matching time series was produced for the study area.The methodology successfully delivered a set of nested regions, explained by known oceanographic features and separated by natural boundaries collocated with frontal activity maxima (ANOVA, p < 0.01). The frontal activity, which was also found to be spatially organized (Moran's I > 0.82 and z-score > 6.95, for a p < 0.01) was thus correlated with the dissimilarity patterns of SST. Together, they offer a new perspective into the biogeographic constraints influencing an important ecosystem.SST-based regions were more informative (k= 4) but both the Chlorophyll-a and the multivariate (SST and Chlorophyll-a) alternatives reproduced the coastal/oceanic dichotomy of established systems in a dynamic way. The method was also applied to yearly subsets, which generally matched the regions delineated with the full time series while depicting inter-annual variability.The DTW and the frontal activity maps contributed to the definition of a scalable and ecologically-meaningful system, which can be adopted for the monitoring of marine areas using different (annual to decadal) time scales and easily accessible datasets.

TI  - Gap Filling of High-Resolution Soil Moisture for SMAP/Sentinel-1: A Two-Layer Machine Learning-Based Framework
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As the most recent 3-km soil moisture product from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, the SMAP/Sentinel-1 L2_SM_SP product has a unique capability to provide global-scale 3-km soil moisture estimates through the fusion of radar and radiometer microwave observations. The spatial and temporal availability of this high-resolution soil moisture product depends on concurrent radar and radiometer observations which is significantly restricted by the narrow swath and low revisit schedule of the Sentinel-1 radars. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel two-layer machine learning-based framework which predicts the brightness temperature and subsequently the soil moisture at gap areas. The proposed method is able to gap-fill soil moisture satisfactorily at areas where the radiometer observations are available while the radar observations are missing. We find that incorporating historical radar backscatter measurements (30-day average) into the machine learning framework boosts its predictive performance. The effectiveness of the two-layer framework is validated against regional holdout SMAP/Sentinel-1 3-km soil moisture estimates at four study areas with distinct climate regimes. Results indicate that our proposed method is able to reconstruct 3-km soil moisture at gap areas with high Pearson correlation coefficient (47%/35%/20%/80% improvement of mean R, at Arizona/Oklahoma/Iowa/Arkansas) and low unbiased Root Mean Square Error (20%/10%/7%/26% improvement of mean unbiased root mean square error) when compared to the SMAP 33-km soil moisture product. Additional validations against airborne data and in situ data from soil moisture networks are also satisfactory.

TI  - Nonparametric identification and estimation of current status data in the presence of death
T2  - STATISTICA NEERLANDICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a nonparametric study of current status data in the presence of death. Such data arise from biomedical investigations in which patients are examined for the onset of a certain disease, for example, tumor progression, but may die before the examination. A key difference between such studies on human subjects and the survival-sacrifice model in animal carcinogenicity experiments is that, due to ethical and perhaps technical reasons, deceased human subjects are not examined, so that the information on their disease status is lost. We show that, for current status data with death, only the overall and disease-free survival functions can be identified, whereas the cumulative incidence of the disease is not identifiable. We describe a fast and stable algorithm to estimate the disease-free survival function by maximizing a pseudo-likelihood with plug-in estimates for the overall survival rates. It is then proved that the global rate of convergence for the nonparametric maximum pseudo-likelihood estimator is equal to O-p(n(-1/3)) or the convergence rate of the estimated overall survival function, whichever is slower. Simulation studies show that the nonparametric maximum pseudo-likelihood estimators are fairly accurate in small- to medium-sized samples. Real data from breast cancer studies are analyzed as an illustration.

TI  - Integration of Machine Learning and Open Access Geospatial Data for Land Cover Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In-time and accurate monitoring of land cover and land use are essential tools for countries to achieve sustainable food production. However, many developing countries are struggling to efficiently monitor land resources due to the lack of financial support and limited access to adequate technology. This study aims at offering a solution to fill in such a gap in developing countries, by developing a land cover solution that is free of costs. A fully automated framework for land cover mapping was developed using 10-m resolution open access satellite images and machine learning (ML) techniques for the African country of Lesotho. Sentinel-2 satellite images were accessed through Google Earth Engine (GEE) for initial processing and feature extraction at a national level. Also, Food and Agriculture Organization's land cover of Lesotho (FAO LCL) data were used to train a support vector machine (SVM) and bagged trees (BT) classifiers. SVM successfully classified urban and agricultural lands with 62 and 67% accuracy, respectively. Also, BT could classify the two categories with 81 and 65% accuracy, correspondingly. The trained models could provide precise LC maps in minutes or hours. they can also be utilized as a viable solution for developing countries as an alternative to traditional geographic information system (GIS) methods, which are often labor intensive, require acquisition of very high-resolution commercial satellite imagery, time consuming and call for high budgets.

TI  - Monitoring of the National Oil and Wheat Flour Fortification Program in Cameroon Using a Program Impact Pathway Approach
T2  - CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Since 2011 Cameroon has mandated the fortification of refined vegetable oil with vitamin A and wheat flour with iron, zinc, folic acid, and vitamin B-12. In 2012, measured fortification levels for flour, and particularly oil, were below target.Objectives: We assessed Cameroon's food fortification program using a program impact pathway (PIP) to identify barriers to optimal performance.Methods: We developed a PIP through literature review and key informant interviews. We conducted interviews at domestic factories for refined vegetable oil (n = 9) and wheat flour (n = 10). In 12 sentinel sites distributed nationally, we assessed availability and storage conditions of fortified foods in markets and frequency of consumption of fortified foods among women and children (n = 613 households). Food samples were collected from factories, markets, and households for measurement of micronutrient content.Results: Two-thirds of factories presented quality certificates for recent premix purchases. All factories had in-house capacity for micronutrient analysis, but most used qualitative methods. Industries cited premix import taxes and access to external laboratories as constraints. Mean vitamin A levels were 141% (95% CI: 116%, 167%), 75% (95% CI: 62%, 89%), and 75% (95% CI: 60%, 90%) of target in individual samples from factories, markets, and households, respectively. Most industry flour samples appeared to be fortified, but micronutrient levels were low. Among composite flour samples from markets and households, the mean iron and zinc content was 25 mg/kg and 43 mg/kg, respectively, similar to 45% of target levels; folic acid (36%) and vitamin B-12 (29%) levels were also low. In the previous week, the majority of respondents had consumed "fortifiable" oil (63% women and 52% children) and wheat flour (82% women and 86% children).Conclusions: In Cameroon, oil fortification program performance appears to have improved since 2012, but fortification levels remain below target, particularly for wheat flour. Consistent regulatory monitoring and program support, possibly through premix procurement and micronutrient analysis, are needed.

TI  - First laboratory evaluation of <i>Gryon gonikopalense</i> (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae), as potential biological control agent of <i>Bagrada hilaris</i> (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae)
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The pentatomid bug Bagrada hilaris is a severe invasive alien pest of Brassicaceae crops, which first appeared in California in 2008 and is expanding to several southern U.S. states and South America. To answer the demand of growers for sustainable management methods, a biological control program started in 2015. The egg parasitoid Gryon gonikopalense Sharma was collected in Pakistan, and after morphological identification here described, is being evaluated as a candidate for classical biological control against B. hilaris. Basic life history studies were performed in climatic chambers (22 +/- 0.5 degrees C, RH 50 +/- 5%, L/D 12:12). On average, Gryon gonikopalense developed in 25.1 +/- 1.4 (mean +/- sd) days and live 66.4 +/- 30.7 days. Allowing females to oviposit reduced their lifespan by 52%, and food deprivation reduced it by 87%. During their life, females produced 59.2 +/- 22.3 offspring on average with a maximum fecundity during the first week of their life. Mean progeny sex ratio was 46.3% female. Live host eggs from 1 to 4 days old were suitable for parasitoid oviposition, but eggs stored at - 80 degrees C were not. Hence, the parasitoid could attack bagrada eggs for most of their development in the field but storage of bagrada eggs at very low temperature for later use in rearing or as sentinel eggs in the field is not recommended. These data provide a baseline for designing host specificity tests to help determine whether G. gonikopalense is suitable to use as a biocontrol agent of Bagrada hilaris.

TI  - Dual-Frequency Reflectarray Cell to Provide Opposite Phase Shift in Dual Circular Polarization With Application in Multibeam Satellite Antennas
T2  - IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new reflectarray cell is proposed to simultaneously provide opposite phase shifts between orthogonal circular polarizations at two frequencies (19.7 and 29.5 GHz) by applying a variable rotation technique independently at each frequency. The reflectarray cell, which consists of two dielectric layers with two levels of printed elements (dipoles and arcs), has been characterized for both circular and linear polarizations at each frequency. Apart from the implementation of the variable rotation technique at each frequency, the reflectarray cell provides an additional phase adjustment at the higher frequency, which can be used to shape the beam. This concept applied to multiple spot satellites in Ka-band will allow to produce two adjacent beams per feed in orthogonal circular polarizations at transmission and reception frequency bands.

T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote forests of the Darien region in eastern Panama are among the last remnants of relatively undisturbed forest habitat in the Central American isthmus. Despite decades of efforts by the government, nongovernmental organizations, and civil society, including Indigenous peoples, to protect the region's natural heritage, it remains under significant threat due to widespread illegal logging. Now, the Panamanian government is considering the mechanism, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), as another option to limit forest loss. Central to the proper functioning of REDD+ is the need to reduce uncertainties in estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB). These estimates are used to establish realistic reference levels against which additional contributions to reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the loss and degradation of forests can be financially compensated. Also, highly desirable to REDD+ is the achievement of biodiversity cobenefits. REDD+ investments will likely be directed primarily to areas where the potential to simultaneously mitigate climate change and conserve biodiversity is highest. Here, we present the results of a field-based forest carbon inventorying method tested in Darien's mature forests with the participation of Embera and Wounaan Indigenous peoples. We also explore whether variations in field-based estimates of AGB across mature forests, in both undisturbed and disturbed areas, are detectable through free and readily-available remote sensing data sources. Furthermore, we examine and compare AGB and tree species richness in Darien with other well-studied forest sites across the tropics. Our findings reveal that Darien's forests play a crucial role globally and regionally in storing carbon and housing biodiversity, and support the imperative need to protect these forests in a culturally appropriate manner with the region's Indigenous peoples.

AB  - This study was intended to detect land use/land cover changes over 44 years in the Bilate Alaba Subwatersed, Southern Ethiopia. Four Landsat images (1972, 1986, 2008 and 2017) were used to as inputs to produce four land cover maps of the sub watershed; ERDAS imagine and ArcGIS software were utilized to accomplish the analysis. In the period between 1972 to1986 cultivated and settlement showed an incremental change by 280.91 and 71.43 ha respectively, while bare land and shrub & grass land decreased by 225.26 and 140.25 ha respectively. In the period 1986 to 2008 cultivated and bare land increased by 105.13 and 52.90 ha while forest and shrub & grass land decreased by 103.41 and 50.84 ha respectively. Between 2008 and 2017 settlement and bare land increased by 83.20 and 65.54 ha respectively while shrub & grass land and forest land decreased by 112.59 and 46.16 ha respectively. The results showed that cultivated land and settlement land expanded by 67.38% and 532% respectively whereas forest land, shrub land &grass land declined by 66.35%, 18.36% respectively over the analysis period (1972-2017). There should be appropriate rural land use/management policy by identifying proper land for specific purpose so that degraded lands would not put under cultivation. Copyright (C) 2019 Mathewos et al.

TI  - Impact of Spatial Resolution of Digital Elevation Model on Landslide Susceptibility Mapping: A Case Study in Kullu Valley, Himalayas
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are one of the most damaging geological hazards in mountainous regions such as the Himalayas. The Himalayan region is, tectonically, the most active region in the world that is highly vulnerable to landslides and associated hazards. Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is a useful tool for understanding the probability of the spatial distribution of future landslide regions. In this research, the landslide inventory datasets were collected during the field study of the Kullu valley in July 2018, and 149 landslide locations were collected as global positioning system (GPS) points. The present study evaluates the LSM using three different spatial resolution of the digital elevation model (DEM) derived from three different sources. The data-driven traditional frequency ratio (FR) model was used for this study. The FR model was used for this research to assess the impact of the different spatial resolution of DEMs on the LSM. DEM data was derived from Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) ALOS-PALSAR for 12.5 m, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global for 30 m, and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) for 90 m. As an input, we used eight landslide conditioning factors based on the study area and topographic features of the Kullu valley in the Himalayas. The ASTER-Global 30m DEM showed higher accuracy of 0.910 compared to 0.839 for 12.5 m and 0.824 for 90 m DEM resolution. This study shows that that 30 m resolution is better suited for LSM for the Kullu valley region in the Himalayas. The LSM can be used for mitigation and future planning for spatial planners and developmental authorities in the region.

TI  - Mapping land use and dynamics of vegetation cover in Southeastern Arabia using remote sensing: the study case of Wilayat Nizwa (Oman) from 1987 to 2016

AB  - The region of Wilayat Nizwa, in Northern Oman, is characterized by very high temperature and rare irregular rainfall. Local farmers relay on irrigation to maintain their lands productive. They get water by means of ancestral water acquisition systems called aflaj (plural of falaj). This study focalizes on the physical space of Wilayat Nizwa. Its main goal is to read and analyze the landscape of this area using a method based on multispectral electromagnetic spatial remote sensing. The processing of data from satellites Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS relative to January 1987, October 2000, February 2009, and January 2016 allowed us to extract information on the landscape components of Nizwa and its surroundings, to generate a land use map, and to monitor the dynamics of the vegetation cover in Wilayat Niwza from 1987 to 2016. The study zone is mainly a mountainous region, rugged with many gullies and characterized by an important geological diversity and large sedimentary valleys and riverbeds. The non-supervised classification reveals six different classes of which the clay/sandy sedimentary soils and the very clayey rocky/gypsum blocs are the most important ones. The information extracted from the Perpendicular Vegetation Index 1 (PVI1) show that the area of irrigated vegetation remained relatively stable, with a minor increase, which equals to 805.91ha, in 2009, compared with the spontaneous one in which the rise is 17,588.85ha. Combined with socioeconomical and climatic parameters, these results would be good indicators to assess the functioning of aflaj and to anticipate the evolution of the local landscape.

TI  - Biomass heat storage dampens diurnal temperature variations in forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observational evidence suggests that compared to non-forested areas, forests have a cooling effect on daytime land surface temperature (LST) and a warming effect on nighttime LST in many regions of the world, thus implying that forests dampen the diurnal temperature range. This feature is not captured by current climate models. Using the Community Land Model 5.0 (CLM5.0), we show that this diurnal behavior can be captured when accounting for biomass heat storage (BHS). The nighttime release of energy absorbed by the vegetation biomass during the day increases both nighttime LST and ambient air temperature in forested regions by more than 1 K. The daytime cooling is weaker than the nighttime warming effect, because the energy uptake by the biomass is compensated by a reduction in the turbulent heat fluxes during day. This diurnal asymmetry of the temperature response to BHS leads to a warming of daily mean temperatures, which is amplified during boreal summer warm extremes. Compared to MODIS, CLM5.0 overestimates the diurnal LST range over forested areas. The inclusion of BHS reduces this bias due to its dampening effect on diurnal LST variations. Further, BHS attenuates the negative bias in the nighttime LST difference of forest minus grassland and cropland, when compared to MODIS observations. These results indicate that it is essential to consider BHS when examining the influence of forests on diurnal temperature variations. BHS should thus be included in land surface models used to assess the climatic consequences of land use changes such as deforestation or afforestation.

T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is endemic to South Africa, where vaccine use is negligible. We describe the epidemiology of IMD in South Africa.Methods. IMD cases were identified through a national, laboratory-based surveillance program, GERMS-SA, from 2003-2016. Clinical data on outcomes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) statuses were available from 26 sentinel hospital sites. We conducted space-time analyses to detect clusters of serogroup-specific IMD cases.Results. Over 14 years, 5249 IMD cases were identified. The incidence was 0.97 cases per 100 000 persons in 2003, peaked at 1.4 cases per 100 000 persons in 2006, and declined to 0.23 cases per 100 000 persons in 2016. Serogroups were confirmed in 3917 (75%) cases: serogroup A was present in 4.7% of cases, B in 23.3%, C in 9.4%; W in 49.5%; Y in 12.3%, X in 0.3%; Z in 0.1% and 0.4% of cases were non-groupable. We identified 8 serogroup-specific, geo-temporal clusters of disease. Isolate susceptibility was 100% to ceftriaxone, 95% to penicillin, and 99.9% to ciprofloxacin. The in-hospital case-fatality rate was 17% (247/1479). Of those tested, 36% (337/947) of IMD cases were HIV-coinfected. The IMD incidence in HIV-infected persons was higher for all age categories, with an age-adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR) of 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-2.8; P < .001) from 2012-2016. No patients reported previous meningococcal vaccine exposure. Patients with serogroup W were 3 times more likely to present with severe disease than those with serogroup B (aRRR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1-6.3); HIV coinfection was twice as common with W and Y diseases (aRRR W = 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9; aRRR Y = 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.4).Conclusions. In the absence of significant vaccine use, IMD in South Africa decreased by 76% from 2003-2016. HIV was associated with an increased risk of IMD, especially for serogroup W and Y diseases.

TI  - <i>Campylobacter</i> species prevalence, characterisation of antimicrobial resistance and analysis of whole-genome sequence of isolates from livestock and humans, Latvia, 2008 to 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Campylobacter is the main cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. The main transmission route is through consumption of food contaminated with Campylobacter species or contact with infected animals. In Latvia, the prevalence of campylobacteriosis is reported to be low (4.6 cases per 100,000 population in 2016). Aim: To determine prevalence, species spectrum and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of Campylobacter spp. in Latvia, using data from various livestock and human clinical samples. Methods: We analysed data of Campyloba cter microbiological monitoring and AMR (2008 and 2014-16) in Latvia. Data from broilers, poultry, pigs, calves and humans were used to determine prevalence of Campylobacter. Additionally, 45 different origin isolates (22 human) were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform; for each isolate core genome multilocus sequence typing was used and relevant antimicrobial resistance mechanisms were identified. Results: Overall, Campylobacter prevalence in was 83.3% in pigs, 50.2% in broilers, 16.1% in calves and 5.3% in humans; C. jejuni was the predominant species in all sources except pigs where C. coli was main species. High level of resistance in Campylobacter were observed against fluoroquinolones, tetracycline and streptomycin, in most of sequenced isolates genetic determinants of relevant AMR profiles were identified. Conclusions: In Latvia, prevalence of Campylobacter in livestock is high, especially in pigs and broilers; prevalence in poultry and humans were lower than in other European countries. AMR analysis reveals increase of streptomycin and tetracycline resistant broiler origin C. jejuni strains. WGS demonstrates a high compliance between resistance phenotype and genotype for quinolones and tetracyclines.

TI  - The Phenomenon (sic) ('power') as a Part of Russian Phraseosemantic Worldview
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SLAWISTIK
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the complex analysis on the phenomenon (sic) ('power') as a part of the Russian phraseological worldview. The most important social conscience spheres of the phenomenon (sic) are defined: politics, economics, sociology, psychology and philosophy. Accordingly, the five most significant micro-concepts, i.e. the particular cognitive fields ('power in politics', 'power in economics', 'power in society', 'power in psychology', 'power in philosophy') as well as macroconcept (the common cognitive field) (sic) are described; phraseological units objectifying this phenomenon are singled out; the phraseosemantic field (sic) is built on the basis of meaningfulness of certain semantic features for the phenomenon characterization and for the common understanding of the concept (sic) in the Russian phraseology; the integral and differentiating features of the cognitive and phraseosemantic fields are revealed.The research is based on both linguistic data and on material from politics, economics, sociology, psychology, philosophy and cultural studies. Thus, the issues analyzed in the article are viewed in terms of the contemporary integral paradigm of cross-disciplinary scientific knowledge. As a result, the syncretic essence of the concept (sic) that includes two opposite and incompatible principles (sic) ('supremacy') and (sic) ('submission') are brought out. The national and cultural specificity of the Russian phraseosemantic worldview and the peculiarities of the Russian linguistic society in the aspect of the phenomenon (sic) ('power') are established.

TI  - Assessment of vegetation dynamics using remote sensing and GIS: A case of Bosomtwe Range Forest Reserve, Ghana
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Changing conditions owing to increasing forest fragmentation make land cover and change detection analysis an extremely important consideration for sustainable forest management. This study applied supervised classification using maximum-likelihood algorithm in Quantum GIS to detect land use land cover changes in the Bosomtwe Range Forest Reserve, Ghana from 1991, 2002 and 2017 using Landsat 4 - TM, Landsat 7 - ETM and Sentinel-2 satellite imageries respectively. Based on the results of the study, it is concluded that land use/cover of Bosomtwe Range Forest Reserve have undergone remarkable changes for over the period of 26 years. The current status of forest cover is estimated to be 2995.45 +/- 401.86 ha and 2090.03 +/- 412.78 ha of closed and opened forest canopy respectively. Conversely, built-up areas (1531.68 +/- 487.13 ha) remains virtually high (20%) though it shows a decrease in comparison to the same area in 2002. The land use land cover change map clearly identified probable areas of forest depletion especially in the north eastern and western portions of the reserve. It is recommended that potential spatial drivers of change should be identified to generate suitable image for change modelling of the reserve, coupled with earmarking of degraded areas for reforestation projects to improve upon the forest cover.

TI  - Internal Mammary Lymph Node Visualization as a Sentinel Sonographic Sign of Tuberculous Pleurisy
T2  - ULTRASCHALL IN DER MEDIZIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Tuberculous pleurisy is one of the primary sites of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, but clinicians currently lack the diagnostic tools necessary for early recognition in the absence of typical signs and symptoms. With this study, we aimed to test the association between internal mammary adenopathies and tuberculous pleurisy (TP).Methods 60 patients with a post-thoracoscopic histological diagnosis of granulomatosis or acute infective pleurisy were retrospectively enrolled. All of them had chest sonography and/or CT scan data available. At least two expert chest sonography physicians re-analyzed the sonography images to look for any internal mammary adenopathy. Such findings were compared to the CT data.Results Chest sonography showed internal mammary adenopathy ipsilateral to the pleural effusion in 97 % of 29 patients who had a diagnosis of TP, and in 13 % of those with an acute infective pleurisy (p < 0.001). Receiver operator characteristic analysis revealed 97 % sensitivity and 87 % specificity for this technique in predicting TP (area under curve 0.92 +/- 0.04, p < 0.001). CT detection power and node measures were significantly similar (p < 0.001).Conclusion Sonographic internal mammary node visualization ipsilateral to the pleural effusion may become a sentinel sign for TP, contributing to early diagnosis or orienting the diagnostic management towards invasive procedures in uncertain cases.

TI  - On-Orbit Star-Based Calibration and Modulation Transfer Function Measurements for PLEIADES High-Resolution Optical Sensors
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate on-orbit radiometric calibration of optical sensors has become a challenge for space agencies who combine their efforts through international working groups such as CEOS/WGCV or WMO/GSICS with the objective of ensuring the consistency of space measurements and to reach the absolute accuracy required by increasingly demanding scientific requirements. Different targets are generally used for calibration, depending on the specific features of the sensor or spacecraft: from on-board calibration systems to ground targets, they can all profitably be characterized and modeled. Thanks to their agility, some satellites have the capability to view extra-terrestrial targets such as stars. Although the spectral irradiance of some stars is known with very high accuracy, very little work has been done on their use as an absolute reference for the calibration of remote sensors. The reason is their low irradiance, requiring a small instantaneous field of view to observe them. Moreover, their use as a calibration reference also requires a good knowledge of the instrument's modulation transfer function (MTF). The MTF which drives the spatial quality is a major parameter for high-resolution (HR) optical remote sensors as it indicates how spatial frequencies are transmitted and weakened by the imaging system. On the other hand, stars provide ideal targets for MTF measurement as they can be assimilated to point sources. This paper proposes a method for simultaneously computing the absolute radiometric calibration of PLEIADES' HR optical sensors and their MTF, using stars. The radiometric model is solved in Fourier space for point sources whose irradiance can be easily controlled. Results are provided for both PLEIADES satellites and compared to the official radiometric calibration and MTF. The quality of the results and the main error contributors are discussed.

TI  - Interpolation of the Mean Anomalies for Cloud Filling in Land Surface Temperature and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When monitoring time series of remote sensing data, it is advisable to fill gaps, i.e., missing or distorted data, caused by atmospheric effects or technical failures. In this paper, a new method for filling these gaps called interpolation of the mean anomalies (IMA) is proposed and compared with some competitors. The method consists of: 1) defining a neighborhood for the target image from previous and subsequent images across previous and subsequent years; 2) computing the mean target image of the neighborhood; 3) estimating the anomalies in the target image by subtracting the mean image from the target image; 4) filtering the anomalies; 5) averaging the anomalies over a predefined window; 6) interpolating the averaged anomalies; and 7) adding the interpolated anomalies to the mean image. To assess the performance of the IMA method, both a real example and a simulation study are conducted with a time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) TERRA and MODIS AQUA images captured over the region of Navarre (Spain) from 2011 to 2013. We analyze the land surface temperature (LST) day and night, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In the simulation study, seven sizes of artificial clouds are randomly introduced to each image in the studied time series. The square root of the mean-squared prediction error (RMSE) between the original and the filled data is chosen as an indicator of the goodness of fit. The results show that the IMA method outperforms Timesat, Hants, and Gapfill (GF) in filling small, moderate, and big cloud gaps in both the day and night LST and NDVI data, reaching RMSE reductions of up to 23%.

TI  - An overview of ABoVE airborne campaign data acquisitions and science opportunities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The 2017 Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment Airborne Campaign (AAC) was one of the largest, most complex airborne science experiments conducted by NASA's Earth Science Division. Between April and November, the AAC involved ten aircraft in more than 200 science flights that surveyed over 4 million km(2) in Alaska and northwestern Canada. Many flights were coordinated with same-day ground-based measurements to link process-level studies with geospatial data products derived from satellite sensors. The AAC collected data spanning the critical intermediate space and time scales that are essential for a comprehensive understanding of scaling across the ABoVE Study Domain and ultimately extrapolation to the pan-Arctic using satellite data and ecosystem models. The AAC provided unique opportunities to validate satellite and airborne remote sensing data and data products for northern high latitude ecosystems. The science strategy coupled domain-wide sampling with L-band and P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), imaging spectroscopy, full waveform LIDAR, atmospheric trace gases (including carbon dioxide and methane), as well as focused studies using Ka-band SAR and solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence. Targets of interest included field sites operated by the ABoVE Science Team as well as the intensive and/or long-term sites operated by US and Canadian partners.

TI  - Flood susceptibility modeling and hazard perception in Rwanda
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is a deleterious phenomenon that induces detrimental impacts on humans, properties and environment. As a result, the knowledge of susceptible places and hazard perception is increasingly pertinent. This study mainly aims at identifying areas susceptible to flood through the application of logistic regression model using remote sensing data (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS). A flood inventory was generated using 153 historical flood locations and a total of 10 predicting factors (elevation, slope, aspect, profile curvature, distance from rivers, distance from roads, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI), the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) and rainfall) were utilized. Flood points were randomly subdivided into training (75%) for model building and testing (25%) points for validation through the Area Under Curve (AUC) approach. The results indicated that NDVI and rainfall are the most influencing variables for estimating flood risk as they showed a high positive relationship with flood occurrence in the study area. Testing datasets disclosed 79.8% of prediction rate using the AUC. Moreover, the results have been linked with community perception on flood and the outcome revealed that the government is perceived as responsible for all flood mitigation measures instead of being a shared responsibility. This perception may contribute to the increase in susceptibility. The results of this study will be essential for upcoming development projects from different organizations operating in many developing countries and would assist as a baseline for flood risk reduction and management especially for Rwanda.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Influenza immunisation is recommended for elderly people each season. The influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) varies annually due to influenza viruses evolving and the vaccine composition. Aim: To estimate, in inpatients >= 60 years old, the 2017/18 trivalent IVE, overall, by vaccine type and by strain. The impact of vaccination in any of the two previous seasons (2016/17 and 2015/16) on current (2017/18) IVE was also explored. Methods: This was a multicentre prospective observational study within the Valencia Hospital Surveillance Network for the Study of Influenza and Respiratory Viruses Disease (VAHNSI, Spain). The test-negative design was applied taking laboratory-confirmed influenza as outcome and vaccination status as main exposure. Information about potential confounders was obtained from clinical registries and/or by interviewing patients; vaccine information was only ascertained by registries. Results: Overall, 2017/18 IVE was 9.9% (95% CI: -15.5 to 29.6%), and specifically, 48.3% (95% CI: 13.5% to 69.1%), -29.9% (95% CI: -79.1% to 5.8%) and 25.7% (95% CI: -8.8% to 49.3%) against A(H1N1) pdm09, A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata lineage, respectively. For the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines, overall IVE was 10.0% (95% CI: -24.4% to 34.9%) and 7.8% (95% CI: -23.1% to 31.0%) respectively. Prior vaccination significantly protected against influenza B/Yamagata lineage (IVE: 50.2%; 95% CI: 2.3% to 74.6%) in patients not vaccinated in the current season. For those repeatedly vaccinated against influenza A(H1N1) pdm09, IVE was 46.4% (95% CI: 6.8% to 69.2%). Conclusion: Our data revealed low vaccine effectiveness against influenza in hospitalised patients >= 60 years old in 2017/18. Prior vaccination protected against influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 and B/Yamagata-lineage.

TI  - Long-term health outcomes in survivors after chronic subdural haematoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH) is the most common neurosurgical presentation among the elderly. Although initially considered a non-threatening event, recent studies have highlighted poor long-term survival post-CSDH. Currently, there is a paucity of information regarding long-term health outcome in survivors after CSDH post-intervention. The objective of this research was to assess long-term functional, cognitive, and mental health outcome after CSDH. CSDH patients were administered a telephone-based assessment including a Demographic Questionnaire, Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), Cognitive Telephone Screening Instrument (COGTEL), Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF), and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Results were obtained in n = 51 patients. CSDH patients were assessed at 5.5 + 2.1 years after CSDH and results were compared to age/gender matched controls (n = 52). Comorbidities were significantly greater in CSDH patients at the time of assessment (chi(2) = 35.47, P < .01). CSDH patients demonstrated a significant reduction in functional independence (FAQ P < .001) and Verbal Short-Term Memory (COGTEL, P = .048). Potential negative trends were observed for Verbal Long-Term Memory (P = .06) and Inductive Reasoning (P = .07). CSDH patients also demonstrated significantly poorer emotional, psychological and social well-being (MHC-SF: Emotional, P = .003; Psychological, P = .001; and Social, P < .001), with increased depressive symptomatology (GDS, P <.001). In addition to known decreased long-term survival, CSDH survivors demonstrated poorer long-term functional, cognitive and mental health outcomes than controls. Pre-existent comorbidities were also more prevalent. CSDH is therefore a sentinel health event: survivors represent a vulnerable group who require long-term, comprehensive, person-centred care. This is the first study of long term CSDH health outcomes. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Inter-Annual Variability and Trends of Sea Level and Sea Surface Temperature in the Mediterranean Sea over the Last 25 Years
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level and sea surface temperature inter-annual variability and trends in the Mediterranean Sea were investigated during the period 1993-2017. These were carried out using gridded absolute dynamic topography from satellite altimetry, tide gauge (TG) time series from 25 stations and gridded sea surface temperature (SST) from advanced very-high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data. The coastal TG data were used to verify the satellite derived sea level. Moreover, the contributions of atmospheric pressure and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) to sea level changes were also examined. The results revealed that the Mediterranean Sea exhibits inter-annual spatiotemporal coherent variability in both sea level and SST. The spatial variability in sea level is more significant over the Adriatic and Aegean Seas, most of the Levantine basin, and along the Tunisian shelf. Marked spatial variability in SST occurs over the central part of the Mediterranean Sea with maximum amplitude in the Tyrrhenian Sea. The highest temporal variability of sea level and SST was found in 2010 and 2003, respectively. The inter-annual variability of sea level and SST accounts for about 32% and 3% of the total variance of sea level and SST, respectively. An analysis of sea level anomaly reveled large negative values during the extended winter of 2011-2012, which may be attributed to the strong positive phase of NAO index. Satellite altimetry indicated a significant positive sea level trend of 2.7 +/- 0.41 mm/year together with a significant warming of 0.036 +/- 0.003 degrees C/year over the whole Mediterranean Sea for the period 1993-2017.

TI  - Network meta-analysis of novel and conventional sentinel lymph node biopsy techniques in breast cancer
T2  - BJS OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Background The aim of this network meta-analysis was to compare the performance of blue dye alone or in combination with radioisotope (technetium-99m, Tc) with three novel techniques for sentinel lymph node detection in breast cancer: indocyanine green fluorescence (ICG), superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles and contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging (CEUS). Methods PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, China Knowledge Research Integrated Database, and OpenGrey databases were searched up to 31 November 2017, without language restriction. Studies that compared the detection performance of at least one of the novel methods (ICG, SPIO and CEUS) with that of traditional methods (blue dye and/or radioisotope) were included in network meta-analysis. Results Thirty-five studies were included. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) for Tc (1.09, 95 per cent c.i. 1.04 to 1.15), ICG (1.12, 1.07 to 1.16) and SPIO (1.09, 1.01 to 1.18) showed statistically better performance in detecting sentinel lymph nodes than blue dye alone. ICG had the lowest false-negative rate, with a RR of 0.29 (0.16 to 0.54), followed by Tc (RR 0.44, 0.20 to 0.96) and SPIO (RR 0.45, 0.14 to 1.45), with blue dye alone as the reference group. Conclusion SPIO or ICG alone are superior to blue dye alone and comparable to the standard dual-modality technique of blue dye with Tc.

AB  - The understanding of surface dynamics of Lake Ngami, a part of Okavango river system is hindered by paucity of data. The aim of this study was to assess the lake surface dynamics using satellite imagery and in-situ data.Surface dynamics of Lake Ngami were monitored using remote sensing methods to complement the available inadequate in-situ measurements. Landsat imagery of the year 1979 to year 2016 were used. The Lake boundary was mapped using the Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI), where use was made of Histogram thresholding segmentation method in extracting the water pixels. Remotely sensed actual evapo-transpiration (ETa) was estimated using Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) Modelling Approach; while the satellite derived rainfall estimates were obtained from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43V7 satellite imagery product. Precipitation and potential evaporation data from meteorological stations were used to correct the bias of the satellite products. The SSEB method involved the estimation of evaporation fraction using the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity 8-day product (MOD11A2) and GLDAS 0.25 degrees Potential Evapotranspiration version 2.1 for the estimation of potential evapotranspiration.The lake extraction process displayed good results with the average Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy of 0.93 and 96.6%, respectively. The maximum extent of Lake Ngami was observed in the year 2012 at 272 km(2). The ETa was found to be in range of 700 mm/year in dry regions to about 2000 mm/year in Okavango delta swamps. From the study, it was observed that after the 2009 flood-event, the precipitation occurring during the rainy season (October-March) at Angola Highlands had a positive relationship with the Lake Ngami surface area, with Pearson correlation of 0.70. Similar findings were noticed when the lake surface area trend was observed against the in-situ flow data at the Mohembo hydrometric station, which is the inflow of the Okavango delta. This suggests that since the floods of 2009, the precipitation in the Angola Highlands has a major influence in the surface dynamics of Lake Ngami.

TI  - Calculating potential evapotranspiration and single crop coefficient based on energy balance equation using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration is considered to be an important component of allocating water to agricultural sector; therefore, the more accurate this parameter is, the more optimized the water use can be. This study was conducted in order to evaluate the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data (A and B), both separately and combined, in potential evapotranspiration (ETp) and single crop coefficient (K-c) estimations. Field measurements such as crop height, leaf area index (LAI), land surface temperature (LST), air temperature above canopy (AT), and spectral data were exploited in the evaluating process throughout the entirety of 2017-18 growing season under winter wheat and barley cultivations in the Agricultural Research Farms of the University of Tehran. The novel method of Multi-Sensor Data Fusion using the Priestly-Taylor equation was taken into practice for satellite-based ETp (MSDF-ET) calculation from the combination of MODIS thermal and Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 multispectral data. Thermal images were downscaled by the means of the TsHARP algorithm. Thus, prior to ETp calculation, the thermal sharpening algorithm calculated using different spectral indices (SI) was assessed. The SI included NDVI, SAVI, SR, NDWI, NDWIg, and LSWI. The subsequent results were representative of the LSWI qualification under both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 conditions against thermal and spectral measurements. Also the satellite-based ETp strongly correlated with the ETp derived from the field data illuminating the promising accuracy of the MSDF-ET method in both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data. In the end, the time series of K-c obtained from the combination of satellites were fairly indicative of the real-world variations under different vegetation cover and crop growth stages. Overall, using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 products in integration with each other could significantly result in more reliable decisions in agricultural water resources management.

TI  - Development of digital bathymetry maps for Lakes Azuei and Enriquillo using sonar and remote sensing techniques
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an improved algorithm for optimization and development of a digital bathymetric model (DBM) for Lake Azuei (LA) (Haiti) and Lake Enriquillo (LE) (Dominican Republic) using the ANUDEM method. Both sonar data and contour lines of the lakes' layout extracted using Landsat imagery were compiled for bathymetry development. We show that the performance of the ANUDEM method was strongly dependent on the density and irregularity of the spatial distribution of the data. Changing the resolution of the output grids and deriving auxiliary topographically corrected contours improved the ANUDEM performance and minimized the systematic errors of the method. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between measured and interpolated depths, characterized by a root mean square error of less than 0.71 m (LE) and 0.96 m (LA), and a median difference of -0.009 m (LE) and 0.012 m (LA) on average. The shape reliability analysis revealed a relationship between accuracy and the depth and slope values, increasing in the center of the lakes where they are deep and the slope is gentle.

M3  - Article
AB  - Chabahar Bay is a strategic and productive estuary in the south-east of Iran (north of Oman Sea). It is an optically complex bay, and its Chl-a content variations never studied. In this study, Red-Green Chlorophyll Index (RGCI) algorithm for estimating accurate Chl-a content was tested, validated and applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data, using in situ bio-optical data collected seasonally from 2007 to 2015 in 35 stations. Chl-a concentrations varied from 7.7 to 31.3 mg m(-3) with a mean value of 16.4 +/- 5.9 mg m(-3). The mean absorption at 443 nm and 555 nm data showed that the detrital particles and CDOM contents is relatively low and the mean absorption is dominated by phytoplankton and non-living particles. The RGCI algorithm was tuned for green band center position of 555 nm, and showed improvement over the traditional blue-green band ratio algorithms (e.g. OC3) with mean relative error of 37.4% and RMSE of 73.2% for Chl-a ranging between 2 and 80 mg m(-3). The Wavelet Transform (WT) techniques were utilized to analyze the spatio-temporal stability and abnormality of MODIS Chl-a extracted using the tuned RGCI algorithm. Significant variability in time and space was observed, with higher Chl-a in the eastern segment and lower Chl-a in the middle of bay. The highest and lowest Chl-a concentrations were observed in summer and winter, respectively. WT components analysis and anomaly detection revealed the strong correlation of Chl-a concentrations and patterns with turbidity contents and adjacent river discharge. This study showed that the accuracy of RGCI algorithm depends on water body constituents and optimized green waveband position, and therefore the algorithm must be tuned regionally with in situ Chl-a data.

TI  - River Bathymetry Estimate and Discharge Assessment from Remote Sensing
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The NASA Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission and ESA Sentinel-1, inter-alia, propose to monitor inland waters from satellites. The radar altimeter and the microwave radiometer can be used to monitor water surface level and assess the cross-sectional mean flow velocity, respectively. However, for most river sites bathymetric data are lacking, preventing the direct computation of discharge. In this context, a new methodology for simulating the bathymetry and estimating the discharge is proposed. The approach is based on entropy theory and can be applied using ground and satellite observations. Four parameters are needed and include channel roughness, water surface slope, channel bottom elevation, and an entropy parameter of flow depth. These parameters are estimated using a genetic algorithm by minimizing the error in the observed maximum surface velocity. Parameter uncertainty is considered through 1,000 random realizations based on different initial values. Eighteen streamflow measurements recorded from three different gauged river sites are used to benchmark the ground observations. The method included ENVISAT altimetry and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (2002-2010) at one river site. Relative to ground measurements, the method provides good results with an error in channel area and discharge that, on average, does not exceed 10% on the 50th percentile. Relative to satellite measurements, channel area is well simulated with an error, on average, lower than 9%; discharge is less well simulated and represented by an error greater than 30% on the 50th percentile.

TI  - Potential added value of the new emergency care dataset to ED-based public health surveillance in England: an initial concept analysis
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction For the London Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012, a sentinel ED syndromic surveillance system was established to enhance public health surveillance by obtaining data from a selected network of EDs, focusing on London. In 2017, a new national standard Emergency Care Dataset was introduced, which enabled Public Health England (PHE) to initiate the expansion of their sentinel system to national coverage. Prior to this initiative, we estimated the added value, and potential additional resource use, of an expansion of the sentinel surveillance system.Methods The detection capabilities of the sentinel and national systems were compared using the aberration detection methods currently used by PHE. Different scenarios were used to measure the impact on health at a local, subnational and national level, including improvements to sensitivity and timeliness, along with changes in specificity.Results The biggest added value was found to be for detecting local impacts, with an increase in sensitivity of over 80%. There were also improvements found at a national level with outbreaks being detected earlier and smaller impacts being detectable. However, the increased number of local sites will also increase the number of false alarms likely to be generated.Conclusion We have quantified the added value of national ED syndromic surveillance systems, showing how they will enable detection of more localised events. Furthermore, national systems add value in enabling timelier public health interventions. Finally, we have highlighted areas where extra resource may be required to manage improvements in detection coverage.

TI  - Assessment of terrestrial water balance using remote sensing data in South America
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the potential of assessing the water balance in South America, at multiple scales, using satellite remote sensing precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets, terrestrial water storage changes from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and discharge measurements. The remote sensing precipitation datasets included those of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), whilst the ET constituents included the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16) and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). Uncertainties in precipitation and ET were evaluated using in situ measurements of 307 rain-gauge stations and 16 eddy covariance sites, respectively. The water balance closure and uncertainties were evaluated in 50 basins for the period 2003-2014, at different spatial scales and under different climatic conditions. Overall, MSWEP precipitation and GLEAM ET provided fewer uncertainties, whilst TRMM and MOD16 yielded greater bias and more errors. Better agreements between the TWSC from GRACE and the water balance were found in the large and medium-sized basins, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of about 42%, whilst small basins and those located in regions with subtropical humid climates, where precipitation did not present strong seasonality, had a RMSE around 130%, indicating that climate conditions can influence the water balance closure. The TWSC from GRACE and the remote sensing water balance estimations were in agreement for more than half of the evaluated basins, mainly those located in tropical climate regions. Greater bias and more errors were found in the estimations of discharge in the semi-arid basins, with low runoff coefficients. Despite the water balance based on remote sensing estimations remaining a challenge due to the large uncertainties in precipitation, ET, and TWSC, our results showed their great potential for assessing terrestrial water-cycle dynamics and understanding their spatial and temporal variability at multiple scales.

TI  - Detection of Seasonal Inundations by Satellite Data at Shkoder Urban Area, North Albania for Sustainable Management
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency satellites Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical data are widely used in water surface mapping and management. In this work, we exploit the potentials of both radar and optical images for satellite-based quick detection and extent mapping of inundations/water raising events over Shkoder area, which occurred in the two last years (2017-2018). For instance, in March 2018 the Shkoder district (North Albania) was affected twice by the overflow of the Drin and Buna (Bojana) Rivers and by the Shkoder lake plain inundation. Sentinel-1 radar data allowed a rapid mapping of seasonal fluctuations and provided flood extent maps by discriminating water surfaces (permanent water and flood areas) from land/non-flood areas over all the informal zones of Shkoder city. By means of Sentinel-2 data, two color composites maps were produced and the Normalized Difference Water Index was estimated, in order to further distinguish water/moisturized soil surfaces from built-up and vegetated areas. The obtained remote sensing-based maps were combined and discussed with the urban planning framework in order to support a sustainable urban and environmental management. The provided multi-temporal analysis could be easily exploited by the local authorities for flood prevention and management purposes in the inherited territorial context. The proposed approach outputs were validated by comparing them with official Copernicus EMS (Emergency Management Service) maps available for one of the chosen events. The comparison shows good accordance results. As for a further enhancement in the future perspective, it is worth to highlight that a more accurate result could be obtained by performing a post-processing edit to further refine the flooded areas, such as water mask application and supervised classification to filter out isolated flood elements, to remove possible water-lookalikes and weed out false positives.

TI  - Evaluation of Chlorophyll-a and POC MODIS Aqua Products in the Southern Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Ocean (SO) is highly sensitive to climate change. Therefore, an accurate estimate of phytoplankton biomass is key to being able to predict the climate trajectory of the 21st century. In this study, MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), on board EOS Aqua spacecraft, Level 2 (nominal 1 km x 1 km resolution) chlorophyll-a (CSat) and Particulate Organic Carbon (POCsat) products are evaluated by comparison with an in situ dataset from 11 research cruises (2008-2017) to the SO, across multiple seasons, which includes measurements of POC and chlorophyll-a (Cin) from both High Performance Liquid Chromatography (CHPLC) and fluorometry (CFluo). Contrary to a number of previous studies, results highlighted good performance of the algorithm in the SO when comparing estimations with HPLC measurements. Using a time window of +/- 12 h and a mean satellite chlorophyll from a 5 x 5 pixel box centered on the in situ location, the median CSat:Cinsitu ratios were 0.89 (N = 46) and 0.49 (N = 73) for CHPLC and CFluo respectively. Differences between CHPLC and CFluo were associated with the presence of diatoms containing chlorophyll-c pigments, which induced an overestimation of chlorophyll-a when measured fluorometrically due to a potential overlap of the chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-c emission spectra. An underestimation of similar to 0.13 mg m-3 was observed for the global POC algorithm. This error was likely due to an overestimate of in situ POCinsitu measurements from the impact of dissolved organic carbon not accounted for in the blank correction. These results highlight the important implications of different in situ methodologies when validating ocean colour products.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a geospatial approach has been utilised to identify suitable sites and structures for rainwater harvesting in Kiambu County, Kenya. Based on an integrated use of remote sensing and GIS, ideal sites for five rainwater harvesting structures (bench terraces, check dams, percolation tanks, contour bunds and contour ridges) have been developed for potential runoff harvesting. SRTM GDEM and Landsat 8 are utilised to process thematic land-use layers in ENVI 4.7 environment and to map other thematic layers in ArcGIS environment. KENSOTER soil database and TRMM monthly precipitation data are also used in the study. The SCS-CN runoff generation technique is used to integrate land-use/cover and hydrologic soil group layers in a runoff depth determination. The lineaments used are analysed in the PCI Geomatics environment. All the thematic layers are assigned weight depending on the capacity of infiltration and runoff characteristics. A weighted overlay analysis is applied to obtain a layer showing suitable areas for rainwater harvesting structures by rank. The suitable areas' layer is integrated further with other structural considerations layers to determine spatial positioning for each rainwater harvesting structure. Results show that 14, 9, 10, 8, and 14 locations in the entire County are suitable for check dams, percolation tanks, bench terraces, contour ridges, and contour bunds respectively.

TI  - Assessing the large-scale variation of heat budget in poorly gauged watershed-shallow lake system using a novel integrated modeling approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of large-scale temperature dynamics and heat fluxes in shallow lakes requires comprehensive modeling capabilities to simulate water interactions, the processes related to the heat budget, and their driving forces. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal variations in water-surface temperature (WST) and surface heat fluxes for the period between January 2001 and December 2010 in Lake Mirim, a large (surface area ca. 4000 km(2)) shallow lake on the Brazil-Uruguay border. The aquatic ecosystem was examined using in-situ WST measurements, MODIS land surface temperature (M*D11A1 LST) products, and a coupling between a large-scale hydrologic model (MGB-IPH) and a hydrodynamic/water quality model (IPH-ECO). The WST values estimated by the hydrodynamic model were consistent with measured in-situ data and MODIS-derived WST, using both daytime and nighttime time series (R-2 = 0.88; Bias = 1.45 degrees C; RMSE = 2.16 degrees C; ENS = 0.77). Our findings also revealed that the dominant heat fluxes in the lake are the atmospheric longwave radiation (annual mean = 303.38 W m(-2)), water longwave radiation (annual mean = 336.01 W m(-2)), and the latent heat flux (annual mean = 51.14 W m(-2)). Additionally, the heat flux from the river inflows contribute minimally to the overall seasonal heat budget in the lake, being the Cebollati river the main contributor (annual average = 4.63 W m(-2)). Coupled large-scale hydrological and hydrodynamic models will benefit future modeling efforts by providing an effective management tool to study the effect of case scenarios (e.g., climate change) on temperature dynamics, heat fluxes, and physical and ecological processes in these ecosystems.

AB  - Changes in population dynamics or climate often results in encroachment on wetlands by vulnerable communities in search of grazing or fertile farming land. This has been the case for the Kilombero Valley, a Ramsar site in Tanzania, where exploitation by the immigrating communities is a concern to both the scientific and local communities. The Kilombero wetlands are rich in biodiversity and a major contributor to the livelihoods of local communities and are also regarded as one of the main bread baskets of the country. Previous research initiatives have focused mainly on biodiversity assessments, with emphasis placed on wildlife population changes, believed to be affected by ongoing anthropogenic activities in the valley.In this study, the land cover changes in the Kilombero Valley were analyzed over a span of 30 years. Fourteen Landsat (ETM and TM) images, covering the years 1975, 1990, 2002, 2009 and 2010, were used to generate land use maps for the study area and were analyzed to provide quantitative assessments of change. Post-classification change detection analysis revealed that there has been an extensive exploitation of natural land cover across the valley through agricultural activities. In 1975, the valley floor was dominated by woodland (42%) and seasonal wetlands (37%). However, this has changed over the years and in 2008, 36% of the valley area was under intensive cultivation and 29% was occupied by a mixture of settlement, grazing, and cultivated areas. Findings show that there is a rapid transformation to agricultural-intensive activities, especially in the wetland area. At least 90% of wetland area originally present in the valley has been converted to other land uses and about 84% of the woodlands that existed in 1975 have been replaced by other land covers. This calls for closer attention to the ongoing degradation of the Kilombero wetlands.

TI  - Estimation of inherent optical properties using quasi-analytical algorithm along the coastal waters of southeast Arabian Sea
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An integrated Satlantic hyperspectral profiler was used to collect radiometric quantities and fluorescence up to a depth of 50 m. Remote sensing reflectance (r(rs)) characteristics were analysed for the coastal waters of southeast Arabian Sea during 2013 to 2015. Inherent optical properties (IOPs) were derived from the radiometric measurements using quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA). Using hyperspectral remote sensing measurements, a better understanding of the optical properties such as backscattering and absorption for the coastal waters of southeast Arabian Sea was possible. Comparison between QAA-modelled and MODIS Aqua-derived absorptions at different wavelengths showed significant correlation (r = 0.753, 0.836, 0.714, 0.709, 0.714 and -0.347 at wavelengths 412, 443, 488, 531, 547 and 667 respectively) except for red band. The retrieval accuracy of MODIS Aqua Chl-a for the coastal waters of southeast Arabian Sea was considerably good with a correlation of 0.89 with profiler Chl-a concentration. QAA-modelled a(ph) at 443 nm and b(bp) at 555 nm showed a good correlation of 0.82 and 0.81 respectively with the in situ Chl-a concentration. The results of this study elucidate the optical complexity of southeast Arabian Sea coastal waters and support the use of QAA for better understanding of IOPs in the coastal case-2 waters.

AB  - Coastal aquaculture is one of the fast growing food production sectors worldwide, contributing to more than half of the total volume of aquatic foods for human consumption, and offering great potential for global food security. Remote sensing and GIS technologies contribute to the mapping and monitoring of changes in aquaculture providing essential information for coastal management applications. The present study investigates the growth and expansion of aquaculture and its spatiotemporal dynamics in Nagapattinam district (from Vedaranyam to Vettar River) over the last decade. Multitemporal IRS 1C and IRS P6 remote sensing data were analyzed for detecting and assessing land use and land cover (LULC) change in the Nagapattinam area (Tamil Nadu). Visual interpretations have been made with the help of field surveys, primary data collected on field, and secondary data from government departments. LULC maps were prepared to identify changes in aquaculture areas. The classified area for aquaculture in Nagapattinam is 4.02 km(2) in 2006 and 9.80 km(2) in 2016. Similarly, the salt pan areaincreased from 0.53 km(2) to 1.53 km(2) in 2016. The coastal wetlands and marshy lands were used for aquaculture and salt pan activities during 2006 to 2016, providing a livelihood for the people in that area. The study will assist to identify change dynamics in environmental sustainability in the context of livelihood option/development activities.

TI  - Indo-Brazil Remote Sensing Agreement: Policy Perspectives and Implications for India
T2  - SPACE POLICY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Capabilities in space technology are turning into a corner stone of emergence of developing countries such as India and China. In a string of agreements for cooperation in outer space, India has developed several cooperation mechanisms with international partners to harness the benefits of space technology for mutual benefits. India has recently signed a multitude of cooperative agreements in outer space and these instruments of cooperation have advanced the space based capabilities and have mutually benefitted the partners. In one such recent engagement, India has signed a bilateral cooperation Memorandum of Understanding with Brazil in the implementation of an arrangement establishing cooperation in the augmentation of a Brazilian Earth station for receiving and processing the data from Indian Remote Sensing satellite. The agreement has been based on the interest of Brazil to receive the Resourcesat-2 data for natural resources management, but not limited to it. In the backdrop of the agreement between India and Brazil, the present work presents an analysis of the state of capacities for these countries and an overview of policy implications for India. In a foreign policy perspective, the Indo-Brazil agreement has been timed at a stage when the Sino-Brazil cooperation is faced with a challenge of recent failure and is set to provide India a push into a better South South cooperation. The agreement has provided India an added location to downlink its satellite data and may well lay a foundation for future cooperation with other Latin American States and for further global strengthening of ties in forums such as the IBSA.

AB  - Glassfish, Ambassis dussumieri (Cuvier, 1828), was used as a sentinel species to investigate the effects of the ingestion of environmentally relevant microplastic concentrations on juvenile fish growth and survival. Both virgin plastic and plastic collected from an urban harbour were fed to small juvenile fish daily for 95 days. Fish standard length, body depth and mass were recorded at intervals of 20 days, while survival was continuously recorded. All fish were fed tropical flakes, measured at 1.7% of the body mass per tank. Overall, fish in in plastic treatments grew less in body length and body depth compared to those control treatments. Fish mass was also lower in the virgin plastic treatment than control fish; however, the growth in mass was not significantly lower than fish in the harbour plastic treatment. The survival probability of fish in both plastic fed treatments was also lower than fish in controls.

TI  - Performance of Molecular Lymphosonography for Detection and Quantification of Metastatic Involvement in Sentinel Lymph Nodes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo assess the performance of molecular lymphosonography with dual-targeted microbubbles in detecting and quantifying the metastatic involvement in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) using a swine melanoma model.MethodsTargeted microbubbles were labeled with P-selectin and alpha(V)beta(3)-integrin antibodies. Control microbubbles were labeled with immunoglobulin G antibodies. First lymphosonography with Sonazoid (GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) was used to identify SLNs. Then dual-targeted and control microbubbles were injected intravenously to detect and quantify metastatic disease in the SLNs. Distant non-SLNs were imaged as benign controls. All evaluated lymph nodes (LNs) were surgically removed, and metastatic involvement was characterized by a histopathologic analysis. Two radiologists blinded to histopathologic results assessed the baseline B-mode images of LNs, and the results were compared to the histologic reference standard. The mean intensities of targeted and control microbubbles within the examined LNs were measured and compared to the LN histologic results.ResultsThirty-five SLNs and 34 non-SLNs from 13 Sinclair swine were included in this study. Twenty-one SLNs (62%) were malignant, whereas 100% of non-SLNs were benign. The sensitivity of B-mode imaging for metastatic LN diagnosis for both readers was relatively high (90% and 71%), but the specificity was very poor (50% and 58%). The sensitivity and specificity of molecular lymphosonography for metastatic LN detection were 91% and 67%, respectively. The mean intensities from dual-targeted microbubbles correlated well with the degree of metastatic LN involvement (r=0.6; P<0.001).ConclusionsMolecular lymphosonography can increase the specificity of metastatic LN detection and provide a measure to quantify the degree of metastatic involvement.

TI  - The Loss of Lymph Node Metastases After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With Cytology-proven Axillary Node-positive Primary Breast Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy still remains a standard treatment of patients with breast cancer with LN metastases before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our results showed that 3 or more residual lymph node metastases after NAC were rare in patients with LN metastases before neoadjuvant chemotherapy with estrogen receptor-negative/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive or estrogen receptor-negative/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative tumors who were assessed as clinically lymph node-negative after neoadjuvant chemotherapy by ultrasonography. It indicated that no complete axillary lymph node dissection might be needed for these populations.Background: Axillary lymph node (LN) dissection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) still remains a standard treatment of initially LN-positive primary breast cancer because of the difficulty of assessment of LN status. The aim of this study was to assess the LN status after NAC in initially LN-positive primary breast cancer patients who were assessed as clinically LN-negative after NAC (ycN0) and identify factors associated with loss of LN metastasis. Patients and Methods: The study cohort comprised 279 patients with cytology-proven LN-positivity before NAC. LN status was assessed by ultrasonography. Regional recurrence-free survival and overall survival according to pathologic LN after NAC (ypN) status were assessed in patients with ycN0. Results: Of the 279 patients, 179 patients (64.2%) had ycN0. High nuclear grade, estrogen receptor-negative (ER ), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2(+)), were significant predictors of ycN0/ypN0 (P < .001, .007, and .046, respectively). Metastases persisted in 1 or 2 LNs for 5 (20.0%) of 25 patients with ER-/HER2(+) and for 4 (21.1%) of 19 patients with ER-/HER2(+), and in 3 or more LNs for 0 (0%) of 25 patients with ER-/HER2(+) and for 1 (5.3%) of 19 patients with ER- MER2 . Patients with ER+ tumors had more numerous residual LN metastases than those with ER+ tumors (P < .001). Among patients with ycN0, ypN status was not associated with regional recurrence-free survival or overall survival. Conclusions: Three or more residual LN metastases were rare in patients with ER- tumors if assessed as ycN0 by ultrasonography. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the prognostic impact of not performing axillary lymph node dissection in such patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Usefulness of Eurasian Magpies (<i>Pica pica</i>) for West Nile virus Surveillance in Non-Endemic and Endemic Situations
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In September 2017, passive surveillance allowed the detection of West Nile virus (WNV) lineage 2 for the first time in northern Spain in a northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). However, a cross sectional study carried out in Eurasian magpies (Pica pica) in a nearby area evidenced that WNV had been circulating two months earlier. Therefore, active surveillance in Eurasian magpies proved its effectiveness for the early detection of WNV in a non-endemic area. Further surveys in 2018 and the beginning of 2019 using young magpies (i.e., born after 2017) showed the repeated circulation of WNV in the same region in the following transmission season. Therefore, active surveillance in Eurasian magpies as well proved to be useful for the detection of WNV circulation in areas that may be considered as endemic. In this manuscript we present the results of those studies and discuss reasons that make the Eurasian magpies an ideal species for the surveillance of WNV, both in endemic and non-endemic areas.

TI  - Leveraging the entire cohort in drug safety monitoring: part 1 methods for sequential surveillance that use regression adjustment or weighting to control confounding in a multisite, rare event, distributed data setting
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: Study designs involving self-controlled or exposure-matched samples are commonly used to monitor postmarket vaccine and drug safety, and they use a subset of the available larger cohort. This article overviews group sequential methods designed for observational data safety monitoring that use the whole exposed and unexposed cohorts by implementing regression adjustment or weighting to control confounding.Methods: We summarize what is known about the performance of "whole cohort" methods in multisite health plan data networks such as the Sentinel System of the Food and Drug Administration, where outcomes are rare, individual-level patient data cannot be pooled across sites, site heterogeneity is large, and data are dynamically updated over time.Results: Group sequential estimation and testing methods that use regression or weighting can flexibly handle electronic health care data's unpredictability, including an uncertain rate of new product uptake, variable composition of the population over time, and data changes due to dynamic administrative updates. Regression and weighting methods generally have higher power, faster signal detection, and fewer practical challenges compared with some design-based confounder adjustment methods.Conclusion: Group sequential regression adjustment and weighting approaches are feasible and underused in practice. They leverage more information than designs that involved sampling and increase power to detect rare adverse effects without increasing bias. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Specific-pathogen-free Turkey model for reoviral arthritis
T2  - VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Turkey arthritis reovirus (TARV) infections have been recognized since 2011 to cause disease and significant economic losses to the U.S. turkey industry. Reoviral arthritis has been reproduced in commercial-origin turkeys. However, determination of pathogenesis or vaccine efficacy in these turkeys can be complicated by enteric reovirus strains and other pathogens that ubiquitously exist at subclinical levels among commercial turkey flocks. In this study, turkeys from a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) flock were evaluated for use as a turkey reoviral arthritis model. One-day-old or 1-week-old poults were orally inoculated with TARV (O'Neil strain) and monitored for disease onset and progression. A gut isolate of turkey reovirus (MN1 strain) was also tested for comparison. Disease was observed only in TARV-infected birds. Features of reoviral arthritis in SPF turkeys included swelling of hock joints, tenosynovitis, distal tibiotarsal cartilage erosion, and gait defects (lameness). Moreover, TARV infection resulted in a significant depression of body weights during the early times post-infection. Age-dependent susceptibility to TARV infection was unclear. TARV was transmitted to all sentinel birds, which manifested high levels of tenosynovitis and tibiotarsal cartilage erosion. Simulation of stressful conditions by dexamethasone treatment did not affect the viral load or exacerbate the disease. Collectively, the clinical and pathological features of reoviral arthritis in the SPF turkey model generally resembled those induced in commercial turkeys under field and/or experimental conditions. The SPF turkey reoviral arthritis model will be instrumental in evaluation of TARV pathogenesis and reoviral vaccine efficacy.

TI  - Semi-automatic extraction and mapping of dyke swarms based on multi-resolution remote sensing images: Applied to the dykes in the Kuluketage region in the northeastern Tarim Block
T2  - PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The geometry and spatial distribution of mafic dyke swarms provide information about geodynamics. However, mapping large-scale dyke swarms manually is a time-consuming and expensive process. Here we present an efficient method to map dyke swarms semi-automatically by using multi-resolution remote sensing images. This method is applied in the Kuluketage region in the northeastern Tarim Block, northwest China where mafic dykes of multiple trends are widely exposed and with the dominant NW trend being of probable Neoproterozoic age. The tracing of dykes, including their orientation, length, thickness, density, and distribution is done by integrating 30-m multispectral Landsat 8 and 2-m panchromatic CORONA KH-4B imagery. The Gramm-Schmidt Spectral Sharpening approach is used to generate color composite and fusion images with 2-m resolution. The Canny edge detector and Hough transform are used to detect dyke edges. Combining the detection of dyke edges with ArcGIS (TM), the dyke orientation, length, density, thickness, and exposed area are measured. The accuracy of the semi-automatic method exceeds 75% in comparison with manual mapping of the dykes in the Kuluketage region.

TI  - A proof-of-concept application of water-soluble ytterbium(III) molecular probes in <i>in vivo</i> NIR-II whole body bioimaging
T2  - INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-infrared (NIR) emissive lanthanide (Ln) complexes are promising candidates for fluorescence imaging in the NIR-II region (1000-1700 nm) to combine the advantages of small organic molecules and inorganic metal ions. However, their metabolism in vivo and application in in vivo imaging are still unknown. In this work, we used water-soluble Yb3+ molecular probes with a quantum yield of ca. 10% in water, which showed a deep penetration (>3 mm) upon excitation at the Q band. One of the Yb3+ complexes, Yb-2, was successfully applied in high resolution non-invasive whole body, vasculature and lymph node imaging of small animals. The complex cleared from the body through hepatobiliary and renal systems, similar to most organic fluorophores. Importantly, we demonstrated the application of Yb-2 in fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node surgery, showing the prospective application of lanthanide complexes as molecular probes in NIR-II whole body bioimaging and surgical operation.

TI  - [CULTURE OF SAFETY IN THE HOSPITAL].
T2  - Harefuah
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The acute care hospital, with its hospitalization departments, diagnostic centers, outpatient clinics, operation rooms and intensive care units, is a very complex industry with the goal of taking care of patients in every stage of their disease, starting with prevention and continuing with diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis and treatment processes have many stages; most of them depend on high technology and advanced science. Studies in the USA demonstrated 98,000 to 241,000 cases of mortality due to medical errors and complications, third place after mortality due to cardiac diseases and cancer. The quality of treatment is obviously important. The more effective the drug, the higher the influence on disease activity and the better the recovery. Drug safety is not always appreciated and taken into account. The medical team is requested to notify on every mistake, adverse event and sentinel event on the one hand and "nearly missed" cases on the other hand. The reports are very important for system learning. We believe that by changing the system we can prevent many kinds of human errors. We believe that "to err is human", we are not looking for "blame or shame", but want to prevent the next potential mistake. According to the hospital vision, working plans and projects, an annual risk-management plan is needed. This plan has 3 parts: retrospective, prospective and continuing claims and complains assessment. A good annual, comprehensive risk-management plan will protect the patients and lead to a decrease in morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Use of Intensity Analysis to Characterize Land Use/Cover Change in the Biggest Island of Persian Gulf, Qeshm Island, Iran
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, land use/cover change was systematically investigated in the Qeshm Island to understand how human and nature interact in the largest island of Persian Gulf. Land-use maps were prepared for 1996, 2002, 2008, and 2014 using Landsat satellite imagery in six classes including agriculture, bare-land, built-up, dense-vegetation, mangrove, and water-body, and then dynamic of changes in the classes was evaluated using intensity analysis at three levels: interval, category, and transition. Results illustrated that, while the land changes were fast over the first and third time intervals (1996-2002 and 2008-2014), the trend of changes was slow in the second period (2002-2008). Driven by high demand for construction and population growth, the built-up class was identified as an active gainer in all the three time intervals. The class of bare-land was the main supplier of the land for other classes especially for built-up area, while built-up did not act as the active supplier of the land for other classes. The dense-vegetation class was active in all three time intervals. As for the mangrove class, drought and cutting by residents had negative effects, while setting up protected areas can effectively maintain this valuable ecosystem. High demands were observed for land change in relation to built-up and agriculture classes among other classes. The findings of this study can advance our understanding of the relationship and behavior of land use/cover classes among each other over 18 years in a coastal island with arid climate.

TI  - Genetic diversity of influenza A(H3N2) viruses in Northern Cameroon during the 2014-2016 influenza seasons
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Cameroon, genome characterization of influenza virus has been performed only in the Southern regions meanwhile genetic diversity of this virus varies with respect to locality. The Northern region characterized by a Sudan tropical climate might have distinct genetic characterization. This study aimed to better understand the genetic diversity of influenza A(H3N2) viruses circulating in Northern Cameroon. Sequences of three gene segments (hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) genes) were obtained from 16 A(H3N2) virus strains collected during the 2014 to 2016 influenza seasons in Garoua. The HA gene segments were analysed with respect to reference strains while the NA and M gene was analysed for reported genetic markers of resistance to antivirals. Analysis of the HA sequences revealed that majority of the virus strains grouped together with the 2016-2017 vaccine strain (3C.2a-A/Hong Kong/4801/2014) while 3/5 (60%) of the 2015 viral strains grouped together with the 2015-2016 vaccine strain 3C.3a-A/Switzerland/9715293/2013. Within clade 3C.2a, Northern Cameroon sequences mostly grouped in sub-clade A3 (10/16). Analysis of the coding regions of the NA and M genes showed that none had genetic markers of resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors but all strains possessed the S31N substitution of resistance to amantadine. Due to some discrepancies observed in this region with respect to the Southern regions of Cameroon, there is necessity of including all regions within a country in the sentinel surveillance of influenza. These data will enable to track changes in influenza viruses in Cameroon.

TI  - Increase in emergency department visits related to cannabis reported using syndromic surveillance system
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Cannabis is illegal in France but, as in many countries, legalization is under debate. In the United States, an increase of emergency department (ED) visits related to cannabis exposure (CE) in infants and adults was reported. In France, a retrospective observational study also suggested an increase of CE in children under 6 years old. This study only included toddlers and the data sources used did not allow repeated analysis for monitoring. Methods: Our study aimed to evaluate the trend in visits for CE in ED in patients younger than 27 years old in Southern France. A cross-sectional study using the Electronic Emergency Department Abstracts (EEDA) included in the national Syndromic Surveillance System. CE visits were defined using International Classification of Disease (ICD-10). Results: From 2009 to 2014, 16 EDs consistently reported EEDA with <5% missing diagnosis code. Seven hundred and ninety seven patients were admitted for CE including 49 (4.1%) children under 8 years old. From 2009-11 to 2012-14, the rate of CE visits increased significantly across all age groups. The highest increase was in the 8-14 years old (+144%; 1.85-4.51, P < 0.001) and was also significant in children under 8 (0.53-1.06; P = 0.02). Among children under 8, hospitalization rate (75.5% vs. 16.8%; P < 0.001) and intensive care unit admissions (4.1% vs. 0.1%; P < 0.001) were higher compared with patients older than 8 years. Conclusion: These trends occurred despite cannabis remaining illegal. EEDA could be useful for monitoring CE in EDs.

TI  - Elucidating observed land surface feedbacks across sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the role of terrestrial forcings on the regional climate of sub-Saharan Africa through the application of a multivariate statistical method, stepwise generalized equilibrium feedback assessment, to an array of observational, reanalysis, and remote sensing data products. By applying multiple datasets, data uncertainty and the robustness of assessed land surface feedbacks are considered. The approach from our 2017 study is expanded to decompose the relative contribution of vegetation, soil moisture, and oceanic forcings; investigate the role of evapotranspiration (ET) partitioning in terrestrial feedbacks; and compare land surface feedbacks among four key regions, namely the Sahel, Greater Horn of Africa, West African monsoon region, and Congo. ET partitioning differs notably among sub-Saharan regions and between available observational datasets. Across sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, oceanic and terrestrial forcings impose a relatively comparable impact on year-round atmospheric conditions. The land surface feedbacks are most pronounced across the semi-arid Sahel and Greater Horn of Africa, although with unique seasonality of such feedbacks between regions. Moisture recycling is the dominant mechanism in these regions, with positive soil moisture-vegetation-rainfall feedbacks. The direct feedback of soil moisture anomalies on atmospheric conditions outweighed that of leaf area index anomalies. There is a clear need for more extensive observations of ET, its partitioning, and soil moisture across sub-Saharan Africa, as these data uncertainties propagate into the reliability of assessed soil moisture-ET feedbacks, particularly across the Sahel.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Acral Melanoma: Analysis of 201 Cases From the Brazilian National Cancer Institute
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the most powerful predictor of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). No studies have evaluated survival of acral melanoma (AM) undergoing SLNB in Brazil.OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to investigate the factors associated with the survival of patients with AM undergoing SLNB.MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients diagnosed with AM and submitted to SLNB were included in this study. We evaluated the epidemiologic, clinical, and histopathological data. Overall survival and RFS curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable analyses were conducted using the Cox regression model.RESULTS Among the 201 patients, 117 (58.2%) were female. The median age was 64 years old. Median tumor depth was 5.0 mm. Lesions were ulcerated in 134 (66.7%). Five-year OS and RFS rates were 44.6% and 38.6%, respectively. Median follow-up time was 39 months. The factors associated with OS were Breslow thickness, ulceration, and SLNB status, and for RFS, they were Breslow thickness and SLNB status.CONCLUSION This is the largest series of AM submitted to SLNB. The 5-year OS and RFS rates were low (44.6% and 38.6%, respectively), and the main prognostic factors for OS were Breslow thickness, ulceration, and the status of SLNB.

AB  - The application of remote sensing techniques for WPET mapping in data scarce regions is gaining more recognition since it can cover large areas with minimal field observations. Important concerns are the generation of high-resolution WPET maps and addressing the question on how accurate the results are. This study aims at high resolution (10 m) mapping and evaluation of the spatial variability of biomass, yield, ET and WPET in the Makanya river catchment using the automated Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (pySEBAL) with SENTINEL-2 and LANDSAT-8 images, local land use map and locally calibrated leaf area index (LAI) inputs. A coupled phenological variability and supervised classification approach on high resolution images generated a high accuracy LULC layer which was used to map the WPET in the agricultural lands. The pySEBAL results were evaluated in view of local information on crop yields, water allocation and agricultural management practices in the different agro-ecological zones within the catchment. Calibration of high-resolution satellite LAI generated products with error estimates within acceptable levels of uncertainty. The simulated crop yields were in agreement with reported crop yields. The results showed relatively high WPET in the highlands and low WPET in the midland and lowland areas of the catchment. The latter was attributed to high transmission losses, low irrigation efficiencies, poor agricultural practices and pest/disease attack. When applying SEBAL in African cultivated catchments, it is highly recommended to use SENTINEL-2 data in addition to LANDSAT-8, and to use local information, especially for the ground truthing of land use maps, phenology, crop practices and crop yields.

TI  - Chlorophyll algorithms for ocean color sensors-OC4, OC5 & OC6
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A high degree of consistency and comparability among chlorophyll algorithms is necessary to meet the goals of merging data from concurrent overlapping ocean color missions for increased coverage of the global ocean and to extend existing time series to encompass data from recently launched missions and those planned for the near future, such as PACE, OLCI, HawkEye, EnMAP and SABIA-MAR. To accomplish these goals, we developed 65 empirical ocean color (OC) chlorophyll algorithms for 25 satellite instruments using the largest available and most globally representative database of coincident in situ chlorophyll a and remote sensing reflectances. Excellent internal consistency was achieved across these OC 'Version -7' algorithms, as demonstrated by a median regression slope and coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.985 and 0.859, respectively, among 903 pairwise comparisons of OC-modeled chlorophyll. SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua satellite-to-in situ match-up results indicated equivalent, and sometimes superior, performance to current heritage chlorophyll algorithms. During the past forty years of ocean color research the violet band (412 nm) has rarely been used in empirical algorithms to estimate chlorophyll concentrations in oceanic surface water. While the peak in chlorophyll specific absorption coincides with the 443 nm band present on most ocean color sensors, the magnitude of chlorophyll-specific absorption at 412 nm can reach upwards of similar to 70% of that at 443 nm. Nearly one third of total chlorophyll-specific absorption between 400 and 700 nm occurs below 443 nm, suggesting that bands below 443 nm, such as the 412 nm band present on most ocean color sensors, may also be useful in detecting chlorophyll under certain conditions and assumptions. The 412 nm band is also the brightest band (that is, with the most dominant magnitude) in remotely sensed reflectances retrieved by heritage passive ocean color instruments when chlorophyll is less than similar to 0.1 mg m(-3), which encompasses similar to 24% of the global ocean. To attempt to exploit this additional spectral information, we developed two new families of OC algorithms, the 005 and 006 algorithms, which include the 412 nm band in the MBR. By using this brightest band in MBR empirical chlorophyll algorithms, the highest possible dynamic range of MBR may be achieved in these oligotrophic areas. The terms oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic get frequent use in the scientific literature to designate trophic status; however, quantitative definitions in terms of chlorophyll levels are arbitrarily defined. We developed a new, reproducible, bio-optically based index for trophic status based on the frequency of the brightest, maximum band in the MBR for the OC6_SEAWIFS algorithm, along with remote sensing reflectances from the entire SeaWiFS mission. This index defines oligotrophic water as chlorophyll less than similar to 0.1 mg m(-3), eutrophic water as chlorophyll above 1.67 mg m(-3) and mesotrophic water as chlorophyll between 0.1 and 1.67 mg m(-3). Applying these criteria to the 40-year mean global ocean chlorophyll data set revealed that oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic water occupy similar to 24%, 67%, and 9%, respectively, of the area of the global ocean on average.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Assessment of Environmental Factors Related to Dengue Outbreaks in Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue fever, a disease caused by a vector-borne flavivirus, is endemic to tropical countries, but its occurrence has been reported worldwide. This study aimed to understand important factors contributing to the spatial and temporal patterns of dengue occurrence in Sao Paulo, the largest municipality of Brazil. The temporal assessment of dengue occurrence covered the 2011-2016 time period and was based on climatological data, such as the El Nino indices and time series statistical tools such as the continuous wavelet transformation. The spatial assessment used Landsat 8 data for years 2014-2016 to estimate land surface temperature and normalized indices for vegetation, urban areas, and leaf water. Results from a cross correlation for the temporal analysis found a relationship between the sea surface temperature anomalies index and the number of reported dengue cases in Sao Paulo (r = 0.5) with a lag of +29 (weeks) between the climatic event and the response on the dengue incidence. This relationship, initially nonlinear, became linear after correcting for the lag period. For the spatial assessment, the linear stepwise regression model detected a low relationship between dengue incidence and minimum surface temperature (r = 0.357) and no relationship with other environmental parameters. The poor relationship might be due to confounding effects of socioeconomic factors as these seem to influence the spatial dynamics of dengue incidence. More testing is needed to validate these methods in other locations. Nevertheless, we presented possible tools to be used for the improvement of dengue control programs.

TI  - Stepwise Disaggregation of SMAP Soil Moisture at 100 m Resolution Using Landsat-7/8 Data and a Varying Intermediate Resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global soil moisture (SM) products are currently available from passive microwave sensors at typically 40 km spatial resolution. Although recent efforts have been made to produce 1 km resolution data from the disaggregation of coarse scale observations, the targeted resolution of available SM data is still far from the requirements of fine-scale hydrological and agricultural studies. To fill the gap, a new disaggregation scheme of Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) data is proposed at 100 m resolution by using the disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change (DISPATCH) algorithm. The main objectives of this paper is (i) to implement DISPATCH algorithm at 100 m resolution using SMAP SM and Landsat land surface temperature and vegetation index data and (ii) to investigate the usefulness of an intermediate spatial resolution (ISR) between the SMAP 36 km resolution and the targeted 100 m resolution. The sequential disaggregation approach from 36 km to ISR (ranging from 1 km to 30 km) and from ISR to 100 m resolution is evaluated over 22 irrigated field crops in central Morocco using in-situ SM measurements collected from January to May 2016. The lowest root mean square difference (RMSD) between the 100 m resolution disaggregated and in-situ SM is obtained when the ISR is around 10 km. Therefore, the two-step disaggregation is more efficient than the direct disaggregation from SMAP to 100 m resolution. Moreover, we propose a moving average window algorithm to increase the accuracy in the 100 m resolution SM as well as to reduce the low-resolution boxy artifacts on disaggregated images. The correlation coefficient between 100 m resolution disaggregated and in situ SM ranges between 0.5-0.9 for four out of the six extensive sampling dates. This methodology relies solely on remote sensing data and can be easily implemented to monitor SM at a high spatial resolution over irrigated regions.

TI  - Magnetically Promoted Rapid Immunofluorescence Staining for Frozen Tissue Sections
T2  - JOURNAL OF HISTOCHEMISTRY & CYTOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current immunohistochemistry methods for diagnosing abnormal cells, such as cancer cells, require multiple steps and can be relatively slow compared with intraoperative frozen hematoxylin and eosin staining, and are therefore rarely used for intraoperative examination. Thus, there is a need for novel rapid detection methods. We previously demonstrated that functionalized fluorescent ferrite beads (FF beads) magnetically promoted rapid immunoreactions. The aim of this study was to improve the magnetically promoted rapid immunoreaction method using antibody-coated FF beads and a magnet subjected to a magnetic field. Using frozen sections of xenograft samples of A431 human epidermoid cancer cells that express high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anti-EGFR antibody-coated FF beads, we reduced the magnetically promoted immunohistochemistry procedure to a 1-min reaction and 1-min wash. We also determined the optimum magnetic force for the antibody reaction (from 7.79 x 10(-15) N to 3.35 x 10(-15) N) and washing (4.78 x 10(-16) N), which are important steps in this technique. Furthermore, we stained paraffin-embedded tissue arrays and frozen sections of metastatic breast cancer lymph nodes with anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody-coated FF beads to validate the utility of this system in clinical specimens. Under optimal conditions, this ultra-rapid immunostaining method may provide an ancillary method for pathological diagnosis during surgery. (J Histochem Cytochem 58:XXX-XXX, 2010)

TI  - The utility of thermal satellite images and land-based meteorology to estimate evaporation from large lakes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaporation measurements over lakes are limited by physical constraints, logistics and financial demands. Thermal satellite images and land-based meteorology can be combined to derive evaporation rates from large lakes. The Dead Sea is a large hypersaline lake that can be used to examine the utility of thermal satellite images along with land-based meteorology to assess evaporation rates. Sea surface tmperature was retrieved for a 12-month period using band 10 onboard Landsat 8. Monthly SST was combined with nearby land-based meteorology to estimate evaporation from the sea surface using a mass transfer method and two variations of the Penman procedure. The Mass transfer gave an annual evaporation rate of 1005 mm whereas the Penman and the Priestley-Taylor methods gave 1308 and 1140 mm, respectively. These values are commensurate with extensive field measurement and theoretically derived evaporation values. Analysis shows a tradeoff between wind speed increase over the smoother lake surface and the drop in the saturation water vapor pressure deficit across the lake-atmosphere boundary. Wind speed has profound effects on evaporation differences during the warm season but diminish appreciably in the cold season when the vapor pressure deficit is small. Thermal images were able to resolve the presence of large pockets of cool water over the Dead Sea resulting from freshwater input Modifications to evaporation caused by freshwater input to a hypersaline lake are investigated from a thermodynamic perspective. The alteration to evaporation depends on the simultaneous departure of surface temperature and the activity of the brine. (C) 2019 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

TI  - GIS and multi-criteria decision-making analysis assessment of land suitability for rapeseed farming in calcareous soils of semi-arid regions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - To reverse the negative environmental properties effect on fertile lands for agriculture, land suitability evaluation is the first step in the designing the most sustainable land use and management systems. The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate a land suitability model for rapeseed farming using topography factors, soil data and remote sensing data in calcareous soils of semi-arid regions northwestern Iran. For this purpose, stratified random sampling was used to select a set of 92 soil samples of agricultural land use from 0 to 30 cm depth. For land suitability assessment, the opinions of 19 local experts were used to make a decision for the weight of topography, soil data and remote sensing data factors by an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) from multi-criteria analysis. The input data including climate, topography, soil and remote sensing data were included that are related to rapeseed production. The results indicate the highest specific weight belongs to the soil texture (0.341), calcium carbonate equivalent (0.171) and elevation (0.114), respectively. Land suitability evaluation based on the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization classification system indicated that 0.81% (420.8 ha) of the studied area was for high suitable (S1), 42.33% (21940.2 ha) was for moderately suitable (S2) and 11.78% (6104 ha) was for marginally suitable (S3) class. The 39.72% (20586.4) and 0.95% (492.1 ha) of studied area were located as currently not-suitable and permanently not-suitable for rapeseed productions, respectively.

TI  - What nutrient sources support anomalous growth and the recent sargassum mass stranding on Caribbean beaches? A review
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Review
AB  - Since 2011, tropical beaches from Africa to Brazil, Central America, and the Caribbean have been inundated by tons of sargassum seaweed from a new equatorial source of pelagic sargassum in the Atlantic. In recent years the extraordinary accumulations of sargassum make this a nuisance algal bloom for tropical coasts. In 2018 satellite data indicated floating mats of sargassum that extended throughout the Caribbean to the northeast coast of Brazil with the highest percent coverage over the water yet recorded. A literature review suggests that Atlantic equatorial recirculation of seaweed mats combined with nutrients from several possible sources may be stimulating the growth and accumulations of sargassum. In the western equatorial recirculation area, new nutrient sources may include Amazon River floods and hurricanes; in the eastern equatorial recirculation area, nutrient sources that could sustain the sargassum blooms include coastal upwelling and Congo River freshwater and nutrients.

TI  - A new approach for biocrust and vegetation monitoring in drylands using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drylands, one of the planet's largest terrestrial biomes, are suggested to be greatly threatened by climate change. Drylands are usually sparsely vegetated, and biological soil crusts (biocrusts) - that is, soil surface communities of cyanobacteria, mosses and/or lichens - can cover up to 70% of dryland cover. As they control key ecosystem processes, monitoring their spatial and temporal distribution can provide highly valuable information. In this study, we examine the potential of European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel-2 (S2) data to characterize the spatial and temporal development of biocrust and vascular plant greening along a rainfall gradient of the Negev Desert (Israel). First, the chlorophyll a absorption feature in the red region (CRred) was identified as the index mostly sensitive to changes in biocrust greening but minimally affected by changes in soil moisture. This index was then computed on the S2 images and enabled monitoring the phenological dynamics of different dryland vegetation components from August 2015 to August 2017. The analysis of multi-temporal S2 images allowed us to successfully track the biocrust greening within 15 days from the first seasonal rain events in the north of Negev, and to identify the maximum development of annual vascular plants and greening of perennial ones. These results show potential for monitoring arid and semi-arid environments using the newly available S2 images, allowing new insights into dryland vegetation dynamics.

TI  - Decoupling of the urban vegetation productivity from climate
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is causing profound alterations of ecosystem functions at local and regional scales. The need to maximize ecosystem services to improve the livability of cities is resulting in intensive management of urban vegetation, which is likely generating new conditions for the ecosystem functioning. In this paper, we address the association between vegetation functioning (i.e., primary productivity) and climate in urban and adjacent non-urban areas in Auckland, New Zealand. We used time series analysis of integrated vegetation indices derived from satellite images (MODIS) to estimate a proxy of primary productivity of urban and non-urban vegetation. We analyzed the interannual variability of vegetation productivity in relation to climate fluctuations. In Auckland's urban area the variability of primary productivity was not associated with any of the climatic variables considered, while in the non-urban area (i.e. reference area) vegetation productivity was strongly associated with cumulative rainfall during the growing season. Our results suggest that the productivity of urban vegetation may be undergoing a decoupling from the regional climate. If a decoupling of ecosystem functions from climate becomes a general pattern in urban areas it could have significant effects on urban vegetation planning and management. In a context of increased variability, urban ecosystems could constitute stable habitats and they will probably contribute to the viability of vulnerable populations.

TI  - Monitoring Variation of Tidal Channels associated with Shihwa Reclamation Project using Remote Sensing Approaches
T2  - ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed variation of tidal channels associated with Shihwa reclamation project for corresponding observation period based on remote sensing approaches. The project period was subdivided to developing period, closed period, and open period based on developing and management plan of Shiwa lake, and number, length, width, and direction of tidal channels for each period were analyzed using CORONA, Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and orthorectified aerial photographs. Number of tidal channels decreased from developing to opening period while 3 rd order channles did not show noticeable changes. The length of tidal channels decreased during developing to closed period, and increasing trend of 2 nd and 3 rd order channels was observed for the opening period. The average widtrh of 2 nd and 3 rd order channels decreased from developing to closed period, and increased during open period. The direction of tidal channels showed NW and NE direction in general, while the rose diagram showed deacrased frequency of NE direction and increased frequency of NW direction during the open period. These variations in tidal channels are considered to be related to changes in tidal energy environment, where stable energy environment before the project was changed to disconnection of tidal energy by closed environment, and re-connection of the energy during the open period.

TI  - Overview of Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Concentration Retrieval Algorithms from Multi-Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - Since the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS)/Nimbus-7 was launched in 1978, a variety of studies have been conducted to retrieve ocean color variables from multi-satellites. Several algorithms and formulations have been suggested for estimating ocean color variables based on multi band data at different wavelengths. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration is one of the most important variables to understand low-level ecosystem in the ocean. To retrieve chl-a concentrations from the satellite observations, an appropriate algorithm depending on water properties is required for each satellite sensor. Most operational empirical algorithms in the global ocean have been developed based on the band-ratio approach, which has the disadvantage of being more adapted to the open ocean than to coastal areas. Alternative algorithms, including the semi-analytical approach, may complement the limits of band-ratio algorithms. As more sensors are planned by various space agencies to monitor the ocean surface, it is expected that continuous monitoring of oceanic ecosystems and environments should be conducted to contribute to the understanding of the oceanic biosphere and the impact of climate change. This study presents an overview of the past and present algorithms for the estimation of chl-a concentration based on multi-satellite data and also presents the prospects for ongoing and upcoming ocean color satellites.

TI  - The Literary Phenomenon "New Folk Tales" in the System of Soviet Literature of the 1920s
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the article is to analyze the phenomenon of "new folk tales" that appeared during the literary process of the 1920s. The ideological discourse of the new power formed a conceptually meaningful category of a "new man in search for new ways of achieving universal happiness and well-being" that reflected the request for searching for different moral landmarks of the epoch. Seeking for such a landmark, the writers of the 1920s rethought archaic genres, and a fairy tale became the most demanded of all genres. It is a fairy tale that makes an attempt to harmonize the new, yet unsettled world through eternal moral landmarks that it contains. When researching the strategies of rethinking this genre, it is important to note that the writers of the 1920s created not only exclusively original literary fairy tales but "pseudofolklore" works ("fakelores") as if written by folk. Specific verbal features of the literary phenomenon "new folk tales" can be seen in each analyzed text, and eventually they form peculiar narrative poetics that unites all the collections the author presents in the article. Individual authorial strategies of the writers of the "second row" obeyed the collective idea of searching for people's happiness and reflected the philosophical and historical-literary discourse of the epoch of a new worldview. The works of the authors that are not widely known to the public but constitute the avant-garde of the new Soviet ideological model of the 1920s (A. Yakovlev, R. Akul'shin, N. Volkov, A. Balagin, N. Kamensky) were the material of the research. Comparative, typological, historical-cultural, receptive methods, as well as genre-stylistic and structural-semantic analysis, were used. The research shows that binary oppositions "old/new", "folk tale/reality", which constitute the worldview basis of the corpus of the analyzed texts together with key notions rethought by the authors (God, religion, happiness, collective, people), are widely included in Stepintsy and The End of an Old Fairy Tale by A. Yakovlev. In New Folk Tales by R. Akul'shin, the final system of perception of new ideological views as immanent to people's consciousness is formed. The accent on the formal features of a folk tale, folk tale semantics, elements of folk tales and colloquial expressions allow classifying Akul'shin's work as an attempt to create new folklore for a new man. In the article, the author makes a basic conclusion that ideologically evoked aspirations of Soviet power to form an image of a "new man" lead to the birth of the phenomenon of "new folk tales" during the literary process of the 1920s where archaic elements were combined with the newest linguistic and aesthetic material reflecting the flow of the epoch. Thus, the traditional religious and theocentric worldview is overcome yielding to a conceptual "new worldview" approved and supported by the masses and born in the literature of the 1920s through the adaption of the folk tale model to the forming reality.

TI  - Satellite Earth Observation Data in Epidemiological Modeling of Malaria, Dengue and West Nile Virus: A Scoping Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) data can be leveraged to estimate environmental variables that influence the transmission cycle of the pathogens that lead to mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs). The aim of this scoping review is to examine the state-of-the-art and identify knowledge gaps on the latest methods that used satellite EO data in their epidemiological models focusing on malaria, dengue and West Nile Virus (WNV). In total, 43 scientific papers met the inclusion criteria and were considered in this review. Researchers have examined a wide variety of methodologies ranging from statistical to machine learning algorithms. A number of studies used models and EO data that seemed promising and claimed to be easily replicated in different geographic contexts, enabling the realization of systems on regional and national scales. The need has emerged to leverage furthermore new powerful modeling approaches, like artificial intelligence and ensemble modeling and explore new and enhanced EO sensors towards the analysis of big satellite data, in order to develop accurate epidemiological models and contribute to the reduction of the burden of MBDs.

TI  - Pretreatment Tattoo Marking of Suspicious Axillary Lymph Nodes: Reliability and Correlation with Sentinel Lymph Node
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTattooing is an alternative method for marking biopsied axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) before initiation of treatments for newly diagnosed breast cancer. Detection of black ink-stained nodes is performed under direct visualization at surgery and is combined with sentinel node (SLN) mapping procedures.MethodsWomen with newly diagnosed breast cancer who underwent fine or core-needle biopsy of suspicious ALNs were recruited. The nodal cortex and perinodal soft tissue was injected with 0.1-1.0ml of Spot (TM) (GI Supply) black ink under ultrasound guidance. Intraoperatively, black stained nodes were removed along with SLNs, noting concordance between the two.ResultsSixty-six evaluable patients were enrolled (2013-2017). Nineteen received surgery first (Group 1) and 47 neoadjuvant therapy (NAT, Group 2). The average number of nodes tattooed was 1.16 for Group 1 and 1.04 for Group 2. The average interval from tattoo to surgery was 21days (range 1-62) for Group 1 and 148days (range 71-257) for Group 2. The tattooed node(s) were visually identified at surgery and corresponded to the sentinel lymph node(s) in 98.5% of cases (18/19 in Group 1 and 47/47 in Group 2). Of the 14 patients in Group 2 whose nodes remained positive following NAT, the tattooed node was the SLN associated with carcinoma.ConclusionsTattooing is an alternative method for marking biopsied ALNs. Tattooed nodes coincided with SLNs in 98.5% of cases. This technique is advantageous, because it allows for fewer procedures and lower costs compared with other methods.

TI  - Multi-Aspect Analysis of Object-Oriented Landslide Detection Based on an Extended Set of LiDAR-Derived Terrain Features
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide identification is a fundamental step enabling the assessment of landslide susceptibility and determining the associated risks. Landslide identification by conventional methods is often time-consuming, therefore alternative techniques, including automatic approaches based on remote sensing data, have captured the interest among researchers in recent decades. By providing a highly detailed digital elevation model (DEM), airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) allows effective landslide identification, especially in forested areas. In the present study, object-based image analysis (OBIA) was applied to landslide detection by utilizing LiDAR-derived data. In contrast to previous investigations, our analysis was performed on forested and agricultural areas, where cultivation pressure has degraded specific landslide geomorphology. A diverse variety of aspects that influence OBIA accuracy in landslide detection have been considered: DEM resolution, segmentation scale, and feature selection. Finally, using DEM delivered layers and OBIA, landslide was identified with an overall accuracy (OA) of 85% and a kappa index (KIA) equal to 0.60, which illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In the end, a field investigation was performed in order to evaluate the results achieved by applying an automatic OBIA approach. The advantages and challenges of automatic approaches for landslide identification for various land use were also discussed. Final remarks underline that effective landslide detection in forested areas could be achieved while this is still challenging in agricultural areas.

TI  - End of season influenza vaccine effectiveness in adults and children in the United Kingdom in 2017/18
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the United Kingdom (UK), in recent influenza seasons, children are offered a quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4), and eligible adults mainly trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV). Aim: To estimate the UK end-of-season 2017/18 adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) and the seroprevalence in England of antibodies against influenza viruses cultured in eggs or tissue. Methods: This observational study employed the test-negative case-control approach to estimate aVE in primary care. The population-based seroprevalence survey used residual age-stratified samples. Results: Influenza viruses A(H3N2) (particularly subgroup 3C. 2a2) and B (mainly B/Yamagata/16/88-lineage, similar to the quadrivalent vaccine B-virus component but mismatched to TIV) dominated. All-age aVE was 15% (95% confidence interval (CI): -6.3 to 32) against all influenza; -16.4% (95% CI: -59.3 to 14.9) against A(H3N2); 24.7% (95% CI: 1.1 to 42.7) against B and 66.3% (95% CI: 33.4 to 82.9) against A(H1N1) pdm09. For 2-17 year olds, LAIV4 aVE was 26.9% (95% CI: -32.6 to 59.7) against all influenza; -75.5% (95% CI: -289.6 to 21) against A(H3N2); 60.8% (95% CI: 8.2 to 83.3) against B and 90.3% (95% CI: 16.4 to 98.9) against A(H1N1) pdm09. For >= 18 year olds, TIV aVE against influenza B was 1.9% (95% CI: -63.6 to 41.2). The 2017 seroprevalence of antibody recognising tissue-grown A(H3N2) virus was significantly lower than that recognising egg-grown virus in all groups except 15-24 year olds. Conclusions: Overall aVE was low driven by no effectiveness against A(H3N2) possibly related to vaccine virus egg-adaption and a new A(H3N2) subgroup emergence. The TIV was not effective against influenza B. LAIV4 against influenza B and A(H1N1) pdm09 was effective.

TI  - Synthesis of proximal sensing, terrain analysis, and parent material information for available micronutrient prediction in tropical soils
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In developing countries, the use of proximal and remotely sensed data is of critical importance as a less expensive means of obtaining soils information. While proximal sensor approaches such as portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry are becoming increasingly used to predict soil properties worldwide, remotely sensed data has also been used for terrain analysis in recent decades with the aid of powerful interpretive algorithms. The aims of this work were to apply a random forest algorithm to model and predict the available contents of Fe, Cu, Mn, and Zn from pXRF data in addition to terrain attributes (TAs) with 5 and 10m spatial resolution and parent material information. The data were used separately and together in an area with high variability of parent materials. Soil samples (n=153) were collected, analyzed by pXRF, and subjected to laboratory analyses to determine the available contents of Fe, Cu, Mn, and Zn. Twelve TAs were generated from digital elevation models (DEM). These data were divided into five datasets (or random forest inputs): pXRF data; TA 5m data; TA 10m; pXRF+TA 5m; and pXRF+TA 10m. Predictions were performed to assess the importance of such variables. Models were validated with an independent set of samples. Finally, the best models were spatially rendered to cover the entire study area and maps were also validated. The combination of pXRF data and TA covariates in addition to parent material information allowed accurate predictions of available Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn through the random forest algorithm. Parent material information improved the predictions. Pixel size of 10m resolution promoted better results than 5m resolution. Available Fe contents were better predicted using only TA data. For the spatial prediction of available micronutrients, validation of maps resulted in R-2 of 0.88, RMSE of 59.97mgkg(-1) and ME of 24.00mgkg(-1) for Fe; 0.85, 29.65mgkg(-1), 9.70mgkg(-1) for Mn, 0.64, 3.11mgkg(-1), 0.71mgkg(-1) for Zn and 0.82, 1.17mgkg(-1), 0.43mgkg(-1) for Cu, respectively. Available micronutrient contents can be accurately predicted using pXRF data in association with terrain and parent material information.

TI  - Densely Based Multi-Scale and Multi-Modal Fully Convolutional Networks for High-Resolution Remote-Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic and accurate semantic segmentation from high-resolution remote-sensing images plays an important role in the field of aerial images analysis. The task of dense semantic segmentation requires that semantic labels be assigned to each pixel in the image. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be powerful tools for image classification, and they have been adopted in the remote-sensing community. But many limitations still exist when modern CNN architectures are directly applied to remote-sensing images, such as gradient explosion when the depth of the network increases, over-fitting with limited labeled remote-sensing data, and special differences between remote-sensing images and natural images. In this paper, we present a novel architecture that combines the thought of dense connection and fully convolutional networks, referred as DFCN, to automatically provide fine-grained semantic segmentation maps. In addition, we improve DFCN with multi-scale filters to widen the network and to increase the richness and diversity of extracted information, making the network more powerful and expressive than the naive convolution layer. Furthermore, we investigate a multi-modal network that incorporates digital surface models (DSMs) into a DFCN structure, and then we propose dual-path densely convolutional networks where the encoder consists of two paths that, respectively, extract features from spectral data and DSMs data and then fuse them. Finally, through conducting comprehensive experimental evaluations on two remote sensing benchmark datasets, we test our proposed models and compare them with other deep networks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approaches; they can achieve competitive performance compared with the current state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Combining GF-2 and RapidEye satellite data for mapping mangrove species using ensemble machine-learning methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are important constitutions for sustainable development of coastal ecosystems, and they are often mapped and monitored with remote sensing approaches. Satellite images allow detailed studies of the distribution and composition of mangrove forests, and therefore facilitate the management and conservation of the ecosystems. The combination of multiple types of satellite images with different spatial and spectral resolutions is helpful in mangrove forests extraction and mangrove species discrimination as it reduces sampling workload and increases classification accuracies. In this study, the 1.0-m-resolution Gaofen-2 (GF-2) and the 5.0-m-resolution RapidEye-4 (RE-4) satellite images, acquired in February 2017 and November 2016 respectively, were used with ensemble machine-learning and object-oriented methods for mangroves mapping at both the community and species levels of the Qi'ao Island, Zhuhai, China. First, the mangroves on the island were segmented from the GF-2 image on a large scale, and then they were extracted combining with their digital elevation model (DEM) data. Second, the GF-2 image was further processed on a fine scale, in which object-oriented features from both the GF-2 and RE-4 images were extracted for each mangrove species. Third, it is followed by the mangrove species classification process which involves three ensemble machine-learning methods: the adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), the random forest (RF) and the rotation forest (RoF). These three methods employed a classification and regression tree (CART) as the base classifier. The results show that the overall accuracy (OA) of mangrove area extraction on the Qi'ao Island with the auxiliary data, DEM, achieves 98.76% (Kappa coefficient (kappa) = 0.9289). The features extracted by the GF-2 and RE-4 images were shown to be beneficial for mangrove species discrimination. A maximum improvement in the OA of approximately 8% and a kappa kappa of approximately 0.10 were achieved when employing RoF (OA = 92.01%, kappa = 0.9016). Ensemble-learning methods can significantly improve the classification accuracy of CART, and the use of a bagging scheme (RF and RoF) is shown as a better way to map mangrove species than adaptive boosting (AdaBoost). In addition, RoF performed well in mangrove species classification but it was not as robust as the RF, whose average OA and kappa kappa were 80.59% and 0.7608, respectively, while the RoF's were 77.45% and 0.7214, respectively, in the 10-fold cross-validation.

TI  - Measurements and reanalysis data on wind speed and solar irradiation from energy generation perspectives at several locations in Poland
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Energy system research requires input data with high temporal and spatial resolution. However, the measurements performed in meteorological stations are only available for selected locations. Currently a growing number of research papers on small and large-scale power systems utilizes data coming from satellite measurements and various reanalyses. Although many authors aimed at comparing various data sources on irradiation and wind speed there is a lack of such studies, which compare both resources simultaneously at the same location. In consequence, many studies which are entirely based on satellite/reanalysis data may not be representative. In this paper 15 locations in Poland have been selected where the National Institute of Meteorology and Water Management performs continuous measurements of wind speed, temperature and global irradiation on a horizontal surface. Hourly time series were obtained for the year 2012 and 2013. The renewable resources were converted into electrical energy, considering the performance of typical PV panels and wind turbines. The findings of this study are as follows: solar radiation (CAMS and ERA5) shows a good agreement with ground measurements, for hourly values the coefficient of correlations is greater than 0.9; for individual locations the energy yield from PV system can differ by up to 9% but on average (all locations) the simulated energy yield based on satellite data is higher by less than 0.5%; simulations for wind energy showed a large variability in results with differences in capacity factors reaching 15 percentage points.

TI  - Leveraging Commercial High-Resolution Multispectral Satellite and Multibeam Sonar Data to Estimate Bathymetry: The Case Study of the Caribbean Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The global coastal seascape offers a multitude of ecosystem functions and services to the natural and human-induced ecosystems. However, the current anthropogenic global warming above pre-industrial levels is inducing the degradation of seascape health with adverse impacts on biodiversity, economy, and societies. Bathymetric knowledge empowers our scientific, financial, and ecological understanding of the associated benefits, processes, and pressures to the coastal seascape. Here we leverage two commercial high-resolution multispectral satellite images of the Pleiades and two multibeam survey datasets to measure bathymetry in two zones (0-10 m and 10-30 m) in the tropical Anguilla and British Virgin Islands, northeast Caribbean. A methodological framework featuring a combination of an empirical linear transformation, cloud masking, sun-glint correction, and pseudo-invariant features allows spatially independent calibration and test of our satellite-derived bathymetry approach. The best R-2 and RMSE for training and validation vary between 0.44-0.56 and 1.39-1.76 m, respectively, while minimum vertical errors are less than 1 m in the depth ranges of 7.8-10 and 11.6-18.4 m for the two explored zones. Given available field data, the present methodology could provide simple, time-efficient, and accurate spatio-temporal satellite-derived bathymetry intelligence in scientific and commercial tasks i.e., navigation, coastal habitat mapping and resource management, and reducing natural hazards.

TI  - Place based transformative learning: a framework to explore consciousness in sustainability initiatives
T2  - EMOTION SPACE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on a critical literature review, the article argues that transformative learning (TL) that fosters a shift in consciousness towards a more ecological approach is an inherently place-based phenomenon. In this article we build a place-based approach to TL based on a literature review. Our theoretical framework is grounded in three key themes which emerge from the literature: (re-) connection, (self-)compassion and creativity. (Re-)connection involves all processes that evoke an experience of the interconnected nature of all life. (Self-)compassion, acting to alleviate suffering or doing the least harm, naturally follows a sense of interconnection. Creativity is the materialisation of a sense of interconnection and compassion or the means through which these can be experienced. This theoretical framework can be used empirically to research the extent to which people involved in place-based sustainability initiatives develop an ecological consciousness. Empirical research can then be used to further develop and anchor this framework, and seek the kind of practices that can evoke experiences of connection, cultivate the human ability for compassion and give space for creative living.

TI  - Direct observation of permafrost degradation and rapid soil carbon loss in tundra
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence suggests that 5-15% of the vast pool of soil carbon stored in northern permafrost ecosystems could be emitted as greenhouse gases by 2100 under the current path of global warming. However, direct measurements of changes in soil carbon remain scarce, largely because ground subsidence that occurs as the permafrost soils begin to thaw confounds the traditional quantification of carbon pools based on fixed depths or soil horizons. This issue is overcome when carbon is quantified in relation to a fixed ash content, which uses the relatively stable mineral component of soil as a metric for pool comparisons through time. We applied this approach to directly measure soil carbon pool changes over five years in experimentally warmed and ambient tundra ecosystems at a site in Alaska where permafrost is degrading due to climate change. We show a loss of soil carbon of 5.4% per year (95% confidence interval: 1.0, 9.5) across the site. Our results point to lateral hydrological export as a potential pathway for these surprisingly large losses. This research highlights the potential to make repeat soil carbon pool measurements at sentinel sites across the permafrost region, as this feedback to climate change may be occurring faster than previously thought.

TI  - Characterization of Forest Fires to Support Monitoring and Management of Mount Kenya Forest
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical analysis of wildfire frequency, intensity, size, season, and type helps to determine the fire regime and the impacts of human activity in a region. Information about the temporal and spatial distribution of forest fires can help guide the formulation of integrated fire management policies. Mt Kenya Forest provides ecosystem services that sustain the livelihoods of local communities. However, forest fires have negatively affected sustainability of these services. This study describes recent fire patterns in the Mt Kenya forest. Field observations recorded by the Kenya Forest Service from 1980 to 2015 are analyzed. In addition, trends in fire occurrence over time and in relation to vegetation type are described. Key findings evidence a fire-prone period in February and March and a decrease of total burned area during the study period. Bush and grassland were the most fire-prone vegetation, and the fire regime varied in each forest station. Further, field observations were compared with satellite data. Some discrepancies between the field and satellite fire data were observed, especially for larger fires. These findings confirm the importance of monitoring efforts by the Kenya Forest Service to inform wildfire management. Recommendations are made on ways to improve fire monitoring and fire suppression efforts.

TI  - The economic burden of oral squamous cell carcinoma in Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL PATHOLOGY & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The financial burden of treatment for oral squamous cell carcinoma in Australia has never been reported, and there is a paucity of international data. Here, we report the direct costs of treatment of surgically resectable oral cancer in a tertiary public hospital in Australia over a 15-year period. Materials and Methods Pathology department records, records of hospital attendance and hospital finance department records were interrogated to determine the direct costs of inpatient and outpatient treatment. Costs were adjusted using the total health price index so that all costs were equivalent to costings for the 2016/2017 financial year. Results A total of 113 cases were identified as suitable for inclusion. Complete inpatient and outpatient hospital attendance and costing data for treatment and subsequent 2-year follow-up was available for 29 cases. The average total cost over the 2-year period was $92 958AUD (median $102 722, range $11 662-$181 512). On average, 92.8% of costs were incurred in the first year post-diagnosis. Inpatient costs, outpatient costs and total costs increased with increasing pathological cancer stage. Both 1- and 2-year post-diagnosis overall cost for patients with Stage 4 oral cavity cancer were more than two times greater than for patients with Stage 1 oral cancer. Conclusion It is well documented that patients diagnosed at an earlier stage will have better survival outcomes, and it is assumed that the economic burden of their treatment will be less. We have shown that there is a direct correlation between cancer stage and cancer treatment cost. The findings provide clear economic support for oral cancer screening initiatives to detect earlier stage cancers, and the need to investigate novel techniques and technologies to detect oral squamous cell carcinoma early and reduce recurrence and mortality rates.

TI  - Experimenting with Mixtures of Water Ice and Dust as Analogues for Icy Planetary Material: Recipes from the Ice Laboratory at the University of Bern
T2  - SPACE SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Due to its abundance and unique properties, water is a major actor in the formation and evolution of many planetary surfaces as well as a sensitive and reliable tracer of past geologic and climatic processes. Water ice is found in variable abundance at the surfaces of many Solar System objects, from the floor of permanently shadowed craters at the poles of Mercury to large fractions of the surfaces of several trans-Neptunian objects. With few exceptions, water is not found in pure form but associated to contaminants of various nature and concentration. These associations and the nature of the mixing and segregation processes that affect and control them are key for our understanding of some of the most important aspects of planetary evolution processes. The observation and characterization of water ice at the surface of Solar System objects is therefore among the primary scientific objectives of many space missions. The quantitative interpretation of remote sensing data in terms of surface composition and physical properties requires the use of complex physical models that rely on experimental data in two different ways. First, the models require as inputs the fundamental properties of the pure materials, such as the optical or dielectric constant. Second, the models can only be fully tested if their results are confronted to actual measurements performed on samples whose complexity comes close to the one encountered on natural planetary surfaces but which are nevertheless well-enough characterized to serve as reference. Such measurements are challenging as macroscopic ice-rich samples prepared as analogues of icy planetary surfaces tend to be unstable, the ice component being prone to metamorphism and phase change. The questions of the reproducibility of the samples and the relevance of the measurements are therefore critical. The Ice Laboratory at the University of Bern has been set up in 2010 to overcome some of these difficulties. We have developed protocols to prepare, store, handle and characterize various associations of ice with mineral and organics contaminants as analogues of different types of icy Solar System surfaces. The aims of this article are to present the context and background for our investigations, describe these protocols and associated hardware in a comprehensive way, provide quantitative characterization of the samples obtained using these protocols and summarize the main results obtained so far by experimenting with these samples. The current state and possible future evolutions of this project are then discussed in the context of the next generation of space missions to visit icy objects in the Solar System and longer term perspectives on future observations of protoplanetary discs and exoplanetary systems.

TI  - Multidisciplinary team meeting and EUSOMA quality indicators in breast cancer care: A French regional multicenter study
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: We evaluate breast cancer (BC) pathway at a regional level including public, private and university institutions. We assessed the quality of multidisciplinary team meetings (MTM) and compliance with a panel of European high-quality indicators (EUSOMA QIs).Methods: We conducted a retrospective multicenter (n = 20) study in the largest health care region in France. Between January and April 2015, we included all patients discussed at an MTM after a diagnosis of BC (n = 619). We analyzed quality of MTM by assessing the quorum, the reliability of data transcription and the exhaustivity of pre-therapeutic MTM. We then analyzed the compliance with a selected panel of 16 EUSOMA QIs.Results: During MTM discussion, data were more than 95% consistent with medical records for 9/11 items. Pre-operative tumor histology (90.6%) and post-operative resection margins (84.3%) were the least concordant between medical records and MTM. Minimum standards as defined by EUSOMA were reached for 11/16 QIs, but not reached for pathology reports in non-invasive BC (78.2%), proportion of exclusive sentinel lymph node biopsies in patients with clinically negative axilla (85.2%), performing adjuvant chemotherapy (76.6%), and proportion of patients discussed in pre-therapeutic and postoperative MTM (63.5%).Conclusions: In this multicentric study evaluating the quality of BC care with a representative sample of institutions, compliance with EUSOMA indicators was satisfactory for all type of institutions. However, too few patients were discussed in pre-therapeutic MTM (especially in non-university hospitals 43.7% [39.4-48.1]) versus 88.7% for others [82.2-95.1]) and data transcription was likely responsible for up to 15% of discordance.

A1  - Sentinel Node Recurrent Breast
TI  - Low Risk of Development of a Regional Recurrence After an Unsuccessful Repeat Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients with Ipsilateral Breast Tumor Recurrence
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundUnlike sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in the primary setting, the repeat SLNB (rSLNB) in patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) is challenging, because it is difficult to visualize and/or harvest a sentinel lymph node in every patient. Regional treatments options and safety in terms of regional disease control after such an unsuccessful rSLNB remain unclear. This study assesses factors associated with the performance of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after unsuccessful rSLNB and evaluates the occurrence of regional recurrences.MethodsData were obtained from the Sentinel Node and Recurrent Breast Cancer (SNARB) study. In 239 patients, the rSLNB was unsuccessful, of whom 60 patients underwent ipsilateral ALND.ResultsA shorter time interval between primary treatment and IBTR, and a primary negative SLNB were significantly associated with a higher probability to be treated with ALND after unsuccessful rSLNB (P<0.001). The 5-year regional-recurrence rate was 0.0% in the ALND group compared with 3.7% in the group treated without ALND (P=0.113). Of the 179 patients treated without ALND, after a median follow-up of 5.1years (range 0.3-13.2), 7 (3.9%) developed a regional recurrence as first event after unsuccessful rSLNB. None of the seven recurrences occurred in the ipsilateral axilla. Univariable analysis showed no factors associated with regional recurrence as first event after unsuccessful rSLNB (P>0.05).ConclusionsThe present study demonstrates that the risk of regional recurrence in patients with an IBTR and an unsuccessful rSLNB is negligible, irrespective of the use of ALND. This suggests that there is no need for additional treatment of the axilla after an unsuccessful rSLNB.

T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Geospatial soil information is critical for agricultural policy formulation and decision making, land-use suitability analysis, sustainable soil management, environmental assessment, and other research topics that are of vital importance to agriculture and economy. Proximal and Remote sensing technologies enables us to collect, process, and analyze spectral data and to retrieve, synthesize, visualize valuable geospatial information for multi-disciplinary uses. We obtained the soil class map provided in this article by processing and analyzing proximal and remote sensed data from soil samples collected in toposequences based on pedomorphogeological relashionships. The soils were classified up to the second categorical level (suborder) of the Brazilian Soil Classification System (SiBCS), as well as in the World Reference Base (WRB) and United States Soil Taxonomy (ST) systems. The raster map has 30 m resolution and its accuracy is 73% (Kappa coefficient of 0.73). The soil legend represents a soil class followed by its topsoil color. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - On the use of Sentinel-2 for coastal habitat mapping and satellite-derived bathymetry estimation using downscaled coastal aerosol band
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal habitats provide a plethora of ecosystem services, yet they undergo continuous pressure and degradation due to the human-induced climate change. Conservation and management imply continuous monitoring and mapping of their spatial distribution at first. The present study explores the capabilities of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission and the contribution of its coastal aerosol band 1 (443 nm) for the mapping of the dominant Mediterranean coastal marine habitats and the bathymetry in three survey sites in the East Mediterranean. The selected sites have shallow to deep habitats and a high variability of oceanographic and seabed morphological conditions. The major findings of our study demonstrate the advantages of the downscaled Sentinel-2 coastal aerosol band 1 for both optically shallow habitat and satellite-derived bathymetry mapping due to its great water penetration. The use of Sentinel-2 band 1 allows detection of Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds down to 32.2 m of depth. Sentinel-2 constellation with its 10-m spatial resolution at most of the spectral bands, 5-day revisit frequency and open data policy can be an important tool to provide crucial missing information on the spatial distribution of coastal habitats and on their bathymetry distribution, especially in data-poor and/or remote areas with large gaps in a retrospective, rapid and non-intrusive manner. As such, it becomes a crucial ally for the conservation and management of coastal habitats globally.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Land Use/Land Cover Changes in an Ecologically Fragile AreaAlappuzha District, Southern Kerala, India
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Concomitant with careless human interference in the delicate environmental balance, the Earth's surface is witnessing a variety of changes in land use and land cover (LULC). Acquisition of a sound understanding of LULC is an important aspect of maintaining a sustainable, benign, healthy environment. The present work highlights a spatiotemporal study on the LULC features of Alappuzha District, an ecologically fragile area in southern Kerala, a state in South India. The study area faces diverse environmental challenges including decline of landforms, rising sea levels, population expansion and anthropogenic encroachments on the ecological balance. This investigation compiles an audited account of the modifications, in each class of LULC, using geospatial technologies. We interpreted satellite imagery from the Landsat 8 and the Landsat multispectral scanner for the years 1973 and 2017. The LULC aspects were categorized into seven classes: waterbody, waterlogged area, mixed vegetation, built-up land, uncultivated area, paddy field and sandy area. Our findings affirm that the expansiveness of the built-up land area is directly proportional to the growth of the population. Advanced technologies such as remote sensing and geographic information system accentuate alterations in land use patterns over time and the extent to which the changes affect the human population and the natural habitat. We verified the results of our research by assessment of accuracy and ground truth confirmation of the LULC features.

TI  - A Data-Adaptive EOF-Based Method for Displacement Signal Retrieval From InSAR Displacement Measurement Time Series for Decorrelating Targets
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a data-adaptive method, namely, principal modes (PM) method, based on the spatially averaged temporal covariance of a time series of InSAR displacement measurement obtained from consecutive SAR acquisitions is proposed to retrieve the displacement signal for decorrelating targets. On wrapped interferogram time series, the PM method can highlight and restore coherent fringe patterns where they are more or less significantly hindered by decorrelation noise, whereas on unwrapped interferogram time series, the PMmethod provides a satisfactory separation of the displacement signal from the spatially correlated perturbations. A two-stage application of the PM method to both wrapped and unwrapped interferogram time series can significantly improve the retrieval of the displacement signal. Synthetic simulations are first performed to investigate the impact of the choice of the appropriate number of modes to retain in the empirical orthogonal function decomposition and of the time series size on the performance of the PM method, as well as to highlight the efficiency of the PM method. Then, the PM method is applied to time series of wrapped and unwrapped Sentinel 1 A/B interferograms over the Gorner glacier between October 2016 and April 2017. The main characteristics of the PM method, such as realistic assumptions, ease of implementation, and high efficiency, are highlighted.

TI  - Epidemiological burden of meningococcal disease in Latin America: A systematic literature review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the epidemiological profile of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), meningococcal meningitis, and Neisseria meningitidis carriers in Latin America.Methods: A systematic review was conducted to identify and analyze studies published in 2008-2018. Incidence rates, case fatality rates (CFRs), and the relative distribution of cases per serogroup by country were assessed.Results: Meningococcal surveillance in Latin America differs among countries, and most systems are based on passive sentinel surveillance. Thirty-nine studies were selected. In 2006, the incidence rate of IMD per 100 000 inhabitants was highest in Brazil (1.9), followed by Uruguay (1.3), Chile (0.8), Argentina (0.7), Colombia and Venezuela (0.3 each), and Mexico (0.06). Brazil reported the highest CFR (20%), followed by Uruguay (15%), Chile (11%), and Venezuela and Argentina (10% each). In 2012, the CFR in Chile increased to approximately 27%. The most frequent serogroups among IMD cases were C in Brazil (2007-2010) and Mexico (2005-2016), W in Chile (2012-2018), and B in Argentina (2012-2015). However, the true burden of IMD in Latin America is probably underestimated due to underreporting of cases.Conclusions: Improvements in IMD notification, IMD registration, national surveillance programs (including active surveillance systems), diagnostic tools, and characterization of isolates may better elucidate the true epidemiological burden of IMD in Latin America.

TI  - Retrieval of Wintertime Sea Ice Production in Arctic Polynyas Using Thermal Infrared and Passive Microwave Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise knowledge of wintertime sea ice production in Arctic polynyas is not only required to enhance our understanding of atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions but also to verify frequently utilized climate and ocean models. Here, a high-resolution (2-km) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal infrared satellite data set featuring spatial and temporal characteristics of 17 Arctic polynya regions for the winter seasons 2002/2003 to 2017/2018 is directly compared to an akin low-resolution Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) passive microwave data set for 2002/2003 to 2010/2011. The MODIS data set is purely based on a 1-D energy-balance model, where thin-ice thicknesses (<= 20 cm) are directly derived from ice-surface temperature swath data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis-Interim atmospheric reanalysis data on a quasi-daily basis. Thin-ice thicknesses in the AMSR-E data set are derived empirically. Important polynya properties such as areal extent and potential thermodynamic ice production can be estimated from both pan-Arctic data sets. Although independently derived, our results show that both data sets feature quite similar spatial and temporal variations of polynya area (POLA) and ice production (IP), which suggests a high reliability. The average POLA (average accumulated IP) for all Arctic polynyas combined derived from both MODIS and AMSR-E are 1.99x10(5) km(2) (1.34x10(3) km(3)) and 2.29x10(5) km(2) (1.31x10(3) km(3)), respectively. Narrow polynyas in areas such as the Canadian Arctic Archipelago are notably better resolved by MODIS. Analysis of 16 winter seasons provides an evaluation of long-term trends in POLA and IP, revealing the significant increase of ice formation in polynyas along the Siberian coast.Plain Language Summary The term "polynya" essentially describes the appearance of "holes" in an otherwise closed sea ice cover, that are kept free of thick sea ice due to strong physical forcing mechanisms such as wind or warmer ocean temperatures. The size of such a polynya can sometimes exceed several tens of thousands of square kilometers, indicating a high physical and biological importance. The contrast between the relatively warm ocean and the cold atmosphere creates a flow of heat to the atmosphere that causes intense freezing at the ocean surface. Gaining a more detailed knowledge about the total amount of new sea ice that is formed in these polynyas during the Arctic winter is highly important to understand the large-scale characteristics of the Arctic sea ice cover. Using different kinds of satellite data, this study follows the aim to analyze the difference in Arctic-wide polynya monitoring between two independent and previously published data sets. Our results show that both data sets show highly similar estimations of polynya size and new sea ice production, with the overall Arctic-wide difference being in the range of 2-15%. The results of this study enhance the confidence when using the data sets for other applications and when analyzing long-term developments and trends of Arctic polynyas.

TI  - Assessment of High-standard Farmland Construction Effectiveness in Liaoning Province During 2011-2015
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, the large-scale construction of high-standard farmland in China has improved the quality of cropland and crop production and enhanced the eco-environmental security. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of high-standard farmland construction in Liaoning Province of China during the 12th five-year period (2011-2015), through on-the-spot investigations and remote sensing monitoring, this study assessed the construction effectiveness of ten typical sampling projects in Liaoning Province and then presented practical suggestions. The main conclusions were as follows. 1) The ranges of increase in productivity of the ten sampling projects in Liaoning Province all surpassed the goal of 1500 kg/ha. 2) Among all sampling project areas, the levels of productivity stability of nine sampling projects were higher than that of the surrounding farmland in a severe drought year. However, the productivity stability of the high-standard farmland construction project in Faku County, Yiniupu Town, declined by 1.04% compared with the surrounding farmland. 3) Except for the high-standard farmland construction project in Dengta City, Dengta Irrigation Region, the productivity uniformity of the other nine sampling projects increased by 3.30%-88.10%. 4) Eight of the ten sampling projects belonged to Class 1, and two projects belonged to Class 2, showing that the effectiveness of high-standard farmland construction in Liaoning Province was quite good. There were some suggestions for high-standard farmland construction in the future. All departments should strengthen cooperation and formulate corresponding protection and development strategies suitable for local conditions. Additionally, lasting management mechanisms should also be established. Using remote sensing monitoring to assess the high-standard farmland construction effectiveness during the 12th five-year period could provide experience and decision-making support for high-standard farmland construction in the future.

TI  - Evaluating seasonal effect on forest leaf area index mapping using multi-seasonal high resolution satellite pleiades imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest canopy leaf area index (LAI) is an important structural variable directly affecting functions and structures of terrestrial plant ecosystems. Optical remote sensing techniques may provide an alternative in estimating and mapping plant LAI. However, existing studies on using very high resolution (VHR) multitemporal satellite imagery to map and investigate the seasonal effect on plant LAI at a landscape scale are rare. In this study, we proposed to map and analyze forest LAI using four seasonal Pleiades images and corresponding in situ seasonal LAI measurements collected over a natural forest area in the City of Tampa, Florida, USA. A subset of selected spectral/textural features was used to develop pixel-based seasonal LAI regression models through a two-step feature selection procedure and a canonical correlation analysis. Finally, seasonal changes of the mapped LAIs were analyzed and assessed. Several interesting experimental results were created through this study, including: (i) a set of optimal texture parameters for extracting the 1st- and 2nd-order grey level statistical textures from the Pleiades imagery was determined as a window size 5 x 5, a direction 90 degrees and pixel displacement 4 pixels; (ii) textural features were more important than spectral features in estimating and mapping forest LAI, and red band has a higher power in mapping forest LAI than other three multispectral bands; (iii) the late spring Pleiades image resulted in the highest accuracy for estimating and mapping forest LAI; and (iv) there exists a significant seasonal change of forest LAI in the study area and the seasonal effect on forest LAI mapping can be assessed by using the multi-seasonal VHR satellite imagery at a landscape scale. A novel significance for this study is that it is the first time using both spectral and textural information extracted from the multi-seasonal VHR satellite images to assess the seasonal effect on forest LAI mapping at a landscape scale. Since the experimental results and findings were derived from a relatively small study area, further testing and validation work is needed over different forest ecosystems at a landscape scale.

TI  - Impacts of climate change and human factors on land cover change in inland mountain protected areas: a case study of the Qilian Mountain National Nature Reserve in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past few decades, natural reserves have been affected by both climate change and human activities, and their land cover has changed dramatically, especially in mountain reserves, which are more sensitive to climate change and human activities. This paper used long-term Landsat and MODIS NDVI remote sensing data to monitor the changes of land cover and vegetation conditions in the Qilian Mountain National Nature Reserve (QMNNR) in China from 1975 to 2015, and analysed the impacts of climate change and human activities in combination with meteorological and socioeconomic data. The results show that the land cover structure of the QMNNR has remained stable over the past 40years, but the total area of natural vegetation has decreased by 49.55km(2), the artificial surface and cropland has expanded by 13.68 and 32.57km(2) in some areas, respectively, and the glacier has retreated by 33.34km(2) as a whole. The warming and humidification trend of the climate is the leading factor for glacial retreat and the improvement of the overall vegetation condition, while population growth and economic benefits lead to the expansion of cropland and artificial surfaces in some areas, thus causing the reduction of 18.80 and 28.30km(2) in shrubland and grassland. This study proves that the system of protected areas plays a key role in maintaining the stability of the ecosystem structure and that reducing the population density around the protected areas and changing the mode of economic development can effectively reduce the intensity of human interference. Under the background of climate warming, the change of the ecosystem function in mountain protected areas is full of uncertainty, so management and protection strategies need to be studied in depth.

TI  - Improved estimates of forest cover and loss in the Brazilian Amazon in 2000-2017
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The data, information and knowledge on the tropical forest area and its dynamics in the Brazilian Amazon remain contentious. We use time-series satellite images to quantify annual forest area, loss and gain in the Brazilian Amazon during 2000-2017. We find that forest area was -15% higher than the estimate by the official Brazilian forest dataset (PRODES), but annual forest-loss rates were twice the PRODES estimates (-0.027 x 10(6) km(2) yr(-1) during 2001-2016). Forest-loss rates increased again after 2013. The El Nino and drought year (2015/2016) drove large forest area loss. The cumulative forest-loss area within the protected areas (which include -50% of forests in the region) was -11% of the total forest-loss area, which highlights the roles of protected areas in forest conservation.

TI  - Local climate zone-based urban land cover classification from multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 images with a recurrent residual network
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The local climate zone (LCZ) scheme was originally proposed to provide an interdisciplinary taxonomy for urban heat island (UHI) studies. In recent years, the scheme has also become a starting point for the development of higher-level products, as the LCZ classes can help provide a generalized understanding of urban structures and land uses. LCZ mapping can therefore theoretically aid in fostering a better understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics of cities on a global scale. However, reliable LCZ maps are not yet available globally. As a first step toward automatic LCZ mapping, this work focuses on LCZ-derived land cover classification, using multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 images. We propose a recurrent residual network (Re-ResNet) architecture that is capable of learning a joint spectral-spatial-temporal feature representation within a unitized framework. To this end, a residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) are combined into one end-to-end architecture. The ResNet is able to learn rich spectral-spatial feature representations from single-seasonal imagery, while the RNN can effectively analyze temporal dependencies of multi-seasonal imagery. Cross validations were carried out on a diverse dataset covering seven distinct European cities, and a quantitative analysis of the experimental results revealed that the combined use of the multi-temporal information and Re-ResNet results in an improvement of approximately 7 percent points in overall accuracy. The proposed framework has the potential to produce consistent-quality urban land cover and LCZ maps on a large scale, to support scientific progress in fields such as urban geography and urban climatology.

TI  - Effect of vegetation index choice on soil moisture retrievals via the synergistic use of synthetic aperture radar and optical remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent launch of the Sentinel-1 A and Sentinel-1B synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite constellation has provided high-quality SAR data with fine spatial and temporal sampling characterizations (6(similar to)12 revisit days at 10 m spatial resolution). When combined with high-resolution optical remote sensing, this data can potentially be used for high-resolution soil moisture retrieval over vegetated areas. However, the suitability of different vegetation index (VI) types for the parameterization of vegetation water content in SAR vegetation scattering models requires further investigation. In this study, the widely-used physical-based Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) is coupled with the Water Cloud Model (WCM) for the retrieval of field-scale soil moisture. Three different VIs (NDVI, EVI, and LAI) produced by two different satellite sensors (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat) are selected to examine their impact on the parameterization of vegetation water content, and subsequently, on soil moisture retrieval accuracy. Results indicate that, despite the different sensitivity of estimated surface roughness parameters to various VIs (i.e., this sensitivity is highest when utilizing MODIS EVI and lowest in the LAI-based model), the optimum roughness parameters derived from each VI exhibit no discernible difference. Consequently, the soil moisture retrieval accuracies show no noticeable sensitivity to the choice of a particular VI. Generally, meadow and grassland sites with small differences in VIderived roughness parameters exhibit good performance in soil moisture estimation. With respect to the relative components in the coupled model, the vegetative contribution to the scattering signal exceeds that of soil at VI about 0.6 similar to 0.8 [-] in NDVI-based models and 0.4 similar to 0.6 [-] in EVI-based models. This study provides insight into the proper selection of vegetation indices during the use of SAR and optical imagery for the retrieval of high-resolution surface soil moisture.

TI  - Paediatric malignant melanoma in Ireland: A population study and review of the literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Malignant melanoma is increasing in frequency worldwide; however, this disease is rare in children. As large-scale studies on paediatric melanoma are lacking, management is currently often based upon the understanding of the disease process in adults. The aim of this study was to characterise cases of paediatric melanoma diagnosed in the Republic of Ireland over a 21-year period.Methods: This was a retrospective, multicentre study using national data provided by the National Cancer Registry of Ireland and individual practitioners.Results: Twenty-four cases of melanoma treated in 11 different centres were included in the study. The median patient age at diagnosis was 15 years. The majority of cases arose on the limbs. The median Breslow thickness in patients of the pre-pubertal age group was 8.25 mm, while in children more than 13 years, it was 1.65 mm. Eight patients had disease recurrence and five patients died.Conclusion: The diagnosis of melanoma remains rare in children. This study contributes to our current understanding of malignant melanoma in paediatric patients; however, further investigation of the disease characteristics in this group is necessary to achieve optimal management of these cases and therefore improve outcomes.

TI  - A PCA-Based Framework for Determining Remotely Sensed Geological Surface Orientations and Their Statistical Quality
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The orientations of planar rock layers are fundamental to our understanding of structural geology and stratigraphy. Remote sensing platforms including satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, and Light Detection and Ranging scanners are increasingly used to build three-dimensional models of structural features on Earth and other planets. Remotely gathered orientation measurements are straightforward to calculate but subject to uncertainty inherited from input data, differences in viewing geometry, and the plane-fitting process, complicating geological interpretation. Here, we improve upon the present state of the art by developing a generalized means for computing and reporting errors in strike-dip measurements from remotely sensed data. We outline a general framework for representing the error space of uncertain orientations in Cartesian and spherical coordinates and develop a principal component analysis (PCA) regression method, which captures statistical errors independent of viewing geometry and input data structure. We also introduce graphical techniques to visualize the uniqueness and quality of orientation measurements and a process to increase statistical power by jointly fitting bedding planes under the assumption of parallel stratigraphy. These new techniques are validated by comparison of field-gathered orientation measurements with those derived from minimally processed satellite imagery of the San Rafael Swell, Utah, and unmanned aerial vehicle imagery from the Naukluft Mountains, Namibia. We provide software packages supporting planar fitting and visualization of error distributions. This method increases the precision and comparability of structural measurements gathered using a new generation of remote sensing techniques.

TI  - Sampling Methods for Adventive <i>Trissolcus japonicus</i> (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) in a Wild Tree Host of <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is an invasive pest that has established in much of the United States. Adventive populations of an effective Asian egg parasitoid of H. halys, Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae), have been detected in several states, including Virginia, and its geographic range is expanding. Documenting changes in its distribution and abundance have thus become key research priorities. For these specific purposes, surveillance of T. japonicus over large geographic areas using sentinel H. halys egg masses may not be optimally efficient, and examination of alternative sampling tactics is warranted. In 2016, sentinel H. halys egg masses were deployed as vertical transects in the canopy of female Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle (Sapindales: Simaroubaceae) in Virginia. A brief follow-up study in 2016 using yellow sticky traps deployed in the same trees yielded captures of T. japonicus, leading to a comparison of vertical transects of sentinel eggs and yellow sticky traps in 2017. Both methods yielded T. japonicus detections only in the middle and upper tree canopies, whereas other known H. halys parasitoids were detected in the lower, middle, or upper canopies. Based on this information, a method for deploying yellow sticky traps in the middle canopy of H. halys host trees was assessed in 2017, yielding T. japonicus captures. A comparison of estimated time inputs revealed that traps were more efficient than sentinel eggs in this regard. Results are discussed in relation to the utility of each sampling method to address specific questions about the range expansion and ecology of T. japonicus.

TI  - Vegetation and Soil Fire Damage Analysis Based on Species Distribution Modeling Trained with Multispectral Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest managers demand reliable tools to evaluate post-fire vegetation and soil damage. In this study, we quantify wildfire damage to vegetation and soil based on the analysis of burn severity, using multitemporal and multispectral satellite data and species distribution models, particularly maximum entropy (MaxEnt). We studied a mega-wildfire (9000 ha burned) in North-Western Spain, which occurred from 21 to 27 August 2017. Burn severity was measured in the field using the composite burn index (CBI). Burn severity of vegetation and soil layers (CBIveg and CBIsoil) was also differentiated. MaxEnt provided the relative contribution of each pre-fire and post-fire input variable on low, moderate and high burn severity levels, as well as on all severity levels combined (burned area). In addition, it built continuous suitability surfaces from which the burned surface area and burn severity maps were built. The burned area map achieved a high accuracy level (kappa = 0.85), but slightly lower accuracy when differentiating the three burn severity classes (kappa = 0.81). When the burn severity map was validated using field CBIveg and CBIsoil values we reached lower kappa statistic values (0.76 and 0.63, respectively). This study revealed the effectiveness of the proposed multi-temporal MaxEnt based method to map fire damage accurately in Mediterranean ecosystems, providing key information to forest managers.

TI  - Lymphadenectomy in elderly patients with high-intermediate-risk, high-risk or advanced endometrial cancer: Time to move from personalized cancer medicine to personalized patient medicine!
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy are recommended for women with high-intermediate, high-risk and advanced endometrial cancer (EC). Lymphadenectomy is less frequently performed in elderly patients than in younger patients. We examined the survival of elderly women diagnosed with high-risk EC according to whether lymphadenectomy was performed or not.Methods: We selected women over 70 years with high-intermediate risk, high-risk or advanced EC from a multicenter retrospective cohort of women diagnosed between 2001 and 2013. Multivariate logistic regression models and Cox proportional hazards survival methods for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were used for analyses.Results: 71 women had lymphadenectomy and were compared with the 213 who did not. Recurrence was similar in both groups (42% vs 33%, respectively, p = 0.17) but more deaths were reported in the group without lymphadenectomy (38% vs 23%, respectively, p < 0.001). There was no difference in adjuvant treatment in the two groups (17% vs 27%, respectively, p = 0.27). Elderly patients without lymphadenectomy had lower 3-year DFS (56% vs 71%, p = 0.076), CSS (67% vs 85%, p < 0.001) and OS (50% vs 71% p < 0.001). The Cox proportional hazard models showed independently poorer prognosis in women without lymphadenectomy (3.027, 95% CI 1.58-5.81, p < 0.001), histology type 2 (3.46, 95% CI 1.51-7.97, p = 0.003) and lymphovascular space involvement (3.47, 95% CI 1.35-8.98, p = 0.01) on 3-year CSS.Conclusion: No lymphadenectomy in elderly patients with high-risk or advanced EC is independently associated with poorer prognosis. Elderly patients with EC should benefit from lymphadenectomy when indicated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd, BASO similar to The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - Classification of cities in Bangladesh based on remote sensing derived spatial characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Bangladesh, cities are conventionally classified based on population size and revenue collection. This conventional city classification system neglects the spatial characteristics inherit in cities. Providing a more comprehensive city classification system is essential for the country's future budget allocation and infrastructure development. Five spatial features: city size (area), urban form (AWMPFD), the ratio of built-up and non-built-up areas, urban growth rate, and total night lights intensity for 331 cities of Bangladesh are derived from remote sensing data. This study classifies these cities into six classes using a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on five selected spatial characteristics. The six categories are named for their levels of spatial development, with Cluster 1 being the highest level and Cluster 6 being the lowest level. The share of employment in the primary sector (agriculture) gradually rises from Cluster 1 to Cluster 6. In contrast, the employment share of the service sector follows a reverse trend from Cluster 2 to Cluster 6. Both per capita income and expenditure is higher for the large cities of Cluster 2 than for the metropolitans of Cluster 1. Comparisons across the six classes with non-spatial attributes validate the classification system. Findings also reveal that remote sensing derived spatial information can explain non-spatial characteristics of cities. Therefore, remote sensing derived spatial attributes of cities can be used for city classification where census data are scarce.

TI  - Multi-Hazard Exposure Mapping Using Machine Learning Techniques: A Case Study from Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountainous areas are highly prone to a variety of nature-triggered disasters, which often cause disabling harm, death, destruction, and damage. In this work, an attempt was made to develop an accurate multi-hazard exposure map for a mountainous area (Asara watershed, Iran), based on state-of-the art machine learning techniques. Hazard modeling for avalanches, rockfalls, and floods was performed using three state-of-the-art models-support vector machine (SVM), boosted regression tree (BRT), and generalized additive model (GAM). Topo-hydrological and geo-environmental factors were used as predictors in the models. A flood dataset (n = 133 flood events) was applied, which had been prepared using Sentinel-1-based processing and ground-based information. In addition, snow avalanche (n = 58) and rockfall (n = 101) data sets were used. The data set of each hazard type was randomly divided to two groups: Training (70%) and validation (30%). Model performance was evaluated by the true skill score (TSS) and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) criteria. Using an exposure map, the multi-hazard map was converted into a multi-hazard exposure map. According to both validation methods, the SVM model showed the highest accuracy for avalanches (AUC = 92.4%, TSS = 0.72) and rockfalls (AUC = 93.7%, TSS = 0.81), while BRT demonstrated the best performance for flood hazards (AUC = 94.2%, TSS = 0.80). Overall, multi-hazard exposure modeling revealed that valleys and areas close to the Chalous Road, one of the most important roads in Iran, were associated with high and very high levels of risk. The proposed multi-hazard exposure framework can be helpful in supporting decision making on mountain social-ecological systems facing multiple hazards.

TI  - Aerosol Radiative Forcing Estimation over a Remote High-altitude Location (∼4900 masl) near Yala Glacier, Nepal
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, we estimated the aerosol radiative forcing and heating rates near Yala Glacier, Nepal (28.21 degrees N, 85.61 degrees E; 4900 masl), using in situ black carbon (BC) mass concentration measurements, satellite data sets, and model simulations. The real-time ambient BC mass concentration was continuously measured using an Aethalometer (AE-33) from October 2016 to May 2017. The Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (OPAC) model was used to simulate the aerosol optical properties in conjunction with the in situ measurements and satellite data sets. Outputs from OPAC and the satellite data sets were used as inputs for the Santa Barbara Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model to estimate the radiative forcing. The in situ measurements showed that the BC mass concentration peaked during the pre-monsoon season (707.9 +/- 541.8 ng m(-3)), which was corroborated by the higher aerosol optical depth (AOD) values during this season (0.058 +/- 0.002). The diurnal cycle of the BC mass concentration exhibited a night-time low and afternoon high, which were influenced by the boundary layer dynamics and valley wind flow pattern. The Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) analysis indicated diverse source regions, including northern Asia, the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), and parts of Nepal and Bangladesh. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived AOD and Angstrom exponent (AE), and the OPAC-simulated single-scattering albedo (SSA) and asymmetry parameter (AP) over the study site were estimated to be 0.048 +/- 0.009 and 1.32 +/- 0.01, and 0.938 +/- 0.019 and 0.710 +/- 0.042, respectively, during the study period. The mean radiative forcing during the study period for the top of the atmosphere, surface and atmosphere were 3.4, -0.5 and 3.9 W m(-2), respectively. Higher atmospheric forcing was observed in the pre-monsoon season, leading to changes in the heating rates.

TI  - DEVELOPMENT OF DROUGHT RISK ANALYSIS PLATFORM USING MULTIPLE SATELLITE SENSORS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought, due to climate change, has in recent years become more severe. Capability to monitor drought conditions and to assess drought risk is essential to the development of an effective drought adaptation plan, especially for an agricultural country like Thailand. Current drought monitoring is provided by separate indices such as Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Soil Moisture Index (SMI) and Moisture Available Index (MAI), calculated from weather station datasets which are not easily comprehensible to users. This research develops a countrywide integrated satellite-based drought model consisting of three parameters: accumulated estimated rainfall generated from FY-2E satellite data, the difference in Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) generated from MODIS. A simple drought hazard is introduced as a multiple linear regression model (R-2=0.795) of these satellite products, calibrated with daily soil moisture measurements in 2015. Consequently, drought conditions are represented by the Drought Hazard Index (DHI) whose assigned integer values are from -3 (extremely dry) to +3 (extremely wet), according to the defined thresholds (presently at 0.05, 0.15, 0.30, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.95) of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of drought hazard values. The model is validated with 426 countrywide drought situations announced by the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM), during the drought season of 2016, yielding a 0.96 probability of detection. Subsequently, the model outputs are processed with relevant GIS data, which are agricultural and irrigation areas to represent drought exposure and vulnerability respectively, to generate a drought risk map for further analysis and planning. This platform can benefit not only policymakers but also the farmers themselves.

TI  - Spatial Forecasting of the Landscape in Rapidly Urbanizing Hill Stations of South Asia: A Case Study of Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka (1996-2037)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting landscape changes is vital for developing and implementing sustainable urban planning. Presently, apart from lowland coastal cities, mountain cities (i.e., hill stations) are also facing the negative impacts of rapid urbanization due to their economic and social importance. However, few studies are addressing urban landscape changes in hill stations in Asia. This study aims to examine and forecast landscape changes in the rapidly urbanizing hill station of Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka. Landsat data and geospatial techniques including support vector machines, urban-rural gradient, and statistical analysis were used to map and examine the land use/land cover (LULC) change in Nuwara Eliya during the 1996-2006 and 2006-2017 periods. The multilayer perceptron neural network-Markov model was applied to simulate future LULC changes for 2027 and 2037. The results show that Nuwara Eliya has been directly affected by rapid urban development. During the past 21 years (1996-2017), built-up areas increased by 1791 ha while agricultural land declined by 1919 ha due to augmented urban development pressure. The pressure of urban development on forest land has been relatively low, mainly due to strict conservation government policies. The results further show that the observed landscape changes will continue in a similar pattern in the future, confirming a significant increase and decrease of built-up and agricultural land, respectively, from 2017 to 2037. The changes in agricultural land exhibit a strong negative relationship with the changes in built-up land along the urban-rural gradient (R-2 were 0.86 in 1996-2006, and 0.93 in 2006-2017, respectively). The observed LULC changes could negatively affect the production of unique upcountry agricultural products such as exotic vegetables, fruits, cut flowers, and world-famous Ceylon tea. Further, unplanned development could cause several environmental issues. The study is important for understanding future LULC changes and suggesting necessary remedial measures to minimize possible undesirable environmental and socioeconomic impacts.

TI  - Supervised cross-fusion method: a new triplet approach to fuse thermal, radar, and optical satellite data for land use classification
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a new fusion method namely supervised cross-fusion method to improve the capability of fused thermal, radar, and optical images for classification. The proposed cross-fusion method is a combination of pixel-based and supervised feature-based fusion of thermal, radar, and optical data. The pixel-based fusion was applied to fuse optical data of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8. According to correlation coefficient (CR) and signal to noise ratio (SNR), among the used pixel-based fusion methods, wavelet obtained the best results for fusion. Considering spectral and spatial information preservation, CR of the wavelet method is 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. The supervised feature-based fusion method is a fusion of best output of pixel-based fusion level, land surface temperature (LST) data, and Sentinel-1 radar image using a supervised approach. The supervised approach is a supervised feature selection and learning of the inputs based on linear discriminant analysis and sparse regularization (LDASR) algorithm. In the present study, the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was utilized for feature extraction. A comparison of the obtained results with state of the art fusion method indicated a higher accuracy of our proposed method of classification. The rotation forest (RoF) classification results improvement was 25% and the support vector machine (SVM) results improvement was 31%. The results showed that the proposed method is well classified and separated four main classes of settlements, barren land, river, river bank, and even the bridges over the river. Also, a number of unclassified pixels by SVM are very low compared to other classification methods and can be neglected. The study results showed that LST calculated using thermal data has had positive effects on improving the classification results. By comparing the results of supervised cross-fusion without using LST data to the proposed method results, SVM and RoF classifiers showed 38% and 7% of classification improvement, respectively.

TI  - Paddy acreage mapping and yield prediction using sentinel-based optical and SAR data in Sahibganj district, Jharkhand (India)
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is an important staple food for the billions of world population. Mapping the spatial distribution of paddy and predicting yields are crucial for food security measures. Over the last three decades, remote sensing techniques have been widely used for monitoring and management of agricultural systems. This study has employed Sentinel-based both optical (Sentinel-2B) and SAR (Sentinel-1A) sensors data for paddy acreage mapping in Sahibganj district, Jharkhand during the monsoon season in 2017. A robust machine learning Random Forest (RF) classification technique was deployed for the paddy acreage mapping. A simple linear regression yield model was developed for predicting yields. The key findings showed that the paddy acreage was about 68.3-77.8 thousand hectares based on Sentinel-1A and 2B satellite data, respectively. Accordingly, the paddy production of the district was estimated as 108-126 thousand tonnes. The paddy yield was predicted as 1.60tonnes/hectare. The spatial distribution of paddy based on RF classifier and accuracy assessment of LULC maps revealed that the SAR-based classified paddy map was more consistent than the optical data. Nevertheless, this comprehensive study concluded that the SAR data could be more pronounced in acreage mapping and yield estimation for providing timely information to decision makers.

TI  - High-resolution earth observation data for assessing the impact of land system changes on wetland health in Kashmir Himalaya, India
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands in Kashmir are showing myriad signs of deterioration. In the present study, we assessed the spatio-temporal variations in the land use land cover of a semi-urban Narkara wetland, Kashmir, using high-resolution satellite data of 1965, 1980, and 2016. We also analyzed the impact of land system changes on the health Narkara wetland by estimating soil loss in the catchment of Narkara wetland using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) in GIS during the observation period. The land system changes indicated a massive increase of 2663% in built-up area, while the area under agriculture showed 78% decrease between 1965 and 2016. Small insignificant changes were manifest in other land cover types as well. The soil erosion estimates for the wetland catchment for 1965, 1980, and 2016 indicate 106.33tha(-1) soil detachment for 1965, 120.21tha(-1) for 1980, and 62.16tha(-1) for 2016. This significant reduction in the soil erosion is attributed to the barren lands and agriculture being taken over by built-up area between 1980 and 2016. The reckless urbanization both within Narkara and its catchment not only affects the hydrology and ecology of this important semi-urban wetland but also increases vulnerability of people to flooding in this part of Himalaya.

TI  - Quantifying Vertical Deformation in the Tigris-Euphrates Basin Due to the Groundwater Abstraction: Insights from GRACE and Sentinel-1 Satellites
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the occurrences of land subsidence in response to dropping groundwater levels in the central part of the Tigris-Euphrates basin. We estimated the groundwater depletion related to human and climate drivers between 2003 and 2017 based on estimates from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and two global hydrological models (NOAH-3.3 and WGHM-2.2d). The cumulative displacement was calculated using Small Baseline Subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) for 96 interferograms, which were generated by 31 images acquired by the Sentinel-1 satellite. The results show that the basin is experiencing a decline in groundwater storage at a rate of -7.56 km(3)/year with a total loss of 106.81 km(3). This depletion rate has led to inelastic compaction and has resulted in subsidence near the city of Baghdad at a rate of -10 mm/year. The measured coherence phase between the two signals is similar to 0.67, and the depletion precedes the subsidence by similar to 1.5 months. The new data from GRACE-Follow on, Sentinel-1, and the piezometric water level could help to constrain the rate of depletion and displacements in the basin. Combining these remote sensing techniques provides an independent tool for water management in areas where in-situ data are scarce.

TI  - Synergetic methodology for estimation of soil moisture over agricultural area using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about the accurate soil moisture is crucial for agriculture. In the present work the Landsat-8, Sentinel-1 satellite data and Modified Water Cloud Model (MWCM) have been used to retrieve soil moisture from an agriculture area. The effect of crop canopy was incoporated in MWCM. The crop coverage was mapped from LANDSAT-8. Further, an account of the V-1 and V-2 vegetation and crop canopy's primary and secondary descriptor were also estimated, respectively. Afterwards, a retrieval scheme of soil moisture was developed using dual polarizations (VH (Vertical characteristics signal send by radar/sensor, Horizontal characteristics signal received by radar/sensor) and VV (Vertical characteristics signal send by radar/sensor, Vertical characteristics signal received by radar/sensor)) available from the quad polarization of Sentinel-1 data. The model based soil moisture was compared with the observed soil moisture obtained from calibrated Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR). The model performance was evaluated with the help of statistical tests. The statistical tests result shows a good correlation between observed and estimated soil moisture (R-2 = 0.86, 0.96, and 0.91, RMSE= 0.06, 0.03, and 0.02, RMSE% =2.0, 1.9, and 1.5) for different dates as: 17 January, 6 March and 15 April-2018, respectively. Therefore, this method has an operational potential for estimating soil moisture from area under crop.

TI  - The Effect of Droughts on Vegetation Condition in Germany: An Analysis Based on Two Decades of Satellite Earth Observation Time Series and Crop Yield Statistics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Europe experienced several droughts in the recent past, such as in the year 2018, which was characterized by extremely low rainfall rates and high temperatures, resulting in substantial agricultural yield losses. Time series of satellite earth observation data enable the characterization of past drought events over large temporal and spatial scales. Within this study, Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) (MOD13Q1) 250 m time series were investigated for the vegetation periods of 2000 to 2018. The spatial and temporal development of vegetation in 2018 was compared to other dry and hot years in Europe, like the drought year 2003. Temporal and spatial inter- and intra-annual patterns of EVI anomalies were analyzed for all of Germany and for its cropland, forest, and grassland areas individually. While vegetation development in spring 2018 was above average, the summer months of 2018 showed negative anomalies in a similar magnitude as in 2003, which was particularly apparent within grassland and cropland areas in Germany. In contrast, the year 2003 showed negative anomalies during the entire growing season. The spatial pattern of vegetation status in 2018 showed high regional variation, with north-eastern Germany mainly affected in June, north-western parts in July, and western Germany in August. The temporal pattern of satellite-derived EVI deviances within the study period 2000-2018 were in good agreement with crop yield statistics for Germany. The study shows that the EVI deviation of the summer months of 2018 were among the most extreme in the study period compared to other years. The spatial pattern and temporal development of vegetation condition between the drought years differ.

TI  - Area changes of glaciers on active volcanoes in Latin America between 1986 and 2015 observed from multi-temporal satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers on active volcanoes are subject to changes in both climate fluctuations and volcanic activity. Whereas many studies analysed changes on individual volcanoes, this study presents for the first time a comparison of glacier changes on active volcanoes on a continental scale. Glacier areas were mapped for 59 volcanoes across Latin America around 1986, 1999 and 2015 using a semi-automated band ratio method combined with manual editing using satellite images from Landsat 4/5/7/8 and Sentinel-2. Area changes were compared with the Smithsonian volcano database to analyse possible glacier-volcano interactions. Over the full period, the mapped area changed from 1399.3 +/- 80 km(2) to 1016.1 +/- 34 km(2) (-383.2 km(2)) or -27.4% (-0.92% a(-1)) in relative terms. Small glaciers, especially in tropical regions lost more of their area compared to large and extra-tropical glaciers. Interestingly, 46 out of 59 analysed glaciers (78%) showed a decelerating shrinkage rate in the second period (-1.20% a(-1) before 1999 and -0.70% a(-1) after 1999). We found a slightly higher (but statistically not significant) area loss rate (-1.03% a(-1)) for glaciers on volcanoes with eruptions than without (-0.86% a(-1)).

T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is a valuable tool in movement ecology. However, the way it is combined with animal movement data is far from optimal as most studies overlook differences in the spatial, temporal and thematic resolutions between both data types. rsmove uses a pixel-based approach to link animal tracking and remote sensing data that bridge the gap between these two disciplines while respecting the limitations of the latest. Additionally, if offers standardize methods to pre-analyse the connection between animal movement and environmental change. The package guides the choice of study sites, satellite data and environmental predictors though data mining and visualization tools. rsmove offers a simple methodology to analyse animal-environment interactions that helps avoid unnecessary, time-consuming satellite data processing through an informed decision process. The package offers a basis for a better communication between ecologists and remote sensing experts contributing to the definition of clear remote sensing data requirements. Additionally, it provides future studies on animal movement tools for a more critical approach on the selection of environmental data supporting the reproducibility of animal movement studies.

Despite its large magnitude, a comprehensive geological study on the co-seismic surface rupture has not yet been reported so far. Here we reported on our new results of the co-seismic surface ruptures and left-lateral offsets caused by the earthquake based on detailed interpretation of recently acquired high-resolution WorldView and SPOT-5 images. We recognized a primary similar to 185-km-long surface rupture that trends N80 degrees E, in consistence with previous results. Along the poorly developed segment at the eastern end of the Manyi fault, a new rupture is also identified, which trends N57 degrees E and extends similar to 17 km, The co-seismic surface rupture zone exhibits many distinct features such as stepovers, extensional cracks, ponds, restraining and releasing bends in relation to fault geometrical complexities. By visual analysis of the displaced geomorphic features using satellite imagery, we measured 198 co-seismic offsets along the similar to 200 km fault trace. The results show a similar to 3.7 m average offset and a maximum offset of up to similar to 7.5 m near the epicenter area. The newly found similar to 17-km-long rupture is interpreted to be linked to the main fault during the event. If the Manyi fault continues this northeastward propagation for additional 100 km, it will separate the BayanHar Block into two sub-blocks. Such a new hypothetical block model will influence assessment of seismic potential near the block boundaries and estimate of deformation of the BayanHar Block and the central Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Introductory Engineering Decision-Making: Guiding First-Year Students to Relativism in Software Design
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Contribution: A semester-long, open-ended design project was implemented to promote intellectual development of first-year students while reinforcing event-driven/procedural programming principles. This paper describes this approach, and an evaluation strategy using Perry's model for intellectual development. The results show that students can reach the relativism stage of Perry's model in their first year of studies.Background: Students must move beyond a dualistic worldview to be engineers. Felder and Brent provided a list of recommendations to promote this type of intellectual development in students; active learning strategies strongly align with these recommendations. While active learning is common in programming courses (sometimes taking the form of project-based learning), they are typically tightly controlled by the instructor, and limited in scope (both in time and complexity), potentially reducing their impact on students.Intended Outcomes: This course and term-long project provided students a supportive environment in which to develop their decision-making skills, and promoted their intellectual development through Perry's stages related to software design.Application Design: Aligned with Felder and Brent's recommendations and Kuh's High Impact Practices, a course was built to: 1) teach students procedural programming, with 2) a focus on software design and open-ended problem solving, while maintaining 3) a supportive environment for skill acquisition.Findings: A mixed methods study showed the majority of students align themselves with the relativism stage of intellectual development at the end of the course. This study also illuminated the decision-making processes of teams of students in a first-year software design course.

TI  - The Centrality of Anti-Semitism in the Islamic State's Ideology and Its Connection to Anti-Shiism
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Islamic State (ISIS) has repeatedly targeted Jews in terrorist attacks and incited against Jews in its propaganda. Anti-Semitism and the belief that Jews are engaged in a war against Islam has been central to Islamist thought since its inception. Islamist anti-Semitism exposes the influence of both Western conspiracy theories and Islamic traditions. This article studies the anti-Semitic themes propagated by ISIS and investigates their ideological foundations. It bases itself on an analysis of articles published in Dabiq, ISIS' English language online magazine in the period 2014-2016. This study shows that ISIS' relationship with Western-inspired anti-Semitic conspiracy theories is inconsistent, vacillating between rejection and acceptance. ISIS holds an apocalyptic, anti-Semitic worldview, which claims that the Shia denomination is a Jewish invention to sow disunity among Muslims and that Shia and Jews are working together to destroy Islam. ISIS' anti-Semitism and anti-Shiism are thus inherently connected. It is vital to correctly assess the anti-Semitic ideological foundations of contemporary Islamism and Jihadism to best understand the movement. Learning about this will help lawmakers, scholars and practitioners develop strategies to deal with these movements and counter their message.

TI  - Effects of land use and land cover change on ecosystem services in the Koshi River Basin, Eastern Nepal
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - The provision of ecosystem services is directly related to the type of land use and land cover and management practices in a given area. Changes in land use and land cover can alter the supply of ecosystem services and affect the well-being of both humanity and nature. This study analyses the spatiotemporal variations of land use and land cover and quantifies the change in three important ecosystem services (food production, carbon storage, and habitat quality) in the Koshi River Basin, Nepal during 1996-2016 by using freely available data and tools such as, Landsat satellite images and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model. During the observed time period, there was an overall gain in urban areas (190 sq.km ), forests (773 sq.km ) and grassland (431 sq.km ); loss of cultivated land (220 sq.km ) and shrub lands (847 sq.km ), mostly occurring in the lowlands (<= 1000 m). As a result of the land cover changes, while food production and carbon storage showed a declining trend, overall habitat quality in the basin increased. There is a need to design novel and effective landscape approaches that address local realities and that will aid the maintenance of ecosystem services. We recommend landscape level planning to improve urban and agricultural sectors and focus on halting the loss of ecosystem services.

TI  - Variation in Hydrological Components of Reservoirs as a Response to El Nino Southern Oscillation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an irregular periodic variation of atmospheric pressure and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, affecting climate in most of the tropics and subtropics, which in turn affects water resource availability and crop productivity. Reservoirs have a vital role in management of water resources in regions with multiple cropping patterns. The present study analyzed the impacts of ENSO on reservoirs and its hydrologic components in the Venna river basin of central India. In the present study, the impact of ENSO on water availability in reservoirs was analyzed using spatial analysis of satellite-derived water-spread area (the spatial distribution of water in the reservoir) and its kappa statistics. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to estimate the area of vegetation in catchment and command areas. Analyses reveal that surplus and deficient water available in reservoirs and the area of vegetation in catchment and command areas harmonized with ENSO phases. Analysis of the variation in impacts of ENSO on reservoir-irrigated area (RIA) and groundwater-irrigated area (GWIA) revealed that average NDVI was higher in RIAs compared to GWIAs, and the difference is greater for La Nina and less for El Nino. The onset of greenness is delayed for RIAs as well as GWIAs during El Nino.

AB  - Detecting and mapping the occurrence, spatial distribution and abundance of Alien Invasive Plants (AIPs) have recently gained substantial attention, globally. This work, therefore, provides an overview of advancements in satellite remote sensing for mapping and monitoring of AIPs and associated challenges and opportunities. Satellite remote sensing techniques have been successful in detecting and mapping the spatial and temporal distribution of AIPs in rangeland ecosystems. Also, the launch of high spatial resolution and hyperspectral remote sensing sensors marked a major breakthrough to precise characterization of earth surface feature as well as optimal resource monitoring. Although essential, the improvements in spatial and spectral properties of remote sensing sensors presented a number of challenges including the excessive acquisition and limited temporal resolution. Therefore, the use of high spatial and hyperspectral datasets is not a plausible alternative to continued and operational scale earth observation, especially in financially constrained countries. On the other hand, literature shows that image classification algorithms have been instrumental in compensating the poor spatial and spectral resolution of remote sensing sensors. Furthermore, the emergence of robust and advanced non-parametric image classification algorithms have been a major development in image classification algorithms. Therefore, to address the inevitable challenges arising with satellite sensor development technology it is necessary to explore the use of robust and advanced non-parametric image classifiers with data provided by the new generation of multispectral sensors with improved spatial and spectral resolutions. This will promote long-term and large scale mapping of AIPs, especially in financially constrained countries.

TI  - A Review of Protocols for Fiducial Reference Measurements of Downwelling Irradiance for the Validation of Satellite Remote Sensing Data over Water
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper reviews the state of the art of protocols for the measurement of downwelling irradiance in the context of Fiducial Reference Measurements (FRM) of water reflectance for satellite validation. The measurement of water reflectance requires the measurement of water-leaving radiance and downwelling irradiance just above water. For the latter, there are four generic families of method, using: (1) an above-water upward-pointing irradiance sensor; (2) an above-water downward-pointing radiance sensor and a reflective plaque; (3) a Sun-pointing radiance sensor (sunphotometer); or (4) an underwater upward-pointing irradiance sensor deployed at different depths. Each method-except for the fourth, which is considered obsolete for the measurement of above-water downwelling irradiance-is described generically in the FRM context with reference to the measurement equation, documented implementations, and the intra-method diversity of deployment platform and practice. Ideal measurement conditions are stated, practical recommendations are provided on best practice, and guidelines for estimating the measurement uncertainty are provided for each protocol-related component of the measurement uncertainty budget. The state of the art for the measurement of downwelling irradiance is summarized, future perspectives are outlined, and key debates such as the use of reflectance plaques with calibrated or uncalibrated radiometers are presented. This review is based on the practice and studies of the aquatic optics community and the validation of water reflectance, but is also relevant to land radiation monitoring and the validation of satellite-derived land surface reflectance.

TI  - Identification of most spectrally distinguishable phenological stage of invasive <i>Phramites australis</i> in Lake Erie wetlands (Canada) for accurate mapping using multispectral satellite imagery
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steudel subspecies australis is one of the worst plant invaders in wetlands of North America. Remote sensing is the most cost-effective method to track its spread given its widespread distribution and rapid colonization rate. We hypothesize that the morphological and/or physiological features associated with different phenological states of Phragmites can influence their reflectance signal and thus affect mapping accuracies. We tested this hypothesis by comparing classification accuracies of cloud-free images acquired by Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and Sentinel 2 at roughly monthly intervals over a calendar year for two wetlands in southern Ontario. We used the Support Vector Machines classification and employed field observations and image acquired from unmanned aerial vehicle (8 cm) to perform accuracy assessments. The highest Phragmites producer's, user's, and overall accuracy (96.00, 91.11, and 88.56% respectively) were provided by images acquired in late summer and fall period. During this period, green, Near Infrared, and Short-Wave Infrared bands generated more unique reflectance signals for Phragmites. Both Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Water Index showed significant difference between Phragmites and the most confused classes (cattail; Typha latifolia L., and meadow marsh) during the late summer and fall period. Since meadow marsh separated out best from Phragmites and cattail in the February image, we used it to mask the meadow marsh in the July image to reduce confusion. The unique reflectance signal of Phragmites in late summer and fall is likely due to prolonged greenness of Phragmites when compared to other wetland vegetation, large, distinct inflorescence, and the water content of Phragmites during this period.

TI  - Comparison of Land Surface Temperatures from Near-surface Measurement and Satellite-based Product
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (T-s) is a critical variable for understanding the surface energy exchange between land and atmosphere. Using the data measured from micrometeorological flux towers, three types of T-s, obtained using a thermal-infrared radiometer (IRT), a net radiometer, and an equation for sensible heat flux, were compared. The T-s estimated using the net radiometer was highly correlated with the T-s obtained from the IRT. Both values acceptably fit the T-s from the Terra/MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite. These results will enhance the measurement of land surface temperatures at various scales. Further, they are useful for understanding land surface energy partitioning to evaluate and develop land surface models and algorithms for satellite remote sensing products associated with surface thermal conditions.

TI  - Different Agricultural Responses to Extreme Drought Events in Neighboring Counties of South and North Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based remote sensing techniques have been widely used to monitor droughts spanning large areas. Various agricultural drought indices have been developed to assess the intensity of agricultural drought and to detect damaged crop areas. However, to better understand the responses of agricultural drought to meteorological drought, agricultural management practices should be taken into consideration. This study aims to evaluate the responses to drought under different forms of agricultural management for the extreme drought that occurred on the Korean Peninsula in 2014 and 2015. The 3-month standardized precipitation index (SPI3) and the 3-month vegetation health index (VHI3) were selected as a meteorological drought index and an agricultural drought index, respectively. VHI3, which comprises the 3-month temperature condition index (TCI3) and the 3-month vegetation condition index (VCI3), differed significantly in the study area during the extreme drought. VCI3 had a different response to the lack of precipitation in South and North Korea because it was affected by irrigation. However, the time series of TCI3 were similar in South and North Korea. These results meant that each drought index has different characteristics and should be utilized with caution. Our results are expected to help comprehend the responses of the agricultural drought index on meteorological drought depending on agricultural management.

TI  - Advanced Applications of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Remote Sensing for Detecting Pre- and Syn-eruption Signatures at Mount Sinabung, North Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mount Sinabung was re-activated at August 28th, 2010 after a long repose interval. The early stage of a phreatic eruption was then followed by magmatic eruptions at September 15th, 2013 for years until now. To understand the ground surface changes accompanying the eruption periods, comprehensive analyses of surface and subsurface data are necessary, especially the condition in pre- and syn-eruption periods. This study is raised to identify ground surface and topographical changes before, intra, and after the eruption periods by analyzing the temporal signature of surface roughness, moisture, and deformation derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The time series of SAR backscattering intensity were analyzed prior to and after the early eruption periods to know the lateral ground surface changes including estimated lava dome roughness and surface moisture. Meanwhile, the atmospherically corrected Differential Interferometric SAR (D-InSAR) method was also applied to know the vertical topographical changes prior to the eruptions. The atmospheric correction based on modified Referenced Linear Correlation (mRLC) was applied to each D-InSAR pair to exclude the atmospheric phase delay from the deformation signal. The changes of surface moistures on syn-eruptions were estimated by calculating dielectric constant from SAR polarimetric mode following Dubois model. Twenty-one Phased Array type L-band SAR (PAL SAR) data on board Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) and nine Sentinel-1A SAR data were used in this study with the acquisition date between February 2006 and February 2017. For D-InSAR purposes, the ALOS PAL SAR data were paired to generate twenty interferograms. Based on the D-InSAR deformation, three times inflation-deflation periods were observed prior to the early eruption at August 28th 2010. The first and second inflation-deflation periods at the end of 2008 and middle 2009 presented migration of magma batches and dike generations in the deep reservoir. The third inflation-deflation periods in the middle of 2010 served as a precursor signal presenting magma feeding to the shallow reservoir. The summit was inflated about 1.4 cm and followed by the eruptions. The deflation of about 2.3 cm indicated the release pressure and temperature in the shallow reservoir after the early eruption at August 28th, 2010. The last inflation-deflation period was also confirmed by the increase of the lava dome roughness size from 5,121 m(2) on July to 6,584 m(2) on August. The summit then inflated again about 1.1 cm after the first eruption and followed by unrest periods presented by lava dome growth and destruction at September 15th, 2013. The volcanic products including lava and pyroclastics strongly affected the moisture of surface layer. The volcanic products were observed to reduce the surface moisture within syn-eruption periods. The hot materials arc presumed responsible for the evaporation of the surface moisture as well.

TI  - Coastline shift analysis in data deficient regions: Exploiting the high spatio-temporal resolution Sentinel-2 products
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - In most developing countries, coastline shift monitoring using in-situ (ground-based) data faces challenges due, e.g., to data unreliability, inconsistency, deficiency, inaccessibility or incompleteness. Even where practically applicable, the traditional "boots on the ground" methods are labour intensive and expensive, thus imposing burden on poor countries struggling to meet other urgent pressing daily needs, i.e., food and medicine. Remote sensing (RS) techniques provide a more efficient and effective way of collecting data for coastline shift analysis. However, moderate spatio-temporal resolution RS products such as the widely used Landsat products (30 m and 16 days) may be insufficient where high accuracy is desired. In 2015, Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) remotely sensed products with higher spatio-temporal resolution (10 m and 5 days) and high spectral resolution (13 bands), which promises to improve coastline movement monitoring to high accuracy, was launched. Using two war-impacted countries (Liberia and Somalia) as case studies of regions with data deficiency or of poor quality, for the period 2015-2018, this contribution aims at (i) assessing the suitability of the new freely available high spatio-temporal Sentinel-2 products to monitor coastline shift, (ii) assessing the possibility of filling the missing Sentinel-2 gaps with Landsat 8 panchromatic band (15 m) products to provide alternative data source for mapping of coastline movements where Sentinel-2 data is unusable, e.g., due to cloud cover, and (iii), undertake a comparative analysis between Sentinel-2 (10 m), Landsat panchromatic (15 m), and Landsat multi spectral (30 m). The results of the evaluation indicate 23% (on average) improvement gained by using Sentinel-2 compared to the traditional Landsat 30 m resolution data (i.e., 32% for Liberia and 14% for Somalia). A comparison of 100 check points from Google Earth Pro (i.e., surrogate in-situ reference data) show 91% agreement for Liberia and 85% for Somalia, indicating the potential of using Sentinel-2 data for future coastal shift studies, particularly for the data deficient regions. The results of comparative studies for Sentinel-2, Landsat panchromatic (PAN), and Landsat multi-spectral (MS) show that the percentages of Sentinel-2 and Landsat PAN that falls within 10 m threshold is much higher than Landsat MS by 35% and 26%, respectively, and for the 2016-2017 period, they provide more detailed mapping of the Liberian coastline compared to Landsat MS (30 m). Finally, panchromatic Landsat data with 15m resolution are found to be capable of filling the missing Sentinel-2 gaps, i.e., where cloud cover hampers its usability.

TI  - Optimized Artificial Neural Networks-Based Methods for Statistical Downscaling of Gridded Precipitation Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation as a key parameter in hydrometeorology and other water-related applications always needs precise methods for assessing and predicting precipitation data. In this study, an effort has been conducted to downscale and evaluate a satellite precipitation estimation (SPE) product using artificial neural networks (ANN), and to impose a residual correction method for five separate daily heavy precipitation events localized over northeast Austria. For the ANN model, a precipitation variable was the chosen output and the inputs were temperature, MODIS cloud optical, and microphysical variables. The particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm,(ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA) were utilized to improve the performance of ANN. Moreover, to examine the efficiency of the networks, the downscaled product was evaluated using 54 rain gauges at a daily timescale. In addition, sensitivity analysis was conducted to obtain the most and least influential input parameters. Among the optimized algorithms for network training used in this study, the performance of the ICA slightly outperformed other algorithms. The best-recorded performance for ICA was on 17 April 2015 with root mean square error (RMSE) = 5.26 mm, mean absolute error (MAE) = 6.06 mm, R-2 = 0.67, bias = 0.07 mm. The results showed that the prediction of precipitation was more sensitive to cloud optical thickness (COT). Moreover, the accuracy of the final downscaled satellite precipitation was improved significantly through residual correction algorithms.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the spatial and temporal patterns of the land cover were monitored within the Qazaly irrigation zone located in the deltaic zone of the Syrdarya river in the surroundings of the former Aral Sea. A 16-day MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Aqua NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data product with a spatial resolution of 250 meters was used for this purpose, covering the period between 2003 and 2018. Field survey results obtained in 2018 were used to build a sample dataset. The random forests supervised classification machine learning algorithm was used to map land cover, which produced good results with an overall accuracy of about 0.8. Statistics on land cover change were calculated and analyzed. The correctness of obtained classes was checked with Landsat 8 (OLI, The Operational Land Imager) images. Detailed land cover maps, including rice cropland, were derived. During the observation period, the rice croplands increased, while the generally irrigated area decreased.

TI  - Direct, ECOC, ND and END Frameworks-Which One Is the Best? An Empirical Study of Sentinel-2A MSIL1C Image Classification for Arid-Land Vegetation Mapping in the Ili River Delta, Kazakhstan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To facilitate the advances in Sentinel-2A products for land cover from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat imagery, Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument Level-1C (MSIL1C) images are investigated for large-scale vegetation mapping in an arid land environment that is located in the Ili River delta, Kazakhstan. For accurate classification purposes, multi-resolution segmentation (MRS) based extended object-guided morphological profiles (EOMPs) are proposed and then compared with conventional morphological profiles (MPs), MPs with partial reconstruction (MPPR), object-guided MPs (OMPs), OMPs with mean values (OMPsM), and object-oriented (OO)-based image classification techniques. Popular classifiers, such as C4.5, an extremely randomized decision tree (ERDT), random forest (RaF), rotation forest (RoF), classification via random forest regression (CVRFR), ExtraTrees, and radial basis function (RBF) kernel-based support vector machines (SVMs) are adopted to answer the question of whether nested dichotomies (ND) and ensembles of ND (END) are truly superior to direct and error-correcting output code (ECOC) multiclass classification frameworks. Finally, based on the results, the following conclusions are drawn: 1) the superior performance of OO-based techniques over MPs, MPPR, OMPs, and OMPsM is clear for Sentinel-2A MSIL1C image classification, while the best results are achieved by the proposed EOMPs; 2) the superior performance of ND, ND with class balancing (NDCB), ND with data balancing (NDDB), ND with random-pair selection (NDRPS), and ND with further centroid (NDFC) over direct and ECOC frameworks is not confirmed, especially in the cases of using weak classifiers for low-dimensional datasets; 3) from computationally efficient, high accuracy, redundant to data dimensionality and easy of implementations points of view, END, ENDCB, ENDDB, and ENDRPS are alternative choices to direct and ECOC frameworks; 4) surprisingly, because in the ensemble learning (EL) theorem, weaker classifiers (ERDT here) always have a better chance of reaching the trade-off between diversity and accuracy than stronger classifies (RaF, ExtraTrees, and SVM here), END with ERDT (END-ERDT) achieves the best performance with less than a 0.5% difference in the overall accuracy (OA) values, but is 100 to 10000 times faster than END with RaF and ExtraTrees, and ECOC with SVM while using different datasets with various dimensions; and, 5) Sentinel-2A MSIL1C is better choice than the land cover products from MODIS and Landsat imagery for vegetation species mapping in an arid land environment, where the vegetation species are critically important, but sparsely distributed.

TI  - A New Adaptive Image Interpolation Method to Define the Shoreline at Sub-Pixel Level
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new methodological process for detecting the instantaneous land-water border at sub-pixel level from mid-resolution satellite images (30 m/pixel) that are freely available worldwide. The new method is based on using an iterative procedure to compute Laplacian roots of a polynomial surface that represents the radiometric response of a set of pixels. The method uses a first approximation of the shoreline at pixel level (initial pixels) and selects a set of neighbouring pixels to be part of the analysis window. This adaptive window collects those stencils in which the maximum radiometric variations are found by using the information given by divided differences. Therefore, the land-water surface is computed by a piecewise interpolating polynomial that models the strong radiometric changes between both interfaces. The assessment is tested on two coastal areas to analyse how their inherent differences may affect the method. A total of 17 Landsat 7 and 8 images (L7 and L8) were used to extract the shorelines and compare them against other highly accurate lines that act as references. Accurate quantitative coastal data from the satellite images is obtained with a mean horizontal error of 4.38 +/- 5.66 m and 1.79 +/- 2.78 m, respectively, for L7 and L8. Prior methodologies to reach the sub-pixel shoreline are analysed and the results verify the solvency of the one proposed.

TI  - Multicenter Phase II Study of Intraoperative Radiotherapy of Early Breast Cancer: Ipsilateral Tumor Recurrence
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWe performed a multicenter phase II study on the efficacy and safety of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) as partial breast irradiation using multiple devices.MethodsThe primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Key inclusion criteria were T<2.5cm, age>50years, surgical margin>1cm, intraoperative pathologically free margins, and sentinel node negative. After resection of the tumor, radiation at 21Gy was delivered directly to the mammary gland employing an electron linear accelerator in the operating room, otherwise the patient was transported from the surgical suite to the radiation room.ResultsOverall, 142 patients were enrolled in this study and 129 underwent IORT. Stage 0: n=4 (3.1%); stage I: n=98 (76.0%); and stage IIA: n=27 (20.9%). Luminal type: n=116 (89.9%); triple-negative: n=9 (7.0%); and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2: n=4 (3.1%). Median follow-up time was 59.5months (range 27.5-99.0), and the rate of IBTR was 3.1% (95% confidence interval 0.9-7.8). The toxicities included fibrosis in deep-connective tissue: grade1, 78.1%; wound infection: grade3, 1.6% and grade2, 1.6%; and soft tissue necrosis: grade3, 0.8% and grade2, 0.8%. Recurrence in the breast occurred in four cases; the site of recurrence was just under the skin near the primary tumor site, with similar histology and subtype.ConclusionsIn this multicenter phase II study, the rate of IBTR was low and IORT at 21Gy was feasible in properly selected patients. It is important to use a careful surgical technique to reduce local recurrence because the skin is not included in the radiation field of IORT.

TI  - Characterizing Crop Water Use Dynamics in the Central Valley of California Using Landsat-Derived Evapotranspiration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how different crops use water over time is essential for planning and managing water allocation, water rights, and agricultural production. The main objective of this paper is to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop water use in the Central Valley of California using Landsat-based annual actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from 2008 to 2018 derived from the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model. Crop water use for 10 crops is characterized at multiple scales. The Mann-Kendall trend analysis revealed a significant increase in area cultivated with almonds and their water use, with an annual rate of change of 16,327 ha in area and 13,488 ha-m in water use. Conversely, alfalfa showed a significant decline with 12,429 ha in area and 13,901 ha-m in water use per year during the same period. A pixel-based Mann-Kendall trend analysis showed the changing crop type and water use at the level of individual fields for all of Kern County in the Central Valley. This study demonstrates the useful application of historical Landsat ET to produce relevant water management information. Similar studies can be conducted at regional and global scales to understand and quantify the relationships between land cover change and its impact on water use.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background The eighth international symposium for sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in head and neck cancer was held in 2018. This consensus conference aimed to deliver current multidisciplinary guidelines. This document focuses on the surgical aspects of SNB for oral cancer. Method Invited expert faculty selected topics requiring guidelines. Topics were reviewed and evidence evaluated where available. Data were presented at the consensus meeting, with live debate from panels comprising expert, nonexpert, and patient representatives followed by voting to assess the level of support for proposed recommendations. Evidence review, debate, and voting results were all considered in constructing these guidelines. Results/Conclusion A range of topics were considered, from patient selection to surgical technique and follow-up schedule. Consensus was not achieved in all areas, highlighting potential issues that would benefit from prospective studies. Nevertheless these guidelines represent an up-to-date pragmatic recommendation based on current evidence and expert opinion.

TI  - Bayesian inversion of a forest reflectance model using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - The inversion of reflectance models is a generalizable tool to obtain estimates on forest biophysical parameters, such as leaf area index, with theoretically little information need from a study area, instead relying on the knowledge about physical processes in the forest radiation regime. The use of prior information can greatly improve the reflectance model inversion, however, the literature does not yet provide much information on the selection of priors and their influence on the inversion results. In this study, we used a Bayesian approach to invert the PARAS forest reflectance model and retrieve leaf area index from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI multispectral satellite images. The PARAS model is based on the theory of spectral invariants, which describes the influence of wavelength-independent parameters on forest radiative transfer. The Bayesian inversion approach is highly flexible, provides uncertainty quantification, and enables the explicit incorporation of prior knowledge into the inversion process. We found that the choice of prior information is crucial in inverting a forest reflectance model to predict leaf area index. Regularizing and informative priors for leaf area index strongly improved the predictions, relative to an uninformative prior, in that they counteracted the saturation effect of the optical signal occuring at high values for leaf area index. The predictions of leaf area index were more accurate for Landsat 8 than for Sentinel-2, due to potential inconsistencies in the visible bands of Sentinel-2 in our data, and the higher spectral resolution.

AB  - Developing countries with a paucity of direct rainfall measuring systems on the ground, satellite remote sensing is increasingly being relied upon as a means through which national governmental response and future strategies to manage natural disasters, such as drought and flooding are decided upon. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the Tropical Applications of Meteorology Using Satellite Data and Ground-Based Observations (TAMSAT) monthly rainfall dataset for southern Africa by comparing it to two widely used stable global rainfall datasets, the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) datasets. Using rainfall records for the period 1984-2010, four statistical measures namely, the correlation coefficient, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), relative bias, mean absolute deviation and the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency index were calculated to facilitate pair-wise comparisons. This inter-product comparison study found a good agreement between TAMSAT satellite rainfall and the two global rainfall products with regard to the spatial and temporal representation of monthly rainfall over the region. However, it was found that TAMSAT consistently provides lower monthly rainfall estimates compared to both GPCC and GPCP rainfall estimates over southern Africa. The relative bias between TAMSAT and the two global rainfall products (GPCC and GPCP) was much lower (<= 10%) during the austral summer months (November-March) compared to winter when the relative bias surpassed 70%. These findings indicate TAMSAT is geared more towards convective precipitation brought about by the inter-tropical convergence zone in summer. The observed large discrepancy between TAMSAT estimates and those from two mature global rainfall products during winter raises a key concern regarding the use of TAMSAT as a tool for monitoring rainfall patterns and volumes across the southern reaches of the African continent. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate the diminished ability for TAMSAT to "see" non-convective precipitation from frontal systems as well as orographic rainfall due to its reliance upon the observation of the cold cloud duration and convection characteristics of tropical rainfall systems. This calls for the need to further optimise the TAMSAT algorithm using gauge data so that TAMSAT is better able to characterise different precipitation events in those regions where convective rainfall is far from the only major source of rainfall.

TI  - A 32-year aridity analysis: a tool for better understanding on water resources management in Lebanon
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Water scarcity has been well pronounced in the Middle East Region; however, Lebanon is still characterized by wet climate and sufficient water resources. It is a paradox that Lebanon is now under water stress, and many contradictory studies on the climate of Lebanon attributed water stress to the changing climate. Most of these studies were applied with incomplete climatic data records. Therefore, all management approaches were implemented after considering climate as a major influencer on water resources. In this study, the Emberger Aridity Index (E-Ai) was employed to investigate the climate regime of Lebanon over more than 30 years focusing on ten representative meteorological stations where comprehensive climatic records were analysed and supported by remotely sensed data. The E-Ai indicates that Lebanon is still characterized by humid climate, which conflicts with the concept of drought existence. Thus, 47% of the Lebanese territory is characterized by humid to sub-humid climate and 29% by semi-arid climate according to Emberger classification. This obviously shows that even the climate impact has a role on water scarcity, but it is not the principal influencer. The results of this study help applying new approaches for water management where the negative human interference should be accounted. It guides stakeholder and decision-maker to follow appropriate water and agricultural policies and strategies for better sustainable development.

M3  - Article
AB  - Mars is the only extraterrestrial body which could host primitive lifeforms and also has the potential to host a human base in the near future. Towards fulfilling these objectives, several remote sensing missions and rover based missions have been sent to Mars. Still, confirmation of existing or extinct life on this planet in any form has not been achieved and possibly human missions at selected sites in the future are the key to addressing this problem. Here, we have used remote sensing data from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO; NASA), Mars Global Surveyor (MGS; NASA), Mars Odyssey (NASA) and Mars Express (MEX; ESA) to devise an exploration strategy for one such area known as Hebrus Valles, which is a potential site for human exploration of the surface of Mars. A geological context map of the Hebrus Valles and Hephaestus Fossae region has been prepared and a candidate landing site has been proposed in the Hebrus Valles region. Suitable rover paths have been worked out from the proposed landing site for harnessing the science and resource potential of the region. The proposed landing site is located in the equatorial region at (20 degrees 40' N, 126 degrees 23' E) and due to its proximity to the Potential Subsurface Access Candidates (PSACs) in the region, such as sinkholes and skylights and also other resources such as crater ejecta, silicate material and fluvial channels, the site is appropriate for exploration of the region.

T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric SAR analysis with a time series of images obtained from satellite has been proven to be a useful monitoring scheme for geomorphological changes, particularly related to the vertical dimension. The success of this technique relies on the coherence between the images. This imposes severe challenges for applications in vegetated areas. In this study, the landslide process of a site located in Liugui, southern Taiwan, is investigated by a time series of SAR images collected from ALOS PALSAR and Sentinel 1A. This landslide monitoring site is heavily vegetated. From the Persistent Scattering (PS) analysis, ALOS PALSAR presented more extracted points. The wavelength of the band may be a decisive factor. The time series of ALOS images spans across the deadliest typhoon impacted Taiwan in recorded history, Typhoon Morakot on 8 August 2009. It is clear that there are more PS points extracted from the time series after the event as compared to before Typhoon Morakot. This is largely explained by the increase in the amount of bare earth after the disaster. From the interferometric SAR analysis, the development of headward erosion could be observed. Although the number of PS points is limited, the understanding of erosion and landslide progress in the area could still be improved while integrating with the digital elevation model collected with airborne lidar, historic aerial photos, and images collected with UAS (Unmanned Aviation Systems). Together with the in situ measurements, the colluvium depth ranges from 2 - 40 m in the area. The surface instability is expected to persist.

TI  - Detecting Forest Changes Using Dense Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 Time Series Data in Tropical Seasonal Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and timely detection of forest disturbances can provide valuable information for effective forest management. Combining dense time series observations from optical and synthetic aperture radar satellites has the potential to improve large-area forest monitoring. For various disturbances, machine learning algorithms might accurately characterize forest changes. However, there is limited knowledge especially on the use of machine learning algorithms to detect forest disturbances through hybrid approaches that combine different data sources. This study investigated the use of dense Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 time series data for detecting disturbances in tropical seasonal forests based on a machine learning algorithm. The random forest algorithm was used to predict the disturbance probability of each Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 observation using variables derived from a harmonic regression model, which characterized seasonality and disturbance-related changes. The time series disturbance probabilities of both sensors were then combined to detect forest disturbances in each pixel. The results showed that the combination of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 achieved an overall accuracy of 83.6% for disturbance detection, which was higher than the disturbance detection using only Landsat 8 (78.3%) or Sentinel-1 (75.5%). Additionally, more timely disturbance detection was achieved by combining Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1. Small-scale disturbances caused by logging led to large omissions of disturbances; however, other disturbances were detected with relatively high accuracy. Although disturbance detection using only Sentinel-1 data had low accuracy in this study, the combination with Landsat 8 data improved the accuracy of detection, indicating the value of dense Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 time series data for timely and accurate disturbance detection.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of landscape transformation using earth observation datasets in Shirui Hill of Manipur, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Shirui hill is situated at the north-eastern part of Manipur, India. This hill is not only the habitat of world famous endemic flower; Lilium mackliniae, but also home to many vulnerable and endangered floral and faunal species.. The aim of work was to assess the ecosystem diversity and landscape transformation Landsat satellite images of year 1988, 2001 and 2013 have been used to study the land use/land cover change and landscape fragmentation using FRAGSTATS. Several statistics such as principal component analysis (PCA) and spatial metrics are used to understand the results. The PCA was performed on the landscape metrics explained 93.0% of the total variance and justified three PCs; of these, both RMSR and AGFI fit very well (0.02 and 0.99, respectively), while PC1 accounted for 42% of the variance and was correlated with CA, TCA, NDCA and AREA_CV, PC2 explained 34% and was correlated with TE, SHAPE_MN, and PC3 explained 19% and was correlated with NP. The phytosociological study was carried out to assess the vegetation status. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) method was adopted for socio-economic data collection. The finding of work suggests a rising pressure of human activities on the land and sizable portion of it have been converted into either shifting agriculture or wet paddy land.

TI  - Factors Regulating Nitrification in the Arctic Ocean: Potential Impact of Sea Ice Reduction and Ocean Acidification
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrification is susceptible to changes in light and pH and, thus, could be influenced by recent sea ice reductions and acidification in the Arctic Ocean. We investigated the sensitivity of nitrification to light, pH, and substrate availability in a natural nitrifier community of the Arctic Ocean. Nitrification was active near the bottom of the shelf region (<60 m) and in the halocline layer (50-200 m) of the Arctic basin, where ammonium was abundant, but was low in the ammonium-depleted Atlantic layer (>250 m). In pH control experiments, nitrification rates significantly declined when the pH was manipulated to be 0.22 lower than the controls. However, nitrification was relatively insensitive to changes in pH compared to changes in light. Light control experiments showed that nitrification was inhibited by a light intensity above 0.11 mol photons m(-2) day(-1), which was presumably the light threshold. A light intensity greater than the light threshold extended to the shelf bottom and upper halocline layer, limiting nitrification in these waters. Satellite data analyses indicated that the area where light levels inhibit nitrification has increased throughout the Arctic Ocean due to the recent sea ice reduction, which may lead to a declining trend in nitrification. Our results suggest that stronger light levels in the future Arctic Ocean could further suppress nitrification and alter the composition of inorganic nitrogen, with implications for the structure of ecosystems.

TI  - Positive nonsentinel lymph nodes are associated with poor survival in breast cancer: results from a retrospective study
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe prognostic value of nonsentinel lymph-node (NSLN) status in breast cancer remains unclear. This study was designed to investigate the prognostic value of NSLN status in SLN-positive breast cancer.MethodsRetrospective 873 consecutive primary breast cancer patients from a single institution who were SLN-positive and underwent axillary lymph-node dissection (ALND) were included. Patients with incomplete clinical information or loss of follow-up were excluded. Survival analysis in patients with the same number of positive LNs and patients belonging to the same American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) node (N) classification was performed to establish a proposal for incorporating the NSLN status into the breast cancer staging system.ResultsThe median follow-up was 41months. Positive NSLN status was a significantly unfavorable factor for recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR: 4.31, P<0.001) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) (HR: 3.62, P<0.001). The survival of patients with one positive SLN and one positive NSLN (N=97) was significantly worse than that of patients with two positive SLNs (N=68; RFS, P=0.011; DRFS, P=0.027). Positive NSLN status was a significantly unfavorable factor affecting survival in patients with the AJCC N1 classification (N=806; RFS, HR: 2.85, P=0.002; DRFS, HR: 2.81, P=0.004). No significant difference in survival was found between LN-negative (N=361) and NSLN-negative AJCC N1 classification (N=363) patients.ConclusionsPositive NSLN status has an independent prognostic value in breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive LNs, and the NSLN status should be incorporated into the breast cancer staging system.

TI  - Pre-stratified modelling plus residuals kriging reduces the uncertainty of aboveground biomass estimation and spatial distribution in heterogeneous savannas and forest environments
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping aboveground biomass (AGB) is a challenge in heterogeneous environments, such as the Brazilian savannas and tropical forests located in Minas Gerais state (MG), Brazil. The factors linked to AGB stocks vary in climate, soil characteristics, and stand-level structural attributes over short distances, making generalization of AGB difficult over regional-scales. We offer the hypothesis that stratification into vegetation types at the plot level plus a regression kriging technique, can reduce the variability of factors controlling AGB, helping to select the appropriate predictor variables and result in an ability to produce reliable models and maps. To do so, we incorporate remotely sensed data (Landsat and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-MODIS), spatio-environmental variables, and forest inventory data to develop spatial-explicit maps of AGB across three important Brazilian biomes (savanna, Atlantic forest, and semi-arid woodland). We modelled and predicted the spatial distribution of AGB of six individual vegetation types of savanna-forest biomes (shrub savanna, woodland savanna, densely wooded savanna, deciduous forest, semi-deciduous forest and rain forest), utilizing a random forests (RF) algorithm plus residual kriging, selecting the lowest number of variables that offer the best predictive performance. The stratified models notably improved the AGB prediction by reducing the mean absolute error - MAE (%) and the root-mean-square error - RMSE (Mg/ha) for all vegetation types, mainly for shrub savanna (MAE reduced from 82.69 to 54.73%). The AGB spatial distribution is governed mainly by precipitation and seasonality. The south and east of MG presented high values of AGB due to the predominance of semi-deciduous trees and rain forest conditions within Atlantic forest biome (total of 491,456,607 Mg), with a higher amount rain over the year, lower temperatures, and lower precipitation seasonality. Rain forests have the largest mean AGB per area (157.71 Mg/ha) while semi-deciduous forests hold the largest AGB stocks in the state (583,176,472 Mg). Shrub savannas, located in the central, northwest and north regions of MG (lower amount of rain, higher temperatures and strong seasonality), accounted the lowest amount of AGB in both total AGB (27,906,281 Mg) and AGB per area (18.80 Mg/ha). Our study demonstrates that stratification can reduce variability and improve estimates by developing individual models and selecting optimal predictor variables dependent on the characteristics of specific vegetation types. The methods demonstrated and the resultant maps and estimates improve the quality of regional biomass estimates needed to understand and mitigate climate change, enabling researchers to refine estimates of greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Extramammary Paget's disease: a review of the literature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is a rare cutaneous malignancy. The disease typically affects older individuals aged 60-80 years and is seen most frequently in postmenopausal Caucasian women and Asian men. EMPD exhibits a predilection for the genital and perianal regions and may be associated with an underlying carcinoma in adjacent organs. EMPD presents a challenge in both diagnosis and management. Often treated empirically as various dermatitides, the correct diagnosis is frequently delayed by many years. Following diagnosis, an extensive search for an associated malignancy should be initiated. If invasive disease is present on biopsy, a sentinel lymph node biopsy may guide further treatment. Mohs micrographic surgery appears to be superior to wide local excision when considering tissue sparing ability and disease recurrence. Nonsurgical interventions have also been investigated with varied results. Regardless of treatment method, long-term follow-up is recommended to monitor for local disease recurrence, development of internal malignancy, regional lymphadenopathy, or distant metastasis.

TI  - Raptor: Large Scale Analysis of Big Raster and Vector Data
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increase in amount of remote sensing data, there have been efforts to efficiently process it to help ecologists and geographers answer queries. However, they often need to process this data in combination with vector data, for example, city boundaries. Existing efforts require one dataset to be converted to the other representation, which is extremely inefficient for large datasets. In this demonstration, we focus on the zonal statistics problem, which computes the statistics over a raster layer for each polygon in a vector layer. We demonstrate three approaches, vector-based, raster-based, and raptor-based approaches. The latter is a recent effort of combining raster and vector data without a need of any conversion. This demo will allow users to run their own queries in any of the three methods and observe the differences in their performance depending on different raster and vector dataset sizes.

TI  - Winter Wheat Yield Assessment from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Data: Incorporating Surface Reflectance, Through Phenological Fitting, into Regression Yield Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A combination of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 offers a high frequency of observations (3-5 days) at moderate spatial resolution (10-30 m), which is essential for crop yield studies. Existing methods traditionally apply vegetation indices (VIs) that incorporate surface reflectances (SRs) in two or more spectral bands into a single variable, and rarely address the incorporation of SRs into empirical regression models of crop yield. In this work, we address these issues by normalizing satellite data (both VIs and SRs) derived from NASA's Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) product, through a phenological fitting. We apply a quadratic function to fit VIs or SRs against accumulated growing degree days (AGDDs), which affects the rate of crop development. The derived phenological metrics for VIs and SRs, namely peak, area under curve (AUC), and fitting coefficients from a quadratic function, were used to build empirical regression winter wheat models at a regional scale in Ukraine for three years, 2016-2018. The best results were achieved for the model with near infrared (NIR) and red spectral bands and derived AUC, constant, linear, and quadratic coefficients of the quadratic model. The best model yielded a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.201 t/ha (5.4%) and coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.73 on cross-validation.

TI  - Determining and Evaluating the Hydrological Signal in Polar Motion Excitation from Gravity Field Models Obtained from Kinematic Orbits of LEO Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the gravity field solutions based on high-low satellite-to-satellite tracking (hl-SST) of low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites: GRACE, Swarm, TerraSAR-X, TanDEM-X, MetOp-A, MetOp-B, and Jason 2, by converting them into hydrological polar motion excitation functions (or hydrological angular momentum (HAM)). The resulting HAM series are compared with the residuals of observed polar motion excitation (geodetic residuals, GAO) derived from precise geodetic measurements, and the HAM obtained from the GRACE ITSG 2018 solution. The findings indicate a large impact of orbital altitude and inclination on the accuracy of derived HAM. The HAM series obtained from Swarm data are found to be the most consistent with GAO. Visible differences are found in HAM obtained from GRACE and Swarm orbits and provided by different processing centres. The main reasons for such differences are likely to be different processing approaches and background models. The findings of this study provide important information on alternative data sets that may be used to provide continuous polar motion excitation observations, of which the Swarm solution provided by the Astronomical Institute, Czech Academy of Sciences, is the most accurate. However, further analysis is needed to determine which processing algorithms are most appropriate to obtain the best correspondence with GAO.

TI  - "Really present to bless": The sacrament of creation and a practical ethic of environmental care for the local church
T2  - REVIEW & EXPOSITOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic climate change poses the greatest existential threat humans have ever faced as a species. Churches must find creative ways to confront this frightening new reality, but how are we to do so faithfully? The first half of the article explores the suggestion that a harmful modern worldview of "disenchantment" is partly to blame for our current environmental crisis, and that this perspective fails to account adequately for God's real presence "in, with, and under" creation. The article then offers a short theological "sketch" that considers how a more robust sacramental imagination might challenge pastors and congregations to think differently about the interlocking relationships between God, humanity, and creation. Finally, the second half of the article recommends three small, practical steps that serve as "living signs" of this sacramental creation theology when put into practice by local churches, beginning with our dinner tables.

TI  - Faecal microbiota dynamics in <i>Cornu aspersum</i> during dietary change and antibiotic challenge
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite its widespread geographic distribution and applications, the herbivorous land snail Cornu aspersum represents an understudied animal host. In this study, we used a culture-based approach, in combination with a population analysis based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, to describe changes in the faecal microbiota of wild-caught snails that were fed a nonsterile plant diet over a period of 21 days. At the beginning of the experiment, wild-caught snails harboured diverse populations of Gammaproteobacteria. The two most abundant genera of Gammaproteobacteria were soil-associated Pseudomonas and Buttiauxella; the latter is an understudied genus often reported in snails and slugs. During penicillin treatment, the diversity of Gammaproteobacteria in experimental snails bottlenecked, resulting in Pseudomonas takeover. Following penicillin treatment, experimental snails began to recover, with faecal samples containing pre-treatment Gammaproteobacteria groups by day 21. There was a significant difference in the colony-forming units/g across days and across treatments. Additionally, there was a significant interaction between day and treatment. The food source was not sterile and supported its own population of Gammaproteobacteria, primarily Pseudomonas, which would have been taken up by the snails daily. Given that Buttiauxella was not observed on the food source, we hypothesize that it was present and maintained within the digestive tract of C. aspersum, and this is consistent with the idea that C. aspersum maintains an endogenous gut microbiome.

M3  - Article
AB  - Due to global warming under climate change scenarios, Indus delta region of Pakistan is under serious threat since the last few decades. The present study was thus conducted to determine the spatiotemporal variations in the LST and its impact on the vegetation of the Indus delta, using satellite data for the past 27 years (1990-2017). The analysis revealed that on average, there was an increase of 1.74 degrees C in LST during the last 27 years. The temporal variation in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of vegetation, showed the highest NDVI of 0.725 in the year 2005 followed by the year 2010 with NDVI of 0.712. While the lowest NDVI of 0.545 was observed during the year 2017. The LST was integrated with NDVI which showed a fair but negative statistical correlation with a coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.65. A correlation analysis between NDVI and the yield of the wheat crop of the Delta showed a positive relationship with R-2 = 0.89. Several factors may contribute to an increase in LST, such as an increase in residential areas, change in the cropping pattern and overall global climate change. Such studies are important for determining the climatic influences on ecological parameters.

TI  - An Approach to Multiple Change Detection in VHR Optical Images Based on Iterative Clustering and Adaptive Thresholding
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most common approaches to unsupervised change detection (CD) in multispectral images is change vector analysis (CVA). CVA computes the multispectral difference image and exploits its statistical distribution in (hyper-) spherical coordinates by means of two steps: 1) magnitude and 2) direction thresholding. The two steps require assumptions on: 1) the model of class distributions and 2) the number of changes. However, both assumptions are seldom satisfied or difficult to formulate, especially when considering VHR images. Thus, we propose an approach to multiple CD in VHR optical images based on iterative clustering and adaptive thresholding in (hyper-) spherical coordinate. The proposed approach: 1) is distribution free; 2) is unsupervised; 3) automatically identifies the number of changes; and 4) is robust to noise. Results obtained on two multitemporal single-sensor and multisensor data sets, including images from WorldView-2 and QuickBird, corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Effects of vertical accuracy of digital elevation model (DEM) data on automatic lineaments extraction from shaded DEM
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data, such as satellite images, and remote sensing derived digital elevation models (DEMs) are credited by simplifying many geological processes that require costly and laborious field work, such as lineament extraction. Furthermore, the recent increase in the availability of DEMs from many free open sources as well as their advantages over satellite imagery have promoted their wide application as remote sensing methods for lineament extraction. The quality of a DEM affects the results of its application, and this quality is controlled by its vertical accuracy and spatial resolution. The objectives of this study were to assess and verify the effects of the vertical accuracies of DEMs on lineament extraction. The area around Baoji city, Shaanxi province, China, was selected as a case study and the lineaments were automatically extracted using the LINE algorithm of PCI Geomatica from three DEMs with different vertical accuracies: tri stereo ZY3 imagery derived DEM, SRTM1V3, and ASTGDEMV2. All of these DEMs have 1 '' spatial resolution (approx. 30 m). The results showed that the vertical accuracy of the applied DEM affects the number, length, and density of the extracted lineaments, where these quantities increase with increasing vertical accuracy of the DEM.

TI  - Impact of urban spatial configuration on land surface temperature and urban heat islands: a case study of Mashhad, Iran
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) are among important urban development issues in environmental and ecological climate changes. In this context, the urban spatial configuration is one of the factors that play a significant role in the formation of UHIs. This study investigates how urban spatial configuration affects land surface temperature (LST) and formation of UHI in Mashhad urban area, located in the northeast of Iran. The objectives of this study include (i) building quantitative relationships between LST and spatial configuration properties and (ii) representing the impacts of urban morphology on LST and climate changes. The methodology of this study is based on the space syntax and image processing theories and techniques. With respect to these two objectives, we (1) extracted the surface temperature (LST) by Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor image dated June 27, 2014, by ENVI 4.7 software, (2) provided an axial map of Mashhad city in Auto Cad 2007 environment, (3) analyzed spatial configuration by UCL Depthmap 10, and (4) employed transect model and gradient analysis and measured the measured the Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regression between LST and spatial configuration. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the two variables was found as R=-0.394, which demonstrates that the LST is negatively correlated with integration. The results showed that land surfaces with high temperature are spatially segregated from the whole urban configuration and the integrated urban space has less temperature than other spaces.

TI  - Automatic Semi-Global Artificial Shoreline Subpixel Localization Algorithm for Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline mapping using satellite remote sensing images has the advantages of large-scale surveys and high efficiency. However, low spatial resolution, various geometric morphologies and complex offshore environments prevent accurate positioning of the shoreline. This article proposes a semi-global subpixel shoreline localization method that considers utilizing morphological control points to divide the initial artificial shoreline into segments of relatively simple morphology and analyzing the local intensity homogeneity to calculate the intensity integral error. Combined with the segmentation-merge-fitting method, the algorithm determines the subpixel location accurately. In experiments, we select five artificial shorelines with various geometric morphologies from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. The five subpixel artificial shoreline RMSE results lie in the range of 3.02 m to 4.77 m, with line matching results varying from 2.51 m to 3.72 m. Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed subpixel localization algorithm is effective and applicable to artificial shoreline in various geometric morphologies and is robust to complex offshore environments, to some extent.

TI  - Implication of data uncertainty in the detection of surface radiation trends and observational evidence of renewed solar dimming over India
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of the daily surface solar radiation (SSR) data over the 12 stations spread across India revealed that the data have many missing values and significant variability, which induce large uncertainties in the seasonal and annual means. Since the number of missing values and data variability change over time, ignoring them in the trend analysis, as done in most previous studies, may lead to erroneous results. We propose a method to incorporate the data uncertainty in the trend analysis and compare it with the traditional method, that ignores uncertainty, using the synthetic data with a known trend and having a different percentage of missing values. The proposed method is able to capture the trends in more than 85% of the cases, whereas the traditional method does it for less than 70% of the cases. Analysis of the SSR data by the proposed method revealed a renewed stronger solar dimming of about - 45 W/m(2) per decade over the last decade (2006-2015) at all the 12 stations. Analysis of an independent satellite-derived SSR data from the Breathing Earth System Simulator (generated using the MODIS satellite data) also showed the significantly decreasing trends of about - 20 W/m(2) per decade in the annual SSR over the entire India. The SSR proxies (sunshine duration and diurnal temperature range) and the wind speed also exhibited the trends consistent with the renewed dimming and suggest that it can be attributed to the increasing aerosol concentration over India in the recent decade.

TI  - Combining ASNARO-2 XSAR HH and Sentinel-1 C-SAR VH/VV Polarization Data for Improved Crop Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Satellite with New system ARchitecture for Observation-2 (ASNARO-2), which carries the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (XSAR), was launched on 17 January 2018 and is expected to be used to supplement data provided by larger satellites. Land cover classification is one of the most common applications of remote sensing, and the results provide a reliable resource for agricultural field management and estimating potential harvests. This paper describes the results of the first experiments in which ASNARO-2 XSAR data were applied for agricultural crop classification. In previous studies, Sentinel-1 C-SAR data have been widely utilized to identify crop types. Comparisons between ASNARO-2 XSAR and Sentinel-1 C-SAR using data obtained in June and August 2018 were conducted to identify five crop types (beans, beetroot, maize, potato, and winter wheat), and the combination of these data was also tested. To assess the potential for accurate crop classification, some radar vegetation indices were calculated from the backscattering coefficients for two dates. In addition, the potential of each type of SAR data was evaluated using four popular supervised learning models: Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), multilayer feedforward neural network (FNN), and kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM). The combination of ASNARO-2 XSAR and Sentinel-1 C-SAR data was effective, and overall classification accuracies of 85.4 +/- 1.8% were achieved using SVM.

TI  - First Results of Phytoplankton Spatial Dynamics in Two NW-Mediterranean Bays from Chlorophyll-a Estimates Using Sentinel 2: Potential Implications for Aquaculture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shellfish aquaculture has a major socioeconomic impact on coastal areas, thus it is necessary to develop support tools for its management. In this sense, phytoplankton monitoring is crucial, as it is the main source of food for shellfish farming. The aim of this study was to assess the applicability of Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery (MSI) to monitor the phytoplankton biomass at Ebro Delta bays and to assess its potential as a tool for shellfish management. In situ chlorophyll-a data from Ebro Delta bays (NE Spain) were coupled with several band combination and band ratio spectral indices derived from Sentinel 2A levels 1C and 2A for time-series mapping. The best results (AIC = 72.17, APD < 10%, and MAE < 0.7 mg/m(3)) were obtained with a simple blue-to-green ratio applied over Rayleigh corrected images. Sentinel 2-derived maps provided coverage of the farm sites at both bays allowing relating the spatiotemporal distribution of phytoplankton with the environmental forcing under different states of the bays. The applied methodology will be further improved but the results show the potential of using Sentinel 2 MSI imagery as a tool for assessing phytoplankton spatiotemporal dynamics and to encourage better future practices in the management of the aquaculture in Ebro Delta bays.

TI  - Long-term coastal erosion assessment along the coast of Karnataka, west coast of India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal areas are always under frequent threat from various natural processes and man-induced activities. Coastal erosion is recognized as the permanent loss of land along the shoreline resulting in the transformation of the coast. The current study focuses on long-term coastal erosion analysis of the entire Karnataka coast using Remote Sensing, Geographical Information System (GIS), Linear Regression Rate (LRR), and End Point Rate (EPR) techniques. Analysis of 26 (1990 to 2016) years of erosion using Landsat images by the use of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) tool has been done. The results show a high erosion rate at Ullal during this period (LRR -1.3 m/yr) and accretion at Devbagh (LRR 3.2 m/yr). The southern Karnataka coast faces severe erosion especially at Ullal, where the settlement is high. At Thanirbhavi, Mukka, Kota, and Om Beaches erosion also is noticed. Both anthropogenic activities like ports, seawalls, breakwaters, etc. and natural processes like long shore drift, seasonal variation, etc. are factors affecting the shoreline change along the Karnataka coast.

TI  - Isostasy and crustal structure of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge, Western Indian Ocean: Geodynamic implications
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chagos-Laccadive Ridge (CLR), a prominent linear aseismic ridge in the Western Indian Ocean is believed to be a trace of the Reunion hotspot. In order to understand the mode of emplacement of this ridge and the nature of the underlying crust, we carried out three-dimensional (3D) flexural modelling and coherence analysis of satellite-derived gravity and bathymetry data along the ridge. The analysis revealed variations in Effective Elastic Thickness (Te) along the CLR. While the northernmost part of CLR is associated with low Te of 3 km with a subsurface to surface loading ratio (f) of 1, towards the south, the Maldive Ridge and the Chagos Bank have a fairly uniform Te of 8-10 km with a very low loading ratio f of 0.1-0.2. We consider the Laccadive Ridge as a continental sliver possessing underplated magmatic rocks caused by the Reunion hotspot volcanism. The Maldive Ridge and the Chagos Bank appear to have emplaced on a lithosphere of intermediate strength possibly on the flanks of the Central Indian Ridge.

TI  - Assessment and validation of total water storage in the Chesapeake Bay watershed using GRACE
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States, and its catchment has heterogeneous hydrological and geomorphologic characteristics. It includes seven major river basins: James, Patuxent, Potomac, Rappahannock, Susquehanna, Western Shore, Eastern Shore, and York. Remote sensing data, along with in-situ observations of streamflow and simulated water budget components, can provide significant understanding of variability in water resources availability in this diverse watershed. In this study, we quantify the terrestrial water storage using both remote sensing and in-situ data and hydrologic model outputs in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Total water storage change (TWSC) was calculated based on the combination of three methods to identify the best approach in estimating TWSC. These methods evaluated different sources of data, including Parameter elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) precipitation, MODIS ET, U.S. Geological Survey observed streamflow, and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. Estimated TWSC were in close agreement with GRACE-derived TWSC when we employed VIC-simulated streamflow after calibration with observed streamflow. However, the use of VIC-simulated ET or MODIS-derived ET yielded similar results for TWSC. Assessment of TWSC during extreme events (drought) during the summer months revealed that predicting ET is critical for TWSC in June-August and that VIC-simulated TWSC could be a reliable proxy for GRACE data to assess the water availability in the watershed.

TI  - Associations between the presence of specific antibodies to the West Nile Virus infection and candidate genes in Romanian horses from the Danube delta
T2  - MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus causing meningoencephalitis in humans and animals. Due to their particular susceptibility to WNV infection, horses serve as a sentinel species. In a population of Romanian semi-feral horses living in the Danube delta region, we have analyzed the distribution of candidate polymorphic genetic markers between anti WNV-IgG seropositive and seronegative horses. Thirty-six SNPs located in 28 immunity-related genes and 26 microsatellites located in the MHC and LY49 complex genomic regions were genotyped in 57 seropositive and 32 seronegative horses. The most significant association (p(corr)<0.0002) was found for genotypes composed of markers of the SLC11A1 and TLR4 genes. Markers of five other candidate genes (ADAM17, CXCR3, IL12A, MAVS, TNFA), along with 5 MHC class I and LY49-linked microsatellites were also associated with the WNV antibody status in this model horse population. The OAS1 gene, previously associated with WNV-induced clinical disease, was not associated with the presence of anti-WNV antibodies.

TI  - Assessment of Nonradioactive Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomographic Imaging With Conventional Lymphoscintigraphic Imaging for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Melanoma
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Themetastatic status of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) is the most relevant prognostic factor in breast cancer, melanoma, and other tumors. The conventional standard to label SLNs is lymphoscintigraphy with technetium Tc 99m. A worldwide shortage and known disadvantages of Tc 99mhave intensified efforts to establish alternative, nonradioactive imaging techniques.OBJECTIVE To assess a new nonradioactivemethod using multispectral optoacoustic tomographic (MSOT) imaging in comparison with conventional lymphoscintigraphic imaging for SLN biopsy (SLNB) in melanoma.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Analysis of a cross-sectional study was conducted at the University Hospital-Essen, Skin Cancer Center, Essen, Germany. Between June 2, 2014, and February 22, 2019, 83 patients underwent SLNB with an additional preoperative indocyanine green (ICG) application. Sentinel lymph node basins were preoperatively identified by MSOT imaging, and ICG-labeled SLNs were intraoperatively detected using a near-infrared camera. The surgeons were blinded to the lymphoscintigraphic imaging results in the beginning of the SLNB. Use of a. probewas restricted until the SLNB procedure was attempted by the nonradioactivemethod.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Concordance of SLN basins and SLNs identified by MSOT imaging plus near-infrared camera vs lymphoscintigraphic imaging plus single-photon emission computed tomographic or computed tomographic imaging was assessed.RESULTS Of the 83 patients (mean [SD] age, 54.61 [17.53] years), 47 (56.6%) were men. In 83 surgical procedures, 165 SLNs were excised. The concordance rate of ICG-labeled and Tc 99m-marked detected SLN basins was 94.6%(n = 106 of 112). Intraoperatively, 159 SLNs were detected using a near-infrared camera and 165 were detected by a. probe, resulting in a concordance rate of 96.4%. Multispectral optoacoustic tomographic imaging visualized SLNs in all anatomic regions with high penetration depth (5 cm).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this study suggest that nonradioactive SLN detection via MSOT imaging allows identification of SLNs at a frequency equivalent to that of the current radiotracer conventional standard. Multispectral optoacoustic tomographic imaging appears to be a viable nonradioactive alternative to detect SLNs in malignant tumors.

TI  - The Genre-Forming Function of the "Tragic-Grotesque" Perception of Reality in Mikhail Bulgakov's Plays
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the research, which determines the relevance and novelty of the work, is the analysis of the genre specificity of Mikhail Bulgakov's plays through the prism of his specific tragic-grotesque view of the new post-revolutionary reality. The marginal instability of this reality inspires the emergence of a special literary perception in unstable, parodic genre formations that deviate from the canons and are organized by grotesque. The material of the analytical reading is Bulgakov's plays Zoyka's Apartment, Bliss, Ivan Vasilievich, The Days of the Turbins, Flight. The study has shown the following. (1) In the tragic farce Zoyka's Apartment, there is a distinct tendency to a parodic distortion of tragedy parameters within the comedy genre. (2) The poetics of the comedic dilogy about a Soviet engineer's traveling in time - Bliss and Ivan Vasilievich - includes the codes of a tragedy in a travestized form. The codes develop the topic of the formation of a dictator's personality, which was fundamentally important for Bulgakov and irreversible for the historical time. (3) In the play The Days of the Turbins, the intensity of the tragic historical situation, the political and psychological reliability of the reflected events are depicted in the text space synthesizing various genre codes in a parodic inversion. The comedy layer of the play is associated with the image of a cousin from Zhytomyr typologically close to the tragicomic characters of losers. (4) Flight reveals the parodically interpreted comedy codes. The author's definition of the genre of the play - "Eight Dreams. A Play in Five Acts" - points to the non-classical structure of the text, emphasizing the phantasmagoricity and absurdity of the world destroyed by the revolution. Its reflection requires the absolutization of the forms of the tragedy refracted in the author's consciousness and acquiring grotesque features. As a result of the textual analysis of the plays in the genre paradigm, the following conclusions are drawn. In search of a dramaturgic form to reflect the tragically and grotesquely perceived reality, its absurdity, Mikhail Bulgakov boldly combines elements of different genres, travesties, parodies, transforms them, gives new shades to the genre features of the comedy, the tragedy, the "drama proper" (V.G. Belinsky), constructs his individual creative model of the meta-genre. Bulgakov's literary experiments in playwrighting are considered in the mainstream of the general aesthetic tendency of parody and a grotesque worldview in the Russian literature of the first third of the twentieth century.

TI  - Sea Surface Circulation Structures in the Malta-Sicily Channel from Remote Sensing Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Malta-Sicily Channel is part of the Sicily Channel system where water and thermohaline properties between the Eastern and Western Mediterranean basins take place. Several mesoscales features are detached from the main circulation due to wind and bathymetric forcing. In this paper, surface circulation structures are studied using different remotely sensed datasets: satellite data (absolute dynamic topography, Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform wind vector analysis, satellite chlorophyll and sea surface temperature) and high frequency radar data. We identified high frequency motions (at short time scales-hours to days), as well as mesoscale structures fundamental for the understanding of the Malta-Sicily Channel circulation dynamics. One of those is the Malta-Sicily Gyre; an anticyclonic structure trapped between the Sicilian and Maltese coasts, which is poorly studied in the literature and often confused with the Malta Channel Crest and the Ionian Shelf Break Vortex. In order to characterize this gyre, we calculated its kinetic properties taking advantage of the fine-scale temporal and spatial resolution of the high frequency radar data, and thus confirming its presence with an updated version of the surface circulation patterns in the area.

TI  - Use of NDVI and Landscape Metrics to Assess Effects of Riverine Inputs on Wetland Productivity and Stability
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Alterations to Louisiana's river systems and local hydrology have resulted in reduced freshwater, sediment, and nutrient inputs to wetland landscapes, causing significant negative impacts on marsh productivity and stability. This study set out to assess regional- and basin-scale impacts of river connectivity and sediment availability on wetland productivity. Satellite data were used in conjunction with river discharge, river sediment concentration, and wetland accretion data to evaluate correlations between river connectivity and wetland productivity and stability. Significant correlations were observed between river connectivity and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Aggregation Index (AI) values across a 10 year period of analysis. Moderate correlations (r(2) = 0.51) between mean NDVI and AI values were observed for all wetland vegetation in coastal Louisiana. Middle Coast wetlands had the highest river connectivity and significantly higher aboveground productivity, spatial integrity, and wetland area. The Chenier Plain, with moderate sediment and nutrient inputs, consisted primarily of moderate productivity and integrity. The majority of the inactive Deltaic Plain, which is largely sediment deprived, consists of landscapes with the lowest wetland productivity and spatial integrity. This study linked wetland area, configuration, and productivity with river connectivity to provide an enhanced understanding of river and sediment importance for wetland stability and restoration.

TI  - Recovering Evapotranspiration Trends from Biased CMIP5 Simulations and Sensitivity to Changing Climate over North America
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Future projections of evapotranspiration (ET) are of critical importance for agricultural and freshwater management and for predicting land-atmosphere feedbacks on the climate system. However, ET from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations exhibits substantial biases, bolstering little confidence in future ET projections. Despite poor predictive skill and large bias of ET from the global climate models, the information content necessary to calculate ET offline is available in the models' archived outputs: temperature T, water vapor pressure e, atmospheric pressure P, and surface net radiation R. A relatively simple three-source energy balance model [Penman-Monteith (PM)], along with the mean annual cycle of remotely sensed vegetation properties, can then be used to reconstruct ET with a substantially reduced bias relative to in situ turbulent heat flux measurements. This methodology is used here to reconstruct ET projections from 2006 through 2100 over North America using output from selected CMIP5 models and to attribute projected ET trends to specific atmospheric controls. CMIP5 ET exhibits substantial bias in annual ET relative to in situ flux measurements across North America (38%-73%; 2006-15), but ET reconstructed from the CMIP5 meteorology with the PM method greatly reduces this bias (-8% to +14%). Present-day North American ET is more sensitive to changes in atmospheric demand for ET (temperature and water vapor pressure) than energy limitation (net radiation), and to a lesser extent vegetation properties (leaf area index). Accordingly, ET is projected to increase 0.26-0.87 mm yr(-1) yr(-1) over North America through 2100 driven primarily by trends in temperature.

TI  - Estimating Soil Organic Carbon Density in the Otindag Sandy Land, Inner Mongolia, China, for modelling spatiotemporal variations and evaluating the influences of human activities
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantitative estimates of Soil Organic Carbon Density (SOCD) can effectively represent regional carbon cycle processes and regulation mechanisms, and can serve as reference data when making land management decisions. Limited research, however, has been carried out in arid or desert zones covered with sparse vegetation, despite the fact that these cover wide areas of the earth and play a significant role in global carbon cycles. In this study, the Otindag Sandy Land and its surroundings (OSLAIS) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China was selected as the study area. The study introduces a useful technique for making high spatial coverage SOCD estimates for drylands by utilizing GF-1 WFV optical satellite images and a time series of MODIS satellite remote sensing datasets, and using these to optimize parameters for simulation models in conjunction with other technical procedures that are described. The results showed that the resulting model's accuracy was 77.87%, R-2 = 0.8627, and so the SOCD estimates modelled by soil basal respiration (SBR) could be used for SOCD estimation and for analyzing the spatial distribution patterns across the OSLAIS. The average SOCD was 1.22 kgC/m(2) for the whole of the OSLAIS, and it had a heterogenous distribution pattern. The SOCD was closely related to the way the land was used in each area, and the average SOCD for the main land use types were: forest land = 2.88 kgC/m(2), farmland = 1.63 kgC/m(2), shrub land = 1.41 kgC/m(2), and grassland = 1.08 kgC/m(2). In conclusion, we believe that the proposed method, based on high-resolution GF-1 WFV data and optimized estimation models constructed by integrating climate and vegetation characteristic data, can effectively describe the spatial distribution patterns of SOC and SOCD in the OSLAIS area, in depth and in detail, especially for the areas where the SOCD values are high. We expect this research to provide useful technical support and scientific reference data for land management and for land degradation/desertification assessments, for the study area monitored, as well as across the whole dryland area of China.

TI  - Dust Storm Remote Sensing Monitoring Supported by MODIS Land Surface Reflectance Database
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) land product subsets can provide high-quality prior knowledge for the quantitative inversion of land and atmospheric parameters. Using the LSR (Land Surface Reflectance) dataset, dust storm remote sensing monitoring in this study was carried out via quality control and data synthesis. A dynamic threshold supported dust storm monitoring method was proposed based on a monthly synthesized LSR database, which is produced using MOD09A1 data. The apparent reflectance of clear-pixels with different atmospheric conditions was simulated by the radiative transfer model. A pixel can be identified as a dust pixel if the apparent reflectance is larger than that of the simulated data. The proposed method was applied to the monitoring of four dust storms, the results of which were evaluated and analyzed via visual interpretation, MICAPS (Meteorological Information Comprehensive Analysis and Process System), and the OMI AI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument Aerosol Index) with the following conclusions: the dust storm monitoring results showed that most of the dust areas could be accurately detected when compared with the true color composite images, and the dust monitoring results agreed well with the MICAPS observation station data and the OMI AI dust products.

TI  - Dynamic trend of land degradation/restoration along Indira Gandhi Canal command area in Jaisalmer District, Rajasthan, India: a case study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover is a crucial component in assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In arid regions, land cover is mostly composed of aeolian structures which exhibit fragile environmental scenario. The major challenge in this highly dynamic landscape was conversion of desertic land to intensive land use such as agricultural farmlands. To overcome this challenge Indira Gandhi Canal (IGC) and its branches were extended over this district. The main interest of this research was to investigate net primary productivity (NPP) changes using multi-temporal satellite imagery and meteorological datasets within the timeframe of 30years from 1982 to 2012 over this region. This study was taken up to assess the impact of canal in and around IGC command area in Jaisalmer District to understand the consequence on desertic environment. Analysis of three decades terrestrial NPP over IGC command area in Jaisalmer District, India, shows significant increase in NPP. The satellite data-based analysis of NPP as well as validation with the optical data in the study region revealed that this increasing trend in NPP is basically associated to increase in canal networks. The water supply from the canal gradually led to expansion of irrigation in the agricultural fields leading to change in dynamics of the area. This systematic and long-term NPP analysis will be useful to strengthen our understanding for the role of regional land cover types and impact of their change in the national and global carbon cycle for understanding land degradation and desertification scenario in the study area.

TI  - From ecological macroeconomics to a theory of endogenous money for a finite planet
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper takes stock of the achievements and gaps of the emerging field of ecological macroeconomics, which has brought insights from specific schools of macroeconomics-most notably post-Keynesian-to ecological economics, with a strong emphasis on the endogeneity of money. Ecological macroeconomics has proposed fiscal, monetary and prudential reforms to boost 'green' investments, and developed new modeling frameworks to explore the interactions between the financial, macroeconomic and biophysical spheres. While these proposals open a broader range of possibilities to engage in a sodo-ecological transition than those offered by the current paradigm of a financialized global economy, they paradoxically suffer from similar limitations. By placing much faith in 'green' investments, they impose a vision of the transition that presents strong technical and institutional limitations. The field also fails to revisit its own understanding of macroeconomics and of specific phenomena-e.g. financial instability-through a biophysical lens, in spite of increasing transdisciplinary evidence supporting this approach. We suggest overcoming these limitations through institutionalist perspectives that understand money as a language through which value is created and legitimized. Those perspectives seem essential to re-embed the governance of money within a worldview that acknowledges the finiteness and incommensurable values of Earth's life support systems.

TI  - Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Detection and Surveillance: Advances of Liquid Biomarkers
T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE
M3  - Review
AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas are aggressive tumors that often present at advanced stage in difficult-to-biopsy regions of the head and neck. With the rapid move to analyze circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to either detect cancer or monitor disease progression and response to therapy, we have designed this article as a primer to understand the recent studies that support a transition to use these circulating biomarkers as a part of routine clinical care. Whereas some technical challenges still need to be overcome, the utility of ctDNA in cancer care is already evident from these early studies. Therefore, it is critical to understand recent advances in this area as well as emerging questions that need to be addressed as these biomarkers move closer to enhancing routine clinical care paradigms.

TI  - Dataset for landscape pattern analysis from a climatic perspective
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Revealing the driving forces of changes in landscape pattern is a key question of landscape ecology and landscape analysis. Temperature and precipitation as climatic variables have a dominant role in triggering vegetation changes; thus, a database, which contain their interaction, can support the understanding of spatio-temporal changes in vegetation patterns even on a large scale. The dataset provided in this article contain the R-squared values of bivariate linear regression analysis between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (target variable; as a general quantitative descriptor of surface greenness) of the TERRA satellite's MODIS sensor and the climatic variables of the CarpatClim database (predictor variables; maximum monthly temperature, aridification index, evapotranspiration and precipitation). Environmental variables are also included to support further analysis: terrain height, macro regions, land cover classes. The dataset has a spatial projection (i.e. maps) and covers the area of Hungary. Tabular version provides the possibility of traditional statistical analysis, while maps allow the investigation to involve the spatial characteristics of absolute and relative position of the data points. This data article is related to the paper "NDVI dynamics as reflected in climatic variables: spatial and temporal trends - a case study of Hungary" (Szabo et al., 2019). (c) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Integrating Remotely Sensed and GIS Data for the Detailed Geological Mapping in Semi-Arid Regions: Case of Youks les Bains Area, Tebessa Province, NE Algeria
T2  - GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed geologic mapping provides valuable informations about the spatial distribution of lithological outcrops and lineaments; required to carry out the necessary investigations of the geologic, geotechnical and hydrogeological data investigation. The unavailability of geologic coverage at meduim scale in the Nementcha mountains has severely hampered geoscientist to develop and test their hypotheses. In order to exploit multispectral datasets for the characterization of surface materials; Sentinel-2A data was used in the discrimination of geological classes along Youks les Bain area, extreme NE of Algeria. Resampling, orthorectification, atmospheric correction, and radiometric normalization have been applied to the Sentinel-2A radiance data, identified as the first and most important step in processing. The 12/4, 11/3 and 8/4 band ratios combination was adopted to discriminate the different lithologies. Then, to reduce redundant information in highly correlated bands, the principal component analysis has been implemented. The directional filters were applied to undertaken the lineamentary mapping. At last the project was exported and processed in GIS spatial database. The result allows the discrimination of the lithological boundaries and help to a better understanding of the local geology of the study area. The project digital databases represents a key tool to support research activities in the West of Tebessa region.

TI  - Gravity and geoid changes by the 2004 and 2012 Sumatra earthquakes from satellite gravimetry and ocean altimetry
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We first report the results from analyzing the GRACE satellite data for the co-seismic and long-term post-seismic changes in the Earth's gravity field and geoid height induced by the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake (Mw 9.2) and the 2012 Indian-Ocean earthquake (Mw 8.6). The results suggest that the two earthquakes have changed the gravity field and geoid height irreversibly (as opposed to cyclically). We next use satellite ocean altimetry measurements to search for the geoid height change induced by the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, employing an effective method of extracting coherent space-temporal signals, namely the empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) analysis. Our results demonstrate that the sea level variation in the studied (tropical) area during the studied (10-year) period is dominated by the strong steric changes related to ENSO, to the point that the earthquake-induced signals, even using EOF for the largest earthquakes, are obscured and thus undetectable by ocean altimetry. However, this also means that steric and non-steric changes can be observed separately from artificial satellites.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node-Targeted Therapy by Oncolytic Sendai Virus Suppresses Micrometastasis of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma in an orthotopic Nude Mouse Model
T2  - MOLECULAR CANCER THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In clinical N0 (cN0) cases with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a treatment selection is still controversial: elective neck dissection or watchful waiting. We focused on sentinel lymph node (SLN)-targeted therapy using the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)-dependent oncolytic Sendai virus "BioKnife." The objectives of this study were to investigate BioKnife migration into SLNs and elucidate its antitumor effect on lymph node metastases (LNM). We established an orthotopic nude mouse model of HNSCC, with LNM being frequently induced. We inoculated HSC-3-M3, human highly metastatic tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells, in the tongue of the nude mice, and after 2 weeks, we injected BioKnife into the primary tumor. We tracked BioKnife migration into the SLNs by immunostaining, RT-PCR, and an in vivo imaging system. We also examined its antitumor effects and mechanisms through serial section analysis of lymph nodes. GFP reporter expression was clearly visible in the lymph nodes of virus groups, which corresponded to SLNs. Relative GFP mRNA was significantly increased in both the tongues and lymph nodes in the virus groups compared with that in the control group (P < 0.05). Serial section analysis showed that BioKnife infected cancer cells and exhibited significant antitumor effect against LNM compared with the control groups (P < 0.05). We detected apoptosis in LNM infected by BioKnife. BioKnife migrated into SLNs after its injection into the primary tumor and effectively suppressed LNM, suggesting that SLN-targeted therapy using BioKnife has great potential to provide a novel and promising alternative to elective neck dissection in cN0 patients with HNSCC.

T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mitotic rate is no longer considered a staging criterion for thin melanoma in the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual. The aim of this observational study was to identify prognostic factors for thin melanoma and predictors and prognostic significance of sentinel lymph node (SLN) involvement in a large multicenter cohort of patients with melanoma from nine tertiary care hospitals. A total of 4249 consecutive patients with thin melanoma diagnosed from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2016 were included. The main outcomes were disease-free interval and melanoma-specific survival for the overall population and predictors of SLN metastasis (n = 1083). Associations between survival and SLN status and different clinical and pathologic variables (sex, age, tumor location, mitosis, ulceration, regression, lymphovascular invasion, histologic subtype, Clark level, and Breslow thickness) were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression and logistic regression. SLN status was the most important prognostic factor for melanoma-specific survival (hazard ratio, 13.8; 95% CI, 6.1-31.2; P < 0.001), followed by sex, ulceration, and Clark level for patients who underwent SLNB. A mitotic rate of >2 mitoses/mm(2) was the only factor associated with a positive SLN biopsy (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.22-7; P = 0.01. SLN status is the most important prognostic factor in thin melanoma. A high mitotic rate is associated with metastatic SLN involvement. SLN biopsy should be discussed and recommended in patients with thin melanoma and a high mitotic rate.

TI  - Livelihood and Environmental Impacts of Payments for Forest Environmental Services: A Case Study in Vietnam
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Payments for ecosystem services (PES) is widely employed in various settings; however, whether, and in what contexts, PES programs achieve their objectives by improving local livelihoods and conservation goals is still being debated. This paper aims to evaluate the impacts of payments for forest environmental services (PFES) policies on livelihoods and the environment using propensity score matching of data on 725 systematic randomly selected households in the buffer zones of seven protected areas (PAs) of Quang Nam and Thua Thien Hue provinces in Central Vietnam and data from the General Statistics Office and Landsat. The findings indicate that the PFES policy has some positive effects on economic and environmental issues for different groups. In terms of financial capital, the study found that poor households with PFES have slightly higher income than what they would have had they not participated in PFES. The difference in total income between poor households with and without PFES, however, was statistically insignificant, while the income of non-poor households with PFES was significantly higher than those without PFES. In addition, PFES households are likely to have more consumption expenditure for their daily living and better access to loans from various microfinance sources compared to those without PFES. The PFES policy has provided slight changes in the forest and forest cover and reduced natural forest loss between the pre-PFES and PFES periods. The findings of this study contribute to designing future PFES policies that can better distribute benefits to all household groups as well as harmonize social and natural capital.

TI  - A carbon sink-driven approach to estimate gross primary production from microwave satellite observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global estimation of Gross Primary Production (GPP) - the uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide by plants through photosynthesis - is commonly based on optical satellite remote sensing data. This presents a source driven approach since it uses the amount of absorbed light, the main driver of photosynthesis, as a proxy for GPP. Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) estimates obtained from microwave sensors provide an alternative and independent data source to estimate GPP on a global scale, which may complement existing GPP products. Recent studies have shown that VOD is related to aboveground biomass, and that both VOD and temporal changes in VOD relate to GPP. In this study, we build upon this concept and propose a model for estimating GPP from VOD. Since the model is driven by vegetation biomass, as observed through VOD, it presents a carbon sink driven approach to quantify GPP and, therefore, is conceptually different from common source-driven approaches. The model developed in this study uses single frequencies from active or passive microwave VOD retrievals from C-, X- and Ku-band (Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observation (AMSR-E)) to estimate GPP at the global scale. We assessed the ability for temporal and spatial extrapolation of the model using global GPP from FLUXCOM and in situ GPP from FLUXNET. We further performed upscaling of in situ GPP based on different VOD data sets and compared these estimates with the FLUXCOM and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP products. Our results show that the model developed for individual grid cells using VOD and change in VOD as input performs well in predicting temporal patterns in GPP for all VOD data sets. For spatial extrapolation of the model, however, additional input variables are needed to represent the spatial variability of the VOD-GPP relationship due to differences in vegetation type. As additional input variable, we included the grid cell median VOD (as a proxy for vegetation cover), which increased the model performance during cross validation. Mean annual GPP obtained for AMSR-E X-band data tends to overestimate mean annual GPP for FLUXCOM and MODIS but shows comparable latitudinal patterns. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of VOD for estimating GPP. The sink-driven approach provides additional information about GPP independent of optical data, which may contribute to our knowledge about the carbon source-sink balance in different ecosystems.

Early detection and up-to-date information regarding its distribution is, therefore, crucial in understanding its spatial configuration and propagation rate. The present study, thus, sought to map the seasonal dynamics of invasive water hyacinth, in Greater Letaba river system in Limpopo Province, South Africa, using Sentinel-2 data and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Classification test results showed that seasonal water hyacinth distribution patterns can be accurately detected and mapped, using Sentinel-2 data with high accuracies. Water hyacinth was mapped with an overall accuracy of 80.79% during the wet season, and 79.04% during the dry season, with kappa coefficients of 0.76 and 0.724, respectively, using combined vegetation indices and spectral bands. The use of spectral bands (wet: 79.48% and dry: 75.98%) and vegetation indices (wet: 76.42% and dry: 74.42%) as independent dataset yielded slighter lower accuracies when compared to the use of the combined dataset. Further, areal coverage results showed that approximately 63.82% and 28.34% of the river system was infested with water hyacinth during wet and dry seasons, respectively. Findings of this study underscore the importance of new generation sensors in detecting and mapping the seasonal distribution of water hyacinth in river systems. Overall such findings provide a baseline or provide a framework for developing invasive aquatic species management and eradication strategies.

TI  - A statistical characterisation of the distribution of a cloud of space debris after a break-up in orbit
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims at proposing a new way of statistically characterising the spatial distribution of a cloud of space debris generated by a fragmentation in orbit, by using a family of functions that is well-known in applied mathematics. Such a family can be very convenient to describe through a few parameters the main features affecting the dynamical evolution of the whole cloud, and the mutual distance between objects within the cloud, at different epochs. The tested population of space debris is supposed to be a configuration of points resulting from the realisation of a point process and what we call "exploratory tools" from spatial statistics are applied to it. The role played by some parameters driving the breakup or the dynamical model on the statistical results is investigated with examples based on Fengyun-1C-like and Molniya-like cases.

TI  - Can we Monitor Height of Native Grasslands in Uruguay with Earth Observation?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In countries where livestock production based on native grasslands is an important economic activity, information on structural characteristics of forage is essential to support national policies and decisions at the farm level. Remote sensing is a good option for quantifying large areas in a relative short time, with low cost and with the possibility of analyzing annual evolution. This work aims at contributing to improve grazing management, by evaluating the ability of remote sensing information to estimate forage height, as an estimator of available biomass. Field data (forage height) of 20 commercial paddocks under grazing conditions (322 samples), and their relation to MODIS data (FPAR, LAI, MIR, NIR, Red, NDVI and EVI) were analyzed. Correlations between remote sensing information and field measurements were low, probably due to the extremely large variability found within each paddock for field observations (CV: Around 75%) and much lower when considering satellite information (MODIS: CV: 4%-6% and Landsat:CV: 12%). Despite this, the red band showed some potential (with significant correlation coefficient values in 41% of the paddocks) and justifies further exploration. Additional work is needed to find a remote sensing method that can be used to monitor grasslands height.

TI  - Weak average liquid-cloud-water response to anthropogenic aerosols
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The cooling of the Earth's climate through the effects of anthropogenic aerosols on clouds offsets an unknown fraction of greenhouse gas warming. An increase in the amount of water inside liquid-phase clouds induced by aerosols, through the suppression of rain formation, has been postulated to lead to substantial cooling, which would imply that the Earth's surface temperature is highly sensitive to anthropogenic forcing. Here we provide direct observational evidence that, instead of a strong increase, aerosols cause a relatively weak average decrease in the amount of water in liquid-phase clouds compared with unpolluted clouds. Measurements of polluted clouds downwind of various anthropogenic sources-such as oil refineries, smelters, coal-fired power plants, cities, wildfires and ships-reveal that aerosol-induced cloud-water increases, caused by suppressed rain formation, and decreases, caused by enhanced evaporation of cloud water, partially cancel each other out. We estimate that the observed decrease in cloud water offsets 23% of the global climate-cooling effect caused by aerosol-induced increases in the concentration of cloud droplets. These findings invalidate the hypothesis that increases in cloud water cause a substantial climate cooling effect and translate into reduced uncertainty in projections of future climate.

TI  - Using annual Landsat imagery to identify harvesting over a range of intensities for non-industrial family forests
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of forested landscapes dominated by many small private forest owners is difficult or not possible without spatially explicit and up-to-date information on land cover change. Analysis of time series multispectral data from the Landsat series of satellites have the spatial and temporal characteristics required to detect sub-hectare and non-stand replacing harvest events over large areas. We identified harvests that occurred in six western upper Michigan counties from 1985 to 2011 using Landsat best available pixel (BAP) image composites and the Composite2Change (C2C) approach. We detected a total of 7071 harvesting events with size ranging from 0.5 to 171.36 ha and average size of 6.42 ha, and analyzed their temporal trajectory. To gain confidence in our harvest mapping, we compared our findings to the overlapping decade of Global Forest Watch (GFW) data. Agreement between the datasets was high, with 94.24% of the C2C and GFW harvest pixels identified with the same change year and improving to 98.74% within +/- 1 year. This automated harvest detection system, which can capture small and otherwise missed harvests, is valuable to natural resource agencies responsible for monitoring and compliance with regulations over large areas, and researchers requiring estimates of harvest levels and the nature of forest cover status and trends on family forests.

TI  - A Precision Agriculture Approach for Durum Wheat Yield Assessment Using Remote Sensing Data and Yield Mapping
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of big data in agriculture, enhanced by free remote sensing data and on-board sensor-based data, provides an opportunity to understand within-field and year-to-year variability and promote precision farming practices for site-specific management. This paper explores the performance in durum wheat yield estimation using different technologies and data processing methods. A state-of-the-art data cleaning technique has been applied to data from a yield monitoring system, giving a good agreement between yield monitoring data and hand sampled data. The potential use of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images in precision agriculture for within-field production variability is then assessed, and the optimal time for remote sensing to relate to durum wheat yield is also explored. Comparison of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI) with yield monitoring data reveals significant and highly positive linear relationships (r ranging from 0.54 to 0.74) explaining most within-field variability for all the images acquired between March and April. Remote sensing data analyzed with these methods could be used to assess durum wheat yield and above all to depict spatial variability in order to adopt site-specific management and improve productivity, save time and provide a potential alternative to traditional farming practices.

TI  - Analysis of Site-dependent <i>Pinus halepensis</i> Mill. Defoliation Caused by "Candidatus <i>Phytoplasma pini</i>' through Shape Selection in Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High levels of Candidatus Phytoplasma pini' have produced extensive forest mortality on Pinus halepensis Mill forests in eastern Spain. This has led to the widespread levels of forest mortality. We used archival Landsat imagery and shapes algorithm implemented in the Google Earth Engine to explore the potential of the LandTrendr algorithm and its outputs, together with field observations, to analyze and predict the health status in P. halepensis stands affected by Candidatus Phytoplasma pini' in Andalusia (south-eastern Spain). We found that the Landsat time series algorithm (LandTrendr) has captured both long- and short-duration trends and changes in spectral reflectance related to phytoplasma disturbance in the Aleppo pine forest stands investigated. The normalized burn ratio (NBR) trends were positively associated with environmental variables: Annual precipitation, mean temperature, soil depth, percent base saturation and aspect. Environmental variables were tested for their contributions to the mapping of changes in Aleppo pine cover in the study area, as an empirical modeling approach to disturbance mapping in forests of south-eastern Spain. The methodology outlined in this paper has produced valuable results that indicate new possibilities for the use in forest management of remote-sensing technologies based on spectral trajectories associated with pest-diseases defoliation. Given the likely increase in pest risks in the forests of southern Europe, accurate assessment and map of pest outbreaks on forests will become increasingly important, both for research and for practical applications in forest management.

TI  - Semi-Supervised Classification and Landscape Metrics for Mapping and Spatial Pattern Change Analysis of Tropical Forest Types in Thua Thien Hue Province, Vietnam
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research Highlights: In this study, we classified natural forest into four forest types using time-series multi-source remotely sensed data through a proposed semi-supervised model developed and validated for mapping forest types and assessing forest transition in Vietnam. Background and Objectives: Data on current forest state and changes detection are always essential for forest management and planning. There is, therefore, a need for improved tools to classify and evaluate forest dynamics more accurately and effectively. Our objective is to develop such tools using a semi-supervised model and landscape metrics to classify and map changes in natural forest types by using multi-source remotely sensed data. Materials and Methods: A combination of Landsat data with PALSAR and PALSAR-2 was used for forest classification through the proposed semi-supervised model. This model turned a kernel least square into a self-learning algorithm, trained by a small number of samples with given labels, and then used this classifier to assign labels to the unlabeled data. The overall accuracy, kappa, user's accuracy, and producer's accuracy were used to evaluate the classification accuracy by comparing the classified image with the results of ground truth interpretation. Based on the classified images, forest transition was evaluated using certain landscape metrics at the class and landscape levels. Results: The multi-source data approach achieved improved discrimination of forest types compared to only using single data (optical or radar data). Good classification accuracies were obtained, with kappas of 0.81, 0.76, and 0.74 for the years 2007, 2010, and 2016, respectively. The analysis of landscape metrics indicated that there were different behaviors in the four forest types, as well as provided much information about the trends in spatial pattern changes. Conclusions: This study highlights the utilization of a semi-supervised model in forest classification, and the analysis of forest transition using landscape metrics. However, future research should include a comparison of different models to estimate the improvement of the proposed model. Another important study that should be conducted is to test the proposed method on larger areas.

TI  - A Combination of PROBA-V/MODIS-Based Products with Sentinel-1 SAR Data for Detecting Wet and Dry Snow Cover in Mountainous Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, we explore the value of employing both vegetation indexes as well as land surface temperature derived from Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation (PROBA-V) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors, respectively, to support the detection of total (wet + dry) snow cover extent (SCE) based on a simple tuning machine learning approach and provide reliability maps for further analysis. We utilize Sentinel-1-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations, including backscatter coefficient, interferometric coherence, and polarimetric parameters, and four topographical factors as well as vegetation and temperature information to detect the total SCE with a land cover-dependent random forest-based approach. Our results show that the overall accuracy and F-measure are over 90% with an 'Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (ROC)' (AUC) score of approximately 80% over five study areas located in different mountain ranges, continents, and hemispheres. These accuracies are also confirmed by a comprehensive validation approach with different data sources, attesting the robustness and global transferability. Additionally, based on the reliability maps, we find an inversely proportional relationship between classification reliability and vegetation density. In conclusion, comparing to a previous study only utilizing SAR-based observations, the method proposed in the present study provides a complementary approach to achieve a higher total SCE mapping accuracy while maintaining global applicability with reliable accuracy and corresponding uncertainty information.

TI  - Analysis of the seasonal velocity difference of the Greenland Russell glacier using multi-sensor data
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To fulfil the strong need for monitoring seasonal difference of velocity over the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS), we developed an approach based on the fusion of multiple temporal and multi sensor remote sensing observations. We used spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data over the Russell glacier in southwestern Greenland. Firstly, offset tracking and InSAR time series analyses were employed for deriving the glacier's velocity in planimetric and line of sight (LOS) directions. Next, a three-dimensional (3D) decomposition was applied for estimating the 3D velocity vectors of the glacier. Once the reliability of the results was validated, a numerical ice sheet model (ISM) was further applied to derive the modelled basal friction in different seasons. We concluded that the overall data integration using multiple open-accessed satellite image employed in this study demonstrated a decent method to analyze seasonal velocity difference of the Russell glacier. Based on the proposed monitoring strategy, it is of great potential to further investigate other polar and inland glaciers with various remote sensed data.

TI  - Discovering floristic and geoecological gradients across Amazonia
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim To map and interpret floristic and geoecological patterns across the Amazon basin by combining extensive field data with basin-wide Landsat imagery and climatic data. Location Amazonia. Taxon Ground truth data on ferns and lycophytes; remote sensing results reflect forest canopy properties. Methods We used field plot data to assess main ecological gradients across Amazonia and to relate floristic ordination axes to soil base cation concentration, Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earth's Land Surface Areas (CHELSA) climatic variables and reflectance values from a basin-wide Landsat image composite with generalized linear models. Ordination axes were then predicted across all Amazonia using Landsat and CHELSA, and a regional subdivision was obtained using k-medoid classification. Results The primary floristic gradient was strongly related to base cation concentration in the soil, and the secondary gradient to climatic variables. The Landsat image composite revealed a tapestry of broad-scale variation in canopy reflectance characteristics across Amazonia. Ordination axis scores predicted using Landsat and CHELSA variables produced spatial patterns consistent with existing knowledge on soils, geology and vegetation, but also suggested new floristic patterns. The clearest dichotomy was between central Amazonia and the peripheral areas, and the available data supported a classification into at least eight subregions. Main conclusions Landsat data are capable of predicting soil-related species compositional patterns of understorey ferns and lycophytes across the Amazon basin with surprisingly high accuracy. Although the exact floristic relationships may differ among plant groups, the observed ecological gradients must be relevant for other plants as well, since surface reflectance recorded by satellites is mostly influenced by the tree canopy. This opens exciting prospects for species distribution modelling, conservation planning, and biogeographical and ecological studies on Amazonian biota. Our maps provide a preliminary geoecological subdivision of Amazonia that can now be tested and refined using field data of other plant groups and from hitherto unsampled areas.

TI  - A Theoretical Literature Review on the Social Identity Model of Organizational Leadership
T2  - ADVANCES IN DEVELOPING HUMAN RESOURCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The Problem Leadership is commonly represented as being an individual construct with characteristics, competencies, and traits that identify the individual. Leadership development interventions are also framed around the individual leader. Leadership needs to account for the perceptions and identities of all group members. This includes a leader who is a prototype of both the in-group and out-group members. The Solution Leadership development efforts could be designed to account for the different identities of all members involved, producing a representative prototypical leader. Implementing the social identity model of organizational leadership (SIMOL) theory could be the catalyst that furthers human resource development (HRD)'s efforts of providing a new Worldview of Leadership as called for by McLean and Beigi, one that is all inclusive of its membership. The Stakeholders Considering the SIMOL theory, HRD scholars and scholar-practitioners could offer new perspectives when viewing the leader-group dynamics and leadership development.

TI  - The Use of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Images and Open-Source Software for Cultural Heritage: An Example from Paphos Area in Cyprus for Mapping Landscape Changes after a 5.6 Magnitude Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Active satellite remote sensors have emerged in the last years in the field of archaeology, providing new tools for monitoring extensive cultural heritage landscapes and areas. These active sensors, namely synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites, provide systematic datasets for mapping land movements triggered from earthquakes, landslides, and so on. Copernicus, the European program for monitoring the environment, provides continuous radar datasets through the Sentinel-1 mission with an almost worldwide coverage. This paper aims to demonstrate how the use of open-access and freely distributed datasets such as those under the Copernicus umbrella, along with the exploitation of open-source radar processing software, namely the sentinel applications platform (SNAP) and SNAPHU tools, provided respectively by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the University of Stanford, can be used to extract an SAR interferogram in the wider area of Paphos, located in the western part of Cyprus. The city includes various heritage sites and monuments, some of them already included in the UNESCO World Heritage list. The interferogram was prepared to study the effects of an earthquake to the buildings and sites of the area. The earthquake of a 5.6 magnitude on the Richter scale was triggered on 15 April 2015 and was strongly felt throughout the whole island. The interferogram results were based on Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (D-InSAR) methodology, finding a maximum uplift of 74 mm and a maximum subsidence of 31 mm. The overall process and methodology are presented in this paper.

TI  - The role of sentinel node in early ovarian cancer: a systematic review
T2  - MINERVA MEDICA
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early ovarian cancer (EOC) is defined as ovarian cancer macroscopically limited to the ovaries at the time of initial diagnosis. Approximately only 25% of patients with ovarian cancer are affected by EOC. This condition requires complete surgical staging, including systematic lymphadenectomy up to the level of the renal vessels, with the consequent risk of complications and morbidity. With the aim to reduce the procedure-related morbidity, sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNm) has been introduced as an experimental procedure in EOC staging. The aim of the present study is to systematically review the available series on this interesting issue.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Studies were identified by searching electronic databases. The search was systematically applied to PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov , Scopus and Web of Science looking for records describing the use of sentinel lymph node technique in EOC from January 1st, 1989 to January 1st, 2019. A total of 10 studies were identified for inclusion. Of the 121 patients involved in these studies, only 43 had a histologically-confirmed diagnosis of EOC and were included in the present analysis.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: SLN (paraaortic and/or pelvic) overall detection rate (DR) was of 97.6%. The overall sensitivity (SS) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the included cases were 66.7% and 96.6%, respectively. We calculated also NPV, SS and DR based on the anatomical lymph node district, with a value of 100% both in the lumbo-aortic and in the pelvic district and a DR of 83.3% and 43% respectively.CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that evidence on SLNm in EOC is still scant. Based on the limited data available, SLNm may provide potentially useful information on nodal status in patients affected by this disease.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of Mapping Cropping Patterns on Smallholder Scale Croplands Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of paramount importance to have sustainable agriculture since agriculture is the backbone of many nations' economic development. Majority of agricultural professionals rarely capture the cropping patterns necessary to promote Good Agricultural Practises. Objective of this research is to explore the potential of mapping cropping patterns occurring on different field parcels on small-scale farmlands in Zimbabwe. The first study location under investigation are the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) research station and a few neighboring fields, the second is Middle Sabi Estate. Fourier time series modeling was implemented to determine the trends befalling on the two study sites. Results reveal that Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series allow detection of subtle changes that occur to the crops and fields respectively, hence can be utilized to detect cropping patterns on small-scale farmlands. Discrimination of the main crops (maize and soybean) grown at CIMMYT was possible, and crop rotation was synthesized where sowing starts in November. A single cropping of early and late crops was observed, there were no winter crops planted during the investigation period. At Middle Sabi Estate, single cropping on perennial sugarcane fields and triple cropping of fields growing leafy vegetables, tomatoes and onions were observed. Classification of stacked images was used to derive the crop rotation maps representing what is practised at the farming lands. Random forest classification of the multi-temporal image stacks achieved overall accuracies of 99% and 95% on the respective study sites. In conclusion, Sentinel-1 time series can be implemented effectively to map the cropping patterns and crop rotations occurring on small-scale farming land. We recommend the use of Sentinel-1 SAR multi-temporal data to spatially explicitly map cropping patterns of single-, double- and triple-cropping systems on both small-scale and large-scale farming areas to ensure food security.

TI  - Characteristics of the Quiet-Time Hot Spot Gravity Waves Observed by GOCE Over the Southern Andes on 5 July 2010
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze quiet-time data from the Gravity Field and Ocean Circulation Explorer satellite as it overpassed the Southern Andes at z similar or equal to 275 km on 5 July 2010 at 23 UT. We extract the 20 largest traveling atmospheric disturbances from the density perturbations and cross-track winds using Fourier analysis. Using gravity wave (GW) dissipative theory that includes realistic molecular viscosity, we search parameter space to determine which hot spot traveling atmospheric disturbances are GWs. This results in the identification of 17 GWs having horizontal wavelengths lambda(H) = 170-1,850 km, intrinsic periods tau(Ir) = 11-54 min, intrinsic horizontal phase speeds c(IH) = 245-630 m/s, and density perturbations rho'/(rho) over bar similar to 0.03-7%. We unambiguously determine the propagation direction for 11 of these GWs and find that most had large meridional components to their propagation directions. Using reverse ray tracing, we find that 10 of these GWs must have been created in the mesosphere or thermosphere. We show that mountain waves (MWs) were observed in the stratosphere earlier that day and that these MWs saturated at z similar to 70-75 km from convective instability. We suggest that these 10 Gravity Field and Ocean Circulation Explorer hot spot GWs are likely tertiary (or higher-order) GWs created from the dissipation of secondary GWs excited by the local body forces created from MW breaking. We suggest that the other GW is likely a secondary or tertiary (or higher-order) GW. This study strongly suggests that the hot spot GWs over the Southern Andes in the quiet-time middle winter thermosphere cannot be successfully modeled by conventional global circulation models where GWs are parameterized and launched in the troposphere or stratosphere.

TI  - Predicting the Spatial Distribution and Severity of Soil Erosion in the Global Tropics using Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary This research paper presents the first consistent spatial assessments of soil erosion prevalence based on Earth observation data and systematic field surveys to train models that predict soil erosion prevalence across the global tropics. The results of the study have major implications for efforts to identify land degradation hotspots and design interventions to restore degraded lands given the importance of soil erosion as a major process of land degradation globally. The paper also presents analysis of changes in soil erosion prevalence over the 15 year period from 2002 to 2017. The results of the study can also be used to better understand ecosystem health and resilience in the global tropics, for assessments of food security, and the implications of land degradation on climate change.Abstract Soil erosion has long been recognized as a major process of land degradation globally, affecting millions of hectares of land in the tropics and resulting in losses in productivity and biodiversity, decreased resilience of both marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and increased vulnerability to climate change. This paper presents an assessment of the extent of soil erosion in the global tropics at a moderate spatial resolution (500 m) based on a combination of systematic field surveys using the Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) methodology and Earth observation data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) platform. The highest erosion prevalence was observed in wooded grassland, bushland, and shrubland systems in semi-arid areas, while the lowest occurrence was observed in forests. Observed erosion decreased with increasing fractional vegetation cover, but with high rates of erosion even at 50-60% fractional cover. These findings indicate that methods to assess soil erosion need to be able to detect erosion under relatively dense vegetation cover. Model performance was good for prediction of erosion based on MODIS, with high accuracy (89% for detection) and high overall precision (AUC = 0.97). The spatial predictions from this study will allow for better targeting of interventions to restore degraded land and are also important for assessing the dynamics of land health indicators such as soil organic carbon. Given the importance of soil erosion for land degradation and that the methodology gives robust results that can be rapidly replicated at scale, we would argue that soil erosion should be included as a key indicator in international conventions such as the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.

TI  - Pathology Laboratory Surveillance in the Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance of Sexually Transmitted Infections and Blood-Borne Viruses: Protocol for a Cohort Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Passive surveillance is the principal method of sexually transmitted infection (STI) and blood-borne virus (BBV) surveillance in Australia whereby positive cases of select STIs and BBVs are notified to the state and territory health departments. A major limitation of passive surveillance is that it only collects information on positive cases and notifications are heavily dependent on testing patterns. Denominator testing data are important in the interpretation of notifications.Objective: The aim of this study is to establish a national pathology laboratory surveillance system, part of a larger national sentinel surveillance system called ACCESS (the Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance). ACCESS is designed to utilize denominator testing data to understand trends in case reporting and monitor the uptake and outcomes of testing for STIs and BBVs.Methods: ACCESS involves a range of clinical sites and pathology laboratories, each with a separate method of recruitment, data extraction, and data processing. This paper includes pathology laboratory sites only. First established in 2007 for chlamydia only, ACCESS expanded in 2012 to capture all diagnostic and clinical monitoring tests for STIs and BBVs, initially from pathology laboratories in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia, to at least one public and one private pathology laboratory in all Australian states and territories in 2016. The pathology laboratory sentinel surveillance system incorporates a longitudinal cohort design whereby all diagnostic and clinical monitoring tests for STIs and BBVs are collated from participating pathology laboratories in a line-listed format. An anonymous, unique identifier will be created to link patient data within and between participating pathology laboratory databases and to clinical services databases. Using electronically extracted, line-listed data, several indicators for each STI and BBV can be calculated, including the number of tests, unique number of individuals tested and retested, test yield, positivity, and incidence.Results: To date, over 20 million STI and BBV laboratory test records have been extracted for analysis for surveillance monitoring nationally. Recruitment of laboratories is ongoing to ensure appropriate coverage for each state and territory; reporting of indicators will occur in 2019 with publication to follow.Conclusions: The ACCESS pathology laboratory sentinel surveillance network is a unique surveillance system that collects data on diagnostic testing, management, and care for and of STIs and BBVs. It complements the ACCESS clinical network and enhances Australia's capacity to respond to STIs and BBVs.

TI  - The Sentinel Margin: Intraoperative <i>Ex Vivo</i> Specimen Mapping Using Relative Fluorescence Intensity
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Despite major advancements in surgical oncology, the positive margin rate for primary head and neck cancer resection remains around 15%-30%. In particular, the deep surface margin is the most challenging to adequately assess. Inadequate margins are directly correlated to poor survival, and as such, mitigation of these rates is critical to improve patient outcomes. We have developed an ex vivo imaging strategy that utilizes fluorescence intensity peaks (relative to background signal) of an injected anti-EGFR antibody conjugated to a fluorescent probe to locate potential close or positive margins on the deep surface of the resected tumor specimen.Experimental Design: Twelve patients with head and neck cancer scheduled for surgery received systemic administration of a tumor-specific contrast-agent (panitumumab-IRDye800CW). After surgical resection, the tumor specimen was imaged using a fluorescence imager. The three highest fluorescence intensity-peaks on the deep surface of the specimen were isolated and correlated to histology to determine the margin distance at these regions.Results: Relative fluorescence peak intensities identified the closest margin on the deep surface of the specimen within 2.5 minutes. The highest intensity peak consistently (100%) detected the closest margin to the tumor. The difference in tumor margin distance between the first and second highest fluorescence intensity peak averaged 2.1 +/- 1.4 mm. The tumor-margin difference between the second and third highest peak averaged 1.6 +/- 0.6 mm.Conclusions: Fluorescence intensity peaks can identify the region on the specimen where tumor is closest to specimen's edge on the deep surface. This technique could have broad applications in obtaining adequate margins in oncological surgery.

TI  - Global Sensitivity Analysis of Leaf-Canopy-Atmosphere RTMs: Implications for Biophysical Variables Retrieval from Top-of-Atmosphere Radiance Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of key variables driving the top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiance over a vegetated surface is an important step to derive biophysical variables from TOA radiance data, e.g., as observed by an optical satellite. Coupled leaf-canopy-atmosphere Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) allow linking vegetation variables directly to the at-sensor TOA radiance measured. Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) of RTMs enables the computation of the total contribution of each input variable to the output variance. We determined the impacts of the leaf-canopy-atmosphere variables into TOA radiance using the GSA to gain insights into retrievable variables. The leaf and canopy RTM PROSAIL was coupled with the atmospheric RTM MODTRAN5. Because of MODTRAN's computational burden and GSA's demand for many simulations, we first developed a surrogate statistical learning model, i.e., an emulator, that allows approximating RTM outputs through a machine learning algorithm with low computation time. A Gaussian process regression (GPR) emulator was used to reproduce lookup tables of TOA radiance as a function of 12 input variables with relative errors of 2.4%. GSA total sensitivity results quantified the driving variables of emulated TOA radiance along the 400-2500 nm spectral range at 15 cm-1 (between 0.3-9 nm); overall, the vegetation variables play a more dominant role than atmospheric variables. This suggests the possibility to retrieve biophysical variables directly from at-sensor TOA radiance data. Particularly promising are leaf chlorophyll content, leaf water thickness and leaf area index, as these variables are the most important drivers in governing TOA radiance outside the water absorption regions. A software framework was developed to facilitate the development of retrieval models from at-sensor TOA radiance data. As a proof of concept, maps of these biophysical variables have been generated for both TOA (L1C) and bottom-of-atmosphere (L2A) Sentinel-2 data by means of a hybrid retrieval scheme, i.e., training GPR retrieval algorithms using the RTM simulations. Obtained maps from L1C vs L2A data are consistent, suggesting that vegetation properties can be directly retrieved from TOA radiance data given a cloud-free sky, thus without the need of an atmospheric correction.

TI  - Composition of Amazonian volcanic materials in Tharsis and Elysium, Mars, from MRO/CRISM reflectance spectra
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Compositions of the Amazonian-aged Tharsis and Elysium volcanic provinces of Mars have been largely obscured in Mars-orbital remote sensing data by windblown dust. Fresh impact craters formed within the last few years have disturbed surface dust, providing unique windows to explore these regions' relatively dust-free mineralogic compositions. Such fresh craters, plus other small exposures of less dusty materials, are resolved spatially in high-resolution targeted observations of visible/short-wave infrared spectral reflectance by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM). Analysis of CRISM observations of small, relatively dust-free locations in the Tharsis and Elysium regions shows that these provinces are dominated by high-Ca pyroxene and olivine, similar to volcanic materials of Hesperian age. Thus, the mafic mineral compositions of Hesperian and Amazonian volcanic materials appear similar to each other, but distinct from the olivine- and low-Ca pyroxene-rich compositions that dominate Noachian rocks. In the core regions of both provinces, where thermal infrared data indicate the thickest dust cover, the dust is sufficiently thick that few fresh craters penetrate to expose the underlying volcanics. These results may be consistent with low Si contents of surface materials in Elysium and western Tharsis measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy resulting from a thick cover of dust depleted in Si-rich phases, possibly due to eolian sorting.

TI  - Sub-annual to multi-decadal shoreline variability from publicly available satellite imagery
T2  - COASTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to repeatedly observe and quantify the changing position of the shoreline is key to present-day coastal management and future coastal planning. This study evaluates the capability of satellite remote sensing to resolve at differing temporal scales the variability and trends in shoreline position along sandy coastlines. Shorelines are extracted from 30 + years of publicly available satellite imagery and compared to long-term in situ measurements at 5 diverse test sites in Europe, Australia, the USA and New Zealand. These sites span a range of different beach characteristics including wave energy and tide range as well as timescales of observed shoreline variability, from strongly seasonal (e.g., Truc Vert, France), to storm-dominated (e.g., Narrabeen-Collaroy, Australia), to only minor annual to multi-annual signals (e.g., Duck, USA). For the 5 sites, the observed typical horizontal errors varied between a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 7.3 m and 12.7 m. An analysis of the typical magnitudes of shoreline variability at temporal scales ranging from a single month up to 10 years indicates that, by the implementation of targeted image pre-processing then the application of a robust sub-pixel shoreline extraction technique, the resulting satellite-derived shorelines are generally able to resolve (signal-to-noise ratio > 1) the observed shoreline variance at timescales of 6 months and longer. The only exception to this is along coastlines where minimal annual to multi-annual shoreline variability occurs (e.g. Duck, USA); at these sites decadal-scale variations are successfully captured. The results of this analysis demonstrate that satellite-derived shorelines spanning the past 30 years as well as into the future can be used to explore and quantify intra- and inter-annual shoreline behaviour at a wide range of beaches around the world. Moreover, it is demonstrated that present-day satellite observations are also capable of capturing event-scale shoreline changes (e.g. individual storms) that occur at timescales shorter than 6 months, where this rapid response exceeds the typical magnitude of shoreline variability. Finally, several practical coastal engineering applications are presented, demonstrating the use of freely-available satellite imagery to monitor inter-annual embayed beach rotation, rapid storm-induced shoreline retreat and a major sand nourishment.

TI  - Bioinspired, Multidisciplinary, Iterative Catalyst Design Creates the Highest Performance Peroxidase Mimics and the Field of Sustainable Ultradilute Oxidation Catalysis (SUDOC)
T2  - ACS CATALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oxidation catalysts called NewTAMLs, macrocyclic complexes with TAML carbonamido-N donors replaced by more nucleophile-resistant binders, sulfonamido-N, for example, [Fe{4-NO2C6H3-1,2-(NCOCMe2NSO2)(2)CHMe}](-) (5d), deliver record-setting technical performance parameters (TPPs) for functional peroxidase mimicry. NewTAMLs were designed to test the previously discounted hypothesis that nucleophilic decay of carbonamido-N iron chelators is TAML catalyst lifetime-limiting and, for precautionary reasons, to escape fluorine in the best-performing TAML (1c) for catalyzing ultradilute water purification by H2O2. Replacing two of four TAML carbonamides with less sigma-donating sulfonamides in 5 was found to more than compensate for eliminating 1c's F-substituents to increase substrate oxidation rates and, following the discovery and parametrization of an additional decomposition mechanism, to alter catalyst degradation rates protectively. At pH 7 in less than 5 min, the best-performing NewTAML 5d activates H2O2 to eliminate the beta-blocker drug and sentinel micropollutant (MP) propranolol to the limit of UPLC detection under very dilute starting conditions that pass through the ultradilute regime (<= 2 ppb): [5d] = 100 nM (similar to 60 ppb), [propranolol] = 53 nM (15.6 ppb), [H2O2] = 330 mu M (11.2 ppm). This is ca. 10 times faster than 1c/H2O2 under comparable conditions giving an important advance in the real-world potential for time-, concentration-, and cost-sensitive MP water treatments. The separate decomposition mechanism involves carbon acids bridging the two sulfonamides, a discovery that expands design control over operating NewTAML lifetimes-these features we have named "kill switches" are analyzed for impacts on catalytic function, process control, and sustainable design. Mouse uterotrophic assays show no low-dose adverse effects (lodafs) for the prototype NewTAML (5a) or for the process solution from the 5a/H2O2 destruction of the contraceptive pill estrogen, ethinyl estradiol (EE2), a potent MP. The multidisciplinary catalyst design protocol that led to NewTAMLs is presented graphically to highlight how five key sustainability performances-technical, cost, health, environmental, fairness-are being optimized together for sustainable oxidation catalysis and water treatment. The results validate the "bioinspired" descriptor and the name sustainable ultradilute oxidation catalysis (SUDOC) for this emerging field while highlighting to chemists that dealing with the lodafs and locafs (low-concentration adverse effects) of everyday-everywhere chemicals is essential for sustainability.

TI  - Mapping Tea Plantations from Multi-seasonal Landsat-8 OLI Imageries Using a Random Forest Classifier
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is very challenging to extract tea plantations from medium-resolution satellite imageries. This paper presents a new methodological framework based on the random forest classifier for extracting tea plantations from Landsat-8 OLI imageries. Analysis is facilitated by a dataset of three Landsat-8 OLI images (spring, autumn and winter) in 2014 covering the Anji County, one of the major tea production regions in China. More specifically, in order to determine the relative importance of spectra, texture, vegetation index and seasonality on classification accuracy, we design a series of classification feature sets, including: initial feature sets for different seasons, feature selection feature sets for different seasons and multi-seasonal feature sets. The results show that the multi-seasonal feature selection set has the best feature set performance (PA = 0.88; OA = 0.92; Kappa = 0.90). Our study demonstrates that the random forest classifier is reliable and practical for extracting tea plantations from medium-resolution images. Highlights of this study are: mapping tea plantations, an important cash crop to local agriculture, in a fragmented landscape; integrating textual, vegetational, and seasonal features, which were helpful for improving tea plantation mapping accuracy in combination; taking advantage of the feature selection function of random forest, supporting high-dimensional data classification, which leads to a higher classification accuracy.

TI  - A Novel Vessel Velocity Estimation Method Using Dual-Platform TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X Full Polarimetric SAR Data in Pursuit Monostatic Mode
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate that the spaceborne dual-platform TerraSAR-X (TSX) and TanDEM-X (TDX) pursuit monostatic mode full polarimetric (full-pol) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with a time lag can be used to monitor maritime traffic. For single polarization (single-pol) SAR data, the performance of vessel velocity estimation is mainly determined by 2-D cross correlation of SAR intensity data. As the sea clutter is changing dynamically during the TSX/TDX data acquisition, the correlation between two dual-platform images decreases significantly. We may get unstable or incorrect estimations of vessel velocity, especially under a higher wind condition. For solving this problem, we propose an object-oriented polarimetric likelihood ratio test (PolLRT) method based on the complex Wishart distribution. The proposed method makes PolLRT statistics of the detected target pixels for eliminating the effect of varied sea clutter. Two pairs of full-pol SAR data sets covering the Strait of Gibraltar acquired by dual-platform TSX/TDX in pursuit monostatic mode with a time lag of approximately 10 s are selected for the experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PolLRT method has a better performance than that of the classical normalized cross correlation (NCC) method with VV polarization SAR data and the mutual information (MI) method with full-pol SAR data. Specifically, under the lower wind condition, the correct estimation rate of the NCC, the MI, and the proposed PolLRT methods are 85.7%, 57.1%, and 100%, respectively; under the relatively higher wind condition, the correct estimation rate of the above three methods are 48.8%, 23.2%, and 90.1%, respectively.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of moxibustion on relieving breast cancer-related lymphedema. Materials and Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in our institution from March 2016 to March 2017. All patients (N = 48) with cancer-related lymphedema were allocated to 2 groups: a treatment group, in which moxibustion was performed, and a control group, in which pneumatic circulation was performed with compression garments worn every day. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by measuring arm circumference (wrist crease, 10 cm proximal to wrist crease, elbow crease, and 10 cm proximal to elbow crease) and determining the Revised Piper Fatigue Scale score and Visual Analog Scale score for swelling before and after treatment. Results: All patients were treated for 4 consecutive weeks. Compared with 0 week after treatment, the affected-side arm circumference after 4 weeks' treatment decreased in both treatment and control groups; the difference value in the treatment group was superior to that in the control group. Compared with the controls, moxibustion resulted in a lower Visual Analog Scale score. The Revised Piper Fatigue total scores were improved in both the moxibustion and control group, and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups. Moxibustion reduced the behavioral, sensory, emotional, and cognitive Revised Piper Fatigue scores, but only the behavioral and sensory scores improved in the control group. Conclusion: Moxibustion has potential effect on breast cancer-related lymphedema. We present promising preliminary data for larger randomized trials to enable accurate evaluation of moxibustion as a lymphedema treatment.

TI  - The Spatial-Temporal Variation of Tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> over China during 2005 to 2018
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, new and strict air quality regulations have been implemented in China. Therefore, it is of great significance to evaluate the current air pollution situation and effectiveness of actions. In this study, Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite data were used to detect the spatiotemporal characteristics of tropospheric NO2 columns over China from 2005 to 2018, including spatial distribution, seasonal cycles and long-term trends. The averaged NO2 pollution is higher in southeastern China and lower in the northwest, which are well delineated by the Heihe-Tengchong line. Furthermore, the NO2 loadings are highest in the North China Plain, with vertical column density (VCD) exceeding 13 x 10(15) molec cm(-2). Regarding the seasonal cycle, the NO2 loadings in eastern China is highest in winter and lowest in summer, while the western region shows the opposite feature. The amplitude of annual range increase gradually from the south to the north. If the entire period of 2005-2018 is taken into account, China has experienced little change in NO2. In fact, however, there appears to be significant trends of an increase followed by a downward tendency, with the turning point in the year 2012. In the former episode of 2005-2012, increasing trends overwhelm nearly the whole nation, especially in the Jing-Jin-Tang region, Shandong Province, and Northern Henan and Southern Hebei combined regions, where the rising rates were as high as 1.0-1.8 x 10(15) molec cm(-2) year(-1). In contrast, the latter episode of 2013-2018 features remarkable declines in NO2 columns over China. Particularly, the regions where the decreased degree was remarkable in 2013-2018 were consistent with the regions where the upward trend was obvious in 2005-2012. Overall, this upward-downward pattern is true for most parts of China. However, some of the largest metropolises, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, witnessed a continuous decrease in the NO2 amounts, indicating earlier and more stringent measures adopted in these areas. Finally, it can be concluded that China's recent efforts to cut NO2 pollution are successful, especially in mega cities.

TI  - Market-Driven Corn Monocropping in the U.S. Midwest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the market drivers of corn monocropping in the U.S. Midwest by empirically analyzing crop rotation responses to market fluctuation from 2005 to 2014 and the price shock induced by the recent biofuel mandate. We find that the expected market returns for crops have a significant impact on farmers' decisions about monocropping. We also find that corn monocropping is loosely associated with the presence of nearby ethanol plants. This study illustrates the emerging use of high-resolution land cover data to tackle critical agribusiness and agro-environmental policy questions that remain elusive with aggregate data.

TI  - Estimating leaf area index and aboveground biomass of grazing pastures using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland degradation has accelerated in recent decades in response to increased climate variability and human activity. Rangeland and grassland conditions directly affect forage quality, livestock production, and regional grassland resources. In this study, we examined the potential of integrating synthetic aperture radar (SAR, Sentinel-1) and optical remote sensing (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) data to monitor the conditions of a native pasture and an introduced pasture in Oklahoma, USA. Leaf area index (LAI) and aboveground biomass (AGB) were used as indicators of pasture conditions under varying climate and human activities. We estimated the seasonal dynamics of LAI and AGB using Sentinel-1 (S1), Landsat-8 (LC8), and Sentinel-2 (S2) data, both individually and integrally, applying three widely used algorithms: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Results indicated that integration of LC8 and S2 data provided sufficient data to capture the seasonal dynamics of grasslands at a 10-30-m spatial resolution and improved assessments of critical phenology stages in both pluvial and dry years. The satellite-based LAI and AGB models developed from ground measurements in 2015 reasonably predicted the seasonal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of LAI and AGB in 2016. By comparison, the integration of S1, LC8, and S2 has the potential to improve the estimation of LAI and AGB more than 30% relative to the performance of S1 at low vegetation cover (LAI < 2 m(2)/m(2), AGB < 500 g/m(2)) and optical data of LC8 and S2 at high vegetation cover (LAI > 2 m(2)/m(2), AGB > 500 g/m(2)). These results demonstrate the potential of combining S1, LC8, and S2 monitoring grazing tallgrass prairie to provide timely and accurate data for grassland management.

TI  - Detecting daytime and nighttime land surface temperature anomalies using thermal infrared remote sensing in Dandong geothermal prospect
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional ground survey methods have limited the development and use of renewable energy from geothermal resources. In this paper, the geothermal potential area of Dandong, China is studied using the thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data from daytime Landsat 8 and nighttime Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). Through pre-processing such as georeferencing, radiometric calibration, and atmospheric correction, the Landsat8 TIRS and ASTER data were used to invert the land surface temperature of the study area during the daytime and nighttime using the single-channel algorithm and temperature and emissivity separation algorithm. Furthermore, the land surface temperatures during daytime and nighttime of three natural land features-water, vegetation, and bare soil-were classified and analyzed. According to the results, vegetation and bare soil show relatively thermal anomalies during the day and relatively cold anomalies during the night. Conversely, water shows relatively cold anomalies during the day and relatively thermal anomalies during the night. Calculating the daytime and nighttime mean of land surface temperature (DNMLST) can eliminate the relatively cold/thermal anomalies exhibited by natural land features during the daytime and nighttime while highlighting the geothermal anomaly zone. Nine geothermal anomaly zones were identified using the threshold method. The auxiliary analysis of geological data excluded non-geothermal effects. Studies have shown that the distribution of the identified geothermal prospects is consistent with the development and distribution of faults. The fractures cut the land surface, causing groundwater to form structural fissure hot water through fracture structures and fissures after magma heating. The use of two higher-resolution TIR remote sensing data products to obtain the DNMLST for the detection of geothermal anomalies has proven cost-effective technical method.

TI  - Fine-Resolution Population Mapping from International Space Station Nighttime Photography and Multisource Social Sensing Data Based on Similarity Matching
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have attempted to disaggregate census data into fine resolution with multisource remote sensing data considering the importance of fine-resolution population distribution in urban planning, environmental protection, resource allocation, and social economy. However, the lack of direct human activity information invariably restricts the accuracy of population mapping and reduces the credibility of the mapping process even when external facility distribution information is adopted. To address these problems, the present study proposed a novel population mapping method by combining International Space Station (ISS) photography nighttime light data, point of interest (POI) data, and location-based social media data. A similarity matching model, consisting of semantic and distance matching models, was established to integrate POI and social media data. Effective information was extracted from the integrated data through principal component analysis and then used along with road density information to train the random forest (RF) model. A comparison with WordPop data proved that our method can generate fine-resolution population distribution with higher accuracy (R2=0.91) than those of previous studies (R2=0.55). To illustrate the advantages of our method, we highlighted the limitations of previous methods that ignore social media data in handling residential regions with similar light intensity. We also discussed the performance of our method in adopting social media data, considering their characteristics, with different volumes and acquisition times. Results showed that social media data acquired between 19:00 and 8:00 with a volume of approximately 300,000 will help our method realize high accuracy with low computation burden. This study showed the great potential of combining social sensing data for disaggregating fine-resolution population.

TI  - Superresolution of Single Gaofen-4 Visible-Light and Near-Infrared (VNIR) Image Based on Texture Image Extraction
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Superresolution (SR) is an important compensatory mean for geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites because of their low spatial resolution caused by orbital height. The multiple-image SR (MISR) methods generally have better reconstruction effects than single-image SR (SISR) methods. However, MISR methods require multiple images of the same place, which are susceptible to geometric distortion and radiation differences. Gaofen-4 (GF-4) is a GEO satellite equipped with a visible-light and near-infrared (VNIR) sensor and provides images with five bands. Based on the similarity of spatial information between different bands, this paper proposes an SISR method suitable for GF-4 VNIR images. The radiation differences are eliminated by extracting texture images. The high-resolution (HR) texture image is reconstructed by projections onto convex sets. The final SR result is fused by HR texture image and upsampled VNIR image. Tested by real GF-4 data, the reconstructed results of this method have better sharpness and more abundant information than comparable methods.

TI  - Comparisons of AGRI/<i>FY-4A</i> Cloud Fraction and Cloud Top Pressure with MODIS/<i>Terra</i> Measurements over East Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-4A (FY-4A), the second generation of China's geostationary meteorological satellite, provides high spatiotemporal resolution cloud products over East Asia. In this study, cloud fraction (CFR) and cloud top pressure (CTP) products in August 2017 derived from the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) aboard FY-4A (AGRI/FY-4A) are retrospectively compared with those from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Terra (MODIS/Terra) over East Asia. To avoid possible errors in the comparison caused by the lower temporal coverage of MODIS/Terra products compared to that of AGRI/FY-4A over the same region and to account for time lags between observations of the two instruments, we construct datasets of AGRI/FY-4A CFR and CTP to match those of MODIS/Terra in each scan over East Asia in August 2017. Results show that the CFR and CTP datasets of the two instruments generally agree well, with the linear correlation coefficients (R) between CFR (CTP) data of 0.83 (0.80) regardless of time lags. Though longer time lags contribute to the worse consistency between CFR (CTP) data derived from observations of the two instruments in most cases, large CFR/CTP discrepancies do not always match with long time lags. Large CFR discrepancies appear in the vicinity of the Tibetan Plateau (TP; 28 degrees-45 degrees N, 75 degrees-105 degrees E). These differences in the cloud detection by the two instruments largely occur when MODIS/Terra detects clear-sky while AGRI/FY-4A detects higher values of CFR, and this accounts for 61% of the CFR discrepancy greater than 50% near the TP. In the case of CTP, the largest discrepancies appear in the eastern Iranian Plateau (IP; 25 degrees-45 degrees N, 60 degrees-80 degrees E), where there are some samples with long time lags (20-35 min) and fewer daily data samples are available for computing monthly means compared to other regions since there are many clear-sky data samples there during the study period.

TI  - Application of the Entropy Spectral Method for Streamflow and Flood-Affected Area Forecasting in the Brahmaputra River Basin
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable streamflow and flood-affected area forecasting is vital for flood control and risk assessment in the Brahmaputra River basin. Based on the satellite remote sensing from four observation sites and ground observation at the Bahadurabad station, the Burg entropy spectral analysis (BESA), the configurational entropy spectral analysis (CESA), maximum likelihood (MLE), ordinary least squares (OLS), and the Yule-Walker (YW) method were developed for the spectral analysis and flood-season streamflow forecasting in the basin. The results indicated that the BESA model had a great advantage in the streamflow forecasting compared with the CESA and other traditional methods. Taking 20% as the allowable error, the forecast passing rate of the BESA model trained by the remote sensing data can reach 93% in flood seasons during 2003-2017, which was significantly higher than that trained by observed streamflow series at the Bahadurabad station. Furthermore, the segmented flood-affected area function with the input of the streamflow forecasted by the BESA model was able to forecast the annual trend of the flood-affected area of rice and tea but needed further improvement in extreme rainfall years. This paper provides a better flood-season streamflow forecasting method for the Brahmaputra River basin, which has the potential to be coupled with hydrological process models to enhance the forecasting accuracy.

TI  - Land-Cover Classification of Coastal Wetlands Using the RF Algorithm for Worldview-2 and Landsat 8 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are one of the world's most important ecosystems, playing an important role in regulating climate and protecting the environment. However, human activities have changed the land cover of wetlands, leading to direct destruction of the environment. If wetlands are to be protected, their land cover must be classified and changes to it monitored using remote sensing technology. The random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm, which offers clear advantages (e.g., processing feature data without feature selection and preferable classification result) for high spatial image classification, has been used in many study areas. In this research, to verify the effectiveness of this algorithm for remote sensing image classification of coastal wetlands, two types of spatial resolution images of the Linhong Estuary wetland in Lianyungang-Worldview-2 and Landsat-8 images-were used for land cover classification using the RF method. To demonstrate the preferable classification accuracy of the RF algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) methods were also used to classify the same area of land cover for comparison with the results of RF classification. The study results showed that (1) the overall accuracy of the RF method reached 91.86%, higher than the SVM and k-NN methods by 4.68% and 4.72%, respectively, for Worldview-2 images; (2) at the same time, the classification accuracies of RF, SVM, and k-NN were 86.61%, 79.96%, and 77.23%, respectively, for Landsat-8 images; (3) for some land cover types having only a small number of samples, the RF algorithm also achieved better classification results using Worldview-2 and Landsat-8 images, and (4) the addition texture features could improve the classification accuracy of the RF method when using Worldview-2 images. Research indicated that high-resolution remote sensing images are more suitable for small-scale land cover classification image and that the RF algorithm can provide better classification accuracy and is more suitable for coastal wetland classification than the SVM and k-NN algorithms are.

TI  - Meteorological Parameters and Gaseous Pollutant Concentrations as Predictors of Ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, China
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-level PM2.5 concentrations-especially those during episodes of heavy pollution-are severely underestimated by mixed-effects models that ignore the effects of primary pollutant emissions and secondary pollutant conversion. In this work, meteorological parameters and NO2, SO2, CO, and O-3 concentrations are introduced as predictors to a mixed-effects model to improve the estimated concentration of PM2.5, which is based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD). The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (JingJinJi) region is used as the study area. The model provides an overall cross-validation (CV) R-2 of 0.84 and root-mean-square prediction error (RMSE) of 33.91 mu g m(-3). The CV R-2 and RMSE of the proposed model are higher by 0.11 and lower by 9.16 mu g m(-3), respectively, than those of a model lacking gaseous pollutants as predictors. The R-2 and RMSE of the proposed model increases and decreases by 0.14 and 13.37 mu g m(-3), respectively, when PM2.5 concentrations exceed 75 mu g m(-3). The high values predicted for the PM2.5 concentration indicate a drastic improvement in the estimation, and the spatial distribution generated by the model for periods of heavy pollution is highly consistent with that inferred from monitoring data. Thus, the proposed model can be used to generate highly accurate maps of the PM2.5 distribution for long-term and short-term exposure studies and to correctly classify exposure in heavily polluted areas.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Guided Sampling Design with Both Good Spatial Coverage and Feature Space Coverage for Accurate Farm Field-Level Soil Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing requirements of precision agriculture for massive and various kinds of data, remote sensing technology has become indispensable in acquiring the necessary data for precision agriculture. Understanding the spatial variability of a target soil variable (i.e., soil mapping) is a critical issue in solving many agricultural problems. Field sampling is one of the most commonly used technologies for soil mapping, but sample sizes are restricted by resources, such as field labor, soil physicochemical analysis, and funding. In this paper, we proposed a sampling design method with both good spatial coverage and feature space coverage to achieve more precise spatial variability of farm field-level target soil variables for limited sample sizes. The proposed method used the super-grid to achieve good spatial coverage, and it took advantage of remote sensing products that were highly correlated with the target soil property (SOM content) to achieve good feature space coverage. For the experiments, we employed the ordinary kriging (OK) method to map the soil organic matter (SOM) content. The different sized super-grid comparison experiments showed that the 400 x 400 m(2) super-grid had the highest SOM content mapping accuracy. Then, we compared the proposed method to regular grid sampling (good spatial coverage) and k-means sampling (good feature space coverage), and the experimental results indicated that the proposed method had greater potential in the selection of representative samples that could improve the SOM content mapping accuracy.

TI  - A Methodology for Fitting the Time Series of Snow Depth on the Arctic Sea Ice
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow depth is an important geophysical variable for investigating sea ice and climate change, which can be obtained from satellite data. However, there is a large number of missing data in satellite observations of snow depth. In this study, a methodology, the periodic functions fitting with varying parameter (PFF-VP), is presented to fit the time series of snow depth on Arctic sea ice obtained from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The time-varying parameters are obtained by the independent point (IP) scheme and cubic spline interpolation. The PPF-VP is validated by experiments in which part of the observations are artificially removed and used to compare with the fitting results. Results indicate that the PPF-VP performs better than three traditional fitting methods, with its fitting results closer to observations and with smaller errors. In the practical experiments, the optimal number of IPs can be determined by only considering the fraction of missing data, particularly the length of the longest gaps in the snow-depth time series. All the experimental results indicate that the PPF-VP is a feasible and effective method to fit the time series of snow depth and can provide continuous data of snow depth for further study.

TI  - Mapping the chlorophyll-<i>a</i> horizontal gradient in a cascading reservoirs system using MSI Sentinel-2A images
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we investigated the trophic gradient in three reservoirs cascading in Tiete River, Southeast Brazil, based on their chlorophyll-a (chl a) concentration. The goal of this study was to identify spatial patterns in the chl a distribution, which are associated with the filtration process caused by reservoir cascade. Hence, maps of chl a content were developed considering a short time series of MSI Sentinel-2A images (2016-2018). A chl a prediction algorithm was applied to images, whose calibration was done from data collected during a severe drought (2014), which led to intense harmful algal blooms (HABs) and after the drought (2016). The outcomes showed that 20 m spatial resolution of MSI Sentinel-2A images are suitable in estimating pigment concentration in small and middle reservoirs. In addition, the Sen2cor atmospheric correction tool exhibited good performance in removing the scattering effects. Its application in retrieving the chl a content also presented good results. Besides reservoir order in the cascade, the storage system showed to be a factor that also affects the trophic state in downstream impoundments. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Assessing spectral measures of post-harvest forest recovery with field plot data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Information regarding the nature and rate of forest recovery is required to inform forest management, monitoring, and reporting activities. Delayed establishment or return of forests has implications to harvest rotations and carbon uptake, among others, creating a need for spatially-explicit, large-area, characterizations of forest recovery. Landsat time series (LTS) has been demonstrated as a means to quantitatively relate forest recovery, noting that there are gaps in our understanding of the linkage between spectral measures of forest recovery and manifestations of forest structure and composition. Field plots provide a means to better understand the linkage between forest characteristics and spectral recovery indices. As such, from a large set of existing field plots, we considered the conditions present for the year in which the co-located pixel was considered spectrally recovered using the Years to Recovery (Y2R) metric. Y2R is a long-term metric of spectral recovery that indicates the number of years required for a pixel to return to 80% of its pre-disturbance Normalized Burn Ratio value. Absolute and relative metrics of recovery at 5 years post-disturbance were also considered. We used these three spectral recovery metrics to predict the stand development class assigned by the field crew for 284 seedling plots with an overall accuracy of 73.59%, with advanced seedling stands more accurately discriminated (omission error, OE = 15.74%) than young seedling stands (OE = 49.84%). We then used field-measured attributes (e.g. height, stem density, dominant species) from the seedling plots to classify the plots into three spectral recovery groups, which were defined using the Y2R metric: spectral recovery in (1) 1-5 years, (2) 6-10 years, or (3) 11-15 years. Overall accuracy for spectral recovery groups was 61.06%. Recovery groups 1 and 3 were discriminated with greater accuracy (producer's and user's accuracies > 66%) than recovery group 2 ( < 50%). The top field-measured predictors of spectral recovery were mean height, dominant species, and percentage of stems in the plot that were deciduous. Variability in stand establishment and condition make it challenging to accurately discriminate among recovery rates within 10 years post-harvest. Our results indicate that the long-term metric Y2R relates to forest structure and composition attributes measured in the field and that spectral development post-disturbance corresponds with expectations of structural development, particularly height, for different species, site types, and deciduous abundance. These results confirm the utility of spectral recovery measures derived from LTS data to augment landscape-level assessments of post-disturbance recovery.

TI  - Comparison of Tropospheric Path Delay Estimates from GNSS and Space-Borne SAR Interferometry in Alpine Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We compare tropospheric delays from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry (InSAR) in a challenging mountainous environment in the Swiss Alps, where strong spatial variations of the local tropospheric conditions are often observed. Tropospheric delays are usually considered to be an error for both GNSS and InSAR, and are typically removed. However, recently these delays are also recognized as a signal of interest, for example for assimilation into numerical weather models or climate studies. The GNSS and InSAR are techniques of complementary nature, as one has sparse spatial but high temporal resolution, and the other very dense spatial coverage but repeat pass of only a few days. This raises expectations for a combination of these techniques. For this purpose, a comprehensive comparison between the techniques must be first performed. Due to the relative nature of InSAR estimates, we compare the difference slant tropospheric delays retrieved from GNSS with the dSTDs estimated using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) of 32 COSMO-SkyMed SAR images taken in a snow-free period from June to October between 2008 and 2013. The GNSS estimates calculated at permanent geodetic stations are interpolated to the locations of persistent scatterers using an in-house developed least-squares collocation software COMEDIE. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between InSAR and GNSS estimates averaged over all acquisitions is equal to 0.64 and larger than 0.8 for approximately half of the layers. Better agreement is obtained mainly for days with high variability of the troposphere (relative to the tropospheric conditions at the time of the reference acquisition), expressed as standard deviations of the GNSS-based dSTD On the other hand, the most common feature for the days with poor agreement is represented by very stable, almost constant GNSS estimates. In addition, there is a weak correlation between the agreement and the water vapor values in the area, as well as with the number of stations in the closest vicinity of the study area. Adding low-cost L-1 only GPS stations located within the area of the study increases the biases for most of the dates, but the standard deviations between InSAR and GNSS decrease for the limited area with low-cost stations.

TI  - Lessons Learned from the NOAA CoastWatch Ocean Satellite Course Developed for Integrating Oceanographic Satellite Data into Operational Use
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data are underutilized in many branches of operational oceanography. Users outside of the satellite community often encounter difficulty in discovering the types of satellite measurements that are available, and determining which satellite products are best for operational activities. In addition, the large choice of satellite data providers, each with their own data access protocols and formats, can make data access challenging. The mission of the NOAA CoastWatch Program is to make ocean satellite data easier to access and to apply to operational uses. As part of this mission, the West Coast Node of CoastWatch developed the NOAA Ocean Satellite Course, which introduces scientists and resource managers to ocean satellite products, and provides them tools to facilitate data access when using common analysis software. These tools leverage the data services provided by ERDDAP, a data distribution system designed to make data access easier via a graphical user interface and via machine-to-machine connections. The course has been offered annually since 2006 and has been attended by over 350 participants. Results of post-course surveys are analyzed to measure course effectiveness. The lessons learned from conducting these courses include using the preferred software of the course participants, providing easy access to datasets that are appropriate (fit for purpose) for operation applications, developing tools that address common tasks of the target audience, and minimizing the financial barriers to attend the course.

TI  - Recurrent Snowmelt Pattern Synthesis Using Principal Component Analysis of Multiyear Remotely Sensed Snow Cover
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow acts as a vital source of water especially in areas where streamflow relies on snowmelt. The spatiotemporal pattern of snow cover has tremendous value for snowmelt modeling. Instantaneous snow extent can be observed by remote sensing. Cloud cover often interferes. Many complex methods exist to resolve this but often have requirements which delay the availability of the data and prohibit its use for real-time modeling. In this research, we propose a new method for spatially modeling snow cover throughout the melting season. The method ingests multiple years of MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer snow cover data and combines it using principal component analysis to produce a spatial melt pattern model. Development and application of this model relies on the interannual recurrence of the seasonal melting pattern. This recurrence has long been accepted as fact but to our knowledge has not been utilized in remote sensing of snow. We develop and test the model in a large watershed in Wyoming using 17 years of remotely sensed snow cover images. When applied to images from 2 years that were not used in its development, the model represents snow-covered area with accuracy of 84.9-97.5% at varied snow-covered areas. The model also effectively removes cloud cover if any portion of the interface between land and snow is visible in a cloudy image. This new principal component analysis method for modeling the interannually recurring spatial melt pattern exclusively from remotely sensed images possesses its own intrinsic merit, in addition to those associated with its applications.Plain Language Summary Mountain snow provides an important source of water. The ability to model snowmelt and the resulting streamflow helps predict the amount and timing of when water will be available for irrigation, drinking water, and other uses. Satellite remote sensing can produce maps of snow-covered area that can improve our ability to model snowmelt, but during the melt season, clouds often block the view of watersheds from space. However, snowmelt follows a repeatable spatial pattern as it melts, year after year. We used this observation to develop a model of the spatial pattern of melt using multiple years of satellite snow cover images. This model can remove the cloud interference from daily satellite snow cover images. Our model achieved 85-98% accuracy in representing the spatial pattern of snow observed in satellite images even when starting with 95% cloud cover. Other models achieve similar accuracy but require much more data to accomplish this, which prevents them from being used for cloud removal in real time. We expect the model to improve our ability to model streamflow from snowmelt runoff.

T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background For patients who are diagnosed with early-stage cutaneous melanoma, the principal therapy is wide surgical excision of the primary tumour and assessment of lymph nodes. The purpose of the present guideline was to update the 2010 Cancer Care Ontario guideline on wide local excision margins and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), including treatment of the positive sentinel node, for melanomas of the trunk, extremities, and head and neck.Methods Using Ovid, the MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases were systematically searched for systematic reviews and primary literature evaluating narrow compared with wide excision margins and the use of SLNB for melanoma of the truck and extremities and of the head and neck. Search timelines ran from 2010 through week 25 of 2017.Results Four systematic reviews were chosen for inclusion in the evidence base. Where systematic reviews were available, the search of the primary literature was conducted starting from the end date of the search in the reviews. Where systematic reviews were absent, the search for primary literature ran from 2010 forward. Of 1213 primary studies identified, 8 met the inclusion criteria. Two randomized controlled trials were used to inform the recommendation on completion lymph node dissection.Key updated recommendations include:Wide local excision margins should be 2 cm for melanomas of the trunk, extremities, and head and neck that exceed 2 mm in depth.SLNB should be offered to patients with melanomas of the trunk, extremities, and head and neck that exceed 0.8 mm in depth.Patients with sentinel node metastasis should be considered for nodal observation with ultrasonography rather than for completion lymph node dissection.Conclusions Recommendations for primary excision margins, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and completion lymph node dissection in patients with cutaneous melanoma have been updated based on the current literature.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and management of primary granulocytic sarcoma of the breast A case report
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Primary granulocytic sarcoma of the breast is a rare and poor-prognosis malignancy. Clinicians do not have sufficient knowledge of this disease and often misdirect it as other soft tissue sarcomas or inflammation.Patient concerns: A 42-year-old female presented with a self-discovered asymptomatic growing and palpable right breast mass that had been present for 4 months.Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed as primary myeloid sarcoma.Interventions: The patient received modified radical mastectomy in the right breast and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Pathological diagnosis is primary granulocytic sarcoma. Then the patient accepted acute myeloid leukemia-induction chemotherapy.Outcomes: The follow-up of this patient has no evidence of disease progression or spread during 1 year.Conclusions: Granulocytic sarcoma in the breast tissue is rare. But it still should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any tumor in the breast. The present study discusses comprehensively the clinical and pathological characteristics to improve the understanding of myeloid sarcoma.

TI  - Developing General Equations for Urban Tree Biomass Estimation with High-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban trees provide various important ecological services, the quantification of which is vital to sustainable urban development and requires accurate estimation of tree biomass. A limited number of allometric biomass equations, however, have been developed for urban species due to the prohibitive cost. Remote sensing has provided cost-effective means for estimating urban forest biomass, although the propagation of error in the estimation process is not well understood. This study aimed to offer a baseline assessment of the feasibility of estimating urban tree biomass with remote sensing-based general equations applicable to broad taxonomic groups by conducting a large urban tree inventory on a university campus. The biomasses of 191 trees of seven species from the inventory, separated into two categories (i.e., evergreen and deciduous), were calculated exclusively with urban-based species-specific allometric equations. WorldView-2 satellite imagery data were acquired to retrieve normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values at the location, crown, and stand levels. The results indicated that biomass correlated with NDVI in varying forms and degrees. The general equations at the crown level yielded the most accurate biomass estimates, while the location-level estimates were the least accurate. Crown-level spectral responses provided adequate information for delivering spatially explicit biomass estimation.

TI  - Using L-band radar data for soil salinity mapping-a case study in Central Iraq
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a critical environmental problem for dryland agriculture. Mapping its distribution and severity in space and time is essential for agricultural management and development. Recently, remote sensing technology has been widely applied in such mapping but mostly using optical remote sensing data. In conjunction with the field surveys, this case study was aimed at developing an operational approach for this purpose by employing ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) L-band radar data with support of Landsat 5 TM(Thematic Mapper) imagery acquired at almost the same time. The test was conducted in the Mussaib site in Central Iraq. The innovative procedure involved was the removal or minimization of the impact of vegetation cover and moisture on the backscattering coefficients by Water Cloud Model. The results revealed a strong correlation between the corrected backscattering coefficients of soil and the measured soil salinity (R-2 = 0.565-0.677). The radar-based salinity models developed through multivariate linear regression (MLR) analysis were able to predict salinity with reliability of 70.05%. In conclusion, it is possible to use radar data for soil salinity prediction and mapping in dry environment.

TI  - Examining the Relationship Between Spatial Configurations of Urban Impervious Surfaces and Land Surface Temperature
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect has significant effects on the quality of life and public health. Numerous studies have addressed the relationship between UHI and the increase in urban impervious surface area (ISA), but few of them have considered the impact of the spatial configuration of ISA on UHI. Land surface temperature (LST) may be affected not only by urban land cover, but also by neighboring land cover. The aim of this research was to investigate the effects of the abundance and spatial association of ISAs on LST. Taking Harbin City, China as an example, the impact of ISA spatial association on LST measurements was examined. The abundance of ISAs and the LST measurements were derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery of 2000 and 2010, and the spatial association patterns of ISAs were calculated using the local Moran's I index. The impacts of ISA abundance and spatial association on LST were examined using correlation analysis. The results suggested that LST has significant positive associations with both ISA abundance and the Moran's I index of ISAs, indicating that both the abundance and spatial clustering of ISAs contribute to elevated values of LST. It was also found that LST is positively associated with clustering of high-ISA-percentage areas (i.e.,>50%) and negatively associated with clustering of low-ISA-percentage areas (i.e.,<25%). The results suggest that, in addition to the abundance of ISAs, their spatial association has a significant effect on UHIs.

TI  - Hierarchical Segmentation Evaluation of Region-Based Image Hierarchy
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiscale image segmentation plays an important role in object-based image analysis (OBIA) applications, and the evaluation of segmentation quality is a hot topic for OBIA community. Recently, with the increasing use of multiscale and hierarchical strategy in OBIA works, region-based image hierarchies have attracted increasing attentions. A region-based image hierarchy (i.e., binary partition tree and scale-sets hierarchy) is a tree-like structure, and it can be used to record multiscale segmentation results. Although many methods have been employed to evaluate multiscale segmentation, they cannot be applied to evaluate a region-based image hierarchy directly. In this study, a hierarchical segmentation evaluation approach was proposed to evaluate the upper-bound accuracy of a region-based image hierarchy. In our study, an image hierarchy is implemented using a region merging process, and organized as a scale-indexed binary partition tree; the best matching segment of each reference polygon is then selected by scanning whole hierarchy; and finally, the similarity between reference polygons and corresponding best matching segments are used to evaluate the overall performance of the hierarchy. Two high spatial resolution images (GaoFen-2 and QuickBird) and three region merging criteria were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Moreover, the proposed method was compared with traditional multiscale evaluation strategies. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, as well as the advantages compared to existing approaches.

TI  - Emergent Challenges for Science sUAS Data Management: Fairness through Community Engagement and Best Practices Development
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) as platforms for data capture has rapidly increased in recent years. However, while there has been significant investment in improving the aircraft, sensors, operations, and legislation infrastructure for such, little attention has been paid to supporting the management of the complex data capture pipeline sUAS involve. This paper reports on a four-year, community-based investigation into the tools, data practices, and challenges that currently exist for particularly researchers using sUAS as data capture platforms. The key results of this effort are: (1) sUAS captured data-as a set that is rapidly growing to include data in a wide range of Physical and Environmental Sciences, Engineering Disciplines, and many civil and commercial use cases-is characterized as both sharing many traits with traditional remote sensing data and also as exhibiting-as common across the spectrum of disciplines and use cases-novel characteristics that require novel data support infrastructure; and (2), given this characterization of sUAS data and its potential value in the identified wide variety of use case, we outline eight challenges that need to be addressed in order for the full value of sUAS captured data to be realized. We conclude that there would be significant value gained and costs saved across both commercial and academic sectors if the global sUAS user and data management communities were to address these challenges in the immediate to near future, so as to extract the maximal value of sUAS captured data for the lowest long-term effort and monetary cost.

TI  - Changes in Water Surface Area during 1989-2017 in the Huai River Basin using Landsat Data and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of surface water play a crucial role in the hydrological cycle and are sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic activities, especially for the agricultural zone. As one of the most populous areas in China's river basins, the surface water in the Huai River Basin has significant impacts on agricultural plants, ecological balance, and socioeconomic development. However, it is unclear how water areas responded to climate change and anthropogenic water exploitation in the past decades. To understand the changes in water surface areas in the Huai River Basin, this study used the available 16,760 scenes Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI images in this region from 1989 to 2017 and processed the data on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The vegetation index and water index were used to quantify the spatiotemporal variability of the surface water area changes over the years. The major results include: (1) The maximum area, the average area, and the seasonal variation of surface water in the Huai River Basin showed a downward trend in the past 29 years, and the year-long surface water areas showed a slight upward trend; (2) the surface water area was positively correlated with precipitation (p < 0.05), but was negatively correlated with the temperature and evapotranspiration; (3) the changes of the total area of water bodies were mainly determined by the 216 larger water bodies (>10 km(2)). Understanding the variations in water body areas and the controlling factors could support the designation and implementation of sustainable water management practices in agricultural, industrial, and domestic usages.

TI  - Performances of WorldView 3, Sentinel 2, and Landsat 8 data in mapping impervious surface
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many efforts have been made to map developed impervious surface from remotely sensed information in the last two decades. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) to provide consistent land cover and change products for the Nation since 2001. Percent impervious surface area (ISA), one of the products in NLCD as a continuous field and estimated with Landsat imagery, represents the fraction of human-made impervious area in a 30m resolution grid. ISA is used to map urban land cover types and extents for the United States. However, it is still a challenge to quantify highly heterogeneous features in many urban areas using remotely sensed data with spatial and spectral resolutions similar to Landsat and to determine the impacts of remotely sensed data characteristics on ISA mapping.

TI  - Retrieval of crop biophysical parameters from Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The red-edge bands place the recently available multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery at an advantage over other multispectral sensors, and hypothetically offer improved crop biophysical variable retrieval accuracy. In this study, Sentinel-2 data was tested for its ability to estimate winter wheat leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC). Artificial neural network (ANN) and look-up table (LUT) (based on PROSAIL simulations) and vegetation index (VI) methods were applied to retrieve biophysical parameters, and compared with the biophysical processor module embedded in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software. Based on a set of in situ measurements (62 samples) and near-synchronous Sentinel-2 images, the inversion approaches were applied and validated. The results showed that: 1) Sentinel-2 red-edge bands improved the retrievals of chlorophyll / LAI compared to traditional VIs; 2) the red-edge VIs outperformed other approaches; and 3) the SNAP biophysical processor obtained comparable accuracies of LAI and CCC estimation compared to the ANN and LUT approaches, giving R-2 values above 0.5 with relatively low RMSE (1.53 m(2)/m(2) for LM, and 148.58 mu g/cm(2) for CCC). We recommend VI retrieval approach for small region with ground measurements, whereas where ground data is not available, SNAP is applicable for versatile and rapid winter wheat parameter estimation (though results need to be evaluated alongside the provided quality indicators). Summarizing, the results demonstrate the suitability of Sentinel-2 data, especially its red-edge bands, for crop biophysical variables retrieval. Future studies will need to make comparisons across canopy types to better assess the capability of the SNAP biophysical processor.

TI  - Retrieving Surface Soil Moisture over Wheat and Soybean Fields during Growing Season Using Modified Water Cloud Model from Radarsat-2 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieval over agricultural fields using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is often obstructed by the vegetation effects on the backscattering during the growing season. This paper reports the retrieval of SSM from RADARSAT-2 SAR data that were acquired over wheat and soybean fields throughout the 2015 (April to October) growing season. The developed SSM retrieval algorithm includes a vegetation-effect correction. A method that can adequately represent the scattering behavior of vegetation-covered area was developed by defining the backscattering from vegetation and the underlying soil individually to remove the effect of vegetation on the total SAR backscattering. The Dubois model was employed to describe the backscattering from the underlying soil. A modified Water Cloud Model (MWCM) was used to remove the effect of backscattering that is caused by vegetation canopy. SSM was derived from an inversion scheme while using the dual co-polarizations (HH and VV) from the quad polarization RADARSAT-2 SAR data. Validation against ground measurements showed a high correlation between the measured and estimated SSM (R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 4.43 vol.%, p < 0.01), which suggested an operational potential of RADARSAT-2 SAR data on SSM estimation over wheat and soybean fields during the growing season.

TI  - Temporal and spatial movement characteristics of the Altyn Tagh fault inferred from 21years of InSAR observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - We use 21years of interferometric synthetic aperture radar data obtained between 1996 and 2017 from three European Space Agency satellites, namely the European Remote Satellite (ERS), Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) and Sentinel-1, to estimate the present-day strain accumulation rate within the central segment of the Altyn Tagh fault (ATF) along the northern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau. We obtain the first Sentinel-1 line-of-sight velocity map, thereby revealing a velocity gradient across the main ATF. Due to significant near-fault deformation, which cannot be modeled by utilizing only the classic Savage deep slip model, a dislocation extending to a certain depth representing strain release by shallow creep is combined with a deep screw dislocation to model the observations. The best-fitting results are a 9.0mm/year slip rate with a 20.0km locking depth and a 2.0mm/year creep rate with a 2.0km creep extent for the ERS data, a 7.4mm/year slip rate with an 18.0km locking depth and a 1.8mm/year creep rate with a 2.8km creep extent for the ENVISAT data, and a 6.0mm/year slip rate with a 21.0km locking depth and a 1.5mm/year creep rate with a 1.0km creep extent for the Sentinel-1 data based on a single fault inversion. The slip rate decreases with time along this section of the ATF, while the creep rate varies around 1.8mm/year, which does not constitute an obvious variation. In the spatial domain, the fault was divided into three segments, only Sentinel-1 data were used in the inversion, and the best-fitting values for the slip rate, locking depth, creep rate and creep extent are [7.4, 21.0, 1.8, 1.5], [6.8, 23.0, 1.5, 1.0] and [5.3, 20.0, 2.0, 1.1] for the Kuyake segment, Kulukuole segment and Aqiang segment, respectively. We conclude that deep slip motion within the ATF was variable in both the time domain and the space domain, whereas shallow creep, which must be accounted for using the Fattahi model considering both deep and shallow motions, was stable at2.0mm/year with a creep extent of 1.0-2.0km. The seismic moment release rate is less than 9.0% of the geodetic moment accumulation rate, which indicates a high seismic risk within the ATF.

TI  - Predicting Soybean Yield with NDVI Using a Flexible Fourier Transform Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND APPLIED ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We use models incorporating the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from remote sensing satellites to improve soybean yield predictions in 10 major producing states in the United States. Unlike traditional methods that assume an ordinary least squares model applies to all observations, we allow for global flexibility in the relationship between NDVI and soybean yield by using the flexible Fourier transform (FFT) model. FFT results confirm that there is a nonlinear response of soybean yield to NDVI over the growing season. Out-of-sample predictions indicate that allowing for global flexibility with the FFT improves the predictions in time-series prediction and forecasting.

TI  - A Scheme for the Long-Term Monitoring of Impervious-Relevant Land Disturbances Using High Frequency Landsat Archives and the Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces are commonly acknowledged as major components of human settlements. The expansion of impervious surfaces could lead to a series of human-dominated environmental and ecological issues. Tracing impervious surface dynamics at a finer temporal-spatial scale is a critical way to better understand the increasingly human-dominated system of Earth. In this study, we put forward a new scheme to conduct long-term monitoring of impervious-relevant land disturbances using high frequency Landsat archives and the Google Earth Engine (GEE). First, the developed region was identified using a classification-based approach. Then, the GEE-version LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery) was used to detect land disturbances, characterizing the conversion from vegetation to impervious surfaces. Finally, the actual disturbance areas within the developed regions were derived and quantitatively evaluated. A case study was conducted to detect impervious surface dynamics in Nanjing, China, from 1988 to 2018. Results show that our scheme can efficiently monitor impervious surface dynamics at yearly intervals with good accuracy. The overall accuracy (OA) of the classification results for 1988 and 2018 are 95.86% and 94.14%. Based on temporal-spatial accuracy assessments of the final detection result, the temporal accuracy is 90.75%, and the average detection time deviation is -1.28 a. The OA, precision, and recall of the sampling inspection, respectively, are 84.34%, 85.43%, and 96.37%. This scheme provides new insights into capturing the expansion of impervious-relevant land disturbances with high frequency Landsat archives in an efficient way.

TI  - Integrating Latent Heat Flux Products from MODIS and Landsat Data Using Multi-Resolution Kalman Filter Method in the Midstream of Heihe River Basin of Northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate and spatially continuous estimation of terrestrial latent heat flux (LE) is crucial to the management and planning of water resources for arid and semi-arid areas, for which LE estimations from different satellite sensors unfortunately often contain data gaps and are inconsistent. Many integration approaches have been implemented to overcome these limitations; however, most suffer from either the persistent bias of relying on datasets at only one resolution or the spatiotemporal inconsistency of LE products. In this study, we exhibit an integration case in the midstream of the Heihe River Basin of northwest China by using a multi-resolution Kalman filter (MKF) method to develop continuous and consistent LE maps from satellite LE datasets across different resolutions. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LE product (MOD16), the Landsat-based LE product derived from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor, and ground observations of eddy covariance flux tower from June to September 2012 are used. The integrated results illustrate that data gaps of MOD16 dropped to less than 0.4% from the original 27-52%, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the LE products decreased by 50.7% on average. Our findings indicate that the MKF method has excellent capacity to fill data gaps, reduce uncertainty, and improve the consistency of multiple LE datasets at different resolutions.

TI  - The Analysis of Spectral Separability of Different Coral Reef Benthos and the Influence of Pigments on Coral Spectra Based on in Situ Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - One task of coral reef remote sensing is to obtain the composition and distributionof benthic categories. However, there is still a great deal of uncertainty and difficulty to discriminate reef benthos by means of remote sensing owing to the spatial heterogeneity and complicated spectrum of coral reef. Spectral characteristics of different coral reef benthos are the basic prior knowledge for remote sensing of coral reefs. Based on in situ spectral data and simulated satellite data, this paper analyzed the spectral characteristics of different coral reef benthos, especially the spectral properties of different coral types. The influence of coral pigments on coral spectra was also analysed. Finally, four kinds of commonly used satellite data (Landsat 8, IKONOS, Quickbird and SPOT 5) were simulated to investigate the spectral separability of different reef benthos from space. Results showed that sand and bleached corals could be easily identified by the reflectance curves in the visible bands. The first-order spectral derivation in visible bands was a good way to distinguish algae, seagrass and healthy corals. The differences of families, genera, species, coral shapes and coral colors would have obvious impact on the spectral characters of corals. In addition, Chlorophyll contents (including Chlorophyll-a, Chlorophyll-b and Chlorophyll-c) had high correlativity with reflectance of corals, which would exert notable influence on coral spectral features. Zooxanthella had the similar influence, but not as obviously as that of chlorophyll. Its density would affect the peak features of coral reflectance. Among the commonly used multi-spectral satellite data, Landsat 8 had the ability to distinguish sand, bleached corals, algae, healthy corals and seagrass owing to its coastal band, while IKONOS and Quickbird could identify sand, bleached corals and seagrass. Comparatively, SPOTS had a poor performance, which could only identify sand and bleached corals. However, in the identification of different types of corals, multispectral satellite data failed to capture the elaborated spectral features and hyperspectral data with high spatial resolution was needed for effective identification. In the future work, we will further expand more coral reef benthos samples and establish the spectral database of coral reef to provide the data support for the establishment of coral reef monitoring system in China.

TI  - Numerical investigation of the effects of aquatic plants on wind-induced currents in Taihu Lake in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDRODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow lakes are an important part of the earth's water circulation system, and many factors may impact the evolution of the lake water circulation, including the wind, the topography, the human activities, and the aquatic plants. This paper proposes a depth-averaged 2-D hydrodynamic model to investigate the interaction of the wind-induced current and the aquatic plant in the lake. The model is based on the generalized shallow water equations solved by an explicit finite volume method with unstructured triangular grids. The drag force of the vegetation is considered into the momentum equations as the source term. Remote sensing techniques are applied to evaluate the aquatic vegetation in the Taihu Lake, China, based on Landsat TM satellite images. The study model is then used to simulate the characteristics of the wind-induced currents in the Taihu Lake, without and with the vegetation effects. The simulation results are in good agreement with the field measurements, demonstrating that the aquatic plants significantly affect the magnitude of the velocity and the flow circulation induced by the wind in the Taihu Lake. In addition, a sensitivity analysis reveals that the plant parameters (the density and the drag force coefficient) are significant factors influencing the velocity and the structure of the currents in the Taihu Lake.

TI  - Oasification: An unable evasive process in fighting against desertification for the sustainable development of arid and semiarid regions of China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Oasification is a complex oasis expansion and ecological processes caused by climate changes and human activities under available water supply in arid and semiarid regions. The process can effectively improve soil productivity, vegetation cover, and biomass production in fighting against land degradation, such as desertification and soil erosion. However, the significance of oasification has not yet reached the general cognition compared to desertification, which is regarded as one of the most severe global eco-environmental issues. This paper identifies desertification and oasification processes and their perspectives in cognition. The implication of oasification in combating desertification and controlling land degradation is emphasized by the justification between desertification and oasification processes. As opposite process of desertification, the oasification is an unable evasive process that can provide positive environmental effects in the control of desertification, ecological restoration, and land rehabilitation. According to the interaction of climatic variations and human activities, the oasification processes is classified into six main forms: natural oasis evolution process, engineering forest construction, conversion of natural landforms into farmlands, urban encroachment, constructed environments, and coupled ecosystems. These processes gradually modify the productive capacity of soils, increase vegetation cover for restoring degraded lands, and improve the living environment for human settlement and sustainability of an oasis ecosystem. Moreover, an overview of oasification research is detailed, and Northwest China as an example is used to illustrate the progress of the oasification research in recent decades. Currently, the oasification process and its mechanistic research still remain less concern in the arid and semiarid regions. A new science framework of the oasification research is proposed to effectively deal with ecological and environmental issues in the arid and semiarid regions.

TI  - An Improved Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers Applied to 3D Building Reconstruction and Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent scatterers interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) is capable of precise topography measurement up to sub-meter scale and monitoring subtle deformation up to mm/year scale for all the radar image pixels with stable radiometric characteristics. As a representative PS-InSAR method, the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) is widely used due to its high density of PS points for both rural and urban areas. However, when it comes to layover regions, which usually happen in urban areas, the StaMPS is limited locally. Moreover, the measurement points are greatly reduced due to the removal of adjacent PS pixels. In this paper, an improved StaMPS method, called IStaMPS, is proposed. The PS pixels are selected with high density by the improved PS selection strategy. Moreover, the topography information not provided in StaMPS can be accurately measured in IStaMPS. Based on the data acquired by TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X over the Terminal 3 E (T3 E) site of Beijing Capital International Airport and the Chaobai River of Beijing Shunyi District, a comparison between StaMPS-retrieved results and IStaMPS-retrieved ones was performed, which demonstrated that the density of PS points detected by IStaMPS is increased by about 1.8 and 1.6 times for these two areas respectively. Through comparisons of local statistical results of topography estimation and mean deformation rate, the improvement granted by the proposed IStaMPS was demonstrated for both urban areas with complex buildings or man-made targets and non-urban areas with natural targets. In terms of the spatiotemporal deformation variation, the northwest region of T3 E experienced an exceptional uplift during the period from June 2012 to August 2015, and the maximum uplift rate is approximately 4.2 mm per year.

TI  - Detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses in waterfowl in Bangladesh
T2  - VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bangladesh has reported repeated outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses in poultry since 2007. Because of the large number of live poultry markets (LPM) relative to the population density of poultry throughout the country, these markets can serve as sentinel sites for HPAI A(H5) detection. Through active LPM surveillance during June 2016-June 2017, HPAI A(H5N6) viruses along with 14 other subtypes of influenza A viruses were detected. The HPAI A(H5N6) viruses belonged to Glade 2.3.4.4 and were likely introduced into Bangladesh around March 2016. Human infections with influenza Glade 2.3.4.4 viruses in Bangladesh have not been identified, but the viruses had several molecular markers associated with potential human infection. Vigilant surveillance at the animal-human interface is essential to identify emerging avian influenza viruses with the potential to threaten public and animal health.

TI  - CDnet: CNN-Based Cloud Detection for Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is one of the important tasks for remote sensing image (RSI) preprocessing. In this paper, we utilize the thumbnail (i. e., preview image) of RSI, which contains the information of original multispectral or panchromatic imagery, to extract cloud mask efficiently. Compared with detection cloud mask from original RSI, it is more challenging to detect cloud mask using thumbnails due to the loss of resolution and spectrum information. To tackle this problem, we propose a cloud detection neural network (CDnet) with an encoder-decoder structure, a feature pyramid module (FPM), and a boundary refinement (BR) block. The FPM extracts the multiscale contextual information without the loss of resolution and coverage; the BR block refines object boundaries; and the encoder-decoder structure gradually recovers segmentation results with the same size as input image. Experimental results on the ZY-3 satellite thumbnails cloud cover validation data set and two other validation data sets (GF-1 WFV Cloud and Cloud Shadow Cover Validation Data and Landsat-8 Cloud Cover Assessment Validation Data) demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accurate detection accuracy and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Estimating ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> over a coastal region of China using satellite AOD and a combined model
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of adverse human health effects due to exposures to particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 gm (PM2.5) are often limited by sparse ground in situ measurements. Satellite remote sensing technique provides an effective tool for PM2.5 assessment in areas where surface PM2.5 monitoring network is not available. The MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) with spatial resolution of 10 km has been widely used in retrieving PM2.5 concentrations in a large scale, but it is insufficient for city-scale PM2.5 studies. In this study, we used the newly released AOD product with higher resolution of 3 km incorporating meteorological fields from Goddard Earth Observing System-Forward Processing (GEOS-FP) and road density for ground-level PM2.5 estimation in Fuzhou, i.e. a coastal city of China. A two-stage statistical model combing linear mixed effects model (LME) and support vector regression model (SVR) was proposed in this study, and a 10-fold cross validation approach was employed for model validation. We obtained an overall R-2 of 0.81, root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.83 mu g/m(3) in model fitting, and R-2 of 0.77, RMSE of 9.51 mu g/m(3) in model validation. The retrieved PM2.5 presented a spatial pattern with high concentrations in urban areas and low values in suburban or mountainous areas. We also found that the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations showed a very strong correlation with the terrain features, forest cover, road density, and industrial pollution sources. The results revealed that the combined LME-SVR model using 3 km AOD along with GEOS-FP field and road density could achieve high accuracy in PM2.5 estimation, and would be helpful for air quality monitoring in Fuzhou.

TI  - Linking Persistent Scatterers to the Built Environment Using Ray Tracing on Urban Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent scatterers (PSs) are coherent measurement points obtained from time series of satellite radar images, which are used to detect and estimate millimeter-scale displacements of the terrain or man-made structures. However, associating these measurement points with specific physical objects is not straightforward, which hampers the exploitation of the full potential of the data. We have investigated the potential for predicting the occurrence and location of PSs using generic 3-D city models and ray-tracing methods, and proposed a methodology to match PSs to the pointlike scatterers predicted using RaySAR, a ray-tracing synthetic aperture radar simulator. We also investigate the impact of the level of detail (LOD) of the city models. For our test area in Rotterdam, we find that 10% and 37% of the PSs detected in a stack of TerraSAR-X data can be matched with point scatterers identified by ray tracing using LOD1 and LOD2 models, respectively. In the LOD1 case, most matched scatterers are at street level while LOD2 allows the identification of many scatterers on the buildings. Over half of the identified scatterers easily correspond to identify double or triple-bounce scatterers. However, a significant fraction corresponds to higher bounce levels, with approximately 25% being fivefold-bounce scatterers.

TI  - Post-earthquake spatio-temporal landslide analysis of Huisun Experimental Forest Station
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study utilized satellite imagery and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the post-earthquake spatio-temporal changes of landslide for Huisun Experimental Forest Station (HEFS). Total 26 SPOT satellite images taken between January 1999 (before the Chi-Chi earthquake) and July 2016 shows that the total landslide area was fluctuated after the earthquake and then became stable after 2008. Overall, the long-term landslide trends of HEFS is approaching a stable stage in terms of the slightly increasing mean NDVI value with decreasing NDVI variance from 1999 to 2016 based on the linear regression and Mean-Variance analyses. Two large landslide areas in Xinsheng Village and along Meitangan River were identified as statistically significant hot spots. More than 50% of landslides in HEFS were observed in areas with S-facing and SE-facing slopes with the majority of landslides occurred at 500 - 1500 m elevation. The slope characteristic of landslides changed to a concentration in 30 - 40 degree after the Chi-Chi earthquake and changed again to a concentration in 20 - 30 degree after 2008. Based on the results of the frequency of landslide occurrence, the total landslide area was the largest in the 0 - 9 times category. In the 10 - 16 and 17 - 26 times categories, high percentages of landslides were found in SE-facing and S-facing slopes. An inverse relationship was found between the landslide areas and the distance to river channel in the 0 - 9 and 10 - 16 times categories. The results of spatio-temporal landslide analysis can be references for management and conservation strategies in HEFS.

TI  - Assessing China's human-environment relationship
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - China's coupled human-environment system (CHES) is assessed here via a systems schema that emphasizes the complex interactions of components and their attributes. In addition to the human and environment components, we identified two other components to evaluate the relationship. The four components are human activity intensity, resource carrying capacity, ecological constraints and system's openness. Based on their interactions, we derived a cognitive schema for classifying the level of strain or stress of an area. The analysis draws on 11 indicators and 29 sub-indicators including remote sensing data and statistical data that are used to estimate the four components. The findings indicate that human activities are highly intense in a few geographical areas, particularly large urban systems and trade and investment zones on the eastern coastal areas. Nonetheless, these areas are also well-endowed in water resources and fertile soils although urban systems are increasingly stressed from negative pollution externalities. They are also open systems which allow them to bear a higher level of pressure and adjust accordingly. Desertification and soil erosion point to relatively fragile biophysical systems in the west and southwest, but human activities are still relatively less intense compared to their coastal counterparts. As a whole, only 14% of areas may be said to be relatively or highly strained. This however belies another one-third of areas that are currently unstable, and likely to become strained and thereby vulnerable in the near future.

TI  - Male breast cancer: A 10 year retrospective case series in a tertiary care hospital
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Male breast cancer is a rare disease and it differs from breast cancer in women by some characteristics. The incidence of the disease has increased in the last 25 years. The records of male patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer between 2007 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed in a tertiary care hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. The patients' ages, background, family history, clinical features, histopathological features of the tumour, its stage, the treatment and the survival were investigated. SPSS 15.0 for Windows programme was used for statistical analysis. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier method. Determinants were analysed by univariate Cox regression analysis. A total of 15 patients were evaluated in our study. Fourteen patients had invasive ductal carcinoma and one patient had intraductal papillary carcinoma. The median follow-up period of the patients was 36 months The axillary lymph node metastasis positivity rate (number of metastatic lymph nodes/number of lymph nodes dissected) was statistically significantly higher in patients who died than in patients who survived. In univariate Cox regression analysis, the effects of age, tumour size, estrogen, progesterone, the presence of HER2/neu receptor and axillary metastasis on survival were not determined. We believe that raising awareness on male breast cancer in the community, genetic testing and screening mammography in high-risk patients will be useful in early diagnosis of the disease and improvement of its prognosis.

TI  - Analysis of long-term gully dynamics in different agro-ecology settings
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully erosion is one of the main causes of land degradation, particularly in the drought-prone regions of Ethiopia. This study assessed spatio-temporal changes of gully length and density in watershed pairs in Guder, Aba Gerima, and Dibatie sites, which are representative highland, midland, and lowland agro-ecologies in the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia. Aerial photographs (1957, 1982) and very high resolution satellite images (QuickBird, IKONOS, Worldview-2, SPOT-7, and Pleiades) of the six watersheds, along with field survey results, were used in the analyses. The aerial photographs were scanned and orthorectified using ENVI 4.3 image analysis software, and gullies were mapped by visual image interpretation in the ArcGIS environment. Rates of increase in gully length in Guder (36.9 m yr(-1)) and Aba Gerima (33.6 m yr(-1)) were almost double the rate in Dibatie (17.8 m yr(-1)) from 1957 to 2016 or 2017, and over the same period, gully density similarly increased by 5.9, 5.4, and 3.7 m ha(-1) in Guder, Aba Gerima, and Dibatie, respectively. The higher rates in Guder and Aba Gerima reflect the long history of cultivation and human settlement in those sites, whereas agricultural activity became widespread in Dibatie only after implementation of the national resettlement program in the 1980s. Moreover, although gully density tended to increase over time in all six watersheds, in the three watersheds (one in each paired watershed) where soil and water conservation measures had been introduced, the rate of increase was lower than in those where no such measures were implemented. In addition, gully distribution was linked to land use and landscape position; gully density was higher in cultivated areas and where slope gradients were gentle. The results of this study indicate that careful site-specific identification of factors controlling gully initiation and development is crucial so that appropriate management strategies can be developed for these three sites and for other areas with similar agro-ecologies in the Upper Blue Nile basin.

TI  - Is the frozen section examination for sentinel lymph node necessary in early breast cancer patients?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node [SLN] biopsy [SLNB] is widely performed for axillary staging in patients with breast cancer. Based on the results of frozen section examination [FSE], surgeons can decide to continue further axillary dissections. This study aimed to verify the accuracy of FSE for SLNs.Methods: We reviewed the records of 4,219 patients who underwent SLNB for primary invasive breast cancer between 2007 and 2016 at the Severance Hospital. We evaluated factors associated with the false-negative results of FSE for SLNs using the Generalized Estimating Equations model.Results: A total of 1,397 SLNs from 908 patients were confirmed to be metastatic. Seventy-one patients [1.7%] had confirmed pathologic N2 or N3 stage. Among metastatic SLNs, micrometastasis was found in 234 [16.8%]. The overall accuracy of SLNB was 98.5%. The sensitivity and false-negative rate of FSE were 86.4% and 13.6%, respectively. Several clinicopathological factors, including the size of SLN metastases, suspicious preoperative axillary lymph nodes, and luminal B subtype, were associated with a higher rate of false-negative results.Conclusion: Most patients were not indicated for axillary lymph node dissection. Some patients may show transition in their permanent pathology due to the size of the metastatic node. However, the false-negative results of FSE for SLNs based on the size of the metastatic node did not change our practice. Therefore, intraoperative FSE for SLN should not be routinely performed for all breast cancer patients.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study and Cost-Efficient Genomic Predictions for Growth and Fillet Yield in Nile Tilapia (<i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>)
T2  - G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fillet yield (FY) and harvest weight (HW) are economically important traits in Nile tilapia production. Genetic improvement of these traits, especially for FY, are lacking, due to the absence of efficient methods to measure the traits without sacrificing fish and the use of information from relatives to selection. However, genomic information could be used by genomic selection to improve traits that are difficult to measure directly in selection candidates, as in the case of FY. The objectives of this study were: (i) to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to dissect the genetic architecture of FY and HW, (ii) to evaluate the accuracy of genotype imputation and (iii) to assess the accuracy of genomic selection using true and imputed low-density (LD) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels to determine a cost-effective strategy for practical implementation of genomic information in tilapia breeding programs. The data set consisted of 5,866 phenotyped animals and 1,238 genotyped animals (108 parents and 1,130 offspring) using a 50K SNP panel. The GWAS were performed using all genotyped and phenotyped animals. The genotyped imputation was performed from LD panels (LD0.5K, LD1K and LD3K) to high-density panel (HD), using information from parents and 20% of offspring in the reference set and the remaining 80% in the validation set. In addition, we tested the accuracy of genomic selection using true and imputed genotypes comparing the accuracy obtained from pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (PBLUP) and genomic predictions. The results from GWAS supports evidence of the polygenic nature of FY and HW. The accuracy of imputation ranged from 0.90 to 0.98 for LD0.5K and LD3K, respectively. The accuracy of genomic prediction outperformed the estimated breeding value from PBLUP. The use of imputation for genomic selection resulted in an increased relative accuracy independent of the trait and LD panel analyzed. The present results suggest that genotype imputation could be a cost-effective strategy for genomic selection in Nile tilapia breeding programs.

TI  - Agriculture Sprawl Assessment Using Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Images and Its Environmental Impact; Al-Jouf, KSA
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, multispectral and multi-temporal satellite data were used to assess the spatial and temporal evolution of the agriculture activities in the Al-Jouf region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In the current study, an attempt was made to map the agriculture sprawl from 1987 to 2017 using temporal Landsat images in a geographic information system (GIS) environment for better decision-making and sustainable agriculture expansion. Our findings indicated that the agriculture activities developed through two crucial stages: high and low rise stages. Low rise stages occurred during three sub-stages from April 1987 to April 1988, from September 1993 to August 1998, and from April 2008 to May 2015, with overall change rates of 37.9, 44.4, and 30.5 km(2)/year, respectively. High rise stages occurred during three sub-stages from April 1988 to February 1993, from September 2000 to March 2006, and from April 2016 to August 2017, with overall change rates of 132.4, 159.1, and 119.5 km(2)/year, respectively. Different environmental problems due to uncontrolled agriculture activities were observed in the area, including substantial depletion of the groundwater table. Another environmental impact observed was the appearance of sinkholes that occurred suddenly with no warning signs. These environmental impacts will increase in the future if no regulated restrictions are implemented by decision-makers.

TI  - Glacier facies characterization using optical satellite data: Impacts of radiometric resolution, seasonality, and surface morphology
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral characterization of geographic landscapes is vital for their accurate mapping using remote sensing data. This can be done through spectral profiling, as demonstrated here, to characterize the surface facies of the Gangotri and neighbouring glaciers, central Himalaya. The satellite-derived reflectance curves were compared with the in-situ and published (validation) data. The study attempts to understand the influence of certain parameters such as the satellite sensor's radiometric resolution, timing of data acquisition (seasonality), and surface morphology on glacier/snow-ice facies identification. Results show that the first two parameters complement each other in identifying the snow-ice facies accurately. High radiometric resolution (HRR) data concurred closely with the validation dataset and had higher mean entropy values over the glaciated areas than low radiometric resolution (LRR) ablation data. Presence of seasonal snow and degree of surface melting show considerable influence on satellite-derived reflectances of glacier facies. Our findings assert the usage of HRR ablation data in appraising the interannual and seasonal variability of glacier facies. While HRR post-ablation data overestimates the reflectance of snow-ice facies, LRR post-ablation data have limitations in their discrimination. Certain morphology and resultant features, such as crevasses and shadows, induce underestimation of the satellite-derived reflectances, creating confusion among the snow and ice facies. This spectral confusion can, however, be resolved by the use of ancillary data. Elevation, temperature, and band ratios/spectral indices are helpful in segregating snow-ice facies, while slope, band ratios, temperature, and texture measures effectively discriminate the other facies.

TI  - GPU accelerated interferometric SAR processing for Sentinel-1 TOPS data
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 (S-1) TOPS data are widely applied in InSAR applications to monitor earthquakes and landslides. The large S-1 coverage however, leads to a high computational cost when executing InSAR techniques. Thus, we develop a GPU accelerated S-1 InSAR processing method implemented on a personal desktop. In the proposed method, computationally expensive modules including geometric coregistration, resampling, Enhanced Spectral Diversity, and coherence estimation, are implemented using CUDA. In addition, several optimizations are employed to enhance the efficiency of these modules. We select an efficient approximation method in the geometric coregistration module, and improve the GPU memory access efficiency in the resampling module through the GPU texture memory, temporary register array, and a configuration with more Ll cache. We develop a novel GPU-based parallel coherence estimation algorithm in ESD and coherence estimation modules, and use the asynchronous data transfer technology to hide the costs of CPU-GPU data transfer for resampling, ESD, and coherence estimation modules. After several optimizations, our GPU-accelerated modules (considering CPU-GPU transmission costs) achieves speedup ratios up to 157x, 166x, 145x, and 168x with respect to their single-threaded CPU counterparts. For a full frame S-1 image, our method reduces the computation time from 1415.32s to 8.59s. Moreover, our method is also validated in two case studies of the 2016 Mw6.2 Central Italy earthquake and 2018 Mw6.9 Leilani Estates earthquake caused by the Kilauea eruption in Hawaii.

TI  - Automatically Extracted Antarctic Coastline Using Remotely-Sensed Data: An Update
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal and spatial variability of the Antarctic coastline is a clear indicator of change in extent and mass balance of ice sheets and shelves. In this study, the Canny edge detector was utilized to automatically extract high-resolution information of the Antarctic coastline for 2005, 2010, and 2017, based on optical and microwave satellite data. In order to improve the accuracy of the extracted coastlines, we developed the Canny algorithm by automatically calculating the local low and high thresholds via the intensity histogram of each image to derive thresholds to distinguish ice sheet from water. A visual comparison between extracted coastlines and mosaics from remote sensing images shows good agreement. In addition, comparing manually extracted coastline, based on prior knowledge, the accuracy of planimetric position of automated extraction is better than two pixels of Landsat images (30 m resolution). Our study shows that the percentage of deviation (<100 m) between automatically and manually extracted coastlines in nine areas around the Antarctica is 92.32%, and the mean deviation is 38.15 m. Our results reveal that the length of coastline around Antarctica increased from 35,114 km in 2005 to 35,281 km in 2010, and again to 35,672 km in 2017. Meanwhile, the total area of the Antarctica varied slightly from 1.3618 x 10(7) km(2) (2005) to 1.3537 x 10(7) km(2) (2010) and 1.3657 x 10(7) km(2) (2017). We have found that the decline of the Antarctic area between 2005 and 2010 is related to the breakup of some individual ice shelves, mainly in the Antarctic Peninsula and off East Antarctica. We present a detailed analysis of the temporal and spatial change of coastline and area change for the six ice shelves that exhibited the largest change in the last decade. The largest area change (a loss of 4836 km(2)) occurred at the Wilkins Ice Shelf between 2005 and 2010.

TI  - Development of soil moisture indices from differences in water absorption between shortwave-infrared bands
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) controls the exchange of water and heat energy between the land surface and the atmosphere through evaporation and plant transpiration, and timely and accurate estimates of soil moisture are crucial for many studies. Although remote sensing provides many algorithms to obtain bare-soil moisture on large scales (e.g., Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) products), these algorithms are restricted to studies with low ground resolution. In the present study, we propose and evaluate three normalized shortwave-infrared (SWIR) difference bare soil moisture indices [NSDSI1 = (BSWIR1-BSWIR2)/BSWIR1, NSDSI2 = (BSWIR1 - BSWIR2)/BSWIR2, NSDSI3 = (BSWIR1 BSWIR2)/(BSWIR1 + BSWIR2), where, SWIR1 = 15501750 nm, SWIR2 = 21002300 nm] to estimate the bare-soil moisture content and, based on the water absorption difference between shortwave-infrared bands, use them to map bare-soil moisture with high ground resolution Sentinel-2 MSI images. The three proposed bare-soil moisture indices are obtained by using the different water absorption in shortwave-infrared bands. Four traditional hyperspectral-based bare-soil moisture indices (such as the water index SOIL, or WISOIL, the normalized soil moisture index, or NSMI, etc.) were used as benchmark. The results show that (i) the differences in water absorption between shortwave-infrared bands is linear in soil moisture content; (ii) the combined use of two shortwave-infrared bands from four soils provides more accurate bare-soil moisture estimates than do single shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands, and (iii) our proposed bare-soil moisture indices can be applied on broadband remote-sensing images (such as Landsat, Sentinel-2 MSI). The bare-soil moisture estimates obtained by using the proposed bare-soil moisture indices may help to obtain bare-soil moisture maps with high ground resolution.

TI  - Impact of urbanization on basin hydrology: a case study of the Malir Basin, Karachi, Pakistan
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Karachi, the biggest city of Pakistan, has undergone various urban sprawls due to its continuously growing population that has severely affected its natural drainage pattern. The city had an extensive natural drainage system which has now lost its original form. This study investigated the blockages and their causes during the last two decades in one of the city's riverbeds-Malir. Moreover, the extent of floods identifying the vulnerability of the watershed's urban area after major rainfall events was modeled. The geospatial techniques and satellite images of Landsat 5, 7, and 8 were used to analyze the changes in land use and land cover (LULC) of the Malir Basin. The Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model and topographic sheets of 1975 were utilized to delineate the natural drainage network and streambeds of the basin using geographical information system (GIS) tools. Historical rainfall data from 1985 to 2014 were acquired from the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) to simulate runoff using the US Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS and HEC-GeoHMS). The flood modeling was done using the River Analysis System (HEC-RAS and GeoRAS). Rainfall-runoff simulations and flood extent and depth of five major rainfall events-1992, 2003, 2007, 2009, and 2013-were modeled in this study. GIS overlay analysis combined the LULC, riverbed, and drainage line layers to identify the blocked area and to quantify the specific LULCs that were causing blockages in the riverbed. Several maps, which are prepared in this study, show the parts of the river with altered drainage patterns in 2013 from what existed back in 1975.

TI  - Assessing the impact of dams on riparian and deltaic vegetation using remotely-sensed vegetation indices and Random Forests modelling
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian and deltaic areas exhibit a high biodiversity and offer a number of ecosystem services but are often degraded by human activities. Dams, for example, alter the hydrologic and sediment regimes of rivers and can negatively affect riparian areas and deltas. In order to sustainably manage these ecosystems, it is, therefore, essential to assess and monitor the impacts of dams. To this end, site-assessments and in-situ measurements have commonly been used in the past, but these can be laborious, resource demanding and time consuming. Here, we investigated the impact of three dams on the riparian forest of the Nestos River Delta in Greece by employing multi-temporal satellite data. We assessed the evolution in the values of eight vegetation indices over 27 years, derived from 14 dates of Landsat data. We also employed a modelling approach, using a machine learning Random Forests model, to investigate potential linkages between the observed changes in the indices and a host of climatic and terrestrial predictor variables. Our results show that low density vegetation (0-25%) is more affected by the construction of the dams due to its proximity to anthropogenic influences and the effects of hydrologic regime alteration. In contrast, higher density vegetation cover (50-75%) appears to be largely unaffected, or even improving, due to its proximity to the river, while vegetation with intermediate coverage (25-49%)exhibits no clear trend in the Landsat-derived indices. The Random Forests model found that the most important parameters for the riparian vegetation (based on the Mean Decrease Gini and the Mean Decrease Accuracy) were the distance to the dams, the sea and the river. Our results suggest that management plans of riparian and deltaic areas need to incorporate and take into consideration new innovative management practices and monitoring studies that employ multi-temporal satellite data archives.

TI  - An Integrated Land Cover Mapping Method Suitable for Low-Accuracy Areas in Global Land Cover Maps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In land cover mapping, an area with complex topography or heterogeneous land covers is usually poorly classified and therefore defined as a low-accuracy area. The low-accuracy areas are important because they restrict the overall accuracy (OA) of global land cover classification (LCC) data generated. In this paper, low-accuracy areas in China (extracted from the MODIS global LCC maps) were taken as examples, identified as the regions having lower accuracy than the average OA of China. An integrated land cover mapping method targeting low-accuracy regions was developed and tested in eight representative low-accuracy regions of China. The method optimized procedures of image choosing and sample selection based on an existent visually-interpreted regional LCC dataset with high accuracies. Five algorithms and 16 groups of classification features were compared to achieve the highest OA. The support vector machine (SVM) achieved the highest mean OA (81.5%) when only spectral bands were classified. Aspect tended to attenuate OA as a classification feature. The optimal classification features for different regions largely depends on the topographic feature of vegetation. The mean OA for eight low-accuracy regions was 84.4% by the proposed method in this study, which exceeded the mean OA of most precedent global land cover datasets. The new method can be applied worldwide to improve land cover mapping of low-accuracy areas in global land cover maps.

TI  - Extracting aquaculture ponds from natural water surfaces around inland lakes on medium resolution multispectral images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A considerable portion of the natural inland lakes has been gradually transformed into aquaculture ponds to meet the enormous demand for aquaculture products. The changes in ponds area can be used to measure the impact of human activities on inland lakes. However, aquaculture ponds and inland lakes are often intermingled with each other especially in the areas close to the lake shore, posing great difficulties for the extraction of aquaculture ponds from medium resolution (15-30 m) multispectral imagery, such as Landsat TM, OLI, and Geofen-1 WFV images. This study proposes a contour-based regularity measurement for water segments, which evaluates the zero-curvature portions of the boundaries, to distinguish aquaculture ponds from natural water. Water surfaces are firstly extracted from satellite images, and then boundary trace of each water segment is carried out to evaluate the geometrical feature of its contour, including perimeter, curvature and the proposed contour-based regularity. Eventually, SVM classification based on these geometrical features separates the aquaculture ponds from inland lakes. Experiments on Landsat TM, OLI, and Geofen-1 WFV images showed that the combination of perimeter, area and proposed contour-based regularity outperforms other feature combinations and produced the most accurate classification. Therefore, the proposed method can be used to extract all aquaculture ponds from all historic Landsat images to monitor the changes in inland aquaculture.

TI  - Determining the spatial distribution of soil properties using the environmental covariates and multivariate statistical analysis: a case study in semi-arid regions of Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural soil-forming factors such as landforms, parent materials or biota lead to high variability in soil properties. However, there is not enough research quantifying which environmental factor(s) can be the most relevant to predicting soil properties at the catchment scale in semi-arid areas. Thus, this research aims to investigate the ability of multivariate statistical analyses to distinguish which soil properties follow a clear spatial pattern conditioned by specific environmental characteristics in a semi-arid region of Iran. To achieve this goal, we digitized parent materials and landforms by recent orthophotography. Also, we extracted ten topographical attributes and five remote sensing variables from a digital elevation model (DEM) and the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM), respectively. These factors were contrasted for 334 soil samples (depth of 0-30 cm). Cluster analysis and soil maps reveal that Cluster 1 comprises of limestones, massive limestones and mixed deposits of conglomerates with low soil organic carbon (SOC) and clay contents, and Cluster 2 is composed of soils that originated from quaternary and early quaternary parent materials such as terraces, alluvial fans, lake deposits, and marls or conglomerates that register the highest SOC content and the lowest sand and silt contents. Further, it is confirmed that soils with the highest SOC and clay contents are located in wetlands, lagoons, alluvial fans and piedmonts, while soils with the lowest SOC and clay contents are located in dissected alluvial fans, eroded hills, rock outcrops and steep hills. The results of principal component analysis using the remote sensing data and topographical attributes identify five main components, which explain 73.3% of the total variability of soil properties. Environmental factors such as hillslope morphology and all of the remote sensing variables can largely explain SOC variability, but no significant correlation is found for soil texture and calcium carbonate equivalent contents. Therefore, we conclude that SOC can be considered as the best-predicted soil property in semi-arid regions.

TI  - The potential role of carbon nanoparticles-assisted biopsy for sentinel lymph nodes of incidental thyroid carcinoma
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Some thyroid cancers are found after thyroidectomy for benign lesions, implying additional surgery and treatments. This work aimed to investigate the role of intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for diagnosis of incidental thyroid carcinoma.Methods: This was a retrospective study of 541 consecutive patients who underwent thyroid surgery between 02/2012 and 02/2014 at the Hunan Provincial People's Hospital. All patients were diagnosed with thyroid benign lesions preoperatively and intraoperatively. Among them, 375 underwent successful intraoperative SLNB using carbon nanoparticles (CNs).Results: The preoperative diagnoses were nodular goiter (n=472), I Iashimoto's disease with nodules (n=24), hyperthyroidism with nodules (n=16), and thyroid cysts with obstructive symptoms (n=29). In the SLNB group, SIN metastasis of thyroid microcarcinoma was confirmed in 21/392 cases (5.4%). These 21 patients received radical surgical treatment for thyroid carcinoma during the initial operation. In the no-SLNB group n=149), seven patients (4.7%) were finally diagnosed with thyroid microcarcinoma. Six patients had to undergo a second surgery.Conclusions: Intraoperative SLNB could help diagnose differentiated thyroid microcarcinoma that may be missed preoperatively and intraoperatively. This could prevent the need for a second surgery since the intraoperative frozen section examination of the SLNs can reveal metastasis from thyroid cancer.

TI  - A New Pseudoinvariant Near-Infrared Threshold Method for Relative Radiometric Correction of Aerial Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The utilization of high-resolution aerial imagery such as the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) data is often hampered by a lack of methods for retrieving surface reflectance from digital numbers. This study developed a new relative radiometric correction method to retrieve 1 m surface reflectance from NAIP imagery. The advantage of this method lies in the adaptive identification of pseudoinvariant (PIV) pixels from a time series of Landsat images that can fully characterize the temporally spectral variations of land surface. The identified PIV pixels allow for an effective conversion of digital numbers to surface reflectance, as demonstrated through the validation at 150 sites across the contiguous United States. The results show substantial improvement in the agreement of NAIP-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values with Landsat-derived NDVI reference. Across the sites, root mean square error and mean absolute error were reduced from 0.37 +/- 0.14 to 0.08 +/- 0.07 and from 0.91 +/- 0.64 to 0.18 +/- 0.52, respectively. Over 70% PIV pixels on average were derived from vegetated areas, while water and developed areas together contributed 27% of the PIV pixels. As the NAIP program is continuing to generate new images across the country, the advantages of its high spatial resolution, national coverage, long time series, and regular revisits will make it an increasingly crucial data source for a variety of research and management applications. The proposed method could benefit many agricultural, hydrological, and urban studies that rely on NAIP imagery to quantify land surface patterns and dynamics. It could also be applied to improve the preprocessing of high-resolution aerial imagery in other countries.

TI  - Dust Properties and Radiative Impacts at a Suburban Site during 2004-2017 in the North China Plain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols and their radiative effects are of primary interest in climate research because of their vital influence on climate change. Dust aerosols are an important aerosol type in the North China Plain (NCP), mainly as a result of long-range transport, showing substantial spatiotemporal variations. By using measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) between September 2004 and May 2017, and the space-borne Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) aerosol products, we investigated the properties of dust aerosols and their radiative effects at Xianghe (XH)-a suburban site in the NCP. Dust events occurred most frequently during spring (a total of 105 days) relative to the other three seasons (a total of 41 days) during the periods concerned. The dust aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 675 nm was at a maximum in spring (0.60 +/- 0.44), followed (in decreasing order) by those in autumn (0.58 +/- 0.39), summer (0.54 +/- 0.15), and winter (0.53 +/- 0.23). Cooling effects of dust aerosol radiative forcing (RF) at the bottom and top of the atmosphere tended to be strongest in spring (-96.72 +/- 45.69 and -41.87 +/- 19.66 Wm(-2)) compared to that in summer (-57.08 +/- 18.54 and -25.54 +/- 4.45 Wm(-2)), autumn (-72.01 +/- 27.27 and -32.54 +/- 15.18 Wm(-2)), and winter (-79.57 +/- 32.96 and -37.05 +/- 17.06 Wm(-2)). The back-trajectory analysis indicated that dust air mass at 500 m that arrived at XH generally originated from the Gobi and other deserts of northern China and Mongolia (59.8%), and followed by northwest China and Kazakhstan (37.2%); few dust cases came from northeast China (3.0%). A single-peaked structure with the maximum occurring at similar to 2 km was illustrated by all dust events and those sorted by their sources in three directions. Three typical dust events were specifically discussed to better reveal how long-range transport impacted the dust properties and radiative effects over the NCP. The results presented here are expected to improve our understanding of the physical properties of dust aerosols over the NCP and their major transport path and significant impacts on the regional solar radiation budget.

TI  - Using a Phase-Congruency-Based Detector for Glacial Lake Segmentation in High-Temporal Resolution Sentinel-1A/1B Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes are the main products of glacier melting caused by climate warming. Changes in glacial lake outlines and in textural features in the surroundings are important indicators used in the dynamic monitoring of glacial lakes. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which can be used regardless of weather and solar illumination conditions, are a useful source of information about the occurrence and evolution of such lakes. The development of high-temporal resolution SAR makes it possible to study glacial lakes more frequently. However, segmentation of the glacial lakes using SAR data remains a challenge because of noise effects and low contrast. This paper presents a phase-congruency-based detector that can be used to extract the linear features (outlines and textural features) of glacial lakes using C-band high-temporal resolution Sentinel-1A/1B imagery of the Himalayas. In this algorithm, all the weak edges are first detected by phase congruency, which is insensitive to image contrast and magnification. Then, the fast-marching method is applied to improve the connectivity and form a complete lake boundary. Experimental results derived from intensity and coherence images are evaluated and compared for different lake types. It is shown that the proposed method can locate the exact position of most of the outlines. The relative errors for all the lakes in the intensity images were reduced to within four pixels with a 90% confidence level, and within three pixels for unconnected glacial lakes in the coherence data.

TI  - Evaluation of the Aqua-MODIS C6 and C6.1 Aerosol Optical Depth Products in the Yellow River Basin, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Aqua-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection (C6) and C6.1 Dark Target aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals at 3 km (DT3K) and 10 km (DT10K), Deep Blue AOD retrievals at 10 km (DB10K), and combined DT and DB (DTB) AOD retrievals at 10 km resolutions were validated from 2002 to 2014 against ground-based sunphotometer AOD measurements obtained from the Chinese aerosol remote sensing network (CARSNET). The CARSNET AOD data were obtained for sites at Mt. Waliguan (MW), Lanzhou (LZ), Ulate (UL), and Zhengzhou (ZZ) located in the Yellow River basin (YERB) region, China. Errors and agreement between satellite and ground data were reported using Pearson's correlation (R) and relative mean bias (RMB). Results showed that the DT3K C6.1 highest quality flag (QF = 3) AOD retrievals were well correlated with the sunphotometer AOD data, with an R of 0.82 and an RMB of 1.01. Overestimation and underestimation in DT AOD retrievals were observed for AOD > 1.1 and AOD < 1.1, respectively. A significant underestimation of 37% in DB10K AOD retrievals was observed across all the sites except ZZ, which was indicated by a low-value RMB (0.63). Spatial distribution maps showed high AOD values (>0.8) over the lower part of the YERB and low AOD values (<0.4) across the upstream part of the YERB. This might be due to a large number of aerosol emissions over the lower developed areas and a scarcity of aerosols over the upstream mountain areas. Overall, this study supports the use of DT10K C6.1 AOD retrievals over the western semi-arid and arid regions of the YERB and DTB10K AOD retrievals over the north-central water system and eastern plain regions of the YERB.

TI  - Impacts on watershed-scale runoff and sediment yield resulting from synergetic changes in climate and vegetation
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the relations between climate change and both runoff and sediment yield in watersheds and provides a scientific basis for water resources planning and design as well as watershed-scale soil and water conservation. The impact of climate change on runoff and sediment yield in a watershed does not occur in isolation, but is a synergistic process in which climate and vegetation jointly influence runoff and sediment yield. Previous studies have seldom addressed this synergistic effect. For this study, a regression model between climate factors (temperature and precipitation) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was established using data from the Zhenjiangguan Watershed in China. By combining data on climate-driven changes in vegetation cover, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was built to simulate runoff and sediment yield in the watershed under two scenarios: changes in climate, and synergistic changes in climate and vegetation cover. The simulation results show that precipitation is the most sensitive factor affecting runoff and sediment yield; 10% change in annual precipitation can cause 10%-14% change in annual runoff and 17%-24% change in annual sediment yield. Temperature is also an important factor affecting runoff and sediment yield in the watershed. Each temperature increase of 0.7 degrees C can result in a decrease of 1.4%-2% in annual runoff and 2%-3.7% in annual sediment yield. This research reveals that accounting for synergetic change in vegetation has an impact on runoff and sediment yield results, and that the magnitude and nature of this influence vary among different combinations of temperature and precipitation changes. When temperature was kept constant, the effect of vegetation cover change caused by precipitation change on runoff and sediment yield was relatively small (only 0.9%-1.5% of the total change), and vegetation cover change inhibited the effects of precipitation change on runoff and sediment yield. When precipitation was kept constant, the effects of vegetation cover change caused by temperature change on runoff and sediment yield were relatively large (20%-30% of the total change), and vegetation cover change enhanced the effects of temperature change on runoff and sediment yield. This investigation considers the synergistic effects of climate and vegetation cover change, and thus further clarifies the extent to which climate change impacts water and ecological resources.

TI  - Ground-level PM2.5 estimation over urban agglomerations in China with high spatiotemporal resolution based on Himawari-8
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High concentrations of particulate matter with diameter of <2.5 mu m (PM2.5) demonstrate severe effects on human health, especially in the metropolitan agglomerations of China. Estimating PM2.5 based on satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a widely used method. AOD data from Himawari-8, a geostationary satellite, enable improvement of the temporal resolution of PM2.5 estimates to the hourly level, thereby reflecting diurnal variations of pollutants compared with AOD products from polar orbit satellites, which only have one value per day. In this study, PM2.5 concentrations are estimated based on Himawari-8 AOD and other ancillary data by constructing spatiotemporal linear mixed effects model in Central China (CCH), Beijing-Tianjin-Henan (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) regions, respectively. The determination coefficient (R-2) between the measurements and estimates of PM2.5 calculated with the tenfold cross-validation method are 0.82, 0.84, 0.80 and 0.74 in CCH, BTH, YRD and PRD, respectively. The spatial distributions of PM2.5 present large regional variation, which is highly correlated with land-use type. Heavily polluted zones are mainly located in urban or rural areas, which have dense population and high anthropogenic emissions. Comparisons among different seasons show that particle pollution during the cold seasons (autumn and winter) is relatively severe with an average PM2.5 of >60 mu g/m(3) in CCH, BTH and YRD, whereas the level does not greatly change throughout the year in the PRD region. During the daytime, particulate pollution levels are generally high in the morning. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Exploring an efficient sandy barren index for rapid mapping of sandy barren land from Landsat TM/OLI images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sandification is a serious global environmental problem. The spatiotemporal dynamics of sandy barren land is an important indicator in monitoring its ecological restoration. Such monitoring requires fast and accurate identification of sandy barren land. Although several bare indexes have been developed for the mapping of barren land, these have not proven effective in the mapping of sandy barren land. In this paper, the partial normalized sandy barren index (PNSBI), a new barren index based on spectrum reflectance measurement and analysis, is proposed. The efficiency and enhanced accuracy of PNSBI at retrieving sandy barren land was validated using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of the Poyang Lake and Ordos regions of China. These results suggest that the proposed PNSBI achieved higher accuracy than the other bare indexes in retrieving sandy barren land from the other types of bare land. And it is benefit for the study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of sandification, water distribution, soil erosion, etc.

TI  - <i>l<sub>p</sub></i>-ICP Coastline Inflection Method for Geolocation Error Estimation in FY-3 MWRI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Known as input in the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) data have been widely distributed to the user community. With the development of remote sensing technology, improving the geolocation accuracy of MWRI data are required and the first step is to estimate the geolocation error accurately. However, the traditional method, such as the coastline inflection method (CIM), usually has the disadvantages of low accuracy and poor anti-noise ability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel lp iterative closest point coastline inflection method (lp-ICP CIM). It assumes that the field of views (FOVs) across the coastline can degenerate into a step function and employs an lp(0 <= p<1) sparse regularization optimization model to solve the coastline point. After estimating the coastline points, the ICP algorithm is employed to estimate the corresponding relationship between the estimated coastline points and the real coastline. Finally, the geolocation error can be defined as the distance between the estimated coastline point and the corresponding point on the true coastline. Experimental results on simulated and real data sets show the effectiveness of our method over CIM. The accuracy of the geolocation error estimated by lp-ICP CIM is up to 0.1 pixel, in more than 90% of cases. We also show that the distribution of brightness temperature near the coastline is more consistent with the real coastline and the average geolocation error is reduced by 63% after geolocation error correction.

TI  - Directional Analysis of Urban Expansion Based on Sub-pixel and Regional Scale: A Case Study of Main Districts in Guangzhou, China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-scale data have had a wide-ranging level of performance in the area of urban change monitoring. Herein we investigate the correlation between the impervious surface fraction (ISF) and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime stable light (NTL) data with respect to the urban expansion in the main districts of Guangzhou. Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 8 Operational Land Image (OLI) data from 1988 to 2015 were used to extract the ISF using the linear spectral mixture analysis model and normal difference build-up index at the sub-pixel scale. DMSP/OLS NTL data from 1992 to 2013 were calibrated to illustrate the urban nighttime light conditions at the regional scale. Urban expansion directions were identified by statistics and kernel density analysis for the ISF study area at the sub-pixel scale. In addition, the correlation between the ISF and DMSP/OLS NTL data were illustrated by linear regression analysis. Furthermore, Profile Graph in ArcGIS was employed to illustrate the urban expansion from the differences in correlation in different directions. The conclusions are as follows: 1) The impervious surface (IS) in the study area has expanded to the northeast and the east, starting with the old urban zones, and the high-density IS area has increased by 321.14 km(2). 2) The linear regression analysis reveals a positive correlation between the ISF and the DMSP/OLS NTL data. The multi-scale data changes are consistent with the actual urban planning of Guangzhou. 3) The DMSP/OLS NTL data overestimate the urban extent because of its saturation and blooming effects, causing its correlation with ISF to decrease. The pattern of urban expansion influences the saturation and blooming effects of the DMSP/OLS NTL data.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns of Terrestrial Evapotranspiration in Response to Climate and Vegetation Coverage Changes across the Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal patterns of evapotranspiration (ET) and its controlling factors are important for ecosystem services and water resources management in the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). In this study, we assessed the spatial patterns of ET and then investigated the interannual variability of ET and its relationships with climate variability and vegetation coverage changes at the timescales of annual, active growing season, as well as different seasons across the entire CLP from 2000 to 2014. A MODIS-derived ET dataset, ground-based datasets of precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand (AED), and a remote-sensing dataset of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were comprehensively analyzed. Results showed that mean annual ET varied distinctly among different vegetation zones, generally higher in the more humid southeastern parts of the CLP. Summer ET and ET over active growing season significantly increased for more than 40% of the entire CLP area, and winter ET significantly decreased over similar to 70% of the entire CLP region, while annual ET, spring ET, and autumn ET remained quite stable during 2000-2014. Per-pixel interannual variability of ET was mainly positively correlated with that of precipitation and NDVI except for winter, but negatively correlated with AED trends. Our study also demonstrated that ET variation trends were exactly consistent for the entire CLP region, the areas mainly implemented with the Grain for Green (GFG) project, and other CLP areas not implemented with the GFG project during 2000-2014. Our findings suggest that the spatiotemporal patterns of CLP ET were mainly water-limited, and climate variability played an essential role in shaping the interannual variability of ET in the CLP. This study will improve our understanding on the ET variations over water-limited areas under climate and vegetation coverage changes.

TI  - Spatial Variation of NO<sub>2</sub> and Its Impact Factors in China: An Application of Sentinel-5P Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important tropospheric trace gas and precursor of photochemical smog, the accumulation of NO2 will cause serious air pollution. China, as the largest developing country in the world, has experienced a large amount of NO2 emissions in recent decades due to the rapid economic growth. Compared with the traditional air pollution monitoring technology, the rapid development of the remote sensing monitoring method of atmospheric satellite has gradually become the critical technical means of global atmospheric environmental monitoring. To reveal the NO2 pollution situation in China, based on the latest NO2 products from Sentinel-5P TROPOMI, the spatial-temporal characteristics and impact factors of troposphere NO2 column concentration of mainland China in the past year (February 2018 to January 2019) were analyzed on two administrative levels for the first time. Results show that the monthly fluctuation of tropospheric NO2 column concentration has obvious characteristics of high in winter and low in summer, while the spatial distribution forms a high in East and low in west pattern, bounded by Hu Line. The comparison of Coefficient of Variation (CV) and spatial autocorrelation models at two kinds of administrative scales indicates that although the spatial heterogeneity of NO2 column concentration is less affected by the observed scale, there is a delayed effect of about one month in the process of NO2 column concentration fluctuation. Besides, the impact factors analysis based on Spatial Lag Model (SLM) and Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR) reveals that there is a positive correlation between nighttime light intensity, the secondary and tertiary industries proportion and NO2 column concentration. Furthermore, for regions with serious NO2 pollution in North China Plain, the whole society electricity consumption and vehicle ownership also play a positive role in increasing the NO2 column concentration. This study will enlighten the government and policy makers to formulate policies tailored to local conditions, to more effectively implement NO2 emission reduction and air pollution prevention.

TI  - Improvement of Clustering Methods for Modelling Abrupt Land Surface Changes in Satellite Image Fusions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A key challenge in developing models for the fusion of surface reflectance data across multiple satellite sensors is ensuring that they apply to both gradual vegetation phenological dynamics and abrupt land surface changes. To better model land cover spatial and temporal changes, we proposed previously a Prediction Smooth Reflectance Fusion Model (PSRFM) that combines a dynamic prediction model based on the linear spectral mixing model with a smoothing filter corresponding to the weighted average of forward and backward temporal predictions. One of the significant advantages of PSRFM is that PSRFM can model abrupt land surface changes either through optimized clusters or the residuals of the predicted gradual changes. In this paper, we expanded our approach and developed more efficient methods for clustering. We applied the new methods for dramatic land surface changes caused by a flood and a forest fire. Comparison of the model outputs showed that the new methods can capture the land surface changes more effectively. We also compared the improved PSRFM to two most popular reflectance fusion algorithms: Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and Enhanced version of STARFM (ESTARFM). The results showed that the improved PSRFM is more effective and outperforms STARFM and ESTARFM both visually and quantitatively.

TI  - Are There Sufficient Landsat Observations for Retrospective and Continuous Monitoring of Land Cover Changes in China?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unprecedented human-induced land cover changes happened in China after the Reform and Opening-up in 1978, matching with the era of Landsat satellite series. However, it is still unknown whether Landsat data can effectively support retrospective analysis of land cover changes in China over the past four decades. Here, for the first time, we conduct a systematic investigation on the availability of Landsat data in China, targeting its application for retrospective and continuous monitoring of land cover changes. The latter is significant to assess impact of land cover changes, and consequences of past land policy and management interventions. The total and valid observations (excluding clouds, cloud shadows, and terrain shadows) from Landsat 5/7/8 from 1984 to 2017 were quantified at pixel scale, based on the cloud computing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE). The results show higher intensity of Landsat observation in the northern part of China as compared to the southern part. The study provides an overall picture of Landsat observations suitable for satellite-based annual land cover monitoring over the entire country. We uncover that two sub-regions of China (i.e., Northeast China-Inner Mongolia-Northwest China, and North China Plain) have sufficient valid observations for retrospective analysis of land cover over 30 years (1987-2017) at an annual interval; whereas the Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain (MLYP) and Xinjiang (XJ) have sufficient observations for annual analyses for the periods 1989-2017 and 2004-2017, respectively. Retrospective analysis of land cover is possible only at a two-year time interval in South China (SC) for the years 1988-2017, Xinjiang (XJ) for the period 1992-2003, and the Tibetan Plateau (TP) during 2004-2017. For the latter geographic regions, land cover dynamics can be analyzed only at a three-year interval prior to 2004. Our retrospective analysis suggest that Landsat-based analysis of land cover dynamics at an annual interval for the whole country is not feasible; instead, national monitoring at two- or three-year intervals could be achievable. This study provides a preliminary assessment of data availability, targeting future continuous land cover monitoring in China; and the code is released to the public to facilitate similar data inventory in other regions of the world.

TI  - A Statistical Analysis of the Remotely Sensed Land Surface Temperature-Vegetation Index Method for the Retrieval of Evaporative Fraction Over Grasslands in the Southern Great Plains
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The triangle method based on the spatial relationship between remotely sensed (RS) land surface temperature and vegetation index (TVX) has been widely used for the estimation of evaporative fraction (EF). Combing moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and in situ EF observations, the physical constraint and theoretical accuracy of the TVX method is investigated in this paper through statistical analysis. In theory, the physical constraint of the TVX method is mathematically solvable by using EF measurements as inputs. However, our research suggests that nearly 90% of its solutions are meaningless to retrieve the spatial distribution of EF. Instead, we propose an optimization method to retrieve the spatial distribution of EF over a large heterogeneous area from a limited number of in situ EF observations. Results show that the new method using just one site for calibration has an accuracy comparable with those produced by the traditional TVX method. Its robustness is also demonstrated by its applicability under partially cloudy sky conditions. The accuracy of this optimization method increases with the number of sites used for calibration, but there is an upper limit. Besides, when all sites are used for calibration, the accuracy produced represents the upper limit of the accuracy of the TVX method. Thus, the proposed method also provides a perspective to evaluate the theoretical accuracy of RS-based EF models.

TI  - Increasing Outbreak of Cyanobacterial Blooms in Large Lakes and Reservoirs under Pressures from Climate Change and Anthropogenic Interferences in the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the increasing frequency and severity of cyanobacterial blooms in recreational lakes and water supply reservoirs have become a great concern to public health and a significant threat to the environment. Cyanobacterial bloom monitoring is the basis of early warning and treatment. Previous research efforts have always focused on monitoring blooms in a few specific lakes in China using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images, which are available for the years 2000 onward. However, the lack of overall information on long-term cyanobacterial blooms in the lakes and reservoirs in the middle-lower Yangtze River (MLYR) basin is an obstacle to better understanding the dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms at a watershed scale. In this study, we extracted the yearly coverage area and frequency of cyanobacterial blooms that occurred from 1990 to 2016 in 30 large lakes and 10 reservoirs (inundation area >50 km(2)) by using time series Landsat satellite images from Google Earth Engine (GEE). Then, we calculated the cyanobacterial bloom area percentage (CAP) and the cyanobacterial bloom frequency index (CFI) and analyzed their inter-annual variation and trends. We also investigated the main driving forces of changes in the CAP and CFI in each lake and reservoir. We found that all reservoirs and more than 60% of lakes exhibited an increasing frequency and coverage area of cyanobacterial blooms under the pressures of climate change and anthropogenic interferences. Reservoirs were more prone to be affected by fertilizer consumption from their regional surroundings than lakes. High temperatures increased blooms of cyanobacteria, while precipitation in the lake and reservoir regions somewhat alleviated blooms. This study completes the data records of cyanobacterial blooms in large lakes and reservoirs located in hotspots of the MLYR basin and provides more baseline information before 2000, which will present references for water resource management and freshwater conservation.

TI  - Assessment of meteorological and agricultural droughts using in-situ observations and remote sensing data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Most research on drought assessment adopted historical in-situ observations, however, there has been increased data availability from remote sensing during the recent years. This study utilizes the two sources of data in drought assessment. Using the historical in-situ observations, the spatiotemporal variations of meteorological drought were firstly investigated by calculating the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPED at 1, 3, 6-month time scales in Northeast China. Using remote sensing data, the combined deficit index (CDI) for agricultural drought assessment was computed based on trimonthly sum of deficit in antecedent rainfall and deficit in monthly NDVI at land cover type and sub-type levels in the same region. In the end, the agricultural drought calculated by the CDI was evaluated against the deficit in crop yield, as well as deficit in Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Evapotranspiration (ET), in order to verify the applicability of the CDI for agricultural drought assessment in the study region. The results showed that the CDI has better correlations with the SPEI (R-2 = 0.48) than the SPI (R-2 = 0.05) at 3-month scales with weight factor a = 0.5 in dry farming areas. The spatial pattern of the CDI showed that the area of agricultural drought increased from July to October. In addition, a significant linear correlation was found between the CDI and anomaly in annual agricultural yield (R-2 = 0.55), and anomaly in monthly land surface temperature (R-2 = 0.42). The results prove that the CDI calculated by remote sensing data is not only a reliable indicator for agricultural drought assessment in Northeast China, but also provides useful information for agricultural drought disaster prevention and mitigation, and water management improvement.

TI  - Terrestrial gross primary production: Using NIR<sub>V</sub> to scale from site to globe
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial photosynthesis is the largest and one of the most uncertain fluxes in the global carbon cycle. We find that near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV), a remotely sensed measure of canopy structure, accurately predicts photosynthesis at FLUXNET validation sites at monthly to annual timescales (R-2 = 0.68), without the need for difficult to acquire information about environmental factors that constrain photosynthesis at short timescales. Scaling the relationship between gross primary production (GPP) and NIRV from FLUXNET eddy covariance sites, we estimate global annual terrestrial photosynthesis to be 147 Pg C/year (95% credible interval 131-163 Pg C/year), which falls between bottom-up GPP estimates and the top-down global constraint on GPP from oxygen isotopes. NIRV-derived estimates of GPP are systematically higher than existing bottom-up estimates, especially throughout the midlatitudes. Progress in improving estimated GPP from NIRV can come from improved cloud screening in satellite data and increased resolution of vegetation characteristics, especially details about plant photosynthetic pathway.

TI  - Videographic analysis of flight behaviours of host-seeking <i>Anopheles arabiensis</i> towards BG-Malaria trap
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The BG-Malaria trap (BGM) is an adaptation of the well-known BG-Sentinel trap (BGS) with greater trapping efficiencies for anopheline and culicine mosquitoes. Its continued optimization requires greater understanding of mosquito flight behaviors near it. We used three high-resolution infrared cameras (68 frames/second) to track flight behaviors of laboratory-reared Anopheles arabiensis females in vicinity of the BGM in comparison with BGS. Additional comparisons were done for BGM at 20, 40 and 80cm heights, and for BGMs baited with Ifakara blend plus CO2, CO2 alone, or no bait. More mosquitoes were observed near BGM than BGS. Both BGMs installed 20cm above the floor and baited with CO2 received more visits by host-seeking mosquitoes than the other BGMs evaluated in their respective experiments. Trap designs, height and attractants all influence mosquito activity in vicinity of the traps which can be readily visualized using infrared cameras to accelerate trap development and testing. The greater activity of host-seeking mosquitoes near BGM than BGS supports the proven superiority of BGM traps in field and semi-field settings.

TI  - Between the tides: Modelling the elevation of Australia's exposed intertidal zone at continental scale
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The intertidal zone represents a critical transition between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, supporting a complex mosaic of highly productive and biologically diverse habitats. However, our understanding of these important coastal environments is limited by a lack of spatially consistent topographic data, which can be extremely challenging and costly to obtain at continental-scale. Satellite remote sensing represents an important resource for monitoring extensive coastal zones. Previous approaches to modelling the elevation of the intertidal zone using earth observation (EO) data have been restricted to small study regions or have relied on manual image interpretation, thus limiting their ability to be applied consistently over large geographic extents. In this study, we present an automated open-source approach to generate satellite-derived elevation data for over 15,387 km(2) of intertidal terrain across the entire Australian coastline. Our approach combines global tidal modelling with a 30-year time series archive of spatially and spectrally calibrated Landsat satellite data managed within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) platform. The resulting National Intertidal Digital Elevation Model (NIDEM) dataset provides an unprecedented three-dimensional representation of Australia's vast exposed intertidal zone at 25 m spatial resolution. We validate our model against LiDAR, RTK GPS and multibeam bathymetry datasets, finding that modelled elevations are highly accurate across sandy beach ( +/- 0.41 m RMSE) and tidal flat environments ( +/- 0.39 m RMSE). Model performance was least accurate ( +/- 2.98 m RMSE) within rocky shores and reefs and other complex coastal environments with extreme and variable tidal regimes. We discuss key challenges associated with modelling intertidal elevation including tidal model performance and biased observations from sun-synchronous satellites, and suggest future directions to improve the accuracy and utility of continental-scale intertidal elevation modelling. Our model can be applied to tidally-influenced coastal environments globally, addressing a key gap between the availability of sub-tidal bathymetry and terrestrial elevation data.

TI  - One Health in Action: Operational Aspects of an Integrated Surveillance System for Zoonoses in Western Kenya
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surveillance of diseases in Kenya and elsewhere in East Africa is currently carried out by both human and animal health sectors. However, a recent evaluation highlighted the lack of integration between these sectors, leading to disease under-reporting and inefficiencies. This project aimed to develop an integrated and cost-effective surveillance and reporting system for 15 zoonotic diseases piloted in the counties of Bungoma, Busia, and Kakamega in western Kenya. Specifically, in this paper we describe the operational aspects of such a surveillance system. Interviews were carried out with key informants, and this was followed by field visits to identify sentinel sites and liaise with relevant stakeholders. Based on this information, a sampling strategy comprising 12 sentinel sites, 4 in each county, was developed. Each sentinel site comprised of a livestock market, 1-2 neighboring slaughter houses/slabs, and a hospital in the vicinity; each of the 12 sites, comprising 12 x 3 = 36 sampling locations, was visited every 4 weeks for 20 cycles. At each site, animal or patient sampling included a clinical examination and collection of blood, feces, and nasal swabs; in slaughtered animals, mesenteric lymph nodes, hydatid cysts, and flukes were also collected. At the end of each field visit, data on staff involved and challenges encountered were recorded, while biological samples were processed and tested for 15 zoonotic diseases in the field laboratory in Busia, Kenya. Public engagement sessions were held at each sentinel site to share preliminary results and provide feedback to both stakeholders and study participants. A livestock market visit lasted just over 3 h, and the most common challenge was the frequent refusals of animal owners to participate in the study. At the slaughterhouses, visits lasted just under 4 h, and challenges included poorly engaged meat inspectors or slaughter processes that were too quick for sampling. Finally, the hospital visits lasted around 4 h, and the most frequent challenges included low patients turn-out, frequent staff turn-over leading to poor institutional memory, and difficulty in obtaining patient stool samples. Our experiences have highlighted the importance of engaging with local stakeholders in the field, while also providing timely feedback through public engagement sessions, to ensure on-going compliance.

TI  - Precise direct tracking and remote sensing reveal the use of forest islands as roost sites by Purple Martins during migration
T2  - JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct tracking methods in combination with remote sensing data allow examination of habitat use by birds during migration. Species that roost communally during migration, such as some swallows, form large aggregations that can attract both avian and terrestrial predators. However, the extent to which they might use patchy habitats that could reduce predation risk during migration is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that Purple Martins (Progne subis) use forest islands (patches of suitable forest habitat surrounded by unsuitable habitat) as roost sites during migration between breeding sites in North America and overwintering sites in South America. We used high-precision (< 10 m), archival GPS units deployed and retrieved during the 2015 and 2016 breeding seasons, respectively, at 12 colonies located across eastern North America. We found that Purple Martins roosted in forest islands more often than expected based on availability during both spring and fall migration. Despite an apparent association with urban habitats by Purple Martins based on observational and radar data in North America during the fall, the roost locations we identified during spring and fall migration were not more closely associated with urban areas than random locations. The use of forest islands during both spring and fall migration suggest that Purple Martins may use these habitats to reduce predation risk during migration. Our results suggest that some species of birds may use similar habitats as stopover sites during migration and that patches of forest habitat may be important conservation targets for Purple Martins and other species. Identifying habitat use during migration represents an important advance in support of full annual-cycle conservation of Purple Martins and other migratory species with declining populations.

TI  - Restorative Utopias: The Settlers and the Bible
T2  - MODERN THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The attitude to the Bible is a seismograph for scrutinizing the attitude of Zionism, in general, and that of the settlers, in particular, to their ideological and political worldview. To where in the Bible are the settlers returning? To the Land of Canaan, to the land of the Patriarchs, or perhaps to the Kingdom of David? And what is the meaning of this return? It is not only the land that is basic to this question, but the relationship of the Land of Israel to the people of Israel. In this article, we will mainly address the radical theological facets of the settler movement, not the proponents of Greater Israel. Our article will focus on the replication of settler theology from the first stage of Gush Emunim (The Bloc of the Faithful) and the act of settlement, which in the opinion of the settlers is in accord with the continuation and completion of the Zionist project, to a more metaphysical phase, in which the centrality of the act of settlement gives way to Hassidic or kabbalistic thinking. The models which we present make possible a fresh look at the utopian thinking and radical theology that are nourished by the settler movement and reflect a new, non-homogeneous stage.

TI  - Applying sentinel event reviews to policing
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY & PUBLIC POLICY
M3  - Review
AB  - Research Summary A sentinel event review (SER) is a system-based, multistakeholder review of an organizational error. The goal of an SER is to prevent similar errors from recurring in the future rather than identifying and punishing the responsible parties. In this article, we provide a detailed description of one of the first SERs conducted in an American police department-the review of the Lex Street Massacre investigation and prosecution, which resulted in the wrongful incarceration of four innocent men for 18 months. The results of the review suggest that SERs may help identify new systemic reforms for participating police departments and other criminal justice agencies. Policy Implications Police departments and other criminal justice agencies should begin implementing SERs to review a wide range of organizational errors and "near misses." We offer guiding principles about the kinds of errors that may be more or less susceptible to fruitful review. Congress, state legislatures, and municipalities should also enact policies-such as safe harbor provisions-to encourage agencies to conduct SERs.

TI  - Mitochondrial and ribosomal biogenesis are new hallmarks of stemness, oncometabolism and biomass accumulation in cancer: Mito-stemness and ribo-stemness features
T2  - AGING-US
M3  - Article
AB  - Using proteomics analysis, we previously compared MCF7 breast cancer cells grown as 3D tumor spheres, with the same cell line grown as monolayers. Our results indicated that during 3D anchorage-independent growth, the cellular machinery associated with i) mitochondrial biogenesis and ii) ribosomal biogenesis, were both significantly increased. Here, for simplicity, we refer to these two new oncogenic hallmarks as "mito-stemness" and "ribo-stemness" features. We have now applied this same type of strategy to begin to understand how fibroblasts and MCF7 breast cancer cells change their molecular phenotype, when they are co-cultured together. We have previously shown that MCF7-fibroblast co-cultures are a valuable model of resistance to apoptosis induced by hormonal therapies, such as Tamoxifen and Fulvestrant. Here, we directly show that these mixed co-cultures demonstrate the induction of mito-stemness and ribo-stemness features, likely reflecting a mechanism for cancer cells to increase their capacity for accumulating biomass. In accordance with the onset of a stem-like phenotype, KRT19 (keratin 19) was induced by (similar to)6-fold during co-culture. KRT19 is a well-established epithelial CSC marker that is used clinically to identify metastatic breast cancer cells in sentinel lymph node biopsies. The potential molecular therapeutic targets that we identified by label-free proteomics of MCF7-fibroblast co-cultures were then independently validated using a bioinformatics approach. More specifically, we employed publically-available transcriptional profiling data derived from primary tumor samples from breast cancer patients, which were previously subjected to laser-capture micro-dissection, to physically separate breast cancer cells from adjacent tumor stroma. This allowed us to directly validate that the proteins up-regulated in this co-culture model were also transcriptionally elevated in patient-derived breast cancer cells in vivo. This powerful approach for target identification and translational validation, including the use of patient outcome data, can now be applied to other tumor types as well, to validate new therapeutic targets that are more clinically relevant, for patient benefit. Moreover, we discuss the therapeutic implications of these findings for new drug development, drug repurposing and Tamoxifen-resistance, to effectively target mito-stemness and ribo-stemness features in breast cancer patients. We also discuss the broad implications of this "organelle biogenesis" approach to cancer therapy.

TI  - Constraining Southern Ocean Air-Sea-Ice Fluxes Through Enhanced Observations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Air-sea and air-sea-ice fluxes in the Southern Ocean play a critical role in global climate through their impact on the overturning circulation and oceanic heat and carbon uptake. The challenging conditions in the Southern Ocean have led to sparse spatial and temporal coverage of observations. This has led to a "knowledge gap" that increases uncertainty in atmosphere and ocean dynamics and boundary-layer thermodynamic processes, impeding improvements in weather and climate models. Improvements will require both process-based research to understand the mechanisms governing air-sea exchange and a significant expansion of the observing system. This will improve flux parameterizations and reduce uncertainty associated with bulk formulae and satellite observations. Improved estimates spanning the full Southern Ocean will need to take advantage of ships, surface moorings, and the growing capabilities of autonomous platforms with robust and miniaturized sensors. A key challenge is to identify observing system sampling requirements. This requires models, Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs), and assessments of the specific spatial-temporal accuracy and resolution required for priority science and assessment of observational uncertainties of the mean state and direct flux measurements. Year-round, high-quality, quasi-continuous in situ flux measurements and observations of extreme events are needed to validate, improve and characterize uncertainties in blended reanalysis products and satellite data as well as to improve parameterizations. Building a robust observing system will require community consensus on observational methodologies, observational priorities, and effective strategies for data management and discovery.

TI  - A labelled ocean SAR imagery dataset of ten geophysical phenomena from Sentinel-1 wave mode
T2  - GEOSCIENCE DATA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The Sentinel-1 mission is part of the European Copernicus program aiming at providing observations for Land, Marine and Atmosphere Monitoring, Emergency Management, Security and Climate Change. It is a constellation of two (Sentinel-1 A and B) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites. The SAR wave mode (WV) routinely collects high-resolution SAR images of the ocean surface during day and night and through clouds. In this study, a subset of more than 37,000 SAR images is labelled corresponding to ten geophysical phenomena, including both oceanic and meteorologic features. These images cover the entire open ocean and are manually selected from Sentinel-1A WV acquisitions in 2016. For each image, only one prevalent geophysical phenomenon with its prescribed signature and texture is selected for labelling. The SAR images are processed into a quick-look image provided in the formats of PNG and GeoTIFF as well as the associated labels. They are convenient for both visual inspection and machine learning-based methods exploitation. The proposed dataset is the first one involving different oceanic or atmospheric phenomena over the open ocean. It seeks to foster the development of strategies or approaches for massive ocean SAR image analysis. A key objective was to allow exploiting the full potential of Sentinel-1 WV SAR acquisitions, which are about 60,000 images per satellite per month and freely available. Such a dataset may be of value to a wide range of users and communities in deep learning, remote sensing, oceanography and meteorology.

TI  - Integrating remote sensing and diver observations to predict the distribution of invasive lionfish on Bahamian coral reefs
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing invasion of coral reefs in the greater Caribbean region by Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois spp.) poses challenges for managers. Although the dynamics and ecological effects of lionfish invasions have been examined in detail at the scale of individual reefs, relatively little information is available on the patterns of the invasion over larger areas. This study combined species counts and microhabitat observations from SCUBA surveys with satellite-derived bathymetry and habitat data to create predictive species distribution maps of lionfish in a 58 km(2) region along the southern edge of the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. Models predicted lionfish presence, absence, and density, and were created iteratively using various resolutions and types of data to mimic the datasets that may be available to management in the region. The best-fit model for presence and absence, which combined physical variables derived from remotely sensed satellite data and diver-collected microhabitat data, predicted 89% of lionfish presence and absence. The best-fit model for lionfish density used 2 resolutions of physical habitat data as well as biological data on densities of large native groupers and accurately predicted 67% lionfish density. These results suggest that physical habitat may be more important for initial lionfish presence and that biotic interactions influence lionfish density on the reefs. Understanding the limitations and value of each type of data when creating models may be advantageous for planning targeted lionfish removals and prioritizing sites for conservation efforts.

TI  - Effect of fusing Sentinel-2 and WorldView-4 imagery on the various vegetation indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite image fusion techniques have been used for more than two decades. Development of satellite sensors for very high-resolution satellite imagery monitoring contributed to the development of new image fusion techniques. We examine the quality of Ehlers, Brovey transform, modified intensity-hue-saturation (M-IHS), and high-filter resolution merge fusion methods on vegetation indices values combining high-resolution WorldView-4 and low-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. For image fusion, four bands-blue, green, red, and nearinfrared-were used. The effect of fusing Sentinel-2 and WorldView-4 imagery is tested on the various vegetation indices [normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), blue normalized difference vegetation index (BNDVI), and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI)]. M-IHS fusion showed the best result, with the least difference between indices calculated based on the original Sentinel-2 and fused bands. Difference between vegetation indices calculated using original Sentinel-2 and M-IHS fused bands for 30.08.2015, 30.09.2016, and 30.09.2017 is between -0.041 to 0.037. The second part of this research is an evaluation of three different vegetation classes (grassland, mixed vegetation, and forest) on three different years and three different months within a year. Difference between NDVI, GNDVI, and BNDVI calculated based on the original Sentinel-2, and M-IHS fused bands are ranging from -0.043 to 0.103, -0.041 to 0.050, and -0.052 to 0.030 for grassland, mixed vegetation, and forest, respectively. On the other hand, the difference between vegetation indices for grassland, mixed vegetation, and forest are from -0.110 to 0.050, -0.041 to 0.038, and -0.052 to 0.038, when observing August, September, and October of 2017, respectively.

TI  - Profiling of local disease-sparing responses to bovine respiratory syncytial virus in intranasally vaccinated and challenged calves
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bovine and human respiratory syncytial viruses (BRSV, HRSV) are primary causes of pneumonia in calves and children respectively, with vaccination offering protection via antibody and cellular immune responses. However, with no vaccines currently licensed for human use, evaluation of local responses to BRSV vaccination may provide insights to aid the design of effective safe HRSV vaccines. Calves received intranasal single component BRSV vaccine or "3-Way" vaccine (BRSV, Bovine Herpes Virus-1 (BHV-1), Bovine Parainfluenza Virus Type-3 (BPIV-3)), and were BRSV-challenged 42 days post-vaccination. All vaccinates exhibited reduced pulmonary lesioning with elevated anti-BRSV serum IgG, and higher nasal anti-BRSV IgA in 3-Way vaccinates. Thirty-nine proteins associated with homeostatic and immune processes were altered in vaccinates, with enhanced 3-Way vaccinate group proteins associated with Th1/Th2 balance and immunoglobulin class switching. Proteins altered in the pharyngeal tonsil of animals euthanized early related to anti-inflammatory responses and lymphoid tissue remodeling. These findings indicate that multivalent vaccines distinctly modulate local immune responses, with clear correlation between the pharyngeal tonsil proteome profile and resulting immune protection and disease-sparing. This suggests that the efficacy of low-antigenic subunit vaccine components for problematic pathogens such as HRSV could be enhanced by use in combination with existing safe live vaccines.Significance: This study demonstrates that vaccine valency can alter post-challenge proteome responses within the pharyngeal tonsil, a sentinel site of primary immune responses, with the magnitude of response dependent on antigen formulation. Observed differential responses can be attributed to antigenic material and viral nucleic acid from multivalent formulations providing additional T-cell epitopes and PAMPS. These findings indicate that incorporation of subunits proteins within multivalent formulations containing live virus has the potential to induce/skew a favorable immune response, utilising the natural adjuvanting effects of safe proven live vaccines.

TI  - Monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen by the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Information concerning land-use change is imperative for improving conservation policies that promote sustainable land development. However, to date, most of the previous studies have largely focused on the use of coarse- or moderate-resolution data, with which it may not be possible to identify the land-use classes in urban environments. Due to the improved spatial details, high-resolution (HR) remote sensing imagery provides us with an opportunity for the semantic interpretation of urban landscapes. Therefore, in this study, we took the City of Shenzhen (1997 km(2)) in China as an example to assess the detailed land-use change and its effect on ecosystem services (ESs), based on HR satellite data from 2005 to 2017. In particular, deep learning was used to obtain accurate land-use maps, because this technique is able to model the hierarchical representations of features and can thus effectively characterize urban scenes. The results revealed the following findings: (a) The overall accuracy of the proposed approach was 96.9% and 97.1% for 2005 and 2017, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art semantic classification models; (b) residential and commercial areas in Shenzhen increased dramatically over the study period by 10,416 and 9,168 ha, at the expense of ecological land; (c) supply capacity of the ecosystem decreased by 13.7%, but demand for ESs showed an increase of 23.5%. By courtesy of HR images, detailed land-use changes and the associated ESs can be monitored, which facilitates the in-depth understanding of urban environmental systems.

TI  - Worse survival in breast cancer in elderly may not be due to underutilization of medical procedures as observed upon changing healthcare system in Poland
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundEvidence is emerging that older women may tolerate breast cancer therapies equally well as the young ones, providing that they receive good supportive care. It has also been reported that these patients remain outside the current therapeutic standards. The aim of this observational study was to assess the access of breast cancer patients to medical procedures.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed a database of breast cancer patients registered in the National Cancer Registry in Poland, searching for the numbers of new cases and deaths in the years 2010-2015. We obtained the numbers and costs of key medical procedures provided for these patients from the National Health Fund in Poland. Breast cancer survival in the years 2010-2015 was estimated based on the mortality/incidence ratio. The t-Student test and Spearman correlation coefficient were used for the analysis of data obtained from both databases.ResultsThere was no increase in survival throughout the years 2010-2015 in both analysed subpopulations of all breast cancer patients below and over 65years of age, despite an unprecedented rise in healthcare funding in Poland. We noted 37% lower probability of 5-year survival in patients older than 65years. The average number of outpatient visits and surgical procedures per person per year were slightly, yet significantly (p<0.01), higher in younger vs. older patients (3.9 vs. 3.4 and 1.18 vs. 1.02, respectively). Outpatient chemotherapy was more common in older patients (6.0 vs. 5.25cycles a year per person on average, p<0.01). There were no significant differences in the average numbers of hospitalisations for chemotherapy, frequencies of radiotherapy and in the use of targeted therapy programmes (calculated per person per year), between younger and older patients.ConclusionsOlder women with breast cancer are treated similarly to younger patients, but have significantly worse chances to survive breast cancer in Poland. A simple increase in healthcare financing will not improve the survival in the elderly with breast cancer without developing funded individualised care and survivorship programmes.

TI  - Reconstruction of the Little Ice Age glaciers and equilibrium line altitudes in the Kodar Range, southeast Siberia
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Little Ice Age (LIA), a time of global cooling widely manifested in the 14th-19th centuries, was characterized by worldwide expansion of mountain glaciers. Unfortunately, little is known about the LIA glacier changes in remote areas of continental Siberia. In this work we studied the evolution of the glaciers of the Kodar Range, southeast Siberia. These glaciers are mainly of small size (< 0.5 km(2)), cirque and cirque-valley, with predominant northern and north-eastern aspects, located at elevations of 1900-2800 m a.s.l. Using field and satellite imagery data over the 2001-2013 period (Landsat ETM + , Cartosat-1, WorldView-2) we mapped the glaciers, equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) and the LIA moraines. Modern ELAs vary from 1945 to 2615 m a.s.l. (mean value is 2286 +/- 162 m) and demonstrate NNW to SSE increasing regional trend (from 2060 to 2430 m a.s.l.) with local ELA variability due to orography of +/- 114 m. The extents of the LIA glaciers were reconstructed from terminal moraines, located in front of the glacier termini. These moraines are of fresh morphology, nonvegetated, and locally dated by lichenometry at the mid-18th century. Since the LIA the total glacier area decreased from 19 km(2 )to 9 km(2) (by 53%) and glacier termini retreated, on average, by 440 m. South and southwest facing glaciers shrunk 1.5-2 times stronger than those with northern and north-eastern aspects. Using the toe-to-headwall altitude ratio (THAR) and toe-to-summit altitude method (TSAM), the LIA ELAs were calculated. The LIA ELAs lowered, on average, by 40-60 m, while the ELA changes on south and south-west facing glaciers (mean value of 80-100 m) was 2-2.5 times greater than of the northern. ELA depression during the LIA corresponded to decrease in mean summer temperature of 0.9-1.1 degrees C (if precipitation was equal to the present). Temperature increase was mainly responsible for ELA rising since the LIA, however, the response of small glaciers could be modulated by other factors (e.g. local insolation or precipitation). Stronger reduction of the south and south-west facing Kodar glaciers can be explained by their greater sensitivity to both solar radiation and snow nourishment with southern cyclones and East Asian monsoon.

TI  - Perinodal fibrosis developed after ultrasonography-guided core-needle biopsy of a contrast-enhanced ultrasound-detected sentinel axillary node interferes with subsequent surgical sentinel node dissection
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ULTRASOUND
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate perinodal fibrosis after 14-gauge staging core-needle biopsy (CNB) of the axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) identified using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) and its interference with subsequent surgical SLN dissection in breast cancer patients. Methods Frequencies or means of main clinical, sonographic, pathological, and surgical characteristics were calculated. We also compared patient groups with and without perinodal pathological fibrosis. Results Forty-eight patients who underwent CEUS + CNB and axillary surgery were eligible for this cross-sectional study. Axillary surgical specimens showed perinodal fibrosis in 9/48 (18.7%) patients. Interference with SLN dissection was reported in 4/48 (8.3%) patients (two hematomas, three abnormal palpation findings, and four difficult dissections). The overall surgical detection rate of SLN was 43/48 (89.6%). In the majority of cases, perinodal fibrosis was described as moderate (4/9 [44.4%]) or severe (4/9 [44.4%]). The mean time elapsed between CEUS + CNB and axillary dissection was shorter in patients with perinodal fibrosis (P = .04). Interference with SLN dissection was only reported in patients with perinodal fibrosis (P < .001). Surgical SLN detection was successful in all nine cases in which perinodal pathological fibrosis or interference with SLN dissection was reported. Conclusion Perinodal fibrosis may impair the surgical SLN dissection in early stage breast cancer patients who were staged using CEUS + CNB using a14-gauge needle.

TI  - No association between smoking and sentinel lymph node metastasis and survival in cutaneous melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There is little evidence that smoking is associated with metastasis in patients with cutaneous melanoma. Objective Using a propensity score matching analysis, we assessed whether smoking was associated with a higher rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis and worse survival in these patients. Methods Retrospective cohort study at a referral hospital for melanoma. We studied 762 patients with known smoking status from the melanoma database of the Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia who underwent SLN biopsy between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2016. The patients were matched by smoking status. The matching procedure was implemented using three logistic regression models featuring never vs. former smokers, never vs. current smokers and former vs. current smokers. The study outcomes were disease-free survival (DFS), melanoma-specific survival (MSS), overall survival (OS) and SLN status. Results The following groups were formed based on the propensity matching scores: 114 pairs of smokers vs. never smokers, 113 pairs of smokers vs. former smokers and 174 pairs of never smokers vs. former smokers. Smoking status was not associated with SLN metastasis or with DFS, MSS or OS in any of the three groups. Conclusion Smoking does not influence SLN metastasis or survival in patients with cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - Enhancing attraction of the vector mosquito Aedes albopictus by using a novel synthetic odorant blend
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, an increasingly relevant arboviral vector, has spread worldwide. However, currently available tools are limited in terms of effective monitoring of vector populations and accurate determination of the extent of viral transmission, especially before and during outbreaks. Therefore, it is essential to develop novel monitoring and surveillance tools, particularly those that target adult mosquitoes and enhance the trapping efficiency for Ae. albopictus.MethodsA variety of human body odorants associated with different types of mosquito olfactory receptors were selected, and their attractiveness to Ae. albopictus was tested by a four-arm olfactometer. The optimal compatibility and proportion of the odorants, Mix-5, was observed via orthogonal design analyses. The attractiveness of Mix-5 to Ae. albopictus in the laboratory was assessed using Mosq-ovitraps and Electric Mosquito Killers. In the field, the effectiveness of generic BG-Lure, Mix-5 and a control treatment was compared with a baited Biogents Sentinel trap (BGS-trap) using a Latin square design.ResultsIn the olfactometer experiments, the attractiveness of the selected candidate compounds at varying dilutions was poor when the individual compounds were used alone. The optimal combination, Mix-5, was generated based on orthogonal design analyses. In the laboratory, the average numbers of female Ae. albopictus mosquitoes attracted by the synthetic odorant blend Mix-5 were 27.00 and 27.50, compared with 12.00 and 14.83 for the control, when using Mosq-ovitraps and Electric Mosquito Killers, respectively. In the field, the average number of Ae. albopictus female mosquitoes trapped by Mix-5 was 9.67 females/trap, whereas the average numbers for BG-Lure and the control were 7.78 and 4.47, respectively. The lure also played an important role in attracting Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, and the average numbers of Cx. quinquefasciatus female mosquitoes attracted by Mix-5, BG-Lure and the control were 18.78, 25.11 and 12.22, respectively.ConclusionsA human odor-based bait blend was developed and exhibited enhanced effectiveness at attracting Ae. albopictus This blend can be used to monitor and trap dengue vector mosquitoes in Chinese cities.

TI  - Quantifying the impact of trees on land surface temperature: a downscaling algorithm at city-scale
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate of a city influences the ways in which its outdoor spaces are used. Especially, public spaces intended for use by pedestrians and cyclists, such as parks, squares, residential and commercial streets, and foot and cycle paths will be used and enjoyed more frequently if they have a comfortable and healthy climate. Due to the predicted global temperature increase, urban climate is likely to become more uncomfortable, especially in summer when an increase in heat stress is expected. Urban forestry has been proposed as one approach for mitigating the human health consequences of increased temperature resulting from climate change. The aims of the current research were to (a) provide a transferable methodology useful for analyzing the effect of urban trees on surface temperature reduction, particularly in public spaces, and (b) provide high-resolution urban mapping for adaptation strategies to climate change based on green space projects. To achieve the established aims, we developed a methodology that uses multisource data: LiDAR data, high-resolution Landsat imagery, global climate model data from CMIP5 (IPPC Fifth Assessment), and data from meteorological stations. The proposed model can be a useful tool for validating the efficiency of design simulations of new green spaces for temperature mitigation.

TI  - Anopheles parensis contributes to residual malaria transmission in South Africa
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundUnderstanding the contribution of outdoor-resting Anopheles mosquitoes to residual malaria transmission is important in terms of scaling up vector control towards malaria elimination in South Africa. The aim of this project was to assess the potential role of Anopheles parensis and other Anopheles species in residual malaria transmission, using sentinel surveillance sites in the uMkhanyakude District of northern KwaZulu-Natal Province.MethodsMonthly vector surveillance was conducted at the sentinel sites from January 2017 to May 2018. Outdoor-placed clay pot resting traps were used to collect male and female adult Anopheles mosquitoes. All Anopheles gambiae complex and Anopheles funestus group specimens collected were identified to species and all females were screened for Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples showing infectivity for P. falciparum were further verified by a nested PCR and subsequent DNA sequence analysis.ResultsFrom a sample of 491 anophelines, Anopheles arabiensis (n=228) and An. parensis (n=194) were the most abundant. Other species collected included Anopheles merus (n=11), Anopheles quadriannulatus (n=10), Anopheles leesoni (n=29), Anopheles rivulorum (n=18), and Anopheles vaneedeni (n=1). Of the 317 female specimens screened for P. falciparum CSP, one Anopheles arabiensis and one An. parensis showed positive by ELISA and Plasmodium nested PCR. For the An. parensis specimen, confirmation of its species identity was based on sequence analysis of the ITS2 region, and the presence of P. falciparum DNA was further confirmed by sequence analysis.ConclusionsAnopheles parensis is a potential vector of malaria in South Africa although its contribution to transmission is likely to be minimal at best owing to its strong zoophilic tendency. By contrast, An. arabiensis is a major vector that is primarily responsible for the bulk of residual malaria transmission in South Africa. As all recently collected sporozoite-positive Anopheles mosquitoes were found in outdoor-placed resting traps, it is necessary to introduce interventions that can be used to control outdoor-resting vector populations while maintaining the efficacy of South Africa's indoor house spraying operations.

TI  - The Basics of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy: Anatomical and Pathophysiological Considerations and Clinical Aspects
T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first node to receive the drainage directly from a tumor. Detection and pathological examination of the SLN is an important oncological procedure that minimizes morbidity related to extensive nodal dissection. SLN biopsy was first reported in 1960 but took approximately 40 years to come into general practice following reports of good outcomes in patients with melanoma. After many years of observation and research on its use in various malignancies SLN biopsy has become the standard surgical treatment in patients with malignant melanoma, breast, vulvar, and cervical cancers. Along with the introduction of new technologies, such as the fluorescent dyes indocyanine green (ICG) and near-infrared fluorescence (NIR), and pathologic ultrastaging, SLN detection rate has increased and false-negative rate has decreased. This literature review aimed to present an overview of the basic concepts and clinical aspects of SLN biopsy in the light of the current research.

TI  - Achieving quality primary care data: a description of the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network data capture, extraction, and processing in Alberta.
T2  - International journal of population data science
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Electronic medical record (EMR) databases have become increasingly popular for secondary purposes, such as health research. The Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) is the first and only pan-Canadian primary care EMR data repository, with de-identified health information for almost two million Canadians. Comprehensive and freely available documentation describing the data 'lifecycle' is important for assessing potential data quality issues and appropriate interpretation of research findings. Here, we describe the flow and transformation of CPCSSN data in the province of Alberta.APPROACH: In Alberta, the data originate from 54 publicly-funded primary care settings, including one community pediatric clinic, with 318 providers contributing de-identified EMR data for 410,951 patients (as of December 2018). Data extraction methods have been developed for five different EMR systems, and include both backend and automated frontend extractions. The raw EMR data are transformed according to specific rules, including trimming implausible values, converting values and free text to standard terminologies or classification systems, and structuring the data into a common CPCSSN format. Following local data extraction and processing, the data are transferred to a central repository and made available for research and disease surveillance.CONCLUSION: This paper aims to provide important contextual information to future CPCSSN data users.

TI  - Multispectral remote sensing for post-dictive analysis of archaeological remains. A case study from Bronte (Sicily)
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the use of remote sensing in archeology has rapidly grown, having being proven particularly useful for landscape archaeology investigations. The quality of results obtained through remote sensing mainly depends on the number of bands that can be exploited, the spatial and spectral resolution of imagery and the methodology used. In this work, adopting a post-dictive approach, multispectral remote sensing data from World-View 2 (WV-2) were used in order to detect archaeological features in the volcanic area of Bronte (Sicily, Italy), a town 40 km from Catania. The selected area lies in the western slope of Etna, inside the boundary of Etna Park. Here, the archaeological research is affected by specific problems. The geology and the spontaneous vegetation of this fascinating environment represents one of the biggest issues. The entire research was conducted using free and open source software (FOSS) within a low-cost logic that allows study of landscapes using limited budget. The strategy developed in our study is directed towards a post-dictive approach to archeological data and remote sensing techniques. We analyzed an area where archeological buildings are now visible, but WV-2 multispectral images have been deliberately selected prior to the archaeological excavations carried out in 2015. In this way, we can evaluate and test instruments and techniques at our disposal, emphasizing weaknesses and strengths. The final results illustrate the benefits and challenges of performing multispectral imagines for archaeological investigations. The use of some of the most promising vegetation indices, especially Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Simple Ratio Index (SRI), is analysed and discussed, while the post-dictive approach suggests that the more useful bands are undoubtedly NIR_1 and RED_EDGE.

TI  - Satellite image analysis of changes in glacier cover in Canada's northern Mackenzie Mountain Range (1987-2017)
T2  - CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN
M3  - Article
AB  - The state of a group of glaciers in the northern Mackenzie Mountains across the Yukon-Northwest Territories border was investigated over a period of three decades, using Landsat TM and OLI imagery from 1987, 1994, 1999, 2004, 2013, and 2017 to examine changes in glacier extents. A thresholded red/shortwave infrared band ratio image was used to delineate glacier boundaries. The total area of 74 glaciers in the study area decreased from 52.78 +/- 1.32 km(2) in 1987 to 24.89 +/- 0.62 km(2) in 2017, a loss of 27.89 +/- 1.39 km(2) or 52.8 +/- 2.6%, with a mean rate of reduction of 1.8% center dot a(-1). Smaller glaciers experienced larger relative changes in area. In this study, the rates of reduction are high compared to decreases reported for other glaciers in the region in the late 20(th) century. Based on linear extrapolation of the trend in values of total glacier area, it is predicted-subject to uncertainties in how glaciers diminish in size and eventually disappear-that the study area could be free of visible glacier cover within three decades.

R-2 (0.94) values were found for the soil moisture covered by corn crop at VV polarization using RFR, SVR linear and radial basis function kernels. The least performance was reported using ANNR model for almost all the crops under investigation. The soil moisture retrieval outcomes were found better at VV polarization in comparison to VH polarization using three different models.

TI  - The 2018 North Greenland polynya observed by a newly introduced merged optical and passive microwave sea-ice concentration dataset
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of sea-ice concentration are available from satellites year-round and almost weather-independently using passive microwave radiometers at resolutions down to 5 km. Thermal infrared radiometers provide data with a resolution of 1 km but only under cloud-free conditions. We use the best of the two satellite measurements and merge thermal infrared and passive microwave sea-ice concentrations. This yields a merged sea-ice concentration product combining the gap-free spatial coverage of the passive microwave sea-ice concentration and the 1 km resolution of the thermal infrared sea-ice concentration. The benefit of the merged product is demonstrated by observations of a polynya which opened north of Greenland in February 2018. We find that the merged sea-ice concentration product resolves leads at sea-ice concentrations between 60% and 90 %. They are not resolved by the coarser passive microwave sea-ice concentration product. The benefit of the merged product is most pronounced during the formation of the polynya. Next, the environmental conditions during the polynya event are analysed. The polynya was caused by unusual southerly winds during which the sea ice drifted northward instead of southward as usual. The daily displacement was 50% stronger than normal. The polynya was associated with a warm-air intrusion caused by a high-pressure system over the Eurasian Arctic. Surface air temperatures were slightly below 0 degrees C and thus more than 20 degrees C higher than normal. Two estimates of thermodynamic sea-ice growth yield sea-ice thicknesses of 60 and 65 cm at the end of March in the area opened by the polynya. This differed from airborne sea-ice thickness measurements, indicating that sea-ice growth processes in the polynya are complicated by rafting and ridging. A sea-ice volume of 33 km(3) was produced thermodynamically.

TI  - On the sensitivity of a 4D-Var analysis system to satellite observations located at different times within the assimilation window
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study quantifies the extent to which the ECMWF 4D-Var displays differential (heightened) sensitivity to observations located near the end of the 12-hr assimilation time window compared to observations located near the start of the window. Using dedicated satellite data denial experiments, it is shown that the lattermost 3 hr of observations are significantly more influential on the quality of the assimilation and forecasting system than the first 3 hr of data. Furthermore, it is found that the last 3 hr of data even outperforms the 6 hr of data (i.e. twice the number of observations) located in the first half of the window. The heightened importance of late window data is discussed in terms of these measurements being our most up-to-date information on the atmosphere, but also their ability to provide additional dynamical information to the assimilation system via feature advection wind tracing. The implications of this sensitivity are discussed. Firstly, it leads to the existence of influential (late window) satellite orbits, the location of which can have a strong bearing on the impact of observations from different satellites in different regions. Secondly, this sensitivity reinforces the need for data providers to minimize dissemination delays to ensure that crucial late window data reach users in time to be assimilated. Finally, numerical weather prediction (NWP) centres (who run 4D systems) must ensure that these lattermost observations are being captured and used effectively. Some suggestions for this are proposed.

TI  - Simulating urban climate at sub-kilometre scale for representing the intra-urban variability of Zurich, Switzerland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the face of an increasing number of urban climate modelling studies performed at sub-kilometre resolution, systematic investigations of the performance of high-resolution urban climate simulations and their dependency on spatial resolution are still very sparse. This study investigates the impact of the scale of representation of the urban area on the urban climate simulation with a multi-layer urban canopy model (UCM) integrated in a mesoscale numerical weather prediction model for different sub-kilometre resolutions. The potential of using such a model system for representing the intra-urban climate variability is explored. The weather and climate model COSMO in Climate Mode (CCLM), coupled with the multi-layer UCM Double-Canyon effect parameterization (CCLM-DCEP), was used at increasing resolution from 1 km to 250 m grid spacing to simulate the pronounced heat wave event of June-July 2015 over the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Air temperature and wind speed measurements from a network of urban stations as well as surface temperatures (STs) from Landsat 7 imagery have been used to evaluate the model results. CCLM-DCEP showed good performance against observed air temperature, ST, and wind speed in the urban area. The model performance did not change significantly with model resolution and a performance improvement with model resolution was not found. Small-scale features such as urban parks and large railway areas started to be resolved at sub-kilometre grid spacing. At the finest model resolution (250 m), a spatial variability in air temperature of up to 2 K and wind speed of up to 1.5 m/s was found within the grid cell of the coarsest resolution grid (1 km). CCLM-DCEP showed the potential to represent the urban climate at the neighbourhood scale when used at high (sub-kilometre) resolution, which is needed to support applications such as urban planning, building energy use and urban air quality.

TI  - A denoising-classification-retracking method to improve spaceborne estimates of the water level-surface-volume relation over the Urmia Lake in Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Decreasing the volume of the Urmia Lake, as the largest inland water body in Iran, is one of the current environmental and water resource management concerns. This study obtains a reliable spaceborne water level (WL)-area-volume relationship for the Urmia Lake using terrestrial, aerial and satellite-based data. The aim of this study is to improve Urmia Lake's WL derived from satellite altimetry and, consequently, to more accurately estimate the volume of the lake for the last decade. To this end, improved WL is obtained from the Satellite with Argos and Altika (SARAL/AltiKa) and Jason-2 altimetry missions by performing a post-processing method. The post-processing method includes a denoising, a classification and appropriate retracking algorithms. The results are validated against in situ gauge data and also compared with results from Prototype Innovant de Systeme de Traitement pour les Applications Cotieres et l'Hydrologie (PISTACH) and Prototype on AltiKa for Coastal, Hydrology and Ice (PEACHI) products. The Denoising-Classification-Retracking (DCR) method improves the root mean square error (RMSE) of WL with respect to those of PISTACH and PEACHI by 54% and 24%, respectively. The surface area of the lake is determined from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images based on calculating normalized difference water index (NDWI). The results are validated against the surface area obtained from aerial photogrammetry and Cartosat high resolution image. Moreover, based on bathymetric map a Look-up table including surface area and volume of the lake at specific levels are formed. The obtained surface area is then compared with the values of the Look-up table. The normalized root mean square error between surface extent obtained from proposed method and corresponding values is about 11%. The estimated lake's volume is compared with the level-volume curve from the bathymetric data. The result showed the RMSE of this comparison is about 0.12 km(3). Our validated results show that the lake has lost 75% of its volume from late 2008 to early 2016 but continued with an increase in its volume in May 2017 twice as much as in early 2016. Our results support urgent or long-term restoration plan of Lake Urmia and highlight the important role of spaceborne sensors for hydrological applications.

TI  - Countrywide Observations of Plate Spreading and Glacial Isostatic Adjustment in Iceland Inferred by Sentinel-1 Radar Interferometry, 2015-2018
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - East-west and vertical ground velocities for 2015-2018 are retrieved over 81% of Iceland from Sentinel-1 radar interferometry, using satellite images from six different tracks. Only summertime images are considered, to avoid snow cover. Average line-of-sight velocity fields for 2015-2018 for each track are estimated using a simple approach: single master interferometry time series together with a linear component estimation for each pixel. The line-of-sight velocity fields are combined and their signal is decomposed to extract approximate east (near-East) and approximate vertical (near-Up) velocities. Only pixels passing a coherence and outlier criteria are considered, resulting in 81% coverage of Iceland. The 19% of missing coverage is mostly glaciers and farmland. We find a general agreement between the near-East velocity field and a revised plate spreading model, and the near-Up velocity field and a glacial isostatic adjustment model. Models and their residuals suggest a difference in rheology between the rift zones in Iceland.

TI  - Efficacy and clinical significance of omitting blue dye injection during sentinel lymph node biopsy before Mohs micrographic surgery for malignant melanoma of the lower extremities
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is usually performed using a triple technique that includes lymphoscintigraphy (LSG), which involves the injection of a radiolabelled tracer, blue dye injection, and detection of the radioisotope with a gamma probe. However, blue dye injection may cause pathological misinterpretation and obscure clinical margins, especially when combined with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) for cutaneous melanoma. Objectives To assess the efficacy of SLNB without blue dye injection in patients who subsequently underwent MMS for melanomas of the lower extremities. Methods We evaluated patients who underwent MMS with or without SLNB using preoperative localization of the primary melanoma via LSG and intraoperative confirmation using a gamma probe between 2010 and 2016. Results Seventy-two patients with melanoma of mean Breslow thickness 3 center dot 03 +/- 1 center dot 44 mm were evaluated. Sixty-five of the 72 patients underwent SLNB, the success rate of which was 98%. The 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 78% and 76%, respectively. Conclusions Blue dye injection can be omitted without compromising the accuracy of standard SLNB. Omitting blue dye injection also has marked advantages in MMS for melanoma.

TI  - Decreasing Trend in Formaldehyde Detected From 20-Year Record at Wollongong, Southeast Australia
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of atmospheric composition to ongoing environmental change remains poorly constrained across much of the Southern Hemisphere. We use a 20-year record of ground-based total column measurements from Wollongong, southeast Australia to identify a statistically significant decreasing trend in formaldehyde of -1.9 [-2.2, -1.7]%/year. The trend is consistently negative across all months except November. Satellite data indicate that the trend at Wollongong is distinctly local and is superimposed on a regional-scale increase likely driven by changes in methane. In austral summer, coincident changes in hydrogen cyanide suggest that decreases in local biomass burning can only partly explain the observed trend. In the absence of other explanations, we infer that the observed formaldehyde trend is likely driven by decreasing industrial emissions. In November, an observed increasing temperature trend is consistent with an earlier onset of biogenic emissions in the region, driving increased biogenic formaldehyde that counteracts the overall decrease.

TI  - How Does the Unique Space-Time Sampling of the SWOT Mission Influence River Discharge Series Characteristics?
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will, for the first time, provide simultaneous, high-resolution measurements of water surface elevation and extent. Here we explore the applicability of SWOT's unique sampling to capture discharge frequency behavior throughout the Mississippi River Basin. Our findings suggest the mission may capture key variability in river discharge series. SWOT orbit specifications, US Geological Survey (USGS) discharge measurements, and potential uncertainty estimates are used to generate SWOT-like river discharges. Frequency distributions and specific quantiles derived from synthetic SWOT discharge series are compared to those derived from daily USGS discharge series. Based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, SWOT temporal sampling has essentially no impact on derived frequency distributions. When including potential uncertainty, 78% of derived distributions are statistically identical. The combined effects of temporal sampling and discharge uncertainty mitigates the negative bias used for SWOT discharge uncertainty at larger discharge quantiles (i.e., >= 75% quantiles).

TI  - Apoplastic invasion patterns triggering plant immunity: plasma membrane sensing at the frontline
T2  - MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Plants are able to effectively cope with invading pathogens by activating an immune response based on the detection of invasion patterns (IPs) originating from the pathogen or released by the plant after infection. At a first level, this perception takes place at the plasma membrane through cell surface immune receptors and although the involvement of proteinaceous pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is well established, increasing data are also pointing out the role of membrane lipids in the sensing of IPs. In this review, we discuss the evolution of various conceptual models describing plant immunity and present an overview of well-characterized IPs from different natures and origins. We summarize the current knowledge on how they are perceived by plants at the plasma membrane, highlighting the increasingly apparent diversity of sentinel-related systems in plants.

TI  - Mapping high temperature damaged area of paddy rice along the Yangtze River using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The subtropical high temperature anomaly of 2013 in China, adversely affected paddy rice physiology, especially at the heading, flowering and grain filling stages, and left untold damage and significant rice yield reductions in that year. Considering the importance of data on crop failure induced by abnormal meteorological events, in understanding the potential impacts of climate change on agriculture and food security, and in support of crop insurance policies, the current study employs satellite remote sensing data to map and estimate the areal extent of high-temperature-induced damage on paddy rice in 2013, along the Yangtze River, a major rice producing area in China. In this regard, the daily mean and maximum air temperatures were first estimated using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) products, MODIS Vegetation Indices (VI) products, altitude information from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and air temperature measurements at meteorological stations located within the Yangtze River Basin from 2000 to 2016, to derive fully covered mean and maximum daily air temperatures. Paddy rice cultivated areas were then identified based on the seasonal profiles of MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) in 2013, and map errors at provincial scales were no more than 8.7%. Finally, paddy rice growth characteristics were combined with MODIS VI products to identify heading and flowering stages, and the time series of daily mean and maximum air temperatures, paddy rice phenology and cultivated area, were integrated to map and estimate the rice crop area damaged by the anomalous high temperature. Our results show that all provinces along the Yangtze River, this study investigated, recorded a substantial damaged rice crop area, following the 2013 subtropical temperature high, and Anhui Province was the hardest hit with a damaged rice area of 63.6%. For the entire study area, a damage extent of about 5,656,000 ha, accounting for 35.9% of total paddy rice planted area, was recorded. This indicates a significant agro-meteorological disaster, and in an era of increasing climate variability and weather extremes, studies of this nature would greatly benefit global food security planning and management policies.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Evaporation and Vegetation Transpiration Using Two Trapezoidal Models From MODIS Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil evaporation (ETs) and vegetation transpiration (ETv) are essential in evaporative demand analyses and agricultural applications. This study estimated ETs and ETv using two trapezoidal models, that is, the conventional trapezoidal model and the end-member-based soil and vegetation energy partitioning (ESVEP) model, at three AmeriFlux tower sites. First, the land surface temperature of a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) pixel was decomposed into soil and vegetation temperatures (T-s and T-v, respectively) which involve important information related to ETs and ETv and were compared with corresponding temperatures from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). Then ETs and ETv were parameterized, and the total evapotranspiration (ET) was validated with the eddy covariance system measurements after energy imbalance corrections via the residual energy and Bowen ratio methods. The results showed that the ESVEP model partitioned T-s, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.56-2.70 K (4.98-10.16%), and T-v, with an RMSE of 2.54-2.80 K (9.73-11.11%), indicating a higher accuracy than that from the conventional trapezoidal model, where the RMSE was 2.26-3.64 K (7.31-13.40%) for T-s separation and 2.82-4.62 K (9.80-15.49%) for T-v separation. For the ET estimation, the ESVEP model still performed better. The estimation RMSE was 49.8-58.4 W/m(2) (22.8-27.2%) for the ESVEP model and 72.0-89.5 W/m(2) (29.8-41.1%) for the conventional trapezoidal model, compared to the RE corrected measurements; the RMSE was 42.6-53.3 W/m(2) (24.4-28.1%) for the ESVEP model and 57.5-78.1 W/m(2) (32.3-37.9%) for the conventional trapezoidal model, compared to the Bowen ratio corrected measurements.

TI  - The Impact of the Direct Effect of Aerosols on Meteorology and Air Quality Using Aerosol Optical Depth Assimilation During the KORUS-AQ Campaign
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - To quantify the impact of the direct aerosol effect accurately, this study incorporated the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) aerosol optical depth (AOD) into a coupled meteorology-chemistry model. We designed three model simulations to observe the impact of AOD assimilation and aerosol feedback during the KORUS-AQ campaign (May-June 2016). By assimilating the GOCI AOD with high temporal and spatial resolutions, we improve the statistics from the comparison AOD and AERONET data (root-mean-square error: 0.12, R:0.77, index of agreement: 0.69, mean-absolute error: 0.08). The inclusion of the direct effect of aerosols produces the best model performance (root-mean-square error: 0.10, R:0.86, index of agreement: 0.72, mean-absolute error: 0.07). AOD values increased as much as 0.15, which is associated with an average reduction in solar radiation of -31.39 W/m(2), a planetary boundary layer height (-104.70 m), an air temperature (-0.58 degrees C), and a surface wind speed (-0.07 m/s) over land. In addition, concentrations of major gaseous and particulate pollutants at the surface (SO2, NO2, NH3, SO42-, NO3-, NH4+, and PM2.5) increase by 7.87-34%, while OH concentration decreases by -4.58%. Changes in meteorology and air quality appear to be more significant in high-aerosol loading areas. The integrated process rate analysis shows decelerated vertical transport, resulting in an accumulation of air pollutants near the surface and the amount of nitrate, which is higher than that of sulfate because of its response to reduced temperature. We conclude that constraining aerosol concentrations using geostationary satellite data is a prerequisite for quantifying the impact of aerosols on meteorology and air quality.

TI  - Four-dimensional filtering of InSAR persistent scatterers elucidates subsidence induced by tunnel excavation in the Sri Lankan highlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During construction of the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project, excavation of a headrace tunnel through highly tectonized metamorphic rock was slowed by repeated major water ingress events. In total, these events resulted in an estimated aquifer depletion of over 9 million m(3), causing widespread surface subsidence. Persistent scatterer (PS) time series analysis of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) scenes acquired by Sentinel-1 between July 28, 2016, and January 7, 2018, has revealed an similar to 15 km(2) area of subsidence near reported water ingress locations, with a maximum line-of-sight subsidence value of 4.3 cm. A four-dimensional (4-D) filtering method based on averaging spatial and temporal pixel neighbors was applied to the unwrapped PS pixels, significantly reducing noise from sources that appear randomly in spatial and temporal domains and increasing the ability to accurately identify the onset of subsidence and track surface volume loss over time. A maximum average subsidence rate of 0.15 mm/day coincides with maximum tunnel discharge measurements, indicating that rock mass consolidation occurred as a result of rapid pore-pressure drawdown within an interconnected discontinuity network and led to fracture closure. The observed subsidence is punctuated by localized maxima and extends in a northwest-southeast orientation, suggesting that the extent of subsidence is governed by previously mapped structural trends of similar orientations. These results highlight the value of the 4-D filtering approach in processing InSAR PS data to help determine the magnitude and extent of surface subsidence.

TI  - Estimates of African Dust Deposition Along the Trans-Atlantic Transit Using the Decadelong Record of Aerosol Measurements from CALIOP, MODIS, MISR, and IASI
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Deposition of mineral dust into ocean fertilizes ecosystems and influences biogeochemical cycles and climate. In situ observations of dust deposition are scarce, and model simulations depend on the highly parameterized representations of dust processes with few constraints. By taking advantage of satellites' routine sampling on global and decadal scales, we estimate African dust deposition flux and loss frequency (a ratio of deposition flux to mass loading) along the trans-Atlantic transit using the three-dimensional distributions of aerosol retrieved by spaceborne lidar (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization [CALIOP]) and radiometers (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer [MODIS], Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer [MISR], and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer [IASI]). On the basis of a 10-year (2007-2016) and basin-scale average, the amount of dust deposition into the tropical Atlantic Ocean is estimated at 136-222 Tg/year. The 65-83% of satellite-based estimates agree with the in situ climatology within a factor of 2. The magnitudes of dust deposition are highest in boreal summer and lowest in fall, whereas the interannual variability as measured by the normalized standard deviation with mean is largest in spring (28-41%) and smallest (7-15%) in summer. The dust deposition displays high spatial heterogeneity, revealing that the meridional shifts of major dust deposition belts are modulated by the seasonal migration of the intertropical convergence zone. On the basis of the annual and basin mean, the dust loss frequency derived from the satellite observations ranges from 0.078 to 0.100 day(-1), which is lower than model simulations by up to factors of 2 to 5. The most efficient loss of dust occurs in winter, consistent with the higher possibility of low-altitude transported dust in southern trajectories being intercepted by rainfall associated with the intertropical convergence zone. The satellite-based estimates of dust deposition can be used to fill the geographical gaps and extend time span of in situ measurements, study the dust-ocean interactions, and evaluate model simulations of dust processes.

TI  - Modelling snowmelt runoff in Lidder River Basin using coupled model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A major proportion of discharge in the Udder River is contributed by snowmelt runoff in its catchment which is situated in the West Himalayan region. It is, therefore, quite essential to estimate the contribution of snowmelt runoff to discharge along with other hydrological components. The MIKE SHE-MIKE-11 integrated coupled model along with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing snow cover products was selected and used in the Lidder Basin to ascertain the snowmelt contribution to runoff along with baseflow and drainage, as well as the percentage of snow-covered areas in the Basin around the year. The model was calibrated by trying to match simulated discharge against observed stream flow discharge at the Sheeshnag gauging station. Sensitivity analysis was carried out by varying three unknown parameters, viz., degree day coefficient, temperature lapse rate and precipitation lapse rate. The three parameters were unknown in the region. The cumulative volume of the simulated runoff was further validated with the observed runoff which showed an excellent comparison. The snow-covered areas obtained from the output of the model were validated with the data obtained from MODIS data sets. The data showed an excellent comparison. The ET losses at Sheeshnag represented 19.65% of the total rainfall, while the runoff at the Sheeshnag catchment of the Lidder Basin represented 40% of the total rainfall. Snowmelt contribution to the total streamflow in the Lidder River at Sheeshnag was found to be 54.19%. The total error percentage of the model was about 0.11 of the total rainfall, indicating a good interaction among different hydrological components of the model. The results obtained suggest that the MIKESHE-MIKE-11 integrated coupled model can be used efficiently in the sub-catchments of the upper Indus Basin in which snowfall and snowmelt runoff are significant.

TI  - Investigations into the development of a satellite-based aerosol climate data record using ATSR-2, AATSR and AVHRR data over north-eastern China from 1987 to 2012
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites provide information on the temporal and spatial distributions of aerosols on regional and global scales. With the same method applied to a single sensor all over the world, a consistent data set is to be expected. However, the application of different retrieval algorithms to the same sensor and the use of a series of different sensors may lead to substantial differences, and no single sensor or algorithm is better than any other everywhere and at all times. For the production of long-term climate data records, the use of multiple sensors cannot be avoided. The Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR-2) and the Advanced ATSR (AATSR) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data sets have been used to provide a global AOD data record over land and ocean of 17 years (1995-2012), which is planned to be extended with AOD retrieved from a similar sensor. To investigate the possibility of extending the ATSR data record to earlier years, the use of an AOD data set from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is investigated. AOD data sets used in this study were retrieved from the ATSR sensors using the ATSR Dual View algorithm ADV version 2.31, developed by Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI), and from the AVHRR sensors using the aerosol optical depth over land (ADL) algorithm developed by RADI/CAS. Together, these data sets cover a multi-decadal period (1987-2012). The study area includes two contrasting areas, both in regards to aerosol content and composition and surface properties, i.e. a region over north-eastern China, encompassing a highly populated urban/industrialized area (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei) and a sparsely populated mountainous area.Ground-based AOD observations available from ground-based sun photometer AOD data in AERONET and CARSNET are used as a reference, together with broadband extinction method (BEM) data at Beijing to cover the time before sun photometer observations became available in the early 2000s. In addition, MODIS-Terra C6.1 AOD data are used as a reference data set over the wide area where no ground-based data are available. All satellite data over the study area were validated against the reference data, showing the qualification of MODIS for comparison with ATSR and AVHRR. The comparison with MODIS shows that AVHRR performs better than ATSR in the north of the study area (40 degrees N), whereas further south ATSR provides better results. The validation against sun photometer AOD shows that both AVHRR and ATSR underestimate the AOD, with ATSR failing to provide reliable results in the wintertime. This is likely due to the highly reflecting surface in the dry season, when AVHRR-retrieved AOD traces both MODIS and reference AOD data well. However, AVHRR does not provide AOD larger than about 0.6 and hence is not reliable when high AOD values have been observed over the last decade. In these cases, ATSR performs much better for AOD up to about 1.3. AVHRR-retrieved AOD compares favourably with BEM AOD, except for AOD higher than about 0.6. These comparisons lead to the conclusion that AVHRR and ATSR AOD data records each have their strengths and weaknesses that need to be accounted for when combining them in a single multi-decadal climate data record.

TI  - Effects of forest windstorm disturbance on invasive plants in protected areas of southern Illinois, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive plant populations respond positively to light increase from windstorm-caused canopy damage, but are typically out-competed over time as the tree canopy recovers. Some invasive plants have the ability to slow or even completely prevent canopy regrowth. It is important to understand invasive plant dynamics in windstorm blowdowns to inform effective forest management. We hypothesized that blowdown areas are more invaded than unaffected forest and that invadedness of a blowdown will decrease with increasing time since disturbance and increase with disturbance magnitude. We used Landsat imagery to identify 31 blowdowns caused by one of three storms in southern Illinois of the United States: 2006 tornado, 2009 derecho or 2017 tornado. We statistically matched these blowdowns to areas of unaffected forest based on slope, aspect, elevation, distance to a road and distance to a trail. We surveyed blowdown and unaffected units for invasive plants in summer 2018. Disturbance magnitude was measured in two ways: per cent change in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and area of blowdown. Overall, blowdowns were more invaded than their statistically matched areas. Invadedness of blowdowns decreased with increasing time since disturbance, indicating that the blowdowns are recovering as tree canopy regrowth shades out invasive plants. Per cent change in NDVI was not a supported predictor of blowdown invadedness, but invadedness was strongly positively related to blowdown size. Larger blowdowns recover more slowly than smaller disturbances due to different recovery pathways, providing more time and opportunity for the spread and establishment of invasive plants. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that although blowdowns contained higher cover of invasive plants than forest unaffected by windstorms, invasive plants were responding negatively to canopy regrowth. Land managers should prioritize treatment of invasive plants in larger and more recent blowdowns.

TI  - Remote sensing and seismic data integration for the characterization of a rock slide and an artificially triggered rock fall
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - On May 5th, 2013 a planar rock slide (similar to 450 m(3)) occurred in the village of La Riba (NE Spain), which forced the closure of the road C-240z for 6 months. This slide left a hanging block (similar to 130 m(3)) suspended on the slope forcing a controlled blasting, followed by rock slope stabilization works. The volume of rock displaced during the both events was deduced from LiDAR and photogrammetry data following two approaches: subtracting pre- and post-event data and reconstructing the volume by fitting planes on the structural surfaces after a structural analysis of the slope. Information about the natural rock slide was obtained from the records of two permanent broadband seismic stations located 10 km from the site. From these seismic records, the existence of a rock slide was confirmed and its time of occurrence was determined, information that would be otherwise unknown. In addition, despite the small volume displaced during the event, its location was deduced from a single seismic station analysis. The blasting process was recorded with two high-definition (HD) video cameras and by two temporary seismic stations deployed close to the site (< 100 m). Both the seismic and video recordings enabled us to reconstruct the trajectories and propagation details of the blasted rock blocks, involving material of different size sliding on the slope, suspended in the air or bouncing and impacting along the slope and on the road. Potential and seismic energy ratios (E-s/E-p) for each event were calculated from seismic data analysis in order to investigate the possibility of estimating properties of the rockfalls, primarily volume. The potential energy of both events was deduced from the volumes calculated using remote sensing methods and ranged between 189 and 201 MJ for the natural rock slide and between 48 and 54 MJ for the artificially triggered rockfall. The seismic energy was calculated following two approaches; estimating pseudo local magnitudes and by classical wave propagation theory, obtaining E-s values ranging from 2.0 x 10(-1) MJ to 4.4 x 10(-1) MJ for the natural rock slide and from 4.5 x 10(-3) to 9.1 x 10(-3) MJ for the artificial event. We estimated ranges of E-s/E-p ratios between 1.5 x 10(-7) and 5 x 10(-3) for the natural rock slide and between 8.5 x 10(-5) and 1.1 x 10(-4) for the artificial rockfall. The comparison of the volumes calculated using these ratios with the realistic volumes estimated from remote sensing data analysis, show that the seismic method is far less reliable for this task, specifically for small volumes (< 500 m(3)) at long distances (> 10 km). Partially, because only a part of the released energy is transmitted into the ground as seismic energy, and partially because the recorded seismic signal is highly dependent on the event characteristics and the geotechnical conditions of the ground materials. Nevertheless, seismic data is very well suited to detect and characterize in detail both rockfall events of different nature and size. Merging and integrating remote sensing techniques such as LiDAR or photogrammetry with seismic measurements should allow the implementation of rockfall early warning systems.

TI  - Monitoring Antibiotic Usage in German Dairy and Beef Cattle Farms-A Longitudinal Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well-established that antimicrobial use is a major factor for the development of antimicrobial resistance. To analyze the associations between antimicrobial resistance and usage of antimicrobial agents, data from monitoring and surveillance systems are crucial. Within the project VetCAb (Veterinary Consumption of Antibiotics), antibiotic usage data in German livestock is regularly collected and evaluated. Based on a cross-sectional study in 2011, the project was continued as the longitudinal study VetCAb-Sentinel with ongoing participant recruitment and data collection from 2013. The data collection is based on official German application and delivery forms (ADF), voluntarily provided by veterinarians and farmers. In this study the results of antibiotic usage data of dairy cows, dairy calves and beef cattle were described, using a semi-annual treatment frequency, and 95,944 ADF issued between 2011 and 2015 were analyzed. Results show that the median of the treatment frequency in dairy calf and beef cattle holdings slightly decreased from 0.4 to 0.3 and from 0.2 to 0 days, respectively, whereas the median in dairy cow holdings ranged between 1.9 and 2.3 during the observed period. Temporal changes and the effect of the factors "farm size" and "region" on the treatment frequency were investigated, using multiple linear mixed and logistic regression models. Generally, the factor "time" has a statistically significant impact on the treatment frequency in all production types. In addition, a temporal trend test over the first six half-years shows that an increasing linear trend can be stated in dairy cows and dairy calves (p = 0.017; p = 0.004, respectively). If the time-period is extended to all eight half-years under study, this turns into a quadratic effect (dairy cows: p = 0.006; dairy calves: p < 0.001). In dairy calves and beef cattle the factor "farm size" also has a statistically significant impact. The factor "region," in contrast, shows no statistically significant impact at all. Compared to other livestock populations in Germany, the use of antimicrobials in dairy cows, dairy calves, and beef cattle appears to be low, but varies across several associated factors. Considering these effects, it is recommended that the size of dairy calf and beef cattle holdings is regularly considered in the evaluation of antimicrobial usage data over time.

TI  - Genotypic prevalence of norovirus GII in gastroenteritis outpatients in Shanghai from 2016 to 2018
T2  - GUT PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWith the help of an existing citywide comprehensive surveillance on gastroenteritis outpatients, although norovirus genogroup II (NoV GII) was tested routinely, its genotypes were never investigated systematically on a municipal level. This study aimed to understand the prevalence, major genotypes and evolutional trends of NoV GII in Shanghai during the period of 2016-2018, and to provide molecular bases for early warning for any potential NoV outbreaks.Methods27 sentinel hospitals from all 16 districts were recruited by stratified probability proportional to size (PPS) method in Shanghai comprehensive diarrhea surveillance programme. Stool samples were collected and screened for NoV GII by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). For samples that were positive in qRT-PCR, conventional RT-PCR was performed to amplify the ORF1-ORF2 junction of NoV GII gene. Generated sequences were typed by RIVM online genotyping tool, and then strains of interest were analyzed phylogenetically using MEGA 6.0.ResultsA total of 7883 stool samples were collected from diarrhea outpatients, among which 6474 were from adults and 1409 were from children. 13.66% (1077 cases) were screened positive in qRT-PCR for NoV GII, from which 71.96% (775 cases) were sequenced successfully. The top three genotypes were GII.Pe/GII.4 (37%), GII.P17/GII.17 (26%) and GII.P16/GII.2 (17%). While GII.Pe/GII.4 detection rate decreased significantly over the 3years (from 48.4 to 20.9%); GII.P16/GII.2 appeared for the first time in October 2016 and rose rapidly to 27.0% in 2017, but fell back to 23.4% in 2018. Meanwhile there was a significant increase for both GII.P12/GII.3 and GII.P7/GII.6 recombinant genotypes detected in adult population in 2018. Phylogenic analysis revealed the existence of multiple gene clusters within both of these recombinant genotypes.ConclusionUnlike the alternating circulation of GII.4 and non-GII.4 NoV observed in 2016 or 2017, the genotype profile of NoV GII in 2018 was characterized by the co-prevalence of multiple recombinant genotypes. A recent increase in detection rate in less reported recombinant genotypes such as GII.P12/GII.3 and GII.P7/GII.6 among adult population calls for a continuing close monitoring on NoV GII genotypes in case of potential local outbreaks.

TI  - Characterization of pre- and post-failure displacements of the Huangnibazi landslide in Li County with multi-source satellite observations
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Huangnibazi landslide in Li County of southwest China, began to slide rapidly since 8 August 2017. It received little attention before the failure event. The fast motion of the slope posed great threats to the safety of nearby villages and the national highway G317 at the foot of the mountain. In this study, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets collected by C-band Sentinel-1 and X-band TerraSAR-X (TSX), as well as optical images acquired by Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) over the landslide site were analyzed to characterize the evolution of the slope before and after the failure event. Firstly, the surface change of the sliding area was qualitatively evaluated using the Sentinel-2 true-color images and pseudo-colored TerraSAR-X amplitude images. Next, the slow movement of the slope before the failure event was detected by interferometry using both TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 data stacks. The maximum displacement rate estimated was larger than -45 mm/year along the radar line of sight (LOS) direction. Finally, the large post-failure displacements of the landslide were successfully retrieved with meter-level accuracy from TerraSAR-X observations using adaptive amplitude offset tracking method. The maximum displacement decreased from about 30 m in 11 days in August 2017 to 1-2 m in 22 days in January 2018 in both LOS and azimuth directions. According to the recent measurements of surface displacement, the landslide body is becoming stabilized gradually, which suggests that the risk of catastrophic collapse of the slope has been largely reduced.

TI  - Time series of the Inland Surface Water Dataset in China (ISWDC) for 2000-2016 derived from MODIS archives
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Review
AB  - The moderate spatial resolution and high temporal resolution of MODIS imagery make it an ideal resource for time series surface water monitoring and mapping. We used MODIS MOD09Q1 surface reflectance archive images to create an Inland Surface Water Dataset in China (ISWDC), which maps water bodies larger than 0.0625 km(2) within the land mass of China for the period 2000-2016, with 8 d temporal and 250 m spatial resolution. We assessed the accuracy of the ISWDC by comparing it with the national land cover derived surface water data and global surface water (GSW) data. The results show that the ISWDC is closely correlated with the national reference data with coefficient of determination (R-2) greater than 0.99 in 2000, 2005, and 2010, while the ISWDC possesses very good consistency, very similar change dynamics, and similar spatial patterns in different regions with the GSW dataset. The ISWDC dataset can be used for studies on the inter-annual and seasonal variation of the surface water systems. It can also be used as reference data for verification of the other surface water dataset and as an input parameter for regional and global hydro-climatic models.

TI  - Theoretical basis of the algorithms and early phase results of the GCOM-C (Shikisai) SGLI cloud products
T2  - PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the cloud/clear discrimination algorithm (CLAUDIA) and the cloud microphysical properties algorithm (CAPCOM), which are used by the Second-generation GLobal Imager (SGLI) aboard the GCOM-C satellite, launched in December 2017. Also described are the preliminary results of cloud products' validation. CLAUDIA was validated by comparing cloud fractions derived from satellite data against data from whole-sky images captured by ground-based fisheye cameras. User's accuracy and producer's accuracy were mostly high at around 90%, and the resulting overall accuracy was also high, ranging from 83 to 100% (average of all sites was 90.5%). CLAUDIA has proven to be sufficiently accurate to apply a cloud mask to measurements and meets the requirements for releasing data for SGLI cloud flag products (the minimum for a successful GCOM-C mission). CAPCOM was evaluated by comparing cloud properties obtained by SGLI products against data from MODIS collection 6 products (MOD06). This was done for both ocean and land in the low to middle latitudes (60 degrees N-60 degrees S) from August 22, 2018 to September 14, 2018. The comparison showed good correlation coefficients for cloud optical thickness, effective particle radius, and cloud-top temperature for water clouds: 0.88 (0.83), 0.92 (0.88), and 0.94 (0.92) for ocean (land), respectively. CAPCOM data for ice cloud optical thickness correlated well with data from MODIS products: 0.86 (ocean) and 0.82 (land).

TI  - Cervical cancer screening rate differs by HPV vaccination status: An interim analysis
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The incidence of cervical cancer has been increasing, especially in younger generation, in Japan. The females born between 1994 and 1999, who achieved rates of HPV vaccination approaching 70%, have become the target of cervical cancer screening programs. Here, we have analyzed the cervical cancer screening rates among the vaccinated and unvaccinated women.Methods: The survey data for cervical cancer screening at age 20 in FY 2015 was derived from two cities, Toyonaka and Iwaki.Results: Among 2,727 females, in Toyonaka and Iwaki, who were born in FY 1995 and targeted in FY 2015 at age 20 for cervical cancer screening, their HPV vaccination rate was 64.2% (1,753/2,727). The screening rate was 6.4% (112/1,753) in the vaccinated and 3.9% (38/974) in the unvaccinated. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01).Conclusions: We have demonstrated that HPV-vaccinated females tended to be effectively protected from future cervical cancer than the unvaccinated.

TI  - Cost and resource implications of introducing intensive nodal surveillance for sentinel node positive melanoma in provincial New Zealand
T2  - NEW ZEALAND MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - AIMS: Two randomised trials have shown that immediate completion lymphadenectomy for sentinel node positive melanoma provides no long-term survival benefit; compared with a follow up regime of intensive nodal surveillance. The aim of this study was to assess the cost and resource implications of introducing this regime for patients with sentinel node positive melanoma in a provincial New Zealand hospital.METHODS: Patients with cutaneous melanoma presenting to Northland District Health Board between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2014 were identified. The financial and resource burden of standard treatment was assessed, including operative, outpatient and imaging interventions. Theoretical financial and resource costs of intensive nodal observation for a theoretically equivalent cohort were calculated.RESULTS: The cost of standard treatment was $7,147 per patient and the theoretical cost of nodal observation was $5,300 per patient. Standard treatment required more operating theatre time and inpatient treatment. Nodal observation required more outpatient appointments and imaging.CONCLUSIONS: The cost of nodal observation was lower than standard treatment than in our study. There is a shift in resource requirements from operating theatre and inpatient care to outpatient appointment and imaging. The overall resource impact is low and introduction of nodal observation appears achievable.

TI  - Subsequent injuries experienced by Maori: results from a 24-month prospective study in New Zealand
T2  - NEW ZEALAND MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - AIM: Maori, the indigenous population of New Zealand, experience a disproportionate burden of injury compared to non-Maori. Injury burden can be exacerbated by subsequent injuries (injuries that occur after, but not necessarily because of, an earlier or 'sentinel' injury). Despite obligations under New Zealand's Treaty of Waitangi, it appears no published studies have investigated subsequent injuries among Maori. This study aims to describe subsequent injuries experienced by Maori and reported to New Zealand's no-fault injury Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC), and determine: the number and timing of subsequent injury (SI) claims reported to ACC in 24 months following a sentinel injury; the proportions experiencing >= 1 SI; and the nature of SIs.METHODS: The Subsequent Injury Study analysed interview, ACC and hospital discharge data. SIs were classified as injury events involving an ACC claim within 24 months of a sentinel injury.RESULTS: Of 566 participants, 349 (62%) experienced >= 1 SI in the 24 months post-sentinel injury. Those with moderate/high alcohol use, or cognitive difficulties, before the sentinel injury were more likely to experience SIs. Fewer SIs occurred between 0-3 months after a sentinel injury compared to later periods. Spine dislocations/sprains/strains were the most common SI type.CONCLUSIONS: Despite their descriptive nature, our findings point to both the complexity of SI and the need for a greater research, ACC and health service focus on SI if the burden of injury for Maori is to be truly addressed. That 62% of Maori who had already experienced a profound sentinel injury went on to experience >= 1 SIs reported to ACC within a 24-month period suggests that the burden is considerable, and that preventive opportunities are being missed. Additional analyses are now underway to investigate factors predicting SI, while accounting for potential confounders, in order to assist in the development of SI prevention initiatives for Maori at multiple points in the complex post-injury pathway.

TI  - [Surveillance of epidemic factors of schistosomiasis in wetlands in Sichuan Province].
T2  - Zhongguo xue xi chong bing fang zhi za zhi = Chinese journal of schistosomiasis control
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemic factors of schistosomiasis in wetlands in Sichuan Province, so as to provide scientific evidence for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis in wetlands.METHODS: The artificial and natural wetlands were selected from Sichuan Province, and the relevant data regarding wetlands were collected. Routine snail survey, investigation on human morbidity due to schistosomiasis, snail diffusion experiments, questionnaire survey, determination of water infectivity and retrospective survey were conducted.RESULTS: In Sichuan Province, the mean densities of living snails were 0.003 snails/0.1 m2 and 2.033 snails/0.1 m2 in the upper and lower reaches of the Meiwan Reservoir wetlands, 0.08 snails/0.1 m2 in the Jinyan Lake of Guanghan City, 0.21 snails/0.1 m2 in Muhe River of Guanghan City, and 0.02 snails/0.1 m2 prior to the construction of Qiong-hai wetland park in Xichang City in 2015. Artificial simulation experiments showed that the largest distance of snail diffusion in water was 2 000 m. There were 8.80% (41/466) of subjects that lived neighboring wetlands, worked in wetlands and visited wet-lands having infested water contact behaviors. A total of 690 sentinel mice were assigned, and no Schistosoma japonicum infection was detected in the 677 mice dissected. Retrospective survey showed that the construction of the Meiwan Reservoir caused the spread of schistosomiasis in Dailing County, and snails were found in the ditches entering the Jinyan Lake and in Jinyan Lake areas 5 years following the construction of the Jinyan Lake in Guanghan City, with S. japonicum -infected snails detected in the ditches entering the Jinyan Lake.CONCLUSIONS: O. hupensis snails are found in some wetlands in Sichuan Province. Protection of wetlands and snail control with environmental improvements are recommended for the prevention of snail importation in natural wetlands, while in artificial wetlands, thorough snail control is recommended during the construction of the wetlands because of the likelihood of snail importation via water systems. In addition, both natural and artificial wetlands require long-term systematic surveillance of schistosomiasis.

T2  - LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hansen CH, Burian SJ, Dennison PE, Williams GP. 2019. Evaluating historical trends and influences of meteoorological and seasonal climate conditions on lake chlorophyll a using remote sensing. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. Evaluations of long-term water quality trends and patterns in lakes and reservoirs are often inhibited by irregular historical records. This study uses historical Landsat satellite imagery to construct a more complete historical record of algal biomass (measured via chlorophyll a [Chl-a]) and presents a framework for developing seasonal algal estimation models using open source tools for processing and model development. This approach is both physically based (using observed patterns of variability and algal succession in the lake) and data driven (relying on statistical methods for model development). We use a generalized linear regression modeling technique to develop lake-specific, seasonal models for each lake in the multilake Great Salt Lake system in Utah. The 32-yr constructed history of estimated Chl-a enables analysis of long-term trends within the lake system as well as evaluations of local climate influences on Chl-a concentrations. The estimated historical record exhibits a shift in seasonality (i.e., maximum Chl-a occurs earlier in the growing season), as well as increasing trends of extreme Chl-a concentrations. We also evaluated relationships between meteorological conditions and Chl-a using the enhanced historical record and found localized sensitivity to short-term weather events such as high wind, high temperatures, or precipitation events. Seasonal climate conditions including high winter precipitation, summer temperatures, and early spring snow water equivalent are consistent with higher Chl-a extremes in the historical record. Improved understanding of the trends and climate influences provides useful context and guidance for future monitoring efforts and management strategies.

TI  - Mortality rates among individuals diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV): an observational cohort study, England, 2008 to 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Monitoring trends in mortality for individuals diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are important as we expand treatment and move towards World Health Organization elimination targets. Aim: To estimate mortality rates for individuals aged >= 15 years diagnosed with HCV infection in England 2008-16. Methods: An observational cohort study whereby death certificate information was linked to the Sentinel Surveillance of Blood Borne Virus Testing in England. Age-sex standardised mortality rates (ASMR) for individuals diagnosed with HCV infection (2008-16) were calculated and compared to the general population. Results: Of 43,895 individuals with HCV infection, 2,656 (6.3%) died. All-cause ASMRs were 2,834.2 per 100,000 person years (PY), 2.3 times higher than in the general population. In individuals aged 30-69 years, all-cause mortality rates were 1,768.9 per 100,000 PY among individuals with HCV, 4.7 times higher than in the general population. ASMRs had not decreased between 2010 (2,992) and 2016 (2,340; p=0.10), with no change from 2014 (p = 0.058). ASMRs were 441.0 times higher for hepatitis, 34.4 times higher for liver cancer, 8.1 times higher for end stage liver disease and 6.4 times higher for external causes than in the general population. Conclusions: Mortality was higher in individuals with diagnosed HCV infection compared to the general population, highlighting health inequalities. There is a need to improve HCV diagnosis, engagement in care and treatment rates. The high mortality from external causes highlights the importance of integrated health and social care strategies and addressing the needs of this vulnerable population.

TI  - Tracking spatial-temporal landscape changes of impervious surface areas, bare lands, and inundation areas in China during 2001-2017
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient and timely quantification of landscape changes of urbanization, devegetation, and inundation in China is important for decision making in sustainable development. This study proposed a novel and automatic approach to track landscape changes in China based on 500 m 8-day composite MODIS datasets from 2001 to 2017. An overall accuracy of 94.09% was achieved on the basis of 5,178 references sites. Results showed that newly impervious surface areas (ISA), bare lands, and inundated water bodies accounted for 0.51%, 0.23%, and 0.25% of the total land area in China, respectively. Rapid urbanization transformation was observed with the average annual land urbanization rate of 9.53%, almost three-times higher than the global rate of urbanization. The speediest period of urbanization was exhibited in 2009 and 4,938.89 km(2) of newly formed ISA were generated in this single year. The most obvious period of devegetation, which converted vegetation to bare lands, was observed from 2006 to 2009, with 2000-2100 km(2) yr(-1). Urbanization and devegetation dominantly occurred in humid/semihumid regions (>85%), particularly in the Yangtze River Delta. The remarkable devegetation was strongly associated with newly ISA; however, significant reduction of devegetation was observed in arid/semiarid regions in 2010s. Besides one hotspot surrounding newly ISA, the other hotspot of inundation in remote highlands was highlighted and distinct reduction in inundation was evidenced after 2010. A free download link for these datasets is attached ().

T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system has been effective since January 2018. It has introduced some major changes in the localized/locoregional melanoma classification. However, it has not been demonstrated how this classification was validated on external, clinical data.Patients and methodsIn this retrospective study, we have included 2474 patients diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma in localized or locoregional stage. They were treated surgically in our Center between years 1998 and 2014. Melanoma-specific and overall survival were calculated for each stage according to TNM7 and TNM8 using Kaplan-Meier estimator.ResultsThe melanoma-specific survival rates in our patients were similar to those reported from original cohort used to build TNM8 classification except for stage IIIC (5-year melanoma-specific survival 44.6% vs 51.8%, respectively for TNM7 vs TNM8).ConclusionOur study validated the eighth edition of TNM melanoma staging system as a viable tool in prognosis of the long-term survival of patients with localized or locoregionally advanced melanoma on an independent cohort. The new TNM 8 system has brought important improvements in prognostic assessment for melanoma patients. Deeper understanding of the significance of satellite/in-transit lesions may be required.

TI  - Seismic behavior of Q690 circular HCFTST columns under constant axial loading and reversed cyclic lateral loading
T2  - STEEL AND COMPOSITE STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an investigation on seismic behavior of out-of-code Q690 circular high-strength concrete-filled thin-walled steel tubular (HCFTST) columns made up of high-strength (HS) steel tubes (yield strength f(y) >= 690 MPa). Eight Q690 circular HCFTST columns with various diameter-to-thickness (D/t) ratios, concrete cylinder compressive strengths (f(c)) and axial compression ratios (n) were tested under the constant axial loading and reversed cyclic lateral loading. The obtained lateral load-displacement hysteretic curves, energy dissipation, skeleton curves and ductility, and stiffness degradation were analyzed in detail to reflect the influences of tested parameters. Subsequently, a simplified shear strength model was derived and validated by the test results. Finally, a finite element analysis (FEA) model incorporating a stress triaxiality dependent fracture criterion was established to simulate the seismic behavior. The systematic investigation indicates the following: compared to the D/t ratio and axial compression ratio, improving the concrete compressive strength (e.g., the HS thin-walled steel tube filled with HS concrete) had a slight influence on the ductility but an obvious enhancement of energy dissipation and peak load; the simplified shear strength model based on truss mechanism accurately predicted the shear-resisting capacity; and the established FEA model incorporating steel fracture criterion simulated well the seismic behavior (e.g., hysteretic curve, local buckling and fracture), which can be applied to the seismic analysis and design of Q690 circular HCFTST columns.

TI  - Estimation of influenza- and respiratory syncytial virus-attributable medically attended acute respiratory infections in Germany, 2010/11-2017/18
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The burden of influenza in primary care is difficult to assess, since most patients with symptoms of a respiratory infection are not tested. The case definition of "medically attended acute respiratory infection" (MAARI) in the German physician sentinel is sensitive; however, it requires modelling techniques to derive estimates of disease attributable to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Objectives The objective of this paper was to review and extend our previously published model in order to estimate the burden of RSV and the differential burden of the two influenza B lineages (Victoria, Yamagata) as well as both influenza A subtypes on primary care visits. Methods Data on MAARI and virological results of respiratory samples (virological sentinel) were available from 2010/11 until 2017/18. We updated the previously published generalized additive regression model to include RSV. Results We found that the proportion of MAARI due to RSV is substantial only in the 0-1- and 2-4-year-old age groups (0-1 years old: median 7.5%, range 4.0%-14.8%; 2-4 years old: median 6.5%, range 4.0%-10.3%); in the 0-1 years old age group, RSV leads in almost all seasons to a higher burden than any influenza type or subtype, but this is reversed in the age group 2-4 years old. Conclusions We succeeded in rearranging our previously published model on MAARI to incorporate RSV as well as the two influenza B lineages (Victoria, Yamagata) in the time period 2010 to 2018.

TI  - Monitoring the seasonal dynamics of soil salinization in the Yellow River delta of China using Landsat data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In regions with distinct seasons, soil salinity usually varies greatly by season. Thus, the seasonal dynamics of soil salinization must be monitored to prevent and control soil salinity hazards and to reduce ecological risk. This article took the Kenli District in the Yellow River delta (YRD) of China as the experimental area. Based on Landsat data from spring and autumn, improved vegetation indices (IVIs) were created and then applied to inversion modeling of the soil salinity content (SSC) by employing stepwise multiple linear regression, back propagation neural network and support vector machine methods. Finally, the optimal SSC model in each season was extracted, and the spatial distributions and seasonal dynamics of SSC within a year were analyzed. The results indicated that the SSC varied by season in the YRD, and the support vector machine method offered the best SSC inversion models for the precision of the calibration set (R-2 > 0.72, RMSE < 6.34 g kg(-1)) and the validation set (R-2 > 0.71, RMSE < 6.00 g kg(-1) and RPD > 1.66). The best SSC inversion model for spring could be applied to the SSC inversion in winter (R-2 of 0.66), and the best model for autumn could be applied to the SSC inversion in summer (R-2 of 0.65). The SSC exhibited a gradual increasing trend from the southwest to northeast in the Kenli District. The SSC also underwent the following seasonal dynamics: soil salinity accumulated in spring, decreased in summer, increased in autumn and reached its peak at the end of winter. This work provides data support for the control of soil salinity hazards and utilization of saline-alkali soil in the YRD.

TI  - Organic ultraviolet filters in nearshore waters and in the invasive lionfish (<i>Pterois volitans</i>) in Grenada, West Indies
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sunscreens and other personal care products use organic ultraviolet (UV) filters such as oxybenzone, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, Padimate-O, and octyl methoxycinnamate to prevent damage to human skin. While these compounds are effective at preventing sunburn, they have a demonstrated negative effect on cells and tissues across taxonomic levels. These compounds have a relatively short half-life in seawater but are continuously reintroduced via recreational activities and wastewater discharge, making them environmentally persistent. Because of this, testing seawater samples for the presence of these compounds may not be reflective of their abundance in the environment. Bioaccumulation of organic ultraviolet filters in a high-trophic level predator may provide greater insight to the presence and persistence of these compounds. To address this, the present study collected seawater samples as well as muscle and stomach content samples from the invasive Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans) in the nearshore waters of Grenada, West Indies to examine the use of lionfish as potential bioindicator species. Seawater and lionfish samples were collected at four sites that are near point sources of wastewater discharge and that receive a high number of visitors each year. Samples were tested for the presence and concentrations of oxybenzone, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), Padimate-O, and octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Oxybenzone residues were detected in 60% of seawater samples and OMC residues were detected in 20% of seawater samples. Seawater samples collected in the surface waters near Grenada's main beach had oxybenzone concentrations more than ten times higher than seawater samples collected in less frequently visited areas and the highest prevalence of UV filters in lionfish. Residues of oxybenzone were detected in 35% of lionfish muscle and 4-MBC residues were detected in 12% of lionfish muscle. Padimate-O was not detected in either seawater or lion fish samples. No organic UV filters were detected in lionfish stomach contents. Histopathologic examination of lionfish demonstrated no significant findings attributed to UV filter toxicity. These findings report UV filter residue levels for the first time in inshore waters in Grenada. Results indicate that lionfish may be bioaccumulating residues and may be a useful sentinel model for monitoring organic ultraviolet filters in the Caribbean Sea.

TI  - Mistaking the Map for the Territory: What Does the History of Bannerghatta National Park, India, Tell us about the Study of Institutions?
T2  - SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article traces the history of Bannerghatta National Park (BNP), a deciduous forest south of Bengaluru city, India that is undergoing rapid socio-ecological transformations. Using remotely sensed data combined with interviews, oral histories and archival material we map the changing landscape to discern continuity and change in BNP across pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial periods. Our findings show that complexity is historically contingent and is core to the understanding of contemporary forest governance challenges. Legacies of past social structures such as caste remain a visible presence in the landscape and affect institutional functioning significantly. Our findings also uncover the role of exogenous factors such as the park's peri-urban location and post-liberalization policies in adversely affecting "rules-in-use". A historical approach can offer analysts better grounded and "situated" understandings of the complex interplay between institutions (formal, informal, traditional, modern) and the patterned social practices operating in natural resource systems.

TI  - A study on harmonizing total ozone assimilation with multiple sensors
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bias estimations and corrections of total column measurements are applied and evaluated with ozone data from satellite instruments providing near-real-time products during summer 2014 and 2015 and winter 2015. The developed standalone bias-correction system can be applied in near-real-time chemical data assimilation and long-term reanalysis. The instruments to which these bias corrections were applied include the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 instruments on the MetOp-A and MetOpB satellites (GOME-2A and GOME-2B), the total column ozone mapping instrument of the Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS-NM) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite, and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) instrument on the Aura research satellite. The OMI data set based on the TOMS version 8.5 retrieval algorithm was chosen as the reference used in the bias correction of the other satellite-based total column ozone data sets. OMI data were chosen for this purpose instead of ground-based observations due to OMI's significantly better spatial and temporal coverage, as well as interest in near-realtime assimilation. Ground-based Brewer and Dobson spectrophotometers, and filter ozonometers, as well as the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet satellite instrument (SBUV/2), served as independent validation sources of total column ozone data. Regional and global mean differences of the OMI-TOMS data with measurements from the three ground-based instrument types for the three evaluated 2-month periods were found to be within 1 %, except for the polar regions, where the largest differences from the comparatively small data set in Antarctica exceeded 3 %. Values from SBUV/2 summed partial columns were typically larger than OMI-TOMS on average by 0.6% to 1.2 %, with smaller differences than with ground-based observations over Antarctica. Bias corrections as a function of latitude and solar zenith angle were performed for GOME-2A/B and OMPS-NM using colocation with OMI-TOMS and three variants of differences with short-term model forecasts. These approaches were shown to yield residual biases of less than 1 %, with the rare exceptions associated with bins with less data. These results were compared to a time-independent bias-correction estimation that used colocations as a function of ozone effective temperature and solar zenith angle which, for the time period examined, resulted in larger residual biases for bins whose bias varies more in time.The impact of assimilating total column ozone data from single and multiple satellite data sources with and without bias correction was examined with a version of the Environment and Climate Change Canada variational assimilation and forecasting system. Assimilation experiments for July-August 2014 show a reduction of global mean biases for short-term forecasts relative to ground-based Brewer and Dobson observations from a maximum of about 2.3% in the absence of bias correction to less than 0.3% in size when bias correction is included. Both temporally averaged and time-varying mean differences of forecasts with OMI-TOMS were reduced to within 1% for nearly all cases when bias-corrected observations are assimilated for the latitudes where satellite data are present.Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License and the OGL are interoperable and do not conflict with, reduce or limit each other.

TI  - Incidence estimation from sentinel surveillance data; a simulation study and application to data from the Belgian laboratory sentinel surveillance
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInverse probability weighting (IPW) methods can be used to estimate the total number of cases from the sample collected through sentinel surveillance. Central to these methods are the inverse weights which can be derived in several ways and, in this case, represent the probability that laboratory (lab) sentinel surveillance detects a lab-confirmed case.MethodsWe compare different weights in a simulation study. Weights are obtained from the proportion of participating labs over all labs. We adjust these weights for attractiveness and density of labs over population. The market share of sentinel labs, as estimated by the econometric Huff-model, is also considered. Additionally, we investigate the effect of not recognizing sentinel labs as sentinel labs when they report no cases. We estimate the bias associated with the different weights as the difference between the simulated number of cases and the estimate of this total from the sentinel sample.As motivating data examples, we apply an extended Huff-model to four pathogens under laboratory sentinel surveillance in Belgium between 2010 and 2015 and discuss the model fit. We estimate the total number of lab-confirmed cases associated with Rotavirus, influenza virus, Y. enterocolitica and Campylobacter spp.. The extended Huff-model takes the lab-concept, the number of reimbursements and the number of departments, lab-density, regional borders, distance and competition between labs in account.ResultsEstimates obtained with the Huff-model were most accurate in the more complex simulation scenarios as compared to other weights. In the data examples, several significant coefficients are identified, but the fit of the Huff-model to the Belgian sentinel surveillance data leaves much variability in market shares unexplained.ConclusionThe Huff-model allows for estimation of the spatial and population coverage of sentinel surveillance and through IPW-methods also for the estimation of the total number of cases. The Huff-models gravity function allows us to differentiate inside an area while estimating from the full dataset. Our data examples show that additional data on the participation to surveillance and practices of labs is necessary for a more accurate estimation.

TI  - Intersectionality of Cultural Identities in Health Psychology: Key Recommendations for Working With African-Caribbean Immigrant Women
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - While the field of health psychology has progressed over the years, much work still needs to be done when considering immigrants' health care and well-being. Particularly, for African-Caribbean immigrants, the intersectionality of their cultural identities in the health care system require much attention moving forward. Therefore, this article is particularly relevant for Canada's multicultural society; it describes cultural identity reconstruction within health psychology as a common issue for diverse groups, particularly African-Caribbean immigrant women. The article speaks to the holistic worldview that is required in a paradigm shift which engages a pluralistic society that is Canada. The author presents a key cultural identity model and assessment tool that should be integrated into the health care system to ensure culturally-sensitive and inclusive care for immigrants, especially women. As is argued in the article, contemporary research, advocacy, and social movements speak to invoking alternative ways to complement the prevailing downstream approach to health psychology. In a growing multicultural society that should strive on honoring and respecting the pluralistic cultural worldviews of all people in the health care system, many immigrant women struggle to cope with the social determinants of health post-migration. Their concerns are often pushed to the margins of health care services, with several individuals relying on their faith for coping strategies. This article concludes with culturally-informed and socially-just recommendations for health care professionals working with immigrant populations, particularly African Caribbean immigrant women.

TI  - Serological evidence of bluetongue virus infection and serotype distribution in dairy cattle in South Korea
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBluetongue is a vector-borne viral disease, and bluetongue virus (BTV) outbreaks can cause substantial economic losses. Even subclinical infection may carry significant associated costs, including a loss of condition, reduced milk yield, and infertility and abortion, and indirect costs, largely due to the export restrictions and surveillance requirements imposed to limit the spread of the virus. However, the BTV epidemiology in the Far East remains incompletely understood, especially in the cattle population in South Korea. In this study, the seroprevalence of BTV antibodies and distribution of BTV serotypes in dairy cattle in South Korea were evaluated to improve the understanding of the BTV epidemiological situation in the Asia-Pacific region.ResultsBetween 2012 and 2013, a total of 37 out of 171 dairy cattle herds (21.6%) and 85 out of 466 dairy cattle heads (18.2%) showed antibodies against BTV. Neutralizing antibodies to BTV-1, -2, -3, -4, -7, -15, and-16 serotypes were identified, and the RNAs of the BTV-1, -2, -3, -15, and-16 serotypes were detected, indicating that BTV was circulating in the dairy cattle population in South Korea.ConclusionsThese findings indicate that BTV is widespread and has circulated in dairy cattle in South Korea. This is the first report presenting evidence of circulating antibodies against BTV and the serotype distribution in bovine populations in South Korea.

TI  - MODIS-Derived Arctic Melt Season Fog and Low Stratus over East Greenland Glaciers and the Ice Sheet
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In a first attempt to quantify fog over vast snow and ice surfaces, we present the horizontal and vertical spatial extent of significant melt-season fog events over East Greenland glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet. Two established MODIS fog classification methods are adjusted for use in Arctic glacierized regions and applied to Terra-MODIS Collection 6 Level 1B scenes and Level 2 cloud products. In a 6-step procedure, we process these products in combination with a digital elevation model and glacier extents to separate fog from low stratus over glaciers. The procedure was optimized using Landsat 7 and ground observations and verified with concurrent CloudSat-CALIPSO very low-level clouds. The MODIS-derived end products are 500-m resolution fog and low stratus mask maps over East Greenland with associated fog statistics. Six days throughout the 2002-2007 melt season are mapped, revealing maximum fog extent in July-August covering 20,000-70,000 km(2) of glacier surface. Mean fog thickness is similar to 200 m and maximum inland extent of continuous fog similar to 100 km, although patches occur high on the ice sheet. Our method and results will aid in cloud change detection and in the quantification of cloud radiative forcing and thermal effects over snow and ice surfaces.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma is a malignant tumor derived from the skin and mucous membrane, the epidemiological data showed that the incidence of melanoma elevated rapidly in the last decade. Early lymph node metastasis is a distinguishing characteristic of melanoma. The assessment of regional lymph nodes is a vital factor for melanoma staging and comprehensive therapeutic strategies. The sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) plays an important role in this comprehensive diagnosis and treatment system. Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) with positive sentinel lymph node was accepted by traditional theories. But it has recently been questioned via the latest global clinical trial. CLND limited the benefit for melanoma specific survival. However, SLNB is the reliable procedure for staging and prognostic evaluation of melanoma patients with positive sentinel lymph node, and CLND can significantly improve the local control and decrease the regional recurrence according to the evidence-based medicine. The authors summary the recently correlational research of SLNB and CLND in melanoma in this review.
AB  - 黑色素瘤是主要发生于皮肤和黏膜的恶性肿瘤，近10年来，其发病率增长较快，生物学行为表现为早期出现淋巴结转移。区域淋巴结的评估是黑色素瘤分期的关键因素，对于综合治疗策略和区域淋巴结治疗具有重要指导意义，前哨淋巴结活检(SLNB)在淋巴结判定上优势显著。传统理论认为，前哨淋巴结阳性患者应行区域淋巴结清扫(CLND)，但是最新的临床试验证据对此似乎提出了质疑，CLND对于黑色素瘤疾病特异性生存率无获益，但是对于前哨淋巴结阳性患者，进行CLND能提高患者的局部控制率。SLNB对于指导黑色素瘤分期和预后的价值，以及CLND对于区域淋巴结的控制已经有循证医学的证据支持，文章就黑色素瘤前哨淋巴结活检和CLND的相关研究进行了分析。.

TI  - Leaf Area Index Estimation in a Heterogeneous Grassland Using Optical, SAR, and DEM Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Different types of remote sensing data, including optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and digital elevation model (DEM), have been used to investigate diverse vegetation properties in grasslands. However, it is not known if integrating these data can improve investigation accuracy and how much of a contribution that each of these data can make to the investigation. In this research, WorldView-2, Sentinel-1, and DEM data are used to estimate vegetation leaf area index (LAI) in a heterogeneous grassland in Canada. From the 3 types of data, 121 optical, 13 SAR, and 7 DEM variables were extracted. Four combinations of the variables, including optical, optical + SAR, optical + DEM, and optical + SAR + DEM, were designed and used to evaluate the contribution of each type of data to the LAI estimation. Four random forest models using these 4 combinations of variables were established to estimate LAI. Results show that the first model built with only optical variables achieved a good accuracy (R-2 = 0.630, RMSE = 0.701) that is comparable to other studies. Integrating SAR and DEM variables with optical variables improved LAI estimation accuracy, but not substantially. SAR data's marginal contribution is likely a result of the heterogeneous nature of the grassland ecosystem.

TI  - Retrieving Aerosol Characteristics From the PACE Mission, Part 1: Ocean Color Instrument
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Clouds, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite mission is scheduled to launch in 2022, with the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) on board. For the first time reflected sunlight from the Earth across a broad spectrum from the ultraviolet (UV: 350 nm) to the short wave infrared (SWIR: 2260 nm) will be measured from a single instrument at 1 km spatial resolution. While seven discrete bands will represent the SWIR, the spectrum from 350 to 890 nm will be continuously covered with a spectral resolution of 5 nm. OCI will thus combine in a single instrument (and at an enhanced spatial resolution for the UV) the heritage capabilities of the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), while covering the oxygen A-band (O2A). Designed for ocean color and ocean biology retrievals, OCI also enables continuation of heritage satellite aerosol products and the development of new aerosol characterization from space. In particular the combination of MODIS and OMI characteristics allows deriving aerosol height, absorption and optical depth along with a measure of particle size distribution. This is achieved by using the traditional MODIS visible-to-SWIR wavelengths to constrain spectral aerosol optical depth and particle size. Extrapolating this information to the UV channels allows retrieval of aerosol absorption and layer height. A more direct method to derive aerosol layer height makes use of O2A absorption methods, despite the relative coarseness of the nominal 5 nm spectral resolution of OCI. Altogether the PACE mission with OCI will be an unprecedented opportunity for aerosol characterization that will continue climate data records from the past decades and propel aerosol science forward toward new opportunities.

TI  - Predicting the extent of nodal involvement for node positive breast cancer patients: Development and validation of a novel tool
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study aimed to develop an easy to use prediction model to predict the risk of having a total of 1 to 2, >= 3, or >= 4 positive axillary lymph nodes (LNs), for patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) positive breast cancer. Methods Data of 911 SLN positive breast cancer patients were used for model development. The model was validated externally in an independent population of 180 patients with SLN positive breast cancer. Results Final pathology after ALND showed additional positive LN for 259 (28%) of the patients. A total of 726 (81%) out of 911 patients had a total of 1 to 2 positive nodes, whereas 175 (19%) had >= 3 positive LNs. The model included three predictors: the tumor size (in mm), the presence of a negative SLN, and the size of the SLN metastases (in mm). At external validation, the model showed a good discriminative ability (area under the curve = 0.82; 95% confidence interval = 0.74-0.90) and good calibration over the full range of predicted probabilities. Conclusion This new and validated model predicts the extent of nodal involvement in node-positive breast cancer and will be useful for counseling patients regarding their personalized axillary treatment.

TI  - Safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Preoperative systemic therapy (PST) including neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer (BC) is used nowadays on a large scale especially in aggressive BC subtypes. The use of NAC in BC may be associated with some safety issues and hazards including possible increased rate of locoregional recurrence, inadequate staging with subsequent over or under-treatment, and surgical complications. Areas covered: This review article aims to discuss these concerns and to clarify the adequate steps and procedures needed to increase safety and alleviate the possible drawbacks of NAC. The author will discuss the adequate and meticulous technical procedures needed to stage and localize the breast tumor, detect any affected axillary lymph node, improve the accuracy and safety of doing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NAC, estimate the tumor response to NAC to determine the extent of surgery, and enhance the precise documentation of pCR. Expert opinion: The use of breast MRI, image-detectable clips in the tumor bed, dual technique during SLNB, and target axillary dissection are among the required steps to maintain safety. In the future, ongoing prospective trials will allow us to select patients who can safely avoid breast and/or axillary surgery after systemic therapy.

TI  - The serologic investigation and viral isolation of bluetongue virus in Shangri-La in Southwest China
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Bluetongue is an arthropod-borne viral disease of ruminants caused by bluetongue virus (BTV). In China, BTV is relatively common in Yunnan Province with the exception of northern regions around Shangri-La, where the average altitude is approximately 3,450 metres. Recently, the seroprevalence of BTV has been measured in yaks in Shangri-La; therefore, this study investigated BTV infections in this area. The serological investigation in five villages in Shangri-La showed that there were sporadic BTV infections in yaks (20 of 507 positive) during 2014 to 2017, while the seroprevalence of BTV at three goat farms in a nearby river valley was 35%-65% in 2017. Subsequently, 20 sentinel goats were kept on two separate farms in the river valley and monitored for seroconversion between May and September of 2017. Five of the sentinel animals were tested positive for antibodies to BTV by C-ELISA during the study period, and 13 BTV isolates were isolated from ten sentinel animals. All isolates were identified as the same serotype, and the complete nucleotide sequence of one was determined. The genomic sequences showed that the isolated BTV strain belonged to serotype 21 and had approximately 99.8%-100% homology with three Indonesian BTV-21 strains (D151, RIVS-66 and RIVS-60) between their coding sequences (CDSs) except for Seg4 (99.5%). Besides, our data suggested that this BTV-21 strain might have also infected some local yaks and sheep.

TI  - The role of abiotic mechanisms of long-distance dispersal in the American origin of the Galapagos flora
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Long-distance dispersal research in plants has long been dominated by the assumption that an association between plant diaspore adaptations and related transport vectors (standard dispersal) determines the success of colonization. However, the role of diaspore adaptations in a biogeographic context is being increasingly questioned, as evidence reveals that unspecialized plants have been successful colonizers by recurrent non-standard dispersal. We studied wind and oceanic currents as vectors for long-distance plant dispersal between the Americas and the Galapagos Islands with the focus on diaspore specializations to gain knowledge on the net contribution of standard and non-standard dispersal mechanisms. Location Eastern Pacific Ocean: the American continent and Galapagos. Major taxa studied Non-endemic angiosperms native to Galapagos and the American continent. Methods We used connectivity models for prevailing wind and ocean currents based on satellite data to explore the correspondence between connectivity and species distribution patterns. Using a randomization test to eliminate the effect of wind and current directionality, we evaluated whether the proportion of species that is more connected than randomly expected varies for the five diaspore specialization groups. Results We found that a large percentage of the plants are present in areas of the continent where ocean current connectivity with the archipelago is higher than expected by chance, while the percentage is small for areas with high wind connectivity. We did not find correspondence between species long-distance dispersal specialization and the connectivity provided by either of the two abiotic vectors. Main conclusions Our results of ocean current connectivity - over wind connectivity - lead us to hypothesize that rafting dispersal has been significant in connecting the biota of Central/South America and the Galapagos Islands. This result supports a more prominent role of non-standard dispersal mechanisms in a biogeographic context than accepted in traditional schemes.

TI  - Comparing temperature data sources for use in species distribution models: From in-situ logging to remote sensing
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Although species distribution models (SDMs) traditionally link species occurrences to free-air temperature data at coarse spatio-temporal resolution, the distribution of organisms might instead be driven by temperatures more proximal to their habitats. Several solutions are currently available, such as downscaled or interpolated coarse-grained free-air temperatures, satellite-measured land surface temperatures (LST) or in-situ-measured soil temperatures. A comprehensive comparison of temperature data sources and their performance in SDMs is, however, currently lacking. Location Northern Scandinavia. Time period 1970-2017. Major taxa studied Higher plants. Methods We evaluated different sources of temperature data (WorldClim, CHELSA, MODIS, E-OBS, topoclimate and soil temperature from miniature data loggers), differing in spatial resolution (from 1 '' to 0.1 degrees), measurement focus (free-air, ground-surface or soil temperature) and temporal extent (year-long versus long-term averages), and used them to fit SDMs for 50 plant species with different growth forms in a high-latitudinal mountain region. Results Differences between these temperature data sources originating from measurement focus and temporal extent overshadow the effects of temporal climatic differences and spatio-temporal resolution, with elevational lapse rates ranging from -0.6 degrees C per 100 m for long-term free-air temperature data to -0.2 degrees C per 100 m for in-situ soil temperatures. Most importantly, we found that the performance of the temperature data in SDMs depended on the growth forms of species. The use of in-situ soil temperatures improved the explanatory power of our SDMs (R-2 on average +16%), especially for forbs and graminoids (R-2 +24 and +21% on average, respectively) compared with the other data sources. Main conclusions We suggest that future studies using SDMs should use the temperature dataset that best reflects the ecology of the species, rather than automatically using coarse-grained data from WorldClim or CHELSA.

TI  - Comparison of different sequential assimilation algorithms for satellite-derived leaf area index using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (version Lanai)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a crucial parameter for understanding the exchanges of mass and energy between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. In this study, the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) has been successfully coupled to the Community Land Model with explicit carbon and nitrogen components (CLM4CN) by assimilating Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI data. Within this framework, four sequential assimilation algorithms, including the kernel filter (KF), the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the ensemble adjust Kalman filter (EAKF), and the particle filter (PF), are thoroughly analyzed and compared. The results show that assimilating GLASS LAI into the CLM4CN is an effective method for improving model performance. In detail, the assimilation accuracies of the EnKF and EAKF algorithms are better than those of the KF and PF algorithm. From the perspective of the average and RMSD, the PF algorithm performs worse than the EAKF and EnKF algorithms because of the gradually reduced acceptance of observations with assimilation steps. In other words, the contribution of the observations to the posterior probability during the assimilation process is reduced. The EAKF algorithm is the best method because the matrix is adjusted at each time step during the assimilation procedure. If all the observations are accepted, the analyzed LAI seem to be better than that when some observations are rejected, especially in low-latitude regions.

TI  - Towards monitoring localized CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from space: co-located regional CO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> enhancements observed by the OCO-2 and S5P satellites
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite its key role in climate change, large uncertainties persist in our knowledge of the anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and no global observing system exists that allows us to monitor emissions from localized CO2 sources with sufficient accuracy. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite allows retrievals of the column-average dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2). However, regional column-average enhancements of individual point sources are usually small, compared to the background concentration and its natural variability, and often not much larger than the satellite's measurement noise. This makes the unambiguous identification and quantification of anthropogenic emission plume signals challenging. NO2 is co-emitted with CO2 when fossil fuels are combusted at high temperatures. It has a short lifetime on the order of hours so that NO2 columns often greatly exceed background and noise levels of modern satellite sensors near sources, which makes it a suitable tracer of recently emitted CO2. Based on six case studies (Moscow, Russia; Lipetsk, Russia; Baghdad, Iraq; Medupi and Matimba power plants, South Africa; Australian wildfires; and Nanjing, China), we demonstrate the usefulness of simultaneous satellite observations of NO2 and XCO2. For this purpose, we analyze co-located regional enhancements of XCO2 observed by OCO-2 and NO2 from the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite and estimate the CO2 plume's cross-sectional fluxes. We take advantage of the nearly simultaneous NO2 measurements with S5P's wide swath and small measurement noise by identifying the source of the observed XCO2 enhancements, excluding interference with remote upwind sources, allowing us to adjust the wind direction, and by constraining the shape of the CO2 plumes. We compare the inferred cross-sectional fluxes with the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), the Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide (ODIAC), and, in the case of the Australian wildfires, with the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED). The inferred cross-sectional fluxes range from 31 MtCO(2) a(-1) to 153 MtCO(2) a(-1) with uncertainties (1 sigma) between 23% and 72 %. For the majority of analyzed emission sources, the estimated cross-sectional fluxes agree, within their uncertainty, with either EDGAR or ODIAC or lie somewhere between them. We assess the contribution of multiple sources of uncertainty and find that the dominating contributions are related to the computation of the effective wind speed normal to the plume's cross section. The flux uncertainties are expected to be reduced by the planned European Copernicus anthropogenic CO2 monitoring mission (CO2M), which will provide not only precise measurements with high spatial resolution but also imaging capabilities with a wider swath of simultaneous XCO2 and NO2 observations. Such a mission, particularly if performed by a constellation of satellites, will deliver CO2 emission estimates from localized sources at an unprecedented frequency and level of accuracy.

TI  - The potential of satellite greenness to predict plant diversity among wetland types, ecoregions, and disturbance levels
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedented global biodiversity loss has massive implications for the capacity of ecosystems to maintain functions critical to human well-being, urgently calling for rapid, scalable, and reproducible strategies for biodiversity monitoring, particularly in threatened ecosystems with difficult field access such as wetlands. Remote sensing indicators of spectral variability and greenness may predict the diversity of plant communities based on their optical diversity; however, most evidence is based on narrowband spectral data or terrestrial ecosystems. We investigate how spectral greenness and heterogeneity from publicly available broadband multi-spectral Landsat satellite imagery explain variation in vegetation diversity across different wetland types, ecoregions, and disturbance levels using 1,138 sites surveyed by U.S. EPA's National Wetland Condition Assessment. We found positive correlations of plant species richness and diversity with indicators of annual maximum spectral greenness and its spatial heterogeneity, explaining up to 43% variation within the global sample, 48% within wetland types or ecoregions, and up to 61% with abiotic covariates. The combined effect of spectral greenness and heterogeneity was stronger than the best-performing model using climatic, topographic, and edaphic factors alone. When compared among major U.S. watersheds and individual states, the fit of diversity-greenness models increased when more wetland types were included within the corresponding region's boundaries, up to 61% at the watershed and 77% at the state level, respectively, for diversity models and up to 73% and 80%, respectively, for richness models. Model outliers were characterized by a significantly greater diversity of nonnative species (P < 0.0001), suggesting that changes in model performance and greenness distributions could be used as indicators of shifts in plant community composition, particularly in tidal wetlands making the majority of outliers with significantly lower than predicted diversity. This study represents a first-time national-scale effort to use publicly available remote sensing, climatic, and topographic data to predict plant diversity in wetlands, which tend to be understudied compared to terrestrial ecosystems despite being among the most stressed ecosystems on Earth. Our study suggests that multi-temporal broadband satellite imagery could provide a low-cost assessment of regional and national wetland biodiversity for prioritization of conservation efforts and early detection of biodiversity loss.

TI  - Two-dimensional spatial heterodyne spectrometer for atmospheric nitrogen dioxide observations
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - A broadband monolithic spatial heterodyne spectrometer (SHS) system is built for measuring nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere based on our newly developed fabrication technique. This system is calibrated and tested with Hg, Kr and Xe lamps, as well as monochromator output illuminated by a high-voltage Xe lamp (as a white light source). The obtained overall efficiency profile presents an effective spectral range of 425-495 nm (when the efficiency values are greater than 40%). The maximum fringe visibility is similar to 0.85. The measured instrumental line shape function gives an actual spectral resolution of similar to 0.073 nm. The effect of phase distortion of this 2-D SHS system can be neglected. Direct solar-irradiance spectra in the NO2 absorption band were measured with the SHS system. The measured spectra are consistent with the results simulated by Modtran6 within the SHS spectral range. The vertical column contents of NO2, VC(NO2), derived from the SHS data by the direct sun - differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DS-DOAS) method coincide closely with the simultaneously acquired (OMI) satellite data.

TI  - Associated Determinants of Surface Urban Heat Islands across 1449 Cities in China
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal environment is closely related to human well-being. Determinants of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) have been extensively studied. Nevertheless, some research fields remain blank or have conflicting findings, which need to be further addressed. Particularly, few studies focus on drivers of SUHIs in massive cities with different sizes under various contexts at large scales. Using multisource data, we explored 11 determinants of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) for 1449 cities in different ecological contexts throughout China in 2010, adopting the Spearman and partial correlation analysis and machine learning method. The main results were as follows: (1) Significant positive partial correlations existed between daytime SUHII and the differences in nighttime light intensity and built-up intensity between cities and their corresponding villages except in arid or semiarid western China. The differences in the enhanced vegetation index were generally partially negatively correlated with daytime and nighttime SUHII. The differences in white sky albedo were usually partially negatively correlated with nighttime SUHII. The mean air temperature was partially positively correlated with nighttime SUHII in 40% of cases. Only a few significant partial relationships existed between SUHII and urban area, total population, and differences in aerosol optical depth. The explanation rates during daytime were larger than during nighttime in 72% of cases. The largest and smallest rates occurred during summer days in humid cold northeastern China (63.84%) and in southern China (10.44%), respectively. (2) Both the daytime and nighttime SUHII could be well determined by drivers using the machine learning method. The RMSE ranged from 0.49 degrees C to 1.54 degrees C at a national scale. The simulation SUHII values were always significantly correlated with the actual SUHII values. The simulation accuracies were always higher during nighttime than daytime. The highest accuracies occurred in central-northern China and were lowest in western China during both daytime and nighttime.

TI  - Remote sensing of coastal vegetation: Dealing with high species turnover by mapping multiple floristic gradients
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Mapping gradual transitions in plant species composition via a combination of ordination and regression from remote sensing data is becoming an established approach. However, straightforward analysis of areas with high species turnover rates may result in a loss of information since a high level of generalization is required. In this study, we investigate whether analysis of more homogeneous subsets, in contrast to processing of the complete dataset, is a viable approach to mapping multiple floristic gradients. Location The coastal nature reserve "Zwin" (Belgium). Methods The measured dataset is partitioned into more homogeneous subsets based upon species composition using hierarchical classification. The dataset and subsets are then processed separately. First, ordination is performed to extract floristic gradients in plant species composition; second, these gradients are related to airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data through regression models and mapped by projecting these models on image data. Regression validation and Mantel tests are used to compare the results within the study and to other studies. Results Hierarchical classification resulted in two homogeneous vegetation subsets. Ordination yielded four gradients in the area and all regression models compared favorably to similar studies in other areas with R-2 values ranging from 0.47 to 0.74. The Mantel test showed that by dividing the dataset into subsets, higher resemblance to the original vegetation data can be achieved. Conclusion We showed that mapping gradual transitions in plant species composition across multiple subsets sampled from one measured vegetation dataset is a promising approach for retrospective analysis of areas with high species turnover rates. In addition to potential improvements in performance, this complementary analysis enables mapping of additional gradients, suggesting that all conventionally predicted maps remain available, valuable, and necessary for thorough understanding of plant species composition.

TI  - Recent advances in nuclear and hybrid detection modalities for image-guided surgery
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF MEDICAL DEVICES
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Radioguided surgery is an ever-evolving part of nuclear medicine. In fact, this nuclear medicine sub-discipline actively bridges non-invasive molecular imaging with surgical care. Next to relying on the availability of radio- and bimodal-tracers, the success of radioguided surgery is for a large part dependent on the imaging modalities and imaging concepts available for the surgical setting. With this review, we have aimed to provide a comprehensive update of the most recent advances in the field. Areas covered: We have made an attempt to cover all aspects of radioguided surgery: 1) the use of radioisotopes that emit gamma, beta(+), and/or beta(-) radiation, 2) hardware developments ranging from probes to 2D cameras and even the use of advanced 3D interventional imaging solutions, and 3) multiplexing solutions such as dual-isotope detection or combined radionuclear and optical detection. Expertopinion: Technical refinements in the field of radioguided surgery should continue to focus on supporting its implementation in the increasingly complex minimally invasive surgical setting, e.g. by accommodating robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. In addition, hybrid concepts that integrate the use of radioisotopes with other image-guided surgery modalities such as fluorescence or ultrasound are likely to expand in the future.

TI  - Monitoring irrigation water use over paddock scales using climate data and landsat observations
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigated agriculture has been identified as using approximately 72% of water globally. Many regions of the world are subject to water sharing plans that cross government boarders which contain a mixture of management policies, leading to the requirement to monitor irrigation water use. The study reported here aims to develop and test an approach using Landsat observations to monitor irrigation water use over paddock scales without the need for in-situ observations, ground data or knowledge of planting dates. Using conservative assumptions about agricultural land management practice (i.e. negligible runoff, drainage and soil moisture change), the irrigation is calculated over 25 m x 25 m Landsat images. The approach uses a combination of three vegetation indices derived from Landsat images to calculate crop coefficients (K-c) based on multiple published relationships. These are combined through the FA056 methodology using gridded rainfall and two gridded reference evapotranspiration (ETo) products to estimate actual evapotranspiration, providing six ETo - K-c combinations which are then compared to actual/recorded irrigation volumes from test sites. The method was tested over an almond farm, two vineyards and a cotton field; in addition to Goulbum-Murray Water's (GMW) individual farm scale sites with unknown crops, all located within Australia. The developed approach provided estimated irrigation volumes that closely matched measured data for almond and cotton farms, while vineyards returned less accurate results due to localised management techniques that do not agree with land management assumptions made. The results from GMW showed some indication of the irrigation water use, although more details of the site being assessed needs to be available (i.e. crop type and extent). This study demonstrates the ability of certain remote sensing K-s relationships for sensing irrigation water use and shows the potential applications of the developed approach in monitoring irrigation over paddock scale environments.

TI  - Investigating the interaction between agricultural lands and Urmia Lake ecosystem using remote sensing techniques and hydro-climatic data analysis
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urmia Lake (UL) located in the northwest of Iran, is one of the largest hypersaline lakes in the world. In recent years, most of the lake has been rendered to unusable lands. Drought and rapid increase in agricultural activities are the most important reasons behind the shrinkage of the lake. In this study, hydro-climatic data, Landsat satellite images and image processing techniques were used to detect the spatio-temporal land cover changes and salinization progress in Urmia Lake Basin (ULB) between 1975 and 2019. Increasing the area of irrigated lands from 1265 km(2) in 1975 to 5525 km(2) in 2011 in contrast to decreasing the water surface area of UL from 5982 km(2) in 1995 to 586 km(2) in 2014 and extension of salinization in the basin are the most important and thoughtful results of this study. Even the agricultural lands in the regions close to the lake have been affected by this environmental problem. The climatic conditions have gradually improved after 2014 and the government has released more water from dams to the lake. On the other hand, the area of irrigated lands has gradually decreased by 12% in the same period. As a result of these positive changes, the water surface area of the lake has gradually increased over 1000 km(2). Based on the results of this study, both anthropogenic and climatic factors have played a positive role in UL restoration. Improvement of agricultural methods and providing a sustainable agricultural water management system under a changing climate can play the most effective role in the lake rehabilitation.

TI  - Implications of land use/land cover dynamics and <i>Prosopis</i> invasion on ecosystem service values in Afar Region, Ethiopia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics and the resulting changes in ecosystems, as well as the services they provide, are a consequence of human activities and environmental drivers, such as invasive alien plant species. This study assessed the changes in LULC and ecosystem service values (ESVs) in the Afar National Regional State, Ethiopia, which experiences a rapid invasion by the alien tree Prosopis juliflora (Swartz DC). Landsat satellite data of 1986, 2000 and 2017 were used in Random Forest algorithm to assess LULC changes in the last 31 years, to calculate net changes for different LULC types and the associated changes in ESVs. Kappa accuracies of 88% and higher were obtained for the three LULC classifications. Post-classification change analyses for the period between 1986 and 2017 revealed a positive net change for Prosopis invaded areas, cropland, salt flats, settlements and waterbodies. The rate of Prosopis invasion was estimated at 31,127 ha per year. Negative net changes were found for grassland, bareland, bush-shrub-woodland, and natural forests. According to the local community representatives, the four most important drivers of LULC dynamics were climate change, frequent droughts, invasive species and weak traditional law. Based on two different ESVs estimations, the ecosystem changes caused by LULC changes resulted in an average loss of ESVs in the study area of about US$ 602 million (range US$ 112 to 1091 million) over the last 31 years. With an increase in area by 965,000 ha, Prosopis-invaded land was the highest net change during the study period, followed by grassland (-599,000 ha), bareland (-329,000 ha) and bush-shrub-woodland (-327,000 ha). Our study provides evidence that LULC changes in the Afar Region have led to a significant loss in ESVs, with serious consequences for the livelihoods of the rural people. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Two-stage model for estimating the spatiotemporal distribution of hourly PM1.0 concentrations over central and east China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread and severe PM1.0 (particulate matter <= 1.0 mu m) pollution in China has a significant negative influence on human health. However, knowledge of the regional spatiotemporal distribution of PM1.0 has been hindered by sparsely distributed PM1.0 concentration data. In this work, a two-stage model (linear mixed effect-bagged tree model) was proposed for estimating hourly PM1.0 pollution levels from July 2015 to June 2017 over central and east China by using Himawari-8 aerosol products and coincident geographic data, meteorology, and site-based PM1.0 concentrations from ground monitoring network. The cross-validation for the developed model displayed R-2 and mean absolute error value of 0.80 and 9.3 mu g/m(3), respectively. Validation demonstrated that themodel accurately estimated hourly PM1.0 concentrations with high R-2 of 0.63-0.85 and low bias of 8.7-10.1 mu g/m(3). The estimated PM1.0 concentrations on daily scale showed peaks with PM1.0 of 36.9 +/- 8.4 mu g/m(3) at rush hours during daytime. Seasonal distribution displayed that summer was cleanest with an average PM1.0 of 20.9 +/- 6.8 mu g/m(3) and winter was the most polluted season with an average PM1.0 of 45.6 +/- 16.8 mu g/m(3). These results indicated that the proposed satellite-based model can estimate reliable spatial distribution of PM1.0 concentrations over a large-scale region. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Separability analysis of wetlands in Canada using multi-source SAR data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately classifying and monitoring wetlands using new technologies is important because of many services that wetlands provide to the environment. In this regard, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems provide valuable data to separate different wetland classes. Using large amount of field samples collected over three years, 78 SAR features extracted from multi-source satellites were investigated to select the most important features and decomposition methods for discriminating five wetland classes: Bog, Fen, Marsh, Swamp, and Shallow Water. The results indicated that the ratio features obtained from the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix (extracted from full polarimetric data RADARSAT-2 imagery) and the intensity layers of the dual polarimetric data (i.e., the data acquired by Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2) were most useful for distinguishing wetland class pairs as well as all wetland classes. In this regard, the ratio of HH and HV channels had the highest potential especially for discriminating herbaceous (Bog, Fen, Marsh) and woody (e.g., Swamp) wetlands. Moreover, the features derived from eigenvalues of the coherency matrix (e.g., Anisotropy, serd, normalized serd, and normalized derd) were among the most optimum features for wetland classification. Regarding the decomposition techniques, the H/A/Alpha and Freeman-Durden methods were selected as the best to discriminate wetlands. In terms of scattering mechanisms, it was observed that the volume component was generally the most useful element to discriminate wetland classes compared to the two other components (i.e., single- and double-bounce). This study comprehensively discusses the efficiency of various SAR features/decomposition methods for wetland studies and the results are expected to help with creating sustainable policies and management for wetland protection and monitoring using remote sensing methods.

TI  - Pectoral nerve II block, transversus thoracic muscle plane block, and dexmedetomidine for breast surgery in a patient with achondroplasia: a case report
T2  - JA CLINICAL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Patients with achondroplasia have various airway deformations and spinal anatomic abnormalities; therefore, performing general anesthesia and neuraxial anesthesia in such patients can be challenging.Case presentation: A 56-year-old, 112-cm, 30-kg woman was scheduled to undergo partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy for cancer of the right breast. She had short limbs, scoliosis, thorax deformation, and chronic moderate to severe mitral regurgitation of the mitral valve. We performed pectoral nerve II block and transversus thoracic muscle plane block and administered intravenous dexmedetomidine. The surgery was completed without the administration of any additional analgesics or sedatives.Conclusions: We successfully performed breast surgery using pectoral nerve II block, transversus thoracic muscle plane block, and sedation with dexmedetomidine in a patient with achondroplasia. We found that the combination of peripheral nerve blocks is a useful option in patients who have difficulties with both general anesthesia and neuraxial anesthesia.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInfluenza is known to have a specific pattern of seasonality the reasons for which are yet to be fully ascertained. Temperate zones show influenza epidemic during the winter months. The tropical and subtropical regions show more diverse influenza outbreak patterns. This study explores the seasonality of influenza activity and predicts influenza peak based on historical surveillance time series data in Islamabad and Multan, Pakistan.MethodsThis is a descriptive study of routinely collected monthly influenza sentinel surveillance data and meteorological data from 2012-16 in two sentinel sites of Pakistan: Islamabad (North) and Multan (Central).ResultsMean number of cases of influenza and levels of precipitation were higher in Islamabad compared to Multan. Mean temperature and humidity levels were similar in both the cities. The number of influenza cases rose with decrease in precipitation and temperature in Islamabad during 2012-16, although the same cannot be said about humidity. The relationship between meteorological parameters and influenza incidence was not pronounced in case of Multan. The forecasted values in both the cities showed a significant peak during the month of January.ConclusionThe influenza surveillance system gave a better understanding of the disease trend and could accurately forecast influenza activity in Pakistan.

TI  - A geometry-dependent surface Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity product for UV-Vis retrievals - Part 1: Evaluation over land surfaces using measurements from OMI at 466 nm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The anisotropy of the Earth's surface reflection has implications for satellite-based retrieval algorithms that utilize climatological surface reflectivity databases that do not depend upon the observation geometry. This is the case for most of the current ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) cloud, aerosol, and trace-gas algorithms. The illumination-observation dependence of surface reflection is described by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). To account for the BRDF effect, we use the concept of geometry-dependent surface Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity (GLER), which is derived from the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance computed with Rayleigh scattering and surface BRDF for the exact geometry of a satellite-based pixel. We present details on the implementation of land and water surface BRDF models, and we evaluate our GLER product over land surfaces using observed Sun-normalized radiances at 466 nm. The input surface BRDF parameters for computing TOA radiance are derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations. The observed TOA radiance for comparison is from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The comparison shows good agreement between observed and calculated OMI reflectivity in 2006 in typical geographical regions, with correlation coefficients greater than 0.8 for some regions. Seasonal variations of clear-sky OMI reflectivity (i.e., with minimum clouds and aerosols) closely follow those computed using MODIS-derived GLER over land. GLER also captures the cross-track dependence of OMI-derived LER, though the latter is slightly higher than the former presumably owing to residual cloud and aerosol (nonabsorbing) contamination, particularly over dark surfaces (heavily vegetated regions such as mixed forest, croplands, and grasslands). Calibration differences between OMI and MODIS may also be responsible for some of this bias. The standard OMI climatological surface reflectivity database predicts higher radiances than GLER and OMI observations with different seasonal variation over most regions and does not have any angular-dependent variation. Overall, our evaluation demonstrates that the GLER product adequately accounts for surface BRDF effects while at the same time simplifying the surface BRDF implementation within the existing OMI retrieval infrastructure; use of our GLER product requires changes only to the input surface reflectivity database.

TI  - Comparing ultra-high spatial resolution remote-sensing methods in mapping peatland vegetation
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions How to map floristic variation in a patterned fen in an ecologically meaningfully way? Can plant communities be delineated with species data generalized into plant functional types? What are the benefits and drawbacks of the two selected remote-sensing approaches in mapping vegetation patterns, namely: (a) regression models of floristically defined fuzzy plant community clusters and (b) classification of predefined habitat types that combine vegetation and land cover information? Location Treeless 0.4 km(2) mesotrophic string-flark fen in Kaamanen, northern Finland. Methods We delineated plant community clusters with fuzzy c-means clustering based on two different inventories of plant species and functional type distribution. We used multiple optical remote-sensing data sets, digital elevation models and vegetation height models derived from drone, aerial and satellite platforms from ultra-high to very high spatial resolution (0.05-3 m) in an object-based approach. We mapped spatial patterns for fuzzy and crisp plant community clusters using boosted regression trees, and fuzzy and crisp habitat types using supervised random forest classification. Results Clusters delineated with species-specific data or plant functional type data produced comparable results. However, species-specific data for graminoids and mosses improved the accuracy of clustering in the case of flarks and string margins. Mapping accuracy was higher for habitat types (overall accuracy 0.72) than for fuzzy plant community clusters (R-2 values between 0.27 and 0.67). Conclusions For ecologically meaningful mapping of a patterned fen vegetation, plant functional types provide enough information. However, if the aim is to capture floristic variation in vegetation as realistically as possible, species-specific data should be used. Maps of plant community clusters and habitat types complement each other. While fuzzy plant communities appear to be floristically most accurate, crisp habitat types are easiest to interpret and apply to different landscape and biogeochemical cycle analyses and modeling.

TI  - GPU-accelerated Double-Stage Delay-Multiply-and-Sum Algorithm for Fast Photoacoustic Tomography Using LED Excitation and Linear Arrays
T2  - ULTRASONIC IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Double-stage delay-multiply-and-sum (DS-DMAS) is an algorithm proposed for photoacoustic image reconstruction. The DS-DMAS algorithm offers a higher contrast than conventional delay-and-sum and delay-multiply and-sum but at the expense of higher computational complexity. Here, we utilized a compute unified device architecture (CUDA) graphics processing unit (GPU) parallel computation approach to address the high complexity of the DS-DMAS for photoacoustic image reconstruction generated from a commercial light-emitting diode (LED)-based photoacoustic scanner. In comparison with a single-threaded central processing unit (CPU), the GPU approach increased speeds by nearly 140-fold for 1024 x 1024 pixel image; there was no decrease in accuracy. The proposed implementation makes it possible to reconstruct photoacoustic images with frame rates of 250, 125, and 83.3 when the images are 64 x 64, 128 x 128, and 256 x 256, respectively. Thus, DS-DMAS can be efficiently used in clinical devices when coupled with CUDA GPU parallel computation.

T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The original Glacier Area Mapping for Discharge from the Asian Mountains (GAMDAM) glacier inventory was the first methodologically consistent dataset for high-mountain Asia. Nonetheless, the GAMDAM inventory underestimated glacier area, as it did not include steep ice- and snow-covered slopes or shaded components. During revision of the inventory, Landsat imagery free of shadow, cloud, and seasonal snow cover was selected for the period 1990-2010, after which > 90% of the glacier area was delineated. The updated GAMDAM inventory, comprised of 453 Landsat images, includes 134 770 glaciers with a total area of 100693 +/- 11790 km(2).

TI  - Different response of surface temperature and air temperature to deforestation in climate models
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - When quantifying temperature changes induced by deforestation (e.g., cooling in high latitudes, warming in low latitudes), satellite data, in situ observations, and climate models differ concerning the height at which the temperature is typically measured/simulated. In this study the effects of deforestation on surface temperature, near-surface air temperature, and lower atmospheric temperature are compared by analyzing the biogeophysical temperature effects of large-scale deforestation in the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) separately for local effects (which are only apparent at the location of deforestation) and nonlocal effects (which are also apparent elsewhere). While the nonlocal effects (cooling in most regions) influence the temperature of the surface and lowest atmospheric layer equally, the local effects (warming in the tropics but a cooling in the higher latitudes) mainly affect the temperature of the surface. In agreement with observation-based studies, the local effects on surface and near-surface air temperature respond differently in the MPI-ESM, both concerning the magnitude of local temperature changes and the latitude at which the local deforestation effects turn from a cooling to a warming (at 45-55 degrees N for surface temperature and around 35 degrees N for near-surface air temperature). Subsequently, our single-model results are compared to model data from multiple climate models from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This inter-model comparison shows that in the northern midlatitudes, both concerning the summer warming and winter cooling, near-surface air temperature is affected by the local effects only about half as strongly as surface temperature. This study shows that the choice of temperature variable has a considerable effect on the observed and simulated temperature change. Studies about the biogeophysical effects of deforestation must carefully choose which temperature to consider.

TI  - A new method for extracting ship motion parameters in Radarsat-2 SAR imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally, moving ship detection by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image is primarily based on the ship wake feature. However, many ship wakes cannot be imaged by SAR owing to changes in imaging conditions, such as the SAR band, polarisation, incident angle, and sea state. In this study, we discovered a unique phenomenon called 'azimuth tail' from Radarsat-2 SAR images. Following research and analysis, we determined that the azimuth tail is not manifested as a visible disturbance on sea surface waves. Instead, it is an observation enabled by certain SAR imaging principles. Consequently, we propose a new method for extracting information on moving vessels after a preliminary analysis of the principle of the azimuth tail. The results of experimental analysis of the correctness of the method indicate that the error of the vessel's velocity from its azimuth tail is less than 20%, and the azimuth tail can be applied to the detection of moving vessels in oceans using Radarsat-2 SAR imagery.

TI  - Twitter mining using semi-supervised classification for relevance filtering in syndromic surveillance
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the use of Twitter data to deliver signals for syndromic surveillance in order to assess its ability to augment existing syndromic surveillance efforts and give a better understanding of symptomatic people who do not seek healthcare advice directly. We focus on a specific syndrome-asthma/difficulty breathing. We outline data collection using the Twitter streaming API as well as analysis and pre-processing of the collected data. Even with keyword-based data collection, many of the tweets collected are not be relevant because they represent chatter, or talk of awareness instead of an individual suffering a particular condition. In light of this, we set out to identify relevant tweets to collect a strong and reliable signal. For this, we investigate text classification techniques, and in particular we focus on semi-supervised classification techniques since they enable us to use more of the Twitter data collected while only doing very minimal labelling. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach to symptomatic tweet classification and relevance filtering. We also propose alternative techniques to popular deep learning approaches. Additionally, we highlight the use of emojis and other special features capturing the tweet's tone to improve the classification performance. Our results show that negative emojis and those that denote laughter provide the best classification performance in conjunction with a simple word-level n-gram approach. We obtain good performance in classifying symptomatic tweets with both supervised and semi-supervised algorithms and found that the proposed semi-supervised algorithms preserve more of the relevant tweets and may be advantageous in the context of a weak signal. Finally, we found some correlation (r = 0.414, p = 0.0004) between the Twitter signal generated with the semi-supervised system and data from consultations for related health conditions.

TI  - Modeling the dynamic habitats of mobile pelagic predators (<i>Makaira</i> <i>nigricans</i> and <i>Istiompax indica)</i> in the eastern Pacific Ocean
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Overexploitation and climate change can reduce the abundance and shift the spatial distribution of marine species. Determining the habitat suitability of a mobile pelagic species, such as blue marlin (BUM) Makaira nigricans and black marlin (BAM) Istiompax indica, can help describe their spatiotemporal distribution patterns over a broad spatial scale, which is crucial for fisheries management. We applied a species distribution model (MaxEnt) to model the dynamic suitable habitat of BUM and BAM using 14 yr (1997-2010) of Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission occurrence data (n = 20 348) from purse-seine vessels in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) and high-resolution remotely sensed oceanographic data. The spatial distribution of suitable habitat for both species varied seasonally and in response to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), with BUM positively correlated with chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations and sea surface temperature and BAM with chl a concentrations and sea surface height. The influence of these environmental variables shifted seasonally suitable habitat between coastal (winter and spring) and oceanic (summer and fall) waters. During La Nina events, suitable habitat was along the equator, while during El Nino, suitable habitat shifted to farther northern and southern waters of the EPO. Analyses on species' centers of suitable habitat (CSH) revealed that the strength of ENSO did not influence CSH; however, large displacements were observed during these events. The models applied in our study provide critical information on the spatiotemporal patterns of 2 mobile pelagic predators, which can potentially be used to forecast future distributions and develop effective management strategies in response to climate change.

TI  - Inter-comparing and improving land surface temperature estimates from passive microwaves over the Jiangsu province of the People's Republic of China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent years, the FengYun-3B passive microwave observations (FY3B) have been used to study global and regional soil moisture estimates, and land surface temperature (LST) has been an important input in the retrieval model. Previous studies proposed a linear model to derive LST from Ka-band brightness temperatures (H09 approach) which were routinely masked based on open water data. This study aimed to further understand microwave emission under such challenging open water conditions and developed the first data-driven approach to correct for such open water conditions. The H09 was first applied to the FY3B observations, and then inter-compared against MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer), MERRA (Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications) and ground observations over the Jiangsu province in the People's Republic of China. Several freshwater bodies are located within this region, and the Pacific Ocean bounds at the east, this makes it an excellent region for the study of open water impact on the passive microwave observations. As in previous studies, the quality of the FY3B LST based on the H09 approach dropped over the regions with high open water. While the MERRA and MODIS LST products maintained an average correlation of about 0.95, the FY3B LST product had an average correlation of 0.85 with drops to about 0.65 over the open water regions. Additional comparisons also revealed biases over the open water regions within the passive microwave product. An open water metric, which is based on the percentage of a pixel and its surrounding pixels covered by water was developed to quantify the impact of open water. Based on a pixel-wise linear relationship between the MERRA LST and FY3B Ka-band brightness temperature, spatially variable slopes and intercepts were obtained as a function of open water to produce a correction for open water in the H09 which leads to the HG18 approach. Validations with both the MODIS LST product and the ground observations showed that there was a significant reduction in both the absolute bias (MODIS: 2 K, in situ: 10 K) and the standard errors (MODIS: 0.8 K, in situ: 1 K) using the HG18 approach. This opens up a new window towards further improving and understanding LST retrievals from passive microwave products.

AB  - Surface suspended sediment concentration (SSC) retrieved from the satellite data was used to study the multidecadal (1984-2015) dynamics of the surface turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) in Hangzhou Bay (HZB), China. A correlation algorithm was calibrated to estimate the surface SSC using the remote sensing data. The averaged deviation of the retrieved SSC from the field data was 15.6%. The impacts of tidal amplitude and phase on remote sensing data were specifically considered and accurately removed. Five periods were organized to analyze the multidecadal variability of surface SSC: (a) 1984-1988, (b) 1990-1994, (c) 1997-2001, (d) 2002-2006, and (e) 2013-2015. Results showed that the areas of low turbidity zone (<200 mg L-1) increased from period a to e, indicated by the trend ratio (T-s) of 2.58%. The area of TMZ (>700 mg L-1) decreased significantly from 2205 km(2) in the period a to 647 km(2) in period e, with T-s = -4.57%. The distribution pattern of the SSC was more skewed in period e (S-k = 2.03) than that in the period a (S-k = 0.63). Tidal flat reclamation around HZB contributed to the multidecadal reduction of the surface SSC from 1984 to 2015, through changing the hydrodynamics and reducing sediment source. The decreased sediment load from the Changjiang River contributed to the decline in the surface SSC in HZB, by reducing the sediment source. Flooding of the Qiantang River during wet seasons played an important role in increasing the surface SSC at the bay head, as the deposited sediment during wet seasons reduced the water depth and increased the resuspension. This study helps the estuarine morphology and environment management worldwide.

TI  - Auto-registration of medium and high spatial resolution satellite images by integrating improved SIFT and spatial consistency constraints
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature-based methods have been developed in the past decades for the registration of optical satellite images. However, it is still a challenging problem to handle well the registration between medium and high spatial resolution images due to the large difference of the spatial structural features and local details for the same objects. In this study, an automated co-registration technique is proposed that integrates an improved SIFT (I-SIFT) and a novel matching strategy called spatial consistency constraints (SCC) to cope with the large difference in spatial resolutions between the image pair. Three constraints on angle, distance, and ratio are introduced to re the initial matching features obtained by I-SIFT. Three groups of experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experiments used high resolution multispectral and panoramic SPOT 5/6 images and Landsat 5/8 orthorectification images. Experimental results show that the registration error lies in about 1 pixel of high-resolution images and demonstrate that the proposed I-SIFT-SCC approach is suitable for fine registration of optical satellite images from medium spatial resolution to high spatial resolution with resolution ratio up to 6.

TI  - A new shadow detection index for 8-band very high-resolution satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The new generation of remote sensing satellite with very high-resolution images has provided a high level of details, which make them a reliable source of information. Presence of shadow can reduce the amount of information that can be extracted from these images. Shadow can be confused with dark objects such as water and dark vegetation. The main aim of this research is to develop a new index to detect shadow in the presence of dark objects using the capabilities of the new remote sensing satellite images. For this study, WorldView-2 (WV-2) remote sensing satellite images with eight spectral bands were used. A spectral reflectance analysis for the main ground features has been studied along the eight spectral bands to determine the most effective bands for shadow detection. These bands are employed with the Hue-Saturation-Intensity colour model for producing the new proposed Saturation Intensity Shadow Detection Index (SISDI). The proposed index is applied to four study areas and compared with two state-of-the-art indices of shadow detection. Results of this comparison demonstrate the more accuracy effectiveness and feasibility of that proposed index. The proposed index achieves the highest overall accuracy (average of 97.8%) and has the ability for detecting small shadow areas.

TI  - Mapping evapotranspiration variability over a complex oasis-desert ecosystem based on automated calibration of Landsat 7 ETM+ data in SEBAL
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fragmented ecosystems of the desiccated Aral Sea seek answers to the profound local hydrologically- and water-related problems. Particularly, in the Small Aral Sea Basin (SASB), these problems are associated with low precipitation, increased temperature, land use and evapotranspiration (ET) changes. Here, the utility of high-resolution satellite dataset is employed to model the growing season dynamic of near-surface fluxes controlled by the advective effects of desert and oasis ecosystems in the SASB. This study adapted and applied the sensible heat flux calibration mechanism of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) to 16 clear-sky Landsat 7 ETM+ dataset, following a guided automatic pixels search from surface temperature T-s and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index NDVI (). Results were comprehensively validated with flux components and actual ET (ETa) outputs of Eddy Covariance (EC) and Meteorological Station (KZL) observations located in the desert and oasis, respectively. Compared with the original SEBAL, a noteworthy enhancement of flux estimations was achieved as follows: - desert ecosystem ETa R-2 = 0.94; oasis ecosystem ETa R-2 = 0.98 (P < 0.05). The improvement uncovered the exact land use contributions to ETa variability, with average estimates ranging from 1.24 mm to 6.98 mm . Additionally, instantaneous ET to NDVI (ETins-NDVI) ratio indicated that desert and oasis consumptive water use vary significantly with time of the season. This study indicates the possibility of continuous daily ET monitoring with considerable implications for improving water resources decision support over complex data-scarce drylands.

TI  - Propeller flap donor site closure by means of another propeller flap: A case report and literature review
T2  - MICROSURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite some ongoing criticisms, propeller flaps are still gaining popularity among plastic surgeons. The need of skin grafting of the donor site is one of those limitations that sometime affect the beauty and the efficacy of this reconstructive technique. Similar to a classic bi-lobed skin flap in which the second lobe of the same flap is mobilized to cover the donor site defect of the first lobe, a second, discrete propeller flap can be harvested adjacent to the first, in order to close the first donor site defect, thus avoiding the need for a skin graft. We applied this concept of "sequential" propeller flaps to cover a 4.5 x 4 cm full thickness soft tissue defect at the level of the heel in a 54-year-old patient who underwent melanoma excision and sentinel node biopsy.The first and second propeller flaps of 10 x 4.5 cm respectively were rotated on a distal and on a more proximal perforator of the posterior tibial artery (PTA) respectively, obtaining a tension free closure along the entire wound. The post-operative course was uneventful and the patient returned to full normal activities after 4 weeks. Follow up at 6 months showed a stable reconstruction with no functional deficit. This option, that relies on two separate perforator propeller flaps performed in sequence to obtain complete wound closure, may be kept in mind when dealing with soft tissue defects eligible for propeller flap reconstruction, as long as sizeable perforators in a favorable position are available. Moreover, a brief literature review on propeller flap use in flap donor site closure is also provided.

TI  - Instrument observation strategy for a new generation of three-axis-stabilized geostationary meteorological satellites from China
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fengyun-4 (FY-4) satellite series is a new generation of geostationary meteorological satellites from China. The newly adopted three-axis-stabilized attitude-control platform can increase observation efficiency and flexibility while bringing great challenges for image navigation as well as integrated observation mode design. Considering the requirements of earth observation, navigation and calibration as well as observation flexibility, instrument observation strategies are proposed. These include the earth, the moon, stars, cold space, blackbody and diffuser observations on which the instruments' in-orbit daily observations must be based. The most complicated part is the star observation strategy, while navigation precision is dependent on in-orbit star observations. A flexible, effective, stable and automatic star observation strategy directly influences star data acquisition and navigation precision. According to the requirement of navigation, two specific star observation strategies for the two main instruments on board FY-4A were proposed to be used in the operational ground system. The strategies have been successfully used in FY-4A in-orbit tests for more than a year. Both the simulation results and in-orbit application results are given, including instrument observation strategies, star observation strategies and moon observation tasks, to demonstrate the validity of the proposed observation strategies, which lay important foundations for the instruments' daily operation.

TI  - Monitoring deforestation and forest degradation using multi-temporal fraction images derived from Landsat sensor data in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is the replacement of forest by other land use while degradation is a reduction of long-term canopy cover and/or forest stock. Forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon is mainly due to selective logging of intact/un-managed forests and to uncontrolled fires. The deforestation contribution to carbon emission is already known but determining the contribution of forest degradation remains a challenge. Discrimination of logging from fires, both of which produce different levels of forest damage, is important for the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) program. This work presents a semi-automated procedure for monitoring deforestation and forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon using fraction images derived from Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM). Part of a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene (path/row 226/068) covering part of Mato Grosso State in the Brazilian Amazon, was selected to develop the proposed method. First, the approach consisted of mapping deforested areas and mapping forest degraded by fires using image segmentation. Next, degraded areas due to selective logging activities were mapped using a pixel-based classifier. The results showed that the vegetation, soil, and shade fraction images allowed deforested areas to be mapped and monitored and to separate degraded forest areas caused by selective logging and by fires. The comparison of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and RapidEye results for the year 2013 showed an overall accuracy of 94%. We concluded that spatial resolution plays an important role for mapping selective logging features due to their characteristics. Therefore, when compared to Landsat data, the current availability of higher spatial and temporal resolution data, such as provided by Sentinel-2, is expected to improve the assessment of deforestation and forest degradation, especially caused by selective logging. This will facilitate the implementation of actions for forest protection.

TI  - Health Care Spending, Utilization, and Quality 8 Years into Global Payment
T2  - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Alternative Quality Contract (AQC) of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts is a population-based payment model that includes financial rewards and penalties that are based on spending relative to benchmarks and performance on quality measures. During the first 8 years of the program, growth in spending was lower for AQC enrollees than for privately insured enrollees in control states, without an adverse effect on measures of quality of care.Background Population-based global payment gives health care providers a spending target for the care of a defined group of patients. We examined changes in spending, utilization, and quality through 8 years of the Alternative Quality Contract (AQC) of Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) of Massachusetts, a population-based payment model that includes financial rewards and penalties (two-sided risk). Methods Using a difference-in-differences method to analyze data from 2006 through 2016, we compared spending among enrollees whose physician organizations entered the AQC starting in 2009 with spending among privately insured enrollees in control states. We examined quantities of sentinel services using an analogous approach. We then compared process and outcome quality measures with averages in New England and the United States. Results During the 8-year post-intervention period from 2009 to 2016, the increase in the average annual medical spending on claims for the enrollees in organizations that entered the AQC in 2009 was $461 lower per enrollee than spending in the control states (P<0.001), an 11.7% relative savings on claims. Savings on claims were driven in the early years by lower prices and in the later years by lower utilization of services, including use of laboratory testing, certain imaging tests, and emergency department visits. Most quality measures of processes and outcomes improved more in the AQC cohorts than they did in New England and the nation in unadjusted analyses. Savings were generally larger among subpopulations that were enrolled longer. Enrollees of organizations that entered the AQC in 2010, 2011, and 2012 had medical claims savings of 11.9%, 6.9%, and 2.3%, respectively, by 2016. The savings for the 2012 cohort were statistically less precise than those for the other cohorts. In the later years of the initial AQC cohorts and across the years of the later-entry cohorts, the savings on claims exceeded incentive payments, which included quality bonuses and providers' share of the savings below spending targets. Conclusions During the first 8 years after its introduction, the BCBS population-based payment model was associated with slower growth in medical spending on claims, resulting in savings that over time began to exceed incentive payments. Unadjusted measures of quality under this model were higher than or similar to average regional and national quality measures. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)

TI  - Energy-based cloud detection in multispectral images based on the SVM technique
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the energy characteristics of Gabor texture are used for cloud detection in high-resolution multispectral images. First, the satellite remote-sensing image is divided into superpixels using simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC), and then, the energy characteristics of Gabor texture and spectral characteristics are computed by extracting the texture features of the superpixels. The features of the cloud superpixels are used as the learning sample of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier, and a classification model is obtained by training the SVM classifier. Finally, a cloud-detection experiment is conducted for various sensor images with three visible bands and one near-infrared band. The experimental results showed that the proposed method provides an excellent average overall accuracy for thick and thin clouds in a complex background of forests, harbours, snow and mountains. The characteristic parameters of this paper are not limited by the image parameters; thus, they provide good results and universality for various types of sensors.

TI  - A dryland cover state mapping using catastrophe model in a spectral endmember space of OLI: a case study in Minqin, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Alternative state theory with catastrophe conceptual model is very attractive for dryland zero net land degradation (ZNLD) management, but practically challenging for mapping cover state and pathway with conventional approaches. This paper developed a methodological framework in the generic spectral endmember space (SVD, soils and substrates, vegetation, and dark surface endmembers ) of Landsat-8 OLI (operational land imager) imagery to concretize the catastrophe model of dryland cover state based on the co-development of plant and soil variables in a landscape. A cover function index (LCI) was proposed together with cover type growth form as cover variables in multi-seasonal SVD space. Furthermore, ecological site (ES) and topographic wetness index (TWI) were used as the landscape variables. The four variables as the explanatory variates, soil organic matter (SOM) as a slow response variable of dryland cover state, were explored by classification and regression trees (CART) for the state space. Using the Minqin dryland system in China as a case study, CART explored 65.9% amounts of SOM variance of 85 training samples with the four explanatory variables, and the measured SOM had liner relationship with CART predicted SOM at 0.05 significant level with the explained 39% SOM variance for 10 test samples. In the learned transparent tree, the two alternative stable states were identified correctly and validated by another soil intrinsic clay content variable independently, one was the current highest average SOM (26.757 g kg(-1)) of perennial forest/shrub covers, the other was the bared or sparse vegetation cover with low average SOM (<= 8.518 g kg(-1)) as a critical SOM limit in a given ecological site type. The mean clay content of the undesirable alternative states was all below 60 g kg(-1) with severe soil physical degradation, and had a clear breaking gap with other states. Moreover, the SOM-LCI plane projected the unstable states being folded in the basins of the attraction of two alternative stable states (i.e. 0.39-0.76 LCI) with relative resilience analysis of pathways. In the 10 test sites, only 1 site of the state was not predicted correctly. The results suggest the model has a level of predictability for dryland cover state and its pathway. According to the estimated states, there has 12.74% study area improved and continued to recovering the desirable states, and the study area has already net improvement at the landscape level. Therefore, without the comparable series of historical data for adaptive management, the developed framework in SVD of Landsat imagery is a cost-effective and time-saving tool, which helps managers to assess and develop appropriate management with a more spatially diversified strategy for zero net land degradation using a space-for-time substitution in an era of unprecedented change.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS land surface temperature products for daily air surface temperature estimation in northwest Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) is considered one of the most suitable ways to retrieve air surface temperature (T-a) - one of the most important and widely used climate variables for a wide range of applications. In fact, many successful studies have been reported in many regions of the world. Each day, four MODIS LST data are available; from two sensors (Terra and Aqua) at two local overpass times (daytime and night-time). However, due to their different overpass times, most studies have used LST daytime and night-time for daily maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) air surface temperature estimation, respectively. Therefore, the performance of each individual LST data, the effect of the dynamic combination of these four LST data, the effect of land surface characteristics, and the effect of LST quality on the same estimation in the same region on the accuracy of estimated T-a remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated and tested all individual LST data as well as all possible combinations of the four MODIS LST data from two separate stations with distinct land surface characteristics in northwest Vietnam for 10 years (from 2004 to 2013) under two sky conditions (all clear sky conditions and only good data - i.e. Quality Control (QC) value of 0) for daily T-a (T-max, T-min, and T-mean) estimations. In addition, the mixed data of the two stations were also evaluated. Our results showed that Terra LST data have a higher correlation with T-a than Aqua LST; which is consistent for both stations and both quality conditions (all clear sky and only good data). A closer overpass time with T-max or T-min occurrence time did not guarantee a higher accuracy of T-a estimation. Using only good LST data produced a higher accuracy of T-a estimation than using all clear sky data. However, if the percentage of good data is low (i.e. less than 30%), then the all clear sky data will provide better results for T-max estimation. Comparing the performance of the different combinations when using the single station and mixed station data, combinations including at least one night-time LST produced stable and high accuracy T-min and T-mean estimates, while the combinations with only daytime LST produced very low accuracy results. For T-max estimation, the results were less impacted by LST quality; however, they were strongly impacted by different combinations and land surface characteristics.

Results show that CESI-3 (peak WF about 890 hPa) accurately detect cirrus with the Probability of detection (POD) value reaching 0.69 during both at day and nighttimes. The CESI-1 (peak WF about 550 hPa) falsely detects cirrus in the Sahara Desert, south of the Saudi Arabia, north of Tibetan Plateau and in Australia during the ascending process. More false alarm rates (FARs) are detected in the northern mid-latitude around 60 degrees N because of the surface type and seasonal effects. Furthermore, the thresholds of middle and low peak WF CESIs for cirrus detection are determined and the performance is satisfactory. In addition, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is employed to train four combination types (combining CESI-1 and CESI-2, combining CESI-1 and CESI-3, combining CESI-2 and CESI-3, and combining CESI-1, CESI-2, and CESI-3). Accordingly, results elucidate that Comb-1-3 (combining CESI-1 and CESI-3) is appropriate to detect cirrus for the ascending process, increasing the POD by 11.2% as compared to CESI-3. However, Comb-1-2-3 (combining CESI-1, CESI-2 with peak WF around 790 hPa, and CESI-3) is most suitable for cirrus detection in the descending process, increasing the PODs by 8.5%. We also find that the POD of cirrus detection over the land increases relatively higher than over the sea. The most significant improvement of cirrus detection occurs over the land in the summer in the daytime with a 35% POD increase from 0.57 to 0.76.

TI  - Displacement monitoring of upper Atbara dam based on time series InSAR
T2  - SURVEY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Dam is an important part of engineering structure, in the process of dam construction, the dam monitoring is crucial since water erosion and time-dependent motion may cause deformation. Traditional monitoring methods are time-consuming and labour-intensive. However, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can provide precise and spatially dense information on slow deformations. This research investigated the longest earth-rock-fill dam in Sudan to determine the spatial and temporal deformations Sentinel-1A descending SAR images were further used to analyse the issues mentioned above. The results suggested that the dam existed the maximum displacement with a value up to 190 mm on the dam crest. Besides, the selected sections along the riverbed of the dam were analysed and the RMSE was approximately 2 mm/year. The results were in good agreement with the in situ measurements, indicating the advancement of time series InSAR in dam deformation monitoring.

TI  - Recent trends of ice phenology for eight large lakes using MODIS products in Northeast China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing images with high temporal resolution can be used to monitor lake ice phenology, a periodic freezing and thawing cycle of ice resulting from seasonal and inter-annual climate variations. In the research reported here, we used MODIS satellite data to establish the time series of lake ice extent and extracted lake ice phenology dates and durations for eight large typical lakes in Northeast China for the hydrological years from 2003 to 2016. The MODIS-derived results were validated against ice records at hydrological stations. The mean absolute error for a freeze-up start (FUS), freeze-up end (FUE), break-up start (BUS) and break-up end (BUE) was 3.1, 4.8, 6.6 and 6.6 days, respectively. Our findings indicated that the investigated lakes were tending to freeze later and melt earlier and were frozen for a shortened period over time. FUS was experiencing a delay of 0.65 days per year and BUE was advancing by 0.19 days per year, implying a decrease of frozen duration (FD) of 0.84 days per year taking all eight lakes into consideration. The lake ice duration increased with latitude, and the lakes with a relatively smaller area had a higher yearly rate of change and were more variable compared with the larger ones. The relationship between lake ice phenology and other influencing factors was evaluated using correlation coefficients and partial least squares regression. The results showed that the freeze-up process was more dependent on the lake morphometry, while the break-up process was more dependent on climate changes, particularly on air temperature, which had the highest correlation coefficient (r = -0.69, p < 0.01).

TI  - Worldviews, Levels of Consciousness, and the Evolution of Planning Paradigms in Protected Areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) worldwide are facing increasing visitation and complexity. Mounting pressures from the private sector are intensifying the risks associated with overtourism. The increasing strategic importance of PAs for the communities and regions in which they are situated requires improved management effectiveness; yet, recent studies indicate significant and growing systemic risk. Worldview analysis can be a valuable tool for building consciousness and informing the evolution of PA planning and management. Directed content analysis was used to examine two Visitor Use Plans developed for the Coyhaique National Reserve, located in the iconic Patagonia cultural area of southern Chile. The plans were developed using distinct planning frameworks, with different underlying assumptions. Research questions focused on how modernist, postmodernist and integral worldviews were expressed within the two plans. Worldviews were explored in both manifest and latent manners, considering plan text, models and overall context revealing patterns and links between the plans and planning frameworks that guided their development. Rich context and a thorough discussion of methods assists with the incorporation of worldview evaluation within PA management theory, informing the continuing development of knowledge and capacities that can better prepare PAs for future challenges.

TI  - Icelandic snow cover characteristics derived from a gap-filled MODIS daily snow cover product
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a spatio-temporal continuous data set for snow cover in Iceland based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2000 to 2018. Cloud cover and polar darkness are the main limiting factors for data availability of remotely sensed optical data at higher latitudes. In Iceland the average cloud cover is 75% with some spatial variations, and polar darkness reduces data availability from the MODIS sensor from late November until mid January. In this study MODIS snow cover data were validated over Iceland with comparison to manned in situ observations and Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel 2 data. Overall a good agreement was found between in situ observed snow cover, with an average agreement of 0.925. Agreement of Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel 2 was found to be acceptable, with R-2 values 0.96, 0.92 and 0.95, respectively, and in agreement with other studies. By applying daily data merging from Terra and Aqua and a temporal aggregation of 7 d, unclassified pixels were reduced from 75% to 14 %. The remaining unclassified pixels after daily merging and temporal aggregation were removed with classification learners trained with classified data, pixel location, aspect and elevation. Various snow cover characteristic metrics were derived for each pixel such as snow cover duration, first and last snow-free dates, deviation and dynamics of snow cover and trends during the study period. On average the first snow-free date in Iceland is 27 June, with a standard deviation of 19.9 d. For the study period a trend of increasing snow cover duration was observed for all months except October and November. However, statistical testing of the trends indicated that there was only a significant trend in June.

TI  - Mastectomy Without Drains Reduces Cost with No Detriment to Patient Outcome
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionUse of drains after mastectomy remains highly variable. This study aimed to establish whether simple mastectomy managed without a drain would cost less than the same procedure managed with a drain and whether there would be any difference in complications.MethodsProspective data were collected on all patients undergoing simple mastectomy +/- sentinel lymph node biopsy over sixteen months. Surgeons decided intra-operatively whether to place a drain. Data included operative details, mastectomy weight, length of stay and postoperative complications. Costing data were identified by combining hospital finance costs for admission and follow-up appointments along with the cost of consumables.ResultsOne hundred and thirty mastectomies were performed on 119 patients. There was a significant difference in mastectomy weight between drain group patients (n=80, median: 730g) and no drain group patients (n=50, median: 424g) (p=<0.001). The mean cost for drain group patients was 639.77 pound whilst for the no drain group was 365.46 pound, indicating a potential unit saving of 21944.93 pound over sixteen months. Length of stay was shorter in the no drain group (range: 1-2 days) than the drain group (range: 1-4 days). The presence or absence of drains did not influence complication rates, with no change in seroma interventions (p=0.803).ConclusionsManaging simple mastectomy patients without a drain resulted in no increase in complications or subsequent interventions for seroma. Significant cost savings to both the hospital and to the patient can be achieved by omitting drain use. Routine use of drains in patients undergoing simple mastectomy +/- SNB may be unnecessary and costly.

TI  - An Urban Biodiversity Assessment Framework That Combines an Urban Habitat Classification Scheme and Citizen Science Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - A lack of information about urban habitats, and a lack of professionally-collected species occurrence data are often cited as major impediments to completing bioassessments in urban landscapes. We developed an urban biodiversity assessment framework that addresses these challenges. The proposed framework combines a customized hierarchical urban habitat classification scheme with citizen science-generated species occurrence data, such as iNaturalist and eBird. It integrates publicly available data on the physical and anthropogenic environment with species occurrence information and serves as a novel method for conducting urban biodiversity assessments. This framework provides insights into how species occurrences within an urban landscape are associated with spatial variation in the physical and anthropogenic environment. It can also yield information useful for planning and conservation management aimed at maintaining and enhancing the abundance and diversity of native and other desirable species in urban areas. This framework requires minimal taxonomic expertise on the part of those who employ it, and it can be implemented in urban areas worldwide, wherever adequate data exist. We demonstrate the application of this framework in the highly urbanized portion of Los Angeles County, California, USA. Our demonstration used 18 physical and anthropogenic variables to classify our study area into nine urban habitat types. We then assessed relationships between these urban habitat types with species occurrences using research-grade data from iNaturalist. This analysis detected significant differences in distributions of some species between these nine urban habitat types and demonstrated that the proposed framework can be used to conduct urban biodiversity assessments. With increasing availability of remote sensing data and publicly-generated biodiversity data, this framework may be used for analysis of urban areas around the globe.

TI  - A new dense 18-year time series of surface water fraction estimates from MODIS for the Mediterranean region
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed knowledge on surface water distribution and its changes is of high importance for water management and biodiversity conservation. Landsat-based assessments of surface water, such as the Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset developed by the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC), may not capture important changes in surface water during months with considerable cloud cover. This results in large temporal gaps in the Landsat record that prevent the accurate assessment of surface water dynamics. Here we show that the frequent global acquisitions by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensors can compensate for this shortcoming, and in addition allow for the examination of surface water changes at fine temporal resolution. To account for water bodies smaller than a MODIS cell, we developed a global rule-based regression model for estimating the surface water fraction from a 500m nadir reflectance product from MODIS (MCD43A4). The model was trained and evaluated with the GSW monthly water history dataset. A high estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 11.41 %, and MAE = 6.39 %) was achieved. We then applied the algorithm to 18 years of MODIS data (2000-2017) to generate a time series of surface water fraction maps at an 8 d interval for the Mediterranean. From these maps we derived metrics including the mean annual maximum, the standard deviation, and the seasonality of surface water. The dynamic surface water extent estimates from MODIS were compared with the results from GSW and water level data measured in situ or by satellite altimetry, yielding similar temporal patterns. Our dataset complements surface water products at a fine spatial resolution by adding more temporal detail, which permits the effective monitoring and assessment of the seasonal, inter-annual, and long-term variability of water resources, inclusive of small water bodies.

T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Presence of Leishmania spp. was evaluated in the blood of nine red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus) from a specific area of French Guiana, located in the northeast of the Amazon. The molecular detection was performed based on PCR targeting the markers 18S rRNA, kDNA and ITS2 genes, as well as rapid immunomigration tests. Two monkeys were positive for Leishmania infantum and one for Leishmania guyanensis. While L. guyanensis cutaneous leishmaniasis is common, visceral leishmaniasis (human and canine) caused by L. infantum has never been described in this area. The howler monkey proved to be a sentinel and a potential reservoir of a serious zoonosis. These results must be carefully considered by public health officials and veterinarians in the future.

TI  - Spatio-temporal quality distribution of MODIS vegetation collections 5 and 6: implications for forest-non-forest separability
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been employed for continuous monitoring of land surface dynamics to facilitate the examination of spatial aspects of the environment. Periodical generation of MODIS products enables temporal analysis, and the interpretation of temporal patterns requires information about image quality. The MODIS Scientific Data Set (SDS) provides information on image properties. Some research has utilized the SDS to assist in analysis and interpretation, particularly in supporting time series forecasting and estimating 'invalid' data from near-dates observation. Our research compares the usability and reliability information provided in the MODIS SDS for collections 5 and 6 to describe the spatio-temporal distribution of image quality. This research compared the ability of the MODIS collections to identify the extent of water and to differentiate forest from non-forest. Four sites representing tropical and temperate regions were selected in Brazil, Congo, Colorado (United States of America), and the European Alps. The robustness of usability and reliability information for assessing MODIS vegetation collections 5 and 6 was compared over these sites by using 16-day composite products over a year of observations (2015). The spatio-temporal distribution of invalid pixels and gaps derived from usability and reliability information were assessed by using TiSeG (Time series Generator) and GeoDa. Moran's I indicated a large number of invalid pixels and temporal gaps were clustered in a few areas. Collection 6 appears more consistent in the identification of waterbodies, either for inland water or ocean, but the error detection of ice fractions in two tropical sites tends to increase. Masking data by using Quality Assurance (QA)-SDS information improved the separability between forest and non-forest. This research demonstrated that evaluating the quality of image products using the SDS assisted the selection of period and location to better differentiate forest and non-forest. The seasonal fluctuation of separability metrics showed the importance of exploring temporal pattern for better understanding of the dynamics of forest cover.

TI  - A molecular tool to identify <i>Anastatus</i> parasitoids of the brown marmorated stink bug
T2  - ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, Anastatus species (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae) are associated with the invasive agricultural pest Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). In Europe, the polyphagous Anastatus bifasciatus (Geoffroy) is the most prevalent native egg parasitoid on H. halys eggs and is currently being tested as a candidate for augmentative biological control. Anastatus bifasciatus frequently displays behavior without oviposition, and induces additional host mortality through oviposition damage and host feeding that is not measured with offspring emergence. This exacerbates accurate assessment of parasitism and host impact, which is crucial for efficacy evaluation as well as for pre- and post-release risk assessment. To address this, a general Anastatus primer set amplifying a 318-bp fragment within the barcoding region of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene was developed. When challenged with DNA of three Anastatus species -A. bifasciatus, Anastatus japonicus Ashmead, and Anastatus sp.-, five scelionid parasitoid species that might be encountered in the same host environments and 11 pentatomid host species, only Anastatus DNA was successfully amplified. When applied to eggs of the target host, H. halys, and an exemplary non-target host, Dendrolimus pini L. (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae), subjected to host feeding, no Anastatus amplicons were produced. Eggs of the two host species containing A. bifasciatus parasitoid stages, from 1-h-old eggs to pupae, and emerged eggs yielded Anastatus fragments. Confirmation of parasitoid presence with dissections and subsequent PCRs with the developed primer pair resulted in 95% success for 1-h-old parasitoid eggs. For both host species, field-exposed sentinel emerged eggs stored dry for 6 months, 100% of the specimens produced Anastatus amplicons. This DNA-based screening method can be used in combination with conventional methods to better interpret host-parasitoid and parasitoid-parasitoid interactions. It will help address ecological questions related to an environmentally friendly approach for the control of H. halys in invaded areas.

TI  - Object-based feature selection using class-pair separability for high-resolution image classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing popularity of object-based image analysis (OBIA) since 2006, numerous classification and mapping tasks were reported to benefit from this evolving paradigm. In these studies, segments are firstly created, followed by classification based on segment-level information. However, the feature space formed by segment-level feature variables can be very large and complex, posing challenges to obtaining satisfactory classification performance. Accordingly, this work attempts to develop a new feature selection approach for segment-level features. Based on the principle of class-pair separability, the segment-level features are grouped according to their types. For each group, the contribution of each segment-level feature to the separation of a pair of classes is quantified. With the information of all feature groups and class pairs, the separability ranking and appearance frequency are considered to compute importance score for each feature. Higher importance score means larger appropriateness to select a feature. By using two Gaofen-2 multi-spectral images, the proposed method is validated. The experimental results show the advantages of the proposed technique over some state-of-the-art feature selection approaches: (1) it can better reduce the number of segment-level features and effectively avoid redundant information; (2) the feature subset obtained by the proposed scheme has good potential to improve classification accuracy.

The health consequences of low bone density can be dire, from poor surgical outcomes to increased mortality rates following a fracture. Results: Vertebral fractures are the most common fragility fractures with significant consequences related to patient morbidity and mortality. Additionally, a vertebral fracture is the best predictor of a subsequent fracture. These fractures constitute sentinel events in osteoporosis that require further evaluation and treatment of the patient's underlying bone disease. In addition to fractures, osteopenia and osteoporosis have deleterious effects on elective spine surgery from screw pullout to fusion rates. Adequate evaluation and treatment of a patient's underlying bone disease in these situations have been shown to improve patient outcomes. Conclusion: With an increased understanding of the prevalence of low bone mass and its consequences as well an understanding of how to identify these patients and appropriately intervene, spine surgeons can effectively decrease the rates of adverse health outcomes related to low bone mass.

TI  - Dynamic contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted MRI of invasive breast cancer for the prediction of sentinel lymph node status
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Although sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the current standard for identifying lymph metastasis in breast cancer patients, there are complications of SLNB. Purpose To evaluate preoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of invasive breast cancer for predicting sentinel lymph node metastasis. Study Type Retrospective. Population In all, 309 patients who underwent clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer surgery Field Strength/Sequence 3.0T, DCE-MRI, DWI. Assessment We collected clinicopathologic variables (age, histologic and nuclear grade, extensive intraductal carcinoma component, lymphovascular invasion, and immunohistochemical profiles) and preoperative MRI features (tumor size, background parenchymal enhancement, internal enhancement, adjacent vessel sign, whole-breast vascularity, initial enhancement pattern, kinetic curve types, quantitative kinetic parameters, tumoral apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], peritumoral maximal ADC, and peritumoral-tumoral ADC ratio). Statistical Tests Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to determine independent variables associated with SLN metastasis, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was analyzed for those variables. Results 41 (13.3%) of the patients showed SLN metastasis. With MRI, tumor size (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.17), heterogeneous (OR, 5.33; 95% CI, 1.71-16.58), and rim (OR, 15.54; 95% CI, 2.12-113.72) enhancement and peritumoral-tumoral ADC ratio (OR, 72.79; 95% CI, 7.15-740.82) were independently associated with SLN metastasis. Clinicopathologic variables independently associated with SLN metastasis included age (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99) and CD31 (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.04-8.92). The area under the curve (AUC) of MRI features (0.80; 95% CI, 0.73-0.87) was significantly higher than for clinicopathologic variables (0.68; 95% CI, 0.60-0.77; P = 0.048) and was barely below statistical significance for combined MRI features with clinicopathologic variables (0.84; 95% CI 0.78-0.90, P = 0.057). Data Conclusion Preoperative internal enhancement on DCE-MRI and peritumoral-tumoral ADC ratio on DWI might be useful for predicting SLN metastasis in patients with invasive breast cancer.

TI  - Toward a Combined Surface Temperature Data Set for the Arctic From the Along-Track Scanning Radiometers
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface temperature data sets for, or including, the Arctic have been derived from various thermal infrared sensors. However, a combined, all surface temperature data set for the Arctic has not been generated previously. Here we present the first combined land, ocean, and ice surface temperature data set for the Arctic produced from Along-Track Scanning Radiometer - 2 and the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer satellite sensors: the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer Arctic combined Surface Temperature data set. Separate products, produced independently for each sensor and containing quantified uncertainties, together cover the period August 1995 to April 2012. Product validation, utilizing a more extensive in situ database than previous studies, shows that Along-Track Scanning Radiometer Arctic combined Surface Temperature surface temperatures generally agree with in situ data and are similar to previous validation of input surface temperature retrievals. Biases range from -1.74 to 0.23 K over open ocean, sea ice, snow over land, and the Greenland ice sheet with higher variability over snow/ice. However, there are noticeable outliers in the validation results, particularly over Arctic land in boreal summer for Along-Track Scanning Radiometer - 2, which are likely due to cloud contamination resulting from a climatologically static snow field being used for that sensor. This study suggests that the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer Arctic combined Surface Temperature data set presented here is a useful tool for assessment of models in the Arctic. Further work would have clear benefits including improvements to snow cover and cloud clearing to achieve a fully consistently processed, climate quality combined surface temperature data set for the Arctic region.

TI  - Geographic Co-Occurrence of Mesothelioma and Ovarian Cancer Incidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Asbestos is an established cause of several cancers, including mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. Incidence of mesothelioma, the sentinel asbestos-associated cancer, varies by state, likely reflecting different levels of asbestos exposure. We hypothesized that states with high mesothelioma incidence may also have high ovarian cancer incidence. Materials and Methods: Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Program for Cancer Registries and the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, we examined the geographic co-occurrence of mesothelioma and ovarian cancer incidence rates by U.S. state for 2003-2015. Results: By state, mesothelioma incidence ranged from 0.5 to 1.3 cases per 100,000 persons and ovarian cancer incidence ranged from 9 to 12 cases per 100,000 females. When states were grouped by quartile of mesothelioma incidence, the average ovarian cancer incidence rate was 10% higher in states with the highest mesothelioma incidence than in states with the lowest mesothelioma incidence. Ovarian cancer incidence tended to be higher in states with high mesothelioma incidence (Pearson correlation r = 0.54; p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Data from state cancer registries show ovarian cancer incidence was positively correlated with mesothelioma incidence, suggesting asbestos may be a common exposure. The potential for asbestos exposure has declined since the 1970s because fewer products contain asbestos; however, some products, materials, and buildings may still release asbestos and thousands of workers may be exposed. Ensuring that people are protected from exposure to asbestos in their workplaces, homes, schools, and communities may reduce the risk of several cancers.

TI  - External validation of a prognostic model to predict survival of patients with sentinel node-negative melanoma
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Identifying patients with sentinel node-negative melanoma at high risk of recurrence or death is important. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) recently developed a prognostic model including Breslow thickness, ulceration and site of the primary tumour. The aims of the present study were to validate this prognostic model externally and to assess whether it could be improved by adding other prognostic factors. Methods Patients with sentinel node-negative cutaneous melanoma were included in this retrospective single-institution study. The beta values of the EORTC prognostic model were used to predict recurrence-free survival and melanoma-specific survival. The predictive performance was assessed by discrimination (c-index) and calibration. Seeking to improve the performance of the model, additional variables were added to a Cox proportional hazards model. Results Some 4235 patients with sentinel node-negative cutaneous melanoma were included. The median follow-up time was 50 (i.q.r. 18 center dot 5-81 center dot 5) months. Recurrences and deaths from melanoma numbered 793 (18 center dot 7 per cent) and 456 (10 center dot 8 per cent) respectively. Validation of the EORTC model showed good calibration for both outcomes, and a c-index of 0 center dot 69. The c-index was only marginally improved to 0 center dot 71 when other significant prognostic factors (sex, age, tumour type, mitotic rate) were added. Conclusion This study validated the EORTC prognostic model for recurrence-free and melanoma-specific survival of patients with negative sentinel nodes. The addition of other prognostic factors only improved the model marginally. The validated EORTC model could be used for personalizing follow-up and selecting high-risk patients for trials of adjuvant systemic therapy.

TI  - Evaluation of sum-NDVI values to estimate wheat grain yields using multi-temporal Landsat OLI data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based models have been developed to derive wheat grain yields with multispectral images. In this regard, field measurements and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data were used for two growing seasons to determine the relationships between NDVI and yields. The number of six statistic parameters were calculated from NDVI values to find the best agreement with actual yield data. A comparison of the results showed that sum-NDVI better matched field measurements. To compare the results of NDVI with other vegetation indices, we applied four other vegetation indices. Results indicated that estimation of wheat yields using sum-NDVI values was more accurate than estimation by sum of the four applied vegetation indices values. Also, the investigation of multi-temporal images showed that the critical time to estimate wheat yield using sum-NDVI values was the time that wheat grains were in the milky and maturity stages.
